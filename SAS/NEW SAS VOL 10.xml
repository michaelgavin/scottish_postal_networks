Topography and Natural History. 
Latitude and Longitude.— The latitude of the Academy of 
Perth is 56° 9SI 40" N., and its longitude S° 26' 20" W. As 
a subject intimately connected with geographical position, it may 
ilso be mentioned, that the magnetic variation was 26° 54' W 
in November 1836. In 1815, when the magnetic north seemed 
;o have attained its furthest range to the westward of the true north 
:he variation was 28° 10' W.; hence the annual diminution seems 
it present to be about 3 ; but as the changes of all variable mag- 
ntudes, when near the maximum state, are smaller than the mean 
•ate of change, the decrement will probably become more rapid 
ill toward the close of the present century. 

Name.— The etymology of the name is uncertain. Lord Hailes 
n his Annals, says, that he had been favoured with different inter 
-retations of the word, and that not knowing which to choose he 
ad omitted them all. Fordun, in his Scotichronicon, tells' us 
hat he had found in some ancient writings that the town was for' 
lerly called Bertha. The names of many places in the neih-. 
ourhood are of Celtic origin. The vernacular language of the 
eople not many miles from Perth, is Celtic, at the present day. 
ihar-tatha is a Celtic word, and signifies the height of Tay.f Thus

Kinnoul Hill, which is immediately contiguous to the town, may 
be the height referred to. B. and P. were and still are used by 
the Celts indiscriminately, and Bert, Berth, and Perth, are evi- 
dently contractions for Bertha. 

The parish of Perth contains altogether about 3410 imperial 
acres, and exhibits a considerable diversity of soil and aspect. Up- 
wards of two-thirds of it consist of rich arable land ; and of the 
remaining third about 750 acres are planted, and 350 acres are 
in a state of hilly pasture, the rocky nature of which seems to bid 
defiance to the farther encroachment of the plough. 

Boundaries, Topographical Appearances.— T\\e shape of the parish 
is somewhat incurvated, the extreme length, following the varying 
direction of the curvature, being about five miles, and the greatest 
breadth about a mile and a quarter. As the Tay washes the concave 
side of the arch by which the parish is bounded on the north and east, 
the general slope of the ground is toward the same quarter of the 
horizon. On the east and south-east, it is bounded by the Tay 
and the parish of Rhynd ; on the south by the parish of Rhynd and 
Aberdalgie; on the west by the parish of Aberdalgie, Tibbermore 
and Forteviot; and on the north and north-east by the parish of 
Redgorton. 

The mountain ranges which occur in the parish form the west- 
ern extremity of the Sidlaw hills, and are of limited altitude, the 
highest point Moncrieff hill rising only to the height of 756 feet 
above the mean level of the ocean. The surface of the parish is 
nevertheless diversified with numerous swelling ridges of moderate 
elevation, which graduate by insensible degrees into rich and fer- 
tile plains in a state of the highest culture, and bearing abundant 
crops of every species of grain. Though the hills skirting the 
parish are of the limited height already noticed, the view from 
their summit is at once extensive and varied, presenting on all sides 
prospects of unrivalled fertility and beauty, in which every object 
that can adorn the landscape is finely and harmoniously blended. 
The view from Moncrieff hill, in particular, is acknowleged to be 
one of the finest in Scotland. 

The soil of the parish consists, in the upland district, of a rich 
loam, which has resulted from the decomposition of the trap tuff, 

Kincarathie, Gaelic Cean-car-tatha, the head or turn of Tay ; Abdie, Abbey-tatha 
the abbey of Tay. N. B._ There is no Celtic word for abbey. The word spelled 
tatha in Gaelic sounds as ta in English.

and other mouldering rocks, which at one period crowned the more 
elevated ridges. The low grounds along the bank of the Tay 
are composed chiefly of aluminous earth or clay, resting on beds of 
gravel and other alluvial, or rather lacustrine deposits, and are well 
adapted for bearing every species of grain. Their height above 
the mean level of the sea, varies from 20 to 30 feet, and as the 
plain on which the town is erected is still lower, it is occasionally 
exposed, during a flooded state of the Tay, to the inconvenience 
of partial inundation. 

Cultivation has been carried in the parish almost to the sum- 
mit of the hills, insomuch that crops of every description are rais- 
ed within 200 feet of the most elevated point. 

The following heights have been carefully ascertained by the ba- 
rometer.

No caverns or fissures that can claim particular notice are to be 
found in the parish, excepting perhaps on the south side of Moncrieff 
hill, the precipitous face of which exhibits some basaltic rocks of a 
columnar structure, occasionally standing out in detached masses 
of the most fantastic forms, and separated from the main body of the 
trap rocks, with which they are connected by intervening fissures 
of considerable width. 

Geology. — The greater part of the parish rests upon the red 
sandstone formation, which stretches through the valleys of Strath- 
more and Strathearn. The character of this rock, wherever it pre- 
sents itself in the neighbourhood, whether in artificial excavations, 
or deep ravines formed by the action of water, exhibits little varia- 
tion, either in composition or external appearance. In some few 
instances, the mica predominates, and being feebly united with the 
siliceous particles by means of an argillaceous cement, the stone, 
when exposed to the weather, crumbles down, and is thus unfit for 
the purpose of building. Occasionally, nodules of granite, primitive 
limestone, porphyritic trap, Lydian stone, and hard masses of in- 
durated clay are imbedded in the sandstone ; but no organic remains, 
either of an animal or vegetable nature, have at any time been dis- 
covered in it within the parish. 

Dip and direction of the Stratification. — The dip of the strati- 
fied rocks, which is towards the north-west, has been carefully ex- 



PERTHSHIRE. 



amined in a great variety of situations, and generally ranges from 
1 0° to 20°. The lowest stratum of the extensive formation of sand- 
stone which traverses the parish occurs at the Friartown turnpike, 
about a mile and a half from the city, where the dip is 15° towards 
the N. W. by W. At the waterfall of Craigie, which is about half a 
mile to the north-west of this point, and though about 80 feet lower 
in situation, occupies a more elevated place in the stratification, 
the sandstone is covered by the trap which seems to have flowed over 
it, from the great mass of that rock to the south-west of it, when the 
latter was in a state of fusion. The inclination of the subjacent 
sandstone has accordingly undergone no change, the dip being 12° 
45' towards the N. W.|W.; but the layers, in immediate contact 
with the trap, are assimilated to it in appearance, and possess great 
hardness, with a semi-crystalline structure. Tracing a line from 
the Friartown to the parish church of Moneydie, which is almost 
exactly in the direction of the plane of the dip, the distance is about 
6 miles ; and as the dip of the stratification at the latter point, is 
12° 30' towards the N. W., it may be inferred that the stratum of 
sandstone at Moneydie occupies a position, which had originally 
been upwards of a mile above that which is presented to view at the 
Friartown. Both strata where they crop out being at present 
nearly on the same level, it would seem that the portion of the sand- 
stone rocks above the Friartown, corresponding with the strata at 
Moneydie, has suffered great disintegration ; and indeed, however 
extravagant the opinion may seem, it is far from being inconsistent 
with appearances to suppose, that the debris of these rocks gave 
birth to the shifting hills of loose sand, which occur at the mouth 
of the Tay ; as well as to the extensive accumulation of arenaceous 
tumuli lying between that river and the mouth of the Eden, form- 
ing what is called the Tents -moor. 

The trap rocks which run along the southern boundary of the 
parish may be regarded as a continuation of the Sidlaw range of 
hills, and possess a direction which coincides with that of the 
planes of the adjacent sandstone strata; and it seems highly pro- 
bable, that the latter received their present dip and position from 
the same internal movement which gave existence to the former. 
From the main body of the trap, whin dikes may be traced, issu- 
ing at various points, and retaining for many miles a westerly direc- 
tion. These dikes, which are generally about 60 feet wide, seem 
to have resulted from immense fissures in the sandstone, formed 

 In the immediate vicinity of the trap rocks, the dip extends sometimes to 35°.

at the period when the strata were shifted from their horizontal po- 
sition ; their cavities being at the same time filled up by the melt- 
ed matter, which flowed into them from the principal mass of 
the fused trap. In accordance with this hypothesis of the origin 
of whin dikes, it is uniformly observed that the stratum of 
sandstone, in contact with the trap, exhibits a more compact and 
crystalline aspect ; the siliceous particles being more intimately 
blended with the mica, and other substances of which the sand- 
stone is composed, and converted into a homogeneous rock of great 
hardness ; while the dip of the stratification, at the distance of a 
few yards from the vein, is considerably altered, so as to exhibit, 
within the compass of several feet, a great variety of inclination. 

The hill of MoncrierTis almost entirely composed of compact trap, 
or greenstone, which on the south side exhibits a columnar structure. 
Near its western extremity, patches of conglomerate make their 
appearance, but it is difficult to trace either their thickness or ex- 
tent. On the western side of the great Edinburgh road, detach- 
ed rounded hills, also of the trap family, and occasionally present- 
ing an abrupt face of moderate elevation, towards the south-west, 
stretch onward to the western boundaries of the parish. These 
rocky eminences sometimes graduate into conglomerate, the nodu- 
les of which are always more firmly united at the line of junction; 
and frequently they betray the most unequivocal symptoms of hav- 
ing been exposed to igneous action. At other times, the basalt 
passes.by degrees into the rocks of a porphyritic structure, which 
are usually associated with trap ; felspar and augite being the 
more common ingredients in their composifion. In some cases 
veins of calc-spar, varying from a small fraction of an inch to se- 
veral inches in width, traverse the more compact rocks ; and oc- 
casionally these calcareous veins include detached angular portions 
of the principal rock through which they are disseminated. 

Conglomerate.— An immense bed of conglomerate, composed 
chiefly of rounded nodules of porphyritic trap, varying in size from 
a pea to a man's head, runs along the southern part of the parish 
above the farm of St Magdalenes. At various places, thin lamina/ 
consisting of fine-grained materials, of a siliceous nature, may be 
observed between the larger boulders of which this rugged rock 
is composed ; and in such cases, it is worthy of remark, that both 
the degree and direction of the dip coincide exactly with those 
which belong to the sandstone of the district. Thus on the 
north side of St Magdelene's Hill the dip was found to be 14° 30' 



6 



PERTHSHIRE. 



towards N. W. £W., while on the south side of the same hill, 
at the distance of nearly two miles, the dip was 13° towards N. 
W. At Invermay, six miles onward in the direction of the plane 
of the strata, the same bod of conglomerate makes its appearance, 
but disjoined by the vale of Strathearn, with similar layers of 
sandstone interposed, having the same dip and- direction. It may 
also be traced along the southern face of the Sidlaw range, as far 
as the western shoulder of Kinnoul hill ; its continuity being in- 
terrupted at this point by the bed of the Tay. It is a curious cir- 
cumstance, however, that the planes of the lowest strata of the con- 
glomerate, on both sides of the river, are so nearly coincident, as 
to imply from that circumstance, and other appearances, that they 
had formerly been united ; large detached masses of conglomerate 
occurring in the bed of the Tay, in the very position they might 
have been expected to occupy, in consequence of the disruption 
of the river. Previously to this event, the whole of the parish of 
Perth, with the flat and extensive district towards Crieff and Dun- 
keld, on which water-worn materials are everywhere to be found, 
must have been covered by the waters of a lake, of no ordinary 
magnitude. 

In support of this opinion it may be stated, that trees of large 
dimensions, chiefly of the oak and willow kind, and other vegeta- 
ble productions, are frequently found in the alluvial soil on which 
the town of Perth is built, at a depth varying from 25 to 40 feet 
below the present surface ; and, what is still more confirmatory of it, 
oaks upwards of two feet in diameter may be still seen protruding 
from the immense bed of clay which forms the southern bank of the 
Tay, at the Friartown, in positions not less than 20 feet above the 
highest level of the river, in spring tides. In the mass of clay con- 
taining these organic remains, beds of fine sand, and other indica- 
tions of aqueous arrangement are distinctly observable : so that at 
a period, in the annals of geology, comparatively recent, no doubt 
can be entertained of a barrier having existed across the present 
channel of the river sufficient to raise its waters far above their pre- 
sent level. In fact, an obstruction of 200 feet in height, in the bed 
of the Tay, between the hills of Kinnoul and Moncrieff, would 
cause the waters of the river to find their way to the ocean by the 
valley of Strathmore; nor are indications wanting that such a 
state of things once existed, in the chain of lakes, and the gravelly 
and sandy subsoil, which characterize the district of country 
stretching between the town of Forfar and Lunan bay. 

No ores of any description have been discovered to exist in the

parish ; but agates of great beauty are found in the adjacent pa- 
rish of Kinnoul ; as well as the sulphate of barytes, the carbonate 
of strontites, calc-spar, &amp;c. 

Alluvial Deposits. — The alluvial deposits which cover the stra- 
tified rocks in the less elevated parts of the parish consist of gra- 
vel formed of rounded portions of granite, quartz, gneiss, and other 
primitive rocks, intermixed with sand and clay, both of which are 
frequently in a stratified state. 

Boulders. — Irregular blocks ofgranite and gneiss, measuring from 
3 to 4 feet in every direction, are occasionally to be found on the 
borders of fields in the less perfectly cultivated spots of the parish ; 
but in consequence of the improved state of agriculture which now 
prevails in this district, these obstructions to the plough have long 
ceased to be observed in the lower grounds. These boulders, be- 
longing to rocks of the primitive class, must have been rolled from 
a very great distance to reach their present locality. 

The alluvial materials, composing the subsoil of the lower part 
of the parish, are largely impregnated with the muriate of lime ; 
and accordingly, the water obtained from wells and pits, sunk in 
the town and neighbourhood, are, in all cases, found to hold in so- 
lution a considerable quantity of the same salt, together with more 
limited portions of the muriate of soda and magnesia. 

Rivers and Streams. — The parish is intersected by no running 
stream deserving of notice, with the exception of the lade for con- 
veying water to the town-mill to be afterwards described, but it is 
bounded on the north by the Almond, and on the east by the Tay, 
which is not only the largest river in Scotland, but if the magnitude of 
streams be estimated by the quantity of water they convey to the sea, 
the largest in Britain. The surface from which the various tributaries 
of this noble river derive their supplies, possesses an area of 2750 
square miles, whereas the basin of the Spey contains only 1298f 
square miles, and that of the Forth 541 square miles. It must be 
admitted, indeed, that the volume of water, discharged bv a river 
into the ocean, is not always proportional to the extent of the sur- 
face which it drains ; since the varying latitude of the district 
through which it flows, and still more the inequalities of its sur- 
face, especially when that surface assumes a mountainous character, 
modify, in a considerable degree, the quantity of rain that flows into 
the basin of a river. But in the case of the Tay, as contrasted 
with the Spey and the Forth, the criterion mentioned may be safe- 
ly applied ; the geographic position and condition of surface being 



8 



PERTHSHIRE. 



pretty much alike, with respect to the basins of the three rivers. It 
seems probable, therefore, that the Tay discharges about twice as 
much water as the Spey, and four times as much as the Forth. 

Quantity of Water discharged by the Tay. — Opposite to the 
town of Perth, the quantity of water, flowing through a section of 
the stream, measured with great accuracy for a judicial purpose, 
was determined by Dr Anderson to be at the rate of 3640 cubic 
feet per second, at a time when the river was in its mean state. As 
the area of the basin supplying the various tributaries of the Tay 
excluding the basin of the Earn is equal to 2398 square miles, 
if we assume the annual fall of rain for the hilly districts to be 30 
inches, and suppose that one-third of it is lost by evaporation, and 
the various processes of vegetation, the mean discharge would be 
at the rate of 3496 cubic feet per second, which is probably not 
far from the truth, and differs but little from the above result. In 
the course of the summer of 1819, the discharge, after a long 
drought, was reduced to 457 cubic feet per second ; and at the close 
of the summer of 1835, it was still less. From the gradual exten- 
sion of the system of draining now generally prosecuted in the 
agricultural districts, a very sensible change has taken place, of late 
years, in the magnitude of the stream, during great floods, as well 
as long-continued droughts ; and though, owing to the same cause, 
the Tay now conveys more water to the sea, than it did at a for- 
mer period, it is an undoubted fact that the size of the stream, in 
its ordinary state, is considerably reduced. 

Tides. — The tide from the ocean flows up the river to a point 
about a mile above the town, in spring tides ; and rises, at the har- 
bour, about ten feet above the alveus, or the bed of the stream. At 
high water, according to the survey of Mr Jardine, the surface of 
the river attains the same level with the German Ocean ; but it 
appears by the observations of that accurate and distinguished en- 
gineer, that the level of the high water at Perth is actually 18 
inches higher than it ever attains in the frith of the Tay, three 
or four miles above Dundee. This singular result is to be ascrib- 
ed, partly, to the frith of the Tay being so large, that the tide at 
the mouth of the river begins to subside before it has had suffi- 
cient time to fill that capacious basin, through the contracted inlet, 
by which it is admitted at Broughty Ferry ; and partly, to the sub- 
sequent elevation of the water above its natural level, in conse- 
quence of the gradual contraction of the channel of the river, from 
the town of Newburgh to the city of Perth.

The form of the Tay being so extremely unfavourable to the 
production of river tides for navigable purposes, it was some years 
ago suggested by Dr Anderson to the magistrates of Perth, the 
conservators of the navigation of the river, that they ought to adopt 
all the means in their power, in co-operation with landed proprie- 
tors along its banks, to contract as much as possible the breadth of 
the stream below the town, by encouraging the construction of 
embankments in suitable situations, and the junction of islands with 
either bank, wherever the river flowed in two channels, — compen- 
sating, at the same time, for the diminished area of the section of 
the stream by a corresponding excavation of its bed. Several is- 
lands have accordingly been joined of late to the nearest bank, 
and the result justifies the expectation that the prosecution of si- 
milar operations, on a more enlarged scale, will ultimately prove 
highly beneficial to the navigation of the river ; while it will be 
the means of recovering, at a trifling expense, extensive tracts of 
rich and valuable land. In fact, were a barrier of loose materials 
to be thrown across the Tay, from the lands of Pitfour to the west 
end of Mugdrum island ; and were a similar erection to be execut- 
ed from the eastern extremity of that island to Invergowrie bay, land 
would be gained, along the north bank of the river, to the extent 
of upwards of 4000 acres ; and the river, by the operation, would 
be rendered navigable as far as the harbour of Perth, for vessels 
of 300 tons burden. The embankment would require for its 
completion, 960,000 cubic yards of earth, which would cost about 
L. 20,000 ; and the facing of stone next the river, which would be 
about 150,000 square yards, would amount to an equal sum; so 
that the land would be obtained for about L. 10 per acre, — while 
the rise of the tides at Perth would be increased by the operation, 
probably from three to four feet in perpendicular height. 

Meteorology. — In describing the meteorological phenomena of 
the parish, we shall first give a synoptic, or tabular view of the 
varying physical conditions of the atmosphere, by which the cli- 
mate of a country is chiefly affected ; and conclude with such ge- 
neral observations on the subject, as the facts stated may seem to 
suggest. The circumstances which mainly contribute to the pe- 
culiar character of a climate, we shall describe under the usual 

 The junction of two islands with the western bank of the river, one a little 
above, and the other a little below the Castle of Elcho, has already had the effect of 
raising the tides from six to nine inches, and accelerating the time of high water, at 
Perth, by half an hour.

The mean pressure, derived from the means of the months, is 
29.802 by the observations at nine a. m. ; and 29.808 by the ob- 
servations at half-past eight p. m. The extreme range of the 
means, on either side of the mean for the entire period of obser- 
vation, or the differences, in excess and defect, between the latter 
mean, and the greatest and least means of each month, during the 
six years of observation, are, in reference to the morning observa- 
tions, as follows :

It appears by these observations that the means, in defect, great-

ly exceed those in excess, in reference to the average mean for the 
whole period. Hence it may be concluded, that the causes which 
give rise to a diminished pressure are more sudden, as well as more 
powerful in their operation, than those which tend to produce an 
opposite condition of the atmosphere ; a result which implies that 
the causes contributing to a low state of the barometer are of local 
extent, and partial operation ; and may be satisfactorily explained 
by referring them, partly, to a diminution of aerial elasticity, occa- 
sioned by the rapid condensation of aqueous vapour ; and partly, to 
the combustion of large portions of carburetted hydrogen, in the 
upper regions of the atmosphere, over the place of observation. 
Hence it may be concluded, that an arithmetical mean between 
two observations of the barometer, the one expressing theHiighest, 
and the other the lowest height of the mercury, will rarely give 
the true average height for the interval of time between the ob- 
servations. This fact, which seems to have hitherto escaped the 
notice of meteorologists, is of considerable importance. 

The annual range, or the difference between the highest and 
lowest state of the barometer, in the course of each year, from the 
beginning of 1814, to the close of 1822, being a period of nine 
years, was as subjoined :

Means, 30J55 28.569 2.189 

The mean annual range thus deduced from observations for a 
period. of nine consecutive years is 2.189 inches: the extreme 
range for the same period, being the difference between the high- 
est state of the barometer, which took place on the 9th of July 
1820, and the lowest state of it, which occurred on the 5th of 
March 1818, is 2.821 inches. The greatest change observed to 
take place within a limited period occurred in the year 1820 ; 
when, ten days after the very unusual altitude which the mercurial 
column reached on the 9th of January, it sunk to 28.830, being 
a change of 2.244 inches, in that short interval of time. We 
have already stated, that the mean height of the barometer at 
Perth, deduced from the observations for a period of six years, viz. 



12 



PERTHSHIRE. 



from 1829 to 1834, inclusive, was 29.802 inches ; but we may 
now remark, that if the mean height of the instrument be deriv- 
ed from the observations from 1814 to 1822, inclusive, it would 
somewhat exceed the former result, bein 29.857 inches. It may 
be added, that the difference between this mean, and the mean 
of the highest altitude, viz. 30.755, is only .898 inches; whereas 
the difference between it and the mean of the lowest altitudes, viz. 
28.569, is 1.298 inches. Hence it appears that the aberrations 
of the barometrical pressures from either side of the mean, are 
greater in defect than in excess, in the case of the annual, as well 
as in the case of the monthly results ; a state of things, the cause 
of which we have already endeavoured to explain. 

2. The Temperature. — The mean temperature of the parish, 
as deduced from the annual mean, by Six's thermometer, accord- 
ing to observations continued from the beginning of 1829 to the 
end of 1834, is 48°. 14. The mean obtained by the annual means, 
from observations taken at nine o'clock in the morning, and half- 
past eight o'clock in the evening, is 47°.9. The mean of the an- 
nual extremes, derived from the greatest heat and greatest cold, 
for each year, is 48°.25 ; and the mean of the highest and lowest 
temperature for the entire period of years is 47°.5. Lastly, the 
temperature of the water, drawn from a well of considerable depth, 
was 48°.9, at the beginning of September. 

The mean temperature of each month, derived from a period 
of six years, and consequently from upwards of 180 observations, 
is as follows, the means being those of the morning observations.

It appears that in different years, the month of July possesses 
the greatest uniformity of temperature, and the month of January 
the least. The temperature of March, April, and May, especially 
that of the last of these months, has a considerable range in dif- 
ferent seasons, owing to the variable winds which prevail in our 



PEKT1I. 



13 



spring- ; and the temperature of August and September seems to 
be still more fluctuating ; a circumstance that occasions the late 
and early harvests, which happen in different years. The lowest 
temperature, as indicated by Six's thermometer, within the period 
to which these observations refer, was on the 26th of December 
1830, when the instrument stood at 16°; and the greatest heat, 
as ascertained with the same instrument, was 79°, that temperature 
having occurred on the 28th of July of the same year ; the great- 
est annual range being thus 63°. The mean annual range, however, 
is only 57.°5. 

The most abrupt change of temperature occurs between Octo- 
ber and November, and to this we must, probably, ascribe the in- 
crease of pulmonary complaints, which take place at that gloomy 
and disagreeable season. 

The causes which conspire to produce a diminution of tempera- 
ture, like those which tend to occasion a low state of the barome- 
ter, seem to operate to a wider extent than the causes which give 
rise to an elevation of temperature ; and accordingly we find, that, 
for a given period of observation, the thermometer is generally de- 
pressed further below the mean temperature, than it is elevated 
above it. Thus if the mean temperature of Perth be estimated 
at 47°.95, which is the mean of the different results already given, 
the greatest heat by Six's thermometer, for a period of twenty 
years, was in no instance observed to exceed 79°, or 31°.05 above 
the mean ; whereas the greatest cold within the same period was 
found to be — 10°, or 57°.95 below the mean. This very reduced 
temperature took place on the night between the 17th and the 
18th of January 1820, when the thermometer, in a northern ex- 
posure, sunk to — 10°. During the whole of the following day, the 
instrument remained under zero, except for a short interval at noon, 
when it rose to 1°. The effects produced by this great reduction 
of temperature were such as are usually observed to accompany 
the most intense cold, in high latitudes. The evaporation from 
the surface of the ice, which then covered the Tay, being conden- 
sed in the air almost immediately after its formation, produced over 
the river a partial fog, which being gently wafted to the neighbour- 
ing trees, attached itself by degrees to the naked branches, and 
gave birth to innumerable and diversified exfoliations of the most 
singular beauty. And so great was the intensity of the cold 
within doors, that the windows of apartments, where a constant 
fire was kept up, were covered with a thick coating of ice, which 



14 



PERTHSHIRE. 



obscured the light of day; while liquors of various kinds were 
completely frozen, in situations where it might have been supposed 
they were beyond the reach of frost. Had the cold been of long- 
er duration, or less interrupted by occasional remissions of severity, 
its physiological effects would have been more fatal to animal and 
vegetable life than it actually proved. During the short time it 
continued, several instances occurred in the vicinity of Perth, of per- 
sons perishing by its intensity ; domestic animals were found frozen 
to death, in attitudes which proved the sudden cessation of their 
vital functions ; and in some instances, the trunks of the largest 
trees were reft from top to bottom, by the congelation of their juices, 
as if they had been shivered by lightning. Among the peculiari- 
ties of this remarkable cold, it is deserving of notice, that on the 
morning of the 22d, when the thaw commenced, the thermometer 

rose from 1° to 51° in the course of three hours, being a transition 

nearly as great, as if we had passed in that short interval from the 
ordinary cold of winter to the extreme heat of summer. A change 
of temperature, not quite so abrupt, but more injurious in its conse- 
quences, and scarcely less remarkable in degree, considering the 
season of the year in which it occurred, was experienced at the end 
of October, of the present year, 1 836. On the evening of the 
28th of the month, a fall of snow commenced, which covered the 
ground to the depth of several inches. The wind blowing violent- 
ly from the north, a keen frost set in, and continued with increasing 
severity during the whole of the 29th and 30th, till on the night 
of the last of these days, the thermometer sunk to 12°, being 
below the average of the greatest winter cold for a period of 
several years. The potatoes, owing to the coldness and lateness 
of the season, being still in the ground, were in many places great- 
ly injured ; and in the high districts, many fields of oats were com- 
pletely covered with snow. 

3. The Humidity of the Atmosphere.— In a large proportion 
of meteorological observations, the pressure and temperature of 
the atmosphere are given with greater precision than its hygrome- 
tric condition. This is to be ascribed, partly to the want of a suit- 
able instrument for determining the quantity of moisture contain- 
ed, at different times, in the atmosphere ; but still more to the ab- 
struse and intricate nature of the subject itself, which requires for 
its due elucidation, not only the greatest accuracy of observation, 
but the subsequent application of tedious and difficult calculations, 
for the purpose of deducing the requisite results. These results 



PERTH. 



15 



may be arranged under the heads of, 1st, the Absolute Humidity 
of the air ; 2d, its Relative Humidity ; and Sdly, the Temperature 
to which the air must be reduced, before the moisture which it 
contains begins to assume the liquid form, or the state of visible 
vapour. As the subject of atmospheric humidity is still, notwith- 
standing its great importance, very imperfectly understood, we shall, 
before giving the results of our observations, endeavour to lay be- 
fore the general reader a brief explanation of the several points, 
to be determined by hygrometrical observations. 

For that purpose, we may begin with stating that the quantity 
of moisture which can exist in a given volume of air, or in any 
other substance having an affinity for moisture, is regulated, and 
limited almost entirely by temperature. Thus when air is per- 
fectly damp, or saturated with moisture, 7320 cubic inches of it 
are capable of holding in the vaporous state, the subjoined quanti- 
ties of moisture, at the temperatures to which they are annexed : 
At 32° it can contain 1 grain ; at 53° 2 do. ; at 66° 4 do. ; at 75° 
8 do.; 83° 16 do. ; at 89° 32 do. Hence it appears, that the 
quantity of moisture capable of being held in a vaporous state, by 
a given volume of air, increases in a faster ratio than the tempera- 
ture, — a state of things which enables us to explain a great num- 
ber of meteorological phenomena connected with the humidity of 
the atmosphere. Thus it affords a simple and satisfactory ex- 
planation of the reason why the intermixture of different strata of 
air, by means of mountains, electrical action, or any other phy- 
sical cause, is usually followed by a cloudy atmosphere, and not 
unfrequently by rain. It accounts for the increasing dampness of 
the evening air ; explains the cause of the copious rains which 
fall in tropical climates ; and the reason of the rapid progress that 
is produced in vegetation by a slight increase of temperature, in 
consequence of the still greater increase of atmospheric humidity. 

The absolute humidity of the air being the quantity of moisture 
which a given volume of it actually contains, it is quite unneces- 
sary to add anything to what has been briefly stated on this head, 
farther than simply to repeat, that it can never exceed a precise 
and determinate quantity, at a given temperature, however long 
the air might remain over water ; but the relative humidity is of 
a variable nature, and depends fully as much upon temperature 
as upon the presence of moisture. To render the meaning of the 
expressions perfectly clear, we shall assume a particular case, and 



10 



V E 11 T 1 1 S H I R E . 



suppose that 7320 cubic inches of air contain two grains of mois- 
ture in the vaporous state : If the temperature were exactly 53°, 
the air thus charged with humidity would be perfectly damp, or 
contain its maximum quantity of moisture at that temperature ; 
but if the temperature of the same air were to be raised to 66°, 
in which case it could hold in solution four grains of moisture, or 
double of what it actually contained, the relative humidity would 
be expressed by f or  ; complete dampness being denoted by 
unity. Moreover, if a hygrometer, whose indications were rigidly 
conformable to the humidity of the surrounding air, should be ex- 
posed to an atmosphere containing in solution the quantity of mois- 
ture we have supposed ; and if the scale of the instrument were 
so graduated that zero was placed at perfect dryness, and 100° at 
perfect dampness, the index would point exactly to 50°. More- 
over, if the temperature of the same air were afterwards raised to 
75°, the index of the hygrometer would descend to 25°, now im- 
plying that the moisture contained in the aerial medium was only 
one-fourth of the whole quantity it was capable of holding in the 
vaporous state, at that elevated temperature.  It thus appears 
that the relative humidity of air, containing the very same quanti- 
ty of moisture, might assume an unlimited variety of indications, 
as given by a hygrometer : Nay, however paradoxical it may seem, 
air may, in many cases, become absolutely drier, and yet be rela- 
tively damper. 

After the explanations which have been given of absolute and 
relative humidity, we need scarcely remark, that whatever be the 
quantity of moisture contained in a given volume of air, there will 
always be a temperature, more or less depressed below that of the 
atmosphere, which will be barely sufficient for maintaining that 
moisture in the state of vapour. The smallest depression of tem- 
perature below that point, which is termed the point of deposition, 
and by some the dew-point, will give rise to a separation of mois- 
ture from the air, in the form of visible vapour, producing fog, 
rain, or snow, according to the extent and rapidity of the change 
of temperature ; and according to the height in the atmosphere 
at which the change takes place. 

For ordinary purposes, the point of deposition may be deter- 
mined with sufficient accuracy in the following manner : Fill a 

• It may be proper to mention that there is no hygroscopic substance known, 
which possesses a dilatation by moisture that is exactly proportional to the rela- 
tive humidity of the air, to which it may be exposed.

cylindrical glass vessel, or a common tumbler, with cold water, and 
observe if the outside of it become dim with moisture ; if a deposi - 
tion tiike place very quickly, the water is too cold, and must be 
allowed to stand for a few minutes to receive an increase of tem- 
perature from the air, after which the experiment must be repeat- 
ed, either with another tumbler, or with the one already used ; 
provided its surface be previously wiped with a dry cloth. When 
the water is brought to a temperature barely sufficient to cause a 
deposition of moisture on the external surface of the tumbler, that 
temperature is the point of deposition, and may therefore be as- 
certained by suspending a thermometer in the water. On the 
other hand, if the temperature of the water is not low enough to 
occasion a precipitation of moisture on the surface of the tumbler, 
it must be reduced by artificial means, by ice for example, when 
it can be procured, or by any of the ordinary frigorific mixtures 
used for the purpose, till an incipient deposition of moisture is just 
perceived. When due precaution is employed, the point of de- 
position may be ascertained by the method we have described, 
which was first proposed by Dr Dalton, with greater accuracy' 
than by means of the costly and troublesome instrument called 
Daniell's hygrometer. Thus, suppose it had been found that a 
deposition of moisture ceased to take place, when the temperature 
of the water was 48°, but that it was perceptible when it was 47°, 
the latter might be regarded as the point of deposition, and since 
it lies between 32° and 53°, it would be found by an easy calcu- 
lation, even from the scanty table we have given, that at 47° air 
in a maximum state of vaporization, ought to contain about 1.7 
grains of moisture in 7320. cubic inches. Let it be farther sup- 
posed that Ihe temperature of the air at the time of the experi- 
ment was 53°, at which temperature the same volume of air could 
hold in solution two grains of moisture, and the relative humidity 
would be expressed by  or .85,  complete dampness beino- de- 
noted by unity. 

Having thus explained the means by which the absolute quan- 
tity of moisture in a given volume of the air ; its relative humidity 
and the point of deposition, may all be easily determined, we shall 
now proceed to give the results of observations connected with the 
mean hygrometric state of the air, for a period of three years, viz. 
from the beginning of the year 1818 to the end of 1820.

The absolute quantity of moisture which exists m a vaporous 
state in the atmosphere, depending chiefly upon the temperature, 
is greatest, as might have been expected, in the month of July, 
and least in January. The month of April appears to possess the 
smallest relative humidity, and is therefore, in the ordinary accep- 
tation of the expression, the driest month of the year; while. the 
month of November is the dampest. The mean hygrometnc state 
of the air, at Perth, appears to be when the atmosphere is charg- 
ed with .805, or about four-fifths, of the entire quantity of mois- 
ture it is capable of holding in solution at the mean temperature. 

The coincidence between the point of deposition and the mi- 
nimum temperature of the night, so well exemplified in the above 
table, is a result that might have been anticipated from the gene- 
ral principles of hygrometry ; but it was first established by Dr 
Anderson that the quantity of moisture existing in the air, over 
any district, operates as a check upon the diminution of tempera- 
ture _ t he transition of the aqueous vapour to the liquid form 
caus'ing its latent caloric to assume the sensible state, and thus ef- 
fectually counteracting the tendency of the cooling processes to 
which the nocturnal air is exposed in the absence of the. sun. 
This fact, so important in meteorology, affords a fine illustration 
of the reason whv the windward sides of continents and extensive 
islands are warmer than their leeward sides in the same parallel 
of latitude; and why dry and parched tracts of land are always 
found to be liable to severe cold during the night.— bee fcdin.

Rain. — The quantity of rain that falls in any district is regulat- 
ed chiefly by the absolute humidity of the air; but it is modified 
in a considerable degree by the local circumstances which con- 
tribute to produce an intermixture of the different strata of the 
atmosphere, particularly the vicinity of lofty mountains, and the 
vicissitudes of temperature. The hills around Perth being of mo- 
derate elevation, the quantity of rain observed to fall in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood of the town seems to correspond pretty nearly 
with the mean quantity for the latitude. 

The following table exhibits the mean quantity of rain for each 
month, derived from a period of six years, viz. from the beginning 
of 1829 to the close of 1834, together with the deviations in ex- 
cess and defect during the period : —

The columns entitled « deviations in excess and defect" ex- 
hibit the extent to which the extreme quantity of rain for each 
month has most exceeded or fallen short of the monthly mean 
during the entire period of observation ; and the column entitled 
" total range" shows the difference between the greatest and least 
quantity for each month during the same time. Hence it appears, 
that the greatest anomalies with respect to rain occur in different 
seasons ,n the month of July; and the smallest in November. 
1 he former is to be ascribed to the partial but heavy rains which

accompany thunder storms in July ; and the latter to the uniform- 
ly cloudv weather which generally prevails in November. The 
mean annual quantity derived from the above table is 30.89 in- 
ches ; but if it be deduced from a period of sixteen years, it is only 
25.948 inches, which is probably nearer the annual average. The 
minimum quantity, belonging to the period of sixteen years, was 
15.59 inches, being the quantity in 1814; and the maximum, 
31.01 inches, which fell in 1817. 

The greatest quantity of rain observed to have fallen at Perth, 
in a short period of time, was on the 7th of October 1823, when 
2j\ } inches fell in fifteen hours. 

The driest months of the year are March and April, and the 
wettest July and August. The cold north-easterly winds which ge- 
nerally prevail in the two former months, come to this country from 
the northern regions of Europe, charged with humidity at a low 
point of deposition ; whereas, in the two latter months, the tempera- 
ture of the season having attained its maximum state, the absolute 
humidity of the air is increased in a corresponding degree. Hence 
the reason of the great dryness of the air in March and April, and 
of its opposite condition in July and August. 

The results obtained by a rain-guage at the top of a round tower 
on the summit of a detached conical hill belonging to Lord Gray, 
which is 612 feet above the level of the sea, and about 3 miles to 
the eastward of Perth, considerably exceed the quantity of ram 
collected in guages placed on the plain at the bottom of the hill, 
and about half a mile to the south-west of it. Thus, for a period 
of six years, viz. from the beginning of 1814 to the end of 1819, 
the mean quantity of rain collected in a guage placed m the centre 
of the garden of Kinfauns Castle, was 26.15 inches; whereas that 
which was received in a guage at the top of the tower, amounted 
to 34.965 inches. In 1816, which was a remarkably rainy season, 
especially during the harvest months, the former gave 24.95 inches, 
one-half of which fell in July, August, September, and October; 
and the latter no less than 52.43 inches. This singular result 
receives a satisfactory explanation from the circumstance, that the 
prevailing wind of the district being from the south-west, and 
there being no hill of equal altitude for many miles in that direc- 
tion, the air, when transported to the summit of the hill, is consi- 
derably reduced in temperature, and being previously charged 
with humidity, to a degree corresponding with the temperature of 
the plains over which it has been wafted, it is frequently cooled 
down below the point of deposition, and thus deprived of a portion

of its humidity, either in the form of small rain or of a dense fog, 
which, though minute in quantity, is sufficient, by the frequency 
of the process, to affect the rain-guage. 

Winds. — The prevailing winds in the neighbourhood of Perth 
blow from between the south-east and south-west, but most fre- 
quently from the latter quarter, the most severe gales being ex- 
perienced from the same point of the horizon. By taking the 
means for a period of six years, viz. from the beginning of 1829 to 
the end of 1834, the number of days which the wind blew from 
the principal quarters of the compass was as subjoined.

Ski/. — In every region of the globe, the face of the sky presents 
an aspect which is intimately connected with geographical position, 
and the character of the earth's surface, whether flat or mountain- 
ous, over which it is spread. Thus in the equatorial zones, the 
heavens are more serene, as well as more elevated in appearance, than 
in the less genial climes belonging to the higher latitudes, in con- 
sequence of the decrement of heat, in the atmosphere, being more 
rapid as we advance from the equator towards the poles. Hence 
the region of clouds becomes depressed in a corresponding degree; 
especially in situations where the inequalities of the surface con- 
tribute to intermix the different strata of the atmosphere, and to 
produce that blending of vaporized air, upon which the formation 
of clouds chiefly depends. Though Perth, as already noticed, 
stands extremely low being only a few feet above the level of the 
ocean ; and though it is closely surrounded on all sides, except 
towards the north, by hills, the flanks of which descend to the plain 
on which the town is situated ; yet these hills being of moderate 
elevation, the hygrometric state of the incumbent atmosphere is 
little affected by their vicinity, and the air is accordingly more dry 
and clear, than might have been expected. Fogs are not more 
frequent than in the open plains ; and the diseases resulting from 
a damp soil, and a humid atmosphere, are of rare occurrence, or 
rather altogether unknown. The gravelly and sandy subsoil of the 
district, and the perpetual change of air occasioned by the current 
of the river, in all states of the weather, contribute to render the 
climate of Perth more salubrious, than that of many towns pos- 



22

sessing a greater elevation above the level of the sea. The annual 
number of fair days is, according to the observations for six con- 
secutive years, 253 ; and the number of days on which there was 
either rain or snow, 112. Hence, the relation of the former to 
the latter is more than that of 2 to 1. 

Thunder. — There is no recorded instance of a thunder-storm 
having been attended with fatal effects in Perth, or in its imme- 
diate vicinity. This is to be ascribed to the lowness of its situation, 
and the influence of the hills, by which it is nearly on all sides 
surrounded. The elevated ground in the neighbourhood, being 
for the most part covered with trees, these act as natural conduc- 
tors, by which the electric fluid is slowly dissipated, before it has 
been permitted to accumulate in such a degree, as to be in a con- 
dition to produce violent explosions. 

Aurora Borealis. — The aurora borealis is not uncommon, more 
especially in the winter months, when it displays all the varied and 
fantastic appearances, which that remarkable meteor usually ex- 
hibits in high northern latitudes. When distinguished by more 
than ordinary activity and brilliancy, it not unfrequently terminates 
its restless developements, by assuming the appearance of a splen- 
did arch of light, about 5° in breadth, spanning the heavens in a 
direction that is always at right angles to the magnetic meridian. 
Occasionally the coruscations are tinged with the prismatic co- 
lours, in which the red greatly predominates ; but the other co- 
lours, though faint, are also discernible. The appearance of the 
meteor is generally considered to be a precursor of unsettled and 
stormy weather. 

Parhelia, — Lunar rainbows are seldom seen ; and parhelia or 
mock-suns have been still more rarely observed at Perth. Of the 
latter, however, a striking instance occurred on the 30th of April 
1835, the various phenomena of which were accurately measured 
with suitable instruments. About mid-day a luminous circle, pass- 
ing through the sun, and parallel to the horizon, began to make 
its appearance. This circle, which was about half a degree in 
breadth, was intersected by a halo encompassing the sun, and 
tinged all round with the colours of the rainbow, the red and yel- 
low being as usual, in such meteors, next the sun. The altitude 
of the sun's centre at half-past one o'clock, when the phenomenon 
was brightest, was 45° 15' ; and at that time it exhibited the ap- 
pearance represented by the subjoined diagram, which is a stereo- 
graphic projection of it on the plane of the horizon of Perth : In 
this representation N. E. S. W. is the horizon; Z. the zenith ; S.

the true sun ; s. and s. two parhelia 
or mock-suns ; F, G, H, a luminous 
circle surrounding the zenith ; C. 
K. D. L. a smaller luminous arch 
surrounding the sun. The latter 
halo, when carefully examined, was 
found to be elliptical, the longer axis 
being 43°. Beyond the halo, C, K, 
D, L, which exhibited very distinct- 




ly all the prismatic colours, the two south, 
parhelia, s and s', appeared at the dis- 
tance of 1° from the intersection of the circles. The following arches 
were measured : AC = 22° 30' ; CS. = 22° 45' ; SD. = 20° 15' ; 
AM.= 42° 0'. The parhelia, though considerably inferior in bright- 
ness to the true sun, were extremely luminous. The phenomenon 
was visible, from about noon till two o'clock, when it gradually vanish- 
ed. The sky during the appearance of the meteor was entirely free 
from clouds, but somewhat hazy. The wind had been blowing for se- 
veral days from the NE. and the temperature was low for the season. 

Botany. — The rarer plants found in the parish are the Gerani- 
um columbinum ; it grows near the summit of Moredun hill : the 
Sedum anglicum ; it grows on the rocks at Craigend : the Erythrcea 
centaurium of Persoon, or Chironia centaurium of Curtis ; it grows 
on the dry pastures near these rocks : the Botrychium Lunaria of 
Willdenow ; it grows on the North Inch of Perth : the Potentilla 
argentea, it grows sparingly on the rocks near Craigend, but more 
plentifully on the rocks in the parish of Kinnoul ; the Grarnmitis 
Cetarach ; it grows on the side of the Moredun hill ; but it is found 
in greater abundance on Kinnoul hill, and in the den of Pitrodie, 
parish of Kilspindie. 

The species of plants used for culinary, medicinal, and other pur- 
poses are what are generally found in other lowland parishes in 
Scotland. 

The soil appears to be congenial to the growth of every sort of 
timber, though not all equally so. There are no trees remarkable 
for either age, size, or form. There are no forests. The planta- 
tions extend to about 750 acres. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is no separate history of either the parish or town of Perth. 
By many of the Scottish historians particular mention is made of 
the town. The chief of these historians are Geoffrey de Mon- 
mouth, Richard de Circenster, and Fordun, Major, Hollinshed s 



24 PERTHSHIRE. 

Boetius, Buchanan, and Sir David Dalrymple. Mr Henry Adam- 
son, son of James Adamson, Provost of Perth, and brother 
of Dr Adamson, Principal of the University of Edinburgh, wrote 
a metrical history of it about the year 1620, which was published 
after his death in the year 1638. It contains a faithful narrative 
of many interesting facts, but it is intermingled with traditions 
on which no reliance can be placed. 

For a considerable period after Boetius wrote his history, it was 
a generally received opinion that Bertha and Perth were two dis- 
tinct towns ; that the former, having been destroyed by a land flood 
of the rivers Tay and Almond in 1210, the latter was thereafter 
built in a contiguous situation. In this he was implicitly followed by 
Hollinshed, Buchanan, and other writers. Boetius had evidently 
as his text-book the Scotichronicon of Fordun, which was written 
1377, on which almost all the early history of the country is founded. 
But in the Scotichronicon there is not a sentence which gives the 
least authority to believe that Bertha was a town distinct from 

Perth that they were not one and the same ; indeed, the contrary is 

there distinctly taught. " Villam quoque quae olim dicebatur Ber- 
tha, nunc quoque Perth, in Scotia aqua de Taya cum aqua de Al- 
mond maxima ex parte pertransiit." Lib. viii. c. 72. Boetius wrote 
in the year 1525-26. He was a native of Dundee. In conse- 
quence of certain privileges granted by the Scottish Kings toJPerth, 
but denied to Dundee, the inhabitants of the latter place were dis- 
posed to depreciate the former, and Boetius seems to have partaken 
of this spirit, and thus to have fallen into a discreditable violation 
of historical truth. But what brings complete discredit on his story 
is the language used in many charters previous to 1210, referring 
to certain localities in the town. It may be sufficient to refer to one 
of them, which belonged to the Abbey of Scone, and is contained 
in the old chartulary in the Advocates' Library of Edinburgh. 

 " Charter of William the King to Henry Bald concerning a land in Perth. 

" William, by the grace of God, King of Scotts, to all good men of his whole realm, 
clergy and laity, greeting : Know all who are or shall be, me to have given and 
consigned, and by this my present charter to have confirmed, to Henry Bald, that 
land in my burgh of Perth which James, the son of Simon and others, my Provost of 
Perth, have delivered to him according to my precept : To wit, that land which is in 
the front of the street which leads fiom the church of St John Baptist to the Castle of 
Perth on the east side, opposite to the house of Andrew, the son of Simon, lllam 
scilicet quae est in fronte vici illius qui tendit de ecclesia Sancti Johannis Baptisti 
usque ad castellum de Pert, ex orientali parte contra domum Andreae filii Simonis,

dc Valoines, my Chamberlain ; Malcolm, son of Earl Duncan ; William de Hay ; 
Alexander Sheriff of Stirling ; Roger de Mortimer ; Philip de Lundin ; at Perth 14th 
day of April." 



PERTH. 



25 



When this charter was granted may be inferred from the follow- 
ing facts. Hugh Roxburgh, Bishop of Glasgow, was made Chancel- 
lor of Scotland in 1189, and died in 1199. Philip de Valoineswas 
made great Chamberlain about the year 1180, and held the office 
about thirty-three years. Duncan M'Duff the father of Malcolm Earl 
of Fife died in 1203, and William de Haydied.before the year 1 199. 
The charter then must have been granted before the end of 1 1 99, 
that is, ten years before Boetius' ancient Bertha was destroyed, and 
a new city Perth built in another place. And it may be proper to 
observe, that every person who is acquainted with Perth at the pre- 
sent day can without the least difficulty, and with the utmost cer- 
tainty, point out the localities described in the charter. So that 
Perth now is exactly where and what it locally was in 1199. 

The Picts, after they embraced the Christian faith, consecrated 
the church and bridge of Perth to John the Baptist. John, they 
appear to have made the tutelary saint of the town. Hence it 
was called St Johnstoun. In the Scotichronicon, Vol. ii. p. 99, it 
is called St Johnstoun, as the name by which it had been pre- 
viously known. « Villa St Johannis, quae nunc Perth dicitur, 
Bertha dicebatur." Unde 

Villa Johannis pluribus annis Bertha dicebatur ; 
Perth quoque dicitur, ae, quia vincitur sic vocitatur. 

But there is no public document in which it is designated St 
Johnstone. 

Burgh Seal— In the reign of Alexander II. a. d. 1213-1249, 
the burgh had a common seal, but its particular character and im- 
pression are unknown. Of the seal which it had in the year 1 400, 
many impressions are still in existence, appended to the charters 
of the religious houses of Perth. 





On the obverse it represented the beheading of John— Salome

standing by and holding a platter to receive the head. On the re- 
verse, he is represented enshrined, surrounded by a number of priests. 
Around both sides, the legend is « S. commumtatis ville Sancti 
Johannis Baptiste de Berth." The seal used since the forma- 
tion bears a golden eagle displayed, viz. an eagle of the double or 
imperial kind— the two heads looking opposite ways. A red es- 
cutcheon charged with the holy lamb passant, carrying the ban- 
ner of St Andrew, with a silver double tressure, surmounts the 
breast of the eagle. The legend at the bottom, " pro lege, rege, 
et grege." 

Antiquity of the Town.— But Perth must have been a place of con- 
siderablenote longbefore the period when existing history refers to it. 
Near to the east end, and on the south side of the High Street, there 
is a house having on its front a marble stone, bearing the arms of 
the family of Aldie, with this inscription, " Here stood the house of 
the Green." This house of the Green, which was removed by Co- 
lonel Mercer of Aldie about fifty years ago, for the erection of the 
present one, stood on what had been for ages reckoned the site of 
an old British temple, which, when Hollinshed wrote his history, 
1571, was believed to have been built by the son of Regan, second 
daughter of Lear, who governed Britain long before the birth of 
our Saviour, and dedicated by him to Mars. The belief of this 
rests on the authority of Geoffrey, who wrote his history in the be- 
ginning of the twelfth century, and in the reign of Henry I. In 
connection with this tradition, it may not be out of place to state, 
that the workmen, when they had dug about three feet below the 
level of the street, to find a proper foundation for the present build- 
ing discovered two parallel arches. Under each of these, they found 
an apartment 26 feet long and 14 broad. The walls were 3± feet 
thick, and strongly cemented. In the one there was a door to the 
south, and in the other one to the north. In digging some time 
since in the grounds of Mud Hall, about fourteen miles from Perth, 
in the parish of Bendochy, several similar subterraneous buildings 
were discovered, which, when cleared of the ashes and earth with 
which they were filled, were found to be about 40 feet long, and 6 
feet wide, and 5 feet deep. Such buildings answer to the description 
which Tacitus gives of those of the Germans, De Mor. German, 
c. 16. See Dr Easton's Statistical Account of Kirriemuir, p. 177, 
for similar appearances in that parish. 

It is a generally received opinion that Perth was built and forti- 
fied by Agricola. This opinion is founded on a passage in the 
« Description of Britain by Richard de Circenster," an historian 



PKRTII. 27 



of the fourteenth century. Speaking of the Horestii, a people 
who inhabited the greater part of the county of Fife, and that por- 
tion of the county of Perth which lies to the south of the Tay, he 
says that their towns were Alauna, Lindum, and Victoria, — that 
the last named of these was the most illustrious not only in name 
but in reality, and that it was built by Agricola on the river Tay, 
20 miles from the exit of that river into the sea. There is here 
a description of the situation of Perth as accurate as could be look- 
ed for in a history written at that period. The distance between 
it and the exit of the river into the sea is indeed more than 20 
miles. It is 26 miles. But Hoffman, in his Lexicon, published 
1677, gives us computations of distances which very much corre- 
spond with that here given by Richard, supposing Victoria and 
Perth to be the same place. Hoffman says that Perth is distant 
from Dunkeld 12 miles, whereas it is 15— from Stirling 23 miles, 
whereas it is 32— from Edinburgh 32 miles, whereas it is 43 ; and 
it is a strong corroborative circumstance, that there are fburjnili- 
tary or Roman roads from different quarters, all leading to, ]f not 
centering in, Perth: one from Aberdour through the town of 
Kinross ; another from North Queensferry through Kinross also ; 
a third from Stirling through Dunblane, and the Roman camp at 
Ardoch ; and a fourth from Abernethy. These have been describ- 
ed and commented on by Sir Robert Sibbald in his history. 

Perth was a burgh in the reign of Edgar 1106, as appears from 
a charter granted by Mauritius de Cromad, in favour of John 
Mercer, burgess of Perth, of the lands of Meicklour The charter 
of confirmation by James VI. makes particular mention of one 
whichhad been granted to it by David I., who died 1153. King 
David's charter was renewed and confirmed by William the Lion 
which is extant.f 

Ancient Metropolis.—Pviov to James II. Perth was the capital of 
Scotland. The Kings were crowned at Scone, in its immediate vi- 
cinity, and had a residence in the city. That monarch was born in 
the Castle of Edinburgh, and was crowned there 1447, whither the 
Parhament and courts of justice were in a short time thereafter re- 
moved. But Perth retained its priority as the capital till 1482, in the

reign of James III. The estimation in which the town was held by 
James VI. appears from the following extract from the charter of con- 
firmation of the whole rights and privileges of the burgh of Perth, 
1600 " Our most renowned predecessors have not only beauti- 
fied, but abundantly heaped on our said royal burgh of Perth 
greatest benefices and egregious gifts, liberties, privileges, and 
immunities, that almost all the donations, liberties, benefits, and 
privileges conferred on other royal burghs of our kingdom are re- 
ferred to our said royal burgh of Perth ; and the benefices confer- 
red on the said royal burgh of Perth as being first bestowed on 
our said royal burgh of Perth, and in a manner depending there- 
on, are granted as agreeing thereto." In several of the public 
writings, especially in the time of James IV. it is designated the 
City of Perth, and it still bears the title. At present it ranks next 
to Edinburgh on the list of royal burghs. 

It was, at an early period, a fortified town. It is not known by 
whom, or under whose reign its walls were originally built On 
the outside of these, there was a fosse or moat, supplied with water 
by an aqueduct from the river Almond. Its strength as a fortified 
town in those times may be inferred from the fact that it was re- 
peated subjected to a siege. In the year 1311, Robert Bruce 
invested it with the most powerful force which he could muster. 
For a considerable time he pressed the siege with great vigour, 
but without effect, as he wanted a competent power of engines. 
He was obliged to withdraw his troops, and retire lest famine and 
the diseases occasioned by long encampment, on low marshy ground 
in an inclement season, should cut off the flower of those true and 
faithful followers by whose aid he had now nearly conquered Scot- 
land. But he could not relinquish his purpose, and suffer this 
single walled town for ever to baffle his efforts. Therefore, pro- 
viding himself with scaling-ladders, and such other instruments as 
he could procure, he speedily renewed the siege at a time when 
those within were pleasing themselves, with the persuasion that hey 
were enclosed within impregnable walls, and had no siege to fear. 
He chose a dark night, and in its silence, taking a chosen band, 
conducted them himself in person, partly wading and partly swim- 
minc across the ditch, deep, broad, and full of water, that sur- 
rounded the walls. His men were animated on this, as on many 
other occasions, bv the example of the daring valour with which 
TXosed himself, the foremost, to danger. The contest among

them was, who should be first to cross the ditch, and, by scaling- 
ladders, which they had carried with them, mount the wall. The 
gallant and perilous enterprise succeeded. The King himself was 
the second to enter the city." 

Historical Events of Importance.— When Edward I. subdued 
Scotland, towards the close of the thirteenth century, be took the 
most effectual means in his power to destroy every evidence of its 
former independence. He caused the chartulary of Scone the 
place where, since the time of Kenneth M'Alpine, the Scottish 
Kings had been crowned, to be carefully ransacked, for the pur- 
posed getting possession of whatever might be found at variance 
with the King of England's pretensions. And when he left Scot- 
land, he carried with him to London not only the crown and 
sceptre surrendered by Baliol, but even the sacred stone on which 
the Scottish monarchs were placed when they received the royal 
inauguration — which inauguration every one knows took place at 
Scone, in the immediate vicinity of Perth. Perth was a chief seat 
of royalty at that. time. We are warranted, therefore, to believe 
that the documents of public value there kept he would be parti- 
cularly desirous to take possession of, and this may account for 
there not being such records of public characters and interesting 
events as might naturally be looked for, in a city so prominent in 
the nation's ancient history. His grandson, Edward III. is said 
to have restored to Robert the records which he had abstracted. 
But it is more than probable that the spirit, in which he perpetrat- 
ed the violent deed, would instigate him without delay, to make 
away with some of the most important of the papers ; and report 
says that the vessel that was conveying some of them was lost. 
But these are matters of probability only, or conjecture, and not 
of historical fact.— See Hailes's Annals. 

In early times, the city was surrounded with castles, the resi- 
dences of powerful proprietors, who were often at war with each 
other and with the magistrates. Ruthven Castle was the seat and 
fortress of the Ruthvens ; Aberdalgie and Dupplin of the Oli- 
phants ; Craigie, of the Rosses ; Kinfauns, of the Chartres' ; Gas- 
conhall and Fingask, of the Bruces and the Thrieplands, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
When they quarrelled with the magistrates, they caused their 
tenants to withhold from the town provisions and other necessaries, 
which was retaliated by the magistrates, who issued out at the head 
of the citizens, who were all trained to arms, and burned or de- 

 Heron's History of Scotland.

stroyed their castles. In the records of the town, there is pre- 
served an account of a penalty which it paid to Sir Thomas Bruce 
of Clackmannan for burning the house of Gasconhall, about live 
miles east from Perth — also a remission under the Great Seal grant- 
ed to the magistrates, council, and community of Perth, for burn- 
ing the house of Craigie in the neighbourhood, dated 5th February 
1526. 

In the beginning of the fourteenth century, there existed a dead- 
ly feud between two powerful and fierce clans — the M'Intoshes 
and the M'Kays. King Robert III. sent the Earls of Dunbar 
and Crawford, with a strong force to reduce them to order. These 
noblemen, with a view to terminate the feud, proposed to their 
chiefs to select, out of their respective clans, each a band of thirty 
men, who should, by combat, decide the matter on the North Inch 
of Perth, in the presence of the King. The proposal having been 
agreed to by the chiefs, a place for the combat was prepared. It 
was surrounded by a trench, and by galleries erected for spectators. 
When the combatants were about to engage, one of the M'Intosh- 
es was seized with a panic and absconded. But a man of the name 
of Wynde, a saddler of the town, agreed to supply his place, pro • 
vided he should receive a half French gold dollar. The terms were 
immediately complied with. The combat began, and was carried 
on with great fury on both sides, till twenty-nine of the M'Kays 
fell. The surviving one, unskaithed, seeing that he could not sin- 
gle-handed resist the impetuosity of Wynde, and ten M'Intoshes, 
who were left alive, burst from the arena, leaped into the river, 
swam across and escaped. 

In 1589, a company of players appeared in Perth. In confor- 
mity with an act of the General Assembly passed in 1574, they 
applied to the Consistory of the church for a license, and produ- 
ced a copy of the play which they intended to perform. The an- 
swer given them was as follows : — " Perth, June 3, 1589. The 
minister and elders give licence to play the play, with conditions 
that no swearing, banning, nor any scurrility shall be spoken, which 
would be a scandal to our religion which we profess, and for an 
evil example to others. Also that nothing shall be added to what 
is in the register of the play itself. If any one who plays shall do 
to the contrary, he shall be warded, and make his public repen- 
tance." This last sentence must be understood to intimate, that 
the person so acting should be subjected to imprisonment, and be 

rebuked publicly in the church. In the record, the actors are

spoken of as being all of them men. It was not till after the res- 
toration of the profligate Charles II. that women ventured to ap- 
pear on the stage. Female characters were before his reign 
performed by boys and young men, disguised in female attire. 
The answer of the minister and elders shews that the theatrical 
performances were under the control of the local ecclesiastical juris- 
diction, and furnishes an evidence that, unless restrained, the per- 
formers indulged in what was irreligious and immoral. 

In 1336, the Earl of Cornwall was murdered by his brother 
Edward III., before the great altar of St John, in the parish 
church. While the King was standing there, the Earl, who had 
newly arrived from England, came to him. An altercation between 
the brothers took place in consequence of some highly aggravated 
cruelties, which the Earl was reported to have perpetrated in the 
western counties, on his way to Perth, and for which the King 
reproached him. In the heat of the altercation, the King stabbed 
him with a kind of small-sword, and he immediately expired. 

In 1437, James I. was murdered in the Blackfriars monastery, by 
Walter, Earl of Athole, Robert Stewart, his Lordship's grandson, 
and Robert Graham, their kinsman. The murderers were seiz- 
ed, tried, and put to death. The two most deeply implicated in 
the atrocious crime were the Earl and Robert Graham. They 
were therefore subjected to torture — perhaps the most appalling 
that is recorded in our country's history.-f- The King was buried 

 Fordun's words are " Cumque idem rex ante magnum altare Sancti Johannis 
super premissis ipsum ut abit arguerat : et ipse regi indignant animo responderet 
subito fratris spatu sive culletto extracto percussus, rebus exutus est humanis." 

f Cant gives the following account of the torture inflicted. " Walter's punishment, 
as he was reckoned the chief conspitator, was inflicted on three successive days. On 
the first day, he was placed in a cart, in which a stock-like engine was erected, and 
by ropes let through putties, he was hoisted up on high, the ropes being suddenly let 
go, he fell down, but stopped near the ground, with intolerable pain by the luxation 
of his joints. Then he was set on a pillory that every one might see him, and a red 
hot iron crown set on his head, with this inscription 

The King of Traitors. 
On the second day, he was bound upon a hurdle, and drawn at a horse's tail through 
the principal streets of Edinburgh. On the last day, he was laid upon a plank, in a 
conspicuous place, his bowels were cut out while he was yet alive, and thrown into 
the fire before his face ; afterwards his heart was pulled out, and cast out into the same 
fire. His head was cut off, exposed to the view of all, and set on a pole in the high 
est place of the city. His body was divided into four quarters, which were sent to be 
hung up in the most noted places of the principal cities of the kingdom. 

After him, his grandson was brought forth to suffer, but, because of his youth, they 
would not put him to so much pain ; besides, he was not the author but only an ac- 
complice, being under the direction of his grandfather, therefore he was only hanged 
and quartered. But Robert Graham, who perpetrated the villainy with his own 
hand, was carried in a cart through the city, and his right hand nailed to a gallows 
set up in the car t : the executioners came and run hot iron spikes into his thighs, arms 
and other parts farthest removed from the vitals, and then he was quartered After 
this manner was the death of James revenged, barbarous indeed, and which exceed, 
the bounds of human ,ty.»-See Drummond's and Buchanann's Histories of Scotland

in the Carthusian Monastery, which he himself had, in 1429, found- 
ed. . 

In 1539, there was interred in the Carthusian monastery, beside 
the tomb of James L, and his consort Jane, the body of Marga- 
ret, Queen of James IV. who was killed at the battle of Flodden, 
1513. After the death of the King, her Majesty married Archi- 
bald second Earl of Angus. He proved unfaithful; she therefore di- 
vorced him ; and afterwards married a son of Lord Evandale, whom 
thereafter her son James V. created Lord Methven. Her Majes- 
ty died at Methven Castle. The King, with a numerous retinue of 
his nobles, accompanied the funeral procession to Perth. 

In 1559, the Earl of Argyle and James Stewart, Prior of St 
Andrews, having learned that the Queen Regent was taking mea- 
sures for gaining possession of Stirling, resolved to prosecute the 
cause of the Reformation, or perish in the attempt. They accord- 
ingly set out from Perth for Stirling, attended by three hundred 
citizens; and, that their determination might appear and influence 
others, they, instead of ribbons, put ropes about their necks, inti- 
mating thereby that whoever of their number should desert their 
colour's should be hanged by the ropes. Hence arose the proverb 
of « St Johnstoun's ribbons." The people joined them every where 
as they proceeded. Wherever they met with monuments of super- 
stition, they destroyed them. The gates of Stirling, and of every 
other town in their way, were thrown open to receive them. They, 
without violence, took possession of Edinburgh, cast the images out 
of its churches, and placed in them ministers of the Reforma- 



tion. 



There was a painting of the commencement of the march of 
these heroes of the Reformation, from the south port of the city, 
in the town-clerk's office, now the chamberlain's office, said to have 
been well executed. But it was wantonly defaced in the year 
1795, by the town -guard, who, in consequence of some riot in the 
town and neighbourhood, had obtained a temporary lodgement in 
the court-room adjoining the office. No vestige of the painting re- 
mains.

Plague.— In the year 1512 the plague visited Perth. The prin- 
cipal document respecting it is preserved in the city records. It is 
a letter from the King to the provost, bailies, and council of the 
burgh, and is as follows :

In the years 1585-87, the plague was again in Perth The 
only account which I have found of it being here at that time is in 
the subjoined extracts from the session records.

In 1608, the plague again appeared in Scotland. Vigorous 
measures were promptly adopted by the magistrates and council of 
Perth to prevent its entrance into the city. All communication 
with those places where it was known to exist was prohibited. 
Watchmen were placed at the different ports of the town, to pre- 
vent the entrance of any one without the sanction of a magistrate. 
But every means used was unavailing. Many of the inhabitants 
were seized with the pestilence and died. Of the number who 
died no correct account appears to have been kept; but it must 
have been considerable, as the interments were at the public ex- 
pense, and places of burial specially appointed. The infected who 
were sent out of the city to St Leonards, a place in the neighbour- 
hood, and died there, were ordered to be buried at that place ; as 
also all the infected who died in the Watergate, Southgate, and 
beneath the Cross. Those who were sent out to the " Lone ot 
Balhousie, also in the neighbourhood, and died there, were order- 
ed to be buried in the adjoining grave-yard of the Blackfriars ; as 
also all the infected who died in the north and south side ot the 
Highgate. Those who conducted the interments received for each 
12s and the grave-maker, 6s. Men, designated cleansers, were 
employed in examining the suspected tenements, and received for 
each that thev cleansed 13s. 4d. Duncan Macqueen and others

plague being there ; and an order was issued to close up the houses 
of James Ross and others, they to remain therein during the coun- 
cil's will, for having purchased certain goods from John Peebles of 
Dundee, who died of the pest. 

In an old manuscript volume, I find the subjoined account of the 
plague in 1645. It appears from an entry in the city records of 
1667, that in 1645, a house without the Castle gavel port was 
burnt by order of the council for the purpose of " preventing the 
spreading of the plague." It is remarkable that no historian of the 
time attempted to give any circumstantial account of this devastat- 
ing pestilence. The engrossing political condition of the country 
may have in some measure occasioned that. 

Cholera.— In 1832, the Asiatic cholera visited Perth, as it did 
many other towns in Britain. As in the visitation of the plague, the 
most effectual means that could be devised were adopted by the con- 
stituted authorities to avert or mitigate the malady. A meeting of 
the influential classes of the community was called. The meeting 
divided the town and suburbs into sections. To each of these a cer~ 

  " In Perth it raged with great fury, whole families was seized therewith. At 
first, when one person in a family was seized, he was carried into a separate place in 
the house, where he was visited by the physicians. Such as recovered were of singu- 
lar use in assisting the sick, it being always the case, that if once they recovered they 
never fell into a relapse, for which reason they were called cleansers. But the cala- 
mity still increasing, and the contagion spreading, not only one person, but severals 
in a family, nay, whole families, and several families in a lodging, were taken with 
the distemper. Wherefore a new method was fallen upon of shutting up the dwelling 
houses where the distemper was, and allowing none to enter them except the physicians 
and cleansers. All communication between them and the inhabitants who were whole 
was entirely stopt. But this method being found inconvenient, by reason that per 
sons evil disposed among the cleansers entered the houses of the whole and thereby 
spread the infection through the town, it was thought proper for the future to put 
those out of the town at some distance who were sick. Accordingly, they went out 
and budded huts for themselves in different places around the town, particularly in 
the South Inch, the Vicar Knoll in the grounds of Friartown, Witch hill, near the na 
rish kirk of Kinnoul, and the grounds near the river Almond, at. the mouth thereof 
in all which places there are as yet the remains of their huts which they lodged in 
Ihe persons who died were buried deep in the open fields, none being allowed to be 
buried in the precincts of the town, or if they were, it was in a certain place allotted 
for that purpose, as in the west side of the South Inch. The wearing apparel, coods 
and gear of the persons affected were burned, and their houses shut up for some time 
and their money was afterwards given to persons employed to boil it, who returned' 
the same to the relations of the defunct. This calamity not only raged in the town, but 
wasseverely felt through the adjacent country,_great multitudes in the neighbouring 
parishes dy.ng of it 1 hree thousand of the inhabitants died of it during that time be &amp; 
sides many who died afterwards, it not ceasing for several years, though not raging with 
such violence It almost depopulated Perth; many houses in different placesbeing 
shut up, which afterwards m back parts went to ruin ; and what houses stood to thf 
Streets uninfected, were inhabited but by few. Several houses were infected in a 
great degree to the front, and even some streets were entirely forsaken, particularly 
one between the church and the Meal VenneL And the inhabitants being few n 
number, had no courage to carry on trade or manufacture, and buildings for many

tain number of persons was appointed, with authority to remove 
nuisances, and cause the houses which required it to be thorough- 
ly cleansed and purified. A temporary hospital was fitted up to 
receive patients ; and competent medical officers were appointed to 
attend and take charge of them. A soup-kitchen was established, 
from which the poor of the place were supplied daily with broth and 
bread. The consequence of these precautionary measures was 
most beneficial. To them may be justly ascribed, under Heaven, 
the comparatively small number of cases that occurred. The 
deaths were 147. It is proper to mention, that, through the libe- 
rality of certain noblemen and gentlemen in the county, and of the 
inhabitants of the parish, no legal assessment was resorted to. The 
sum collected and expended was L. 2091, 4s. 5d. 

Trial and Execution for Witchcraft.— In the year 1 623, three 
women were tried and executed for witchcraft. Their names were, 
Margaret Hormscleuch, Isabell Haldane, and Janet Trail. In- 
formation being lodged against them in the session, they were 
summoned before that court, their depositions were respectively 
taken, and witnesses were called, and examined to establish their 
guilt. The examination of the witnesses appears to have occu- 
pied the court for seven days in the months of May and June, and 
to have been conducted with great minuteness. Instead of enter- 
ing into particulars, it may be sufficient to state the following 
things, deponed by witnesses, and confessed by the accused. 

" With regard to Margaret Hormscleuch, — that she came to 
Alexander Mason's house, and having seen his wife, who was very 
unwell, she commanded that south running water should be brought 
from the Tay, the bearer to be dumb both in going and coming, 
and to hold the mouth of the pig to the north. That she wash- 
ed her with this water, and afterwards made a bath of great meal. 
That the diseased immediately recovered, arose, and supped with 
her. That she cured Marjory Lamb in the Muirton, who was 
sick by the dint of an ill wind, by washing her with south running 
water, and rubbing her arms with fresh butter ; and that she learn- 
ed these cures from Oliver Rattray's wife in Pittmudyne. — That 
she had restored milk to the cow of Robert Christie from Ruthven, 
which had grown yeld by causing a peck of draff to be carried 
home to the cow, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost. — That she had restored milk to the cow of Andrew 
Louraine in Mireside, by mumbling some words over a firlot of 
draff, which he bought by her directions \ that she sent him home 



PKRTII. 



39 



with it, and bid him cut the cow's lug, and mix the blood of it 
with the draff, which he did, and the cow gave milk. — That as 
Patrick Auchinleck was going at the plough he took a cholick, 
and she was sent for to cure him ; and that she for that effect com- 
manded him to be washed with south running water, and bathed in 
black wool and butter. 

" With regard to Isabell Haldane, — that she cured Andrew 
Duncan's bairn, by taking water from the burn at the Turret Port, 
being dumb, and carrying it to Andrew's house, and upon her 
knees washed the bairn, in the name of the Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost. That afterwards being accompanied by Alexander 
Lockheart, she took the water and the bairn's sark, and cast both 
into the burn. That being asked if she had any conversation with 
the fairy folk, she answered, that ten years since, when she was 
lying in her bed, she was taken forth, whether it was by God or 
by the Devil she knows not, and was carried to a hill side, when 
the hill opened and she entered. That she staid there three days, 
to wit, from Thursday till Sunday at twelve hours ; when a man 
with a gray beard came to her and brought her forth again. That 
she made three several cakes, every one of them being made of 
nine curns of meal, which had been gotten from nine women that 
were married maidens ; that she made a hole in the crown of every 
one of them, and put a bairn through every cake three times, in 
the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ; and that there 
were women present who put the same bairns thrice backward 
through every cake, using the same words. That she went silent 
to the well of Ruthven and returned silent, bringing water from 
thence to wash John Gow's bairn; that when she took the water 
from the well, she left a part of the bairn's sark at it, which she 
took with her to that effect ; and that when she came home again, 
she washed the bairn with the water, and that she had done in 
like manner to John Powery's bairn. 

" With regard to Janet Trail, — that Janet Burry brought her 
bairn to her, and told her that it started in the night, That she told 
the mother that the bairn had gotten a dint of evil wind, and she 
directed her to cause two persons to go down to south running 
water, and bring as much of it as would wash the bairn ; and that 
they should be dumb when bringing the water. And that after 
the bairn was washed, they should carry back again the water with 
the bairn's sark, and cast them into the place where the water had 
been taken up. §he farther directed her to bathe the bairn with

black wool and butter. That she got a shot star at the burn side, 
and sent it in with black wool, and that after the cure was used, the 
child was healed. That Duncan Tawis and Isabell Haldane came 
to her at her house in Black Ruthven, and Duncan told her, that 
he thought his bairn was taken away, it being stiff as an aik tree, 
and unable to move. That having heard this, she promised to 
come in and see the bairn. That when she came in, she took the 
bairn upon her knee before the fire, and drew the fingers of its 
hands and every toe of its feet, mumbling all the while some 
words that could not be heard, and immediately the bairn was 
cured. 

" Being asked where she learned her skill, she deponed as fol- 
lows, to wit : When I was lying in child-bed lair, I was drawn forth 
from my bed to a dub near my -house door in Dunning, and was 
there puddled and troubled. Being asked by whom this was done, 
she answered by the fairy folks, who appeared some of them red, 
some of them gray, and riding upon horses. The principal of them 
that spake to me, was like a bonny white man, riding upon a gray 
horse. He desired me to speak of God, and to do good to poor 
folks ; and he showed me the means how I might do this, which 
was by washing, bathing, speaking words, putting sick persons 
through hasps of yarn, and the like." The above are excerpts of 
depositions, and confessions, taken by the session, as formally en- 
grossed in the records. 

" George Robertson, post, was sent with the depositions of the 
witches, to purchase a commission to put them to an inquest. The 
clerk was ordained to direct a missive to Andrew Conqueror, com- 
missioner to Parliament from the town ; and another to Charles 
Rollock, baillie, who were both at the time in Edinburgh ; and 
another to Mr John Guthrie, minister there, that they all three 
mio-ht concur for obtaining the commission. 

« The commission having been obtained, directed to the civil 
magistrates, to try Margaret Hormscleuch, Isabell Haldane, and 
Janet Trail, accused of witchcraft ; they were put to an assize, and 
being condemned, suffered the ordinary punishment by being 
strangled at the stake, and afterwards burned, on Friday, July the 
18th 1623. 

" The session thereafter proceeded to censure the persons who 
had sought cures from them, and caused them to make their pub- 
lic repentance on a Sunday before noon, clothed in black cloth, 
and standing under the bell strings ropes." 



PERTH. 



41 



There were, as there still are, perforations in the arched roof of 
the Old, now Middle Church, immediately under the tower, through 
which the bell ropes were let down for the convenience of the 
ringers. And it was a frequent practfce to make delinquents, as a 
particular mark of disgrace, stand under these before the congre- 
gation. 

The place where such tragic scenes as the one now narrated 
were perpetrated, is said to have been a hollow in the North Inch. 

Royal bounty towards the Town. — The following is a speci- 
men of the success of flattering adulation on the mind of King 
James VI. It is a letter by the town-council to his Majesty, 
petitioning his bounty towards the repairing the Bridge of Perth, 
and the result of. it : " Moist gratious Soveragne, above all zour

To this letter the King returned an answer in the month of 
February 1608, granting exemption to the town from taxation, 
" for the furtherance of the building of the brig." 

Royal Visit. — In 1617, James came to Scotland and made a tour 
through several of the principal towns. Before he came to Perth, 
his visit was announced by authority to the town-council. The cir- 
cumstances which characterized this event are peculiar, and, as 
they are not generally known, I shall briefly narrate a few of them. 
The annunciation produced no ordinary excitement. The chief 
concern of the functionaries was how to provide for his Majesty's 
suitable reception and entertainment. But. his Majesty appears 
to have taken care that his dignity and comfort should be duly 
consulted. From the secret council there came a missive to " pro- 
vide fed beef anent his Majesty's coming to the toun." To de- 
fray the expense, an order was issued by the town-council to stent 
the inhabitants for 2000 merks, and again for an additional 1000. 
While preparations were proceeding, there came from Edinburgh 
two missives from the secret council, which, from what we know 



PERTH. 



43 



of the King's self-estimation, were probably dictated, if not written 
by himself. 

These missives were as follows : — " After our verie hartlie com- 
mendationis, the Kingis Majestie being desyrous, that in the spe- 
ciall burrowis of this kingdome quhilk his Majestie intendis, God 
willing, to visite the tyme of his being heir, such shewiss of orna- 
ment, cumliness, and civilitie may be sene, as may gif unto his Ma- 
jestie contentment, and may make the strangeris that ar to accom- 
pany his Majestie persave and see that the countrie is not sa barine 
of formalitie, ordour, and civilitie, as the ignorantlie apprehend. 
His Majestie has thairfoir commandit, that at his first entre in the 
said burrowis at the port thairof, the chief and principal inhabi- 
tants in the toun, in thair most comlie, civil], and formal ordour, 
sail attend his Majestie, and that ane speche sal be maid unto his 
Majestie be some person nocht being of the ministeris of the 
toun in name of the haill toun, congratulating his Majestie's com- 
ing to the toun, and making his Majestie hartlie welcome, and that 
this speche be deliverit in sensible, ticht, and gude language, as 
alswa that at the principal portis of the toun quhairat his Majesty 
is to enter, his Majestie's armes be engraven and sett up both with- 
in and without, and that they be overgilt in the best fassoun. And 
seeing his Majestie intendis, God willing, to visit that toune, we 
have though mete to acquentzou with his Majestie's will and plesour 
in thir poyntis, to the effect that accordinglie zou may provide 
zourselfis in time to gif to his Majestie satisfactione thairintill, and 
recommending the samin to zour diligence, cair, and performance 
as speciall poyntis, heirtilie concerning his Majestie's contentment 
and the credit of zour toun, we commit zou to God. Frome Edin-

" To our Richt traist freinds, the Provest and Bailleis of Perth.' 
Then, in two days after, came the following : — " After our verie 
hartlie commendationis, haveing wrettin unto zou of lait anent the 
decoring of the partis of zour towne with his Majestie's armes, both 
within and without, and anent a speche to his Majestie at his firste

blessings, quhilk this countrey has haid boith in kirk and policie 
under his Majestei's moist happie government, and lait go far as 
modestie may per mitt, he sail speik to the praise of the toune both 
anent the antiquitie theairof, the services done by the saim to the

in thair possibilitie, without ony private respect or consideratione, 
and the constant and firme resolutione of the toun to contineu in 
all dewtifull obedience to his Majestie and his royal progenie and 
successouris in all tyme coming. This being the substance of the 
speche, you sail caus it to be deliverit in the best forme that may 
be, and remitting the same to your awin graive considerations

mit you to God. From Edinburgh, xvii. day of Aprill 1617. Sic 
sub. your verie good friendis, Al. Cancell. Bining, Geo. Hay, S. 
Murray, Balfour of Burley." Written on the back, " To our Right 
traist freindis, the Provest and Baillies of Perth." 

Upon the receipt of these missives an order was issued by the 
town-council to convene daily till the King's coming. On the 4th 
Mav, they received a missive from the Chancellor and President to 
provide a propin to his Majesty at his entry into the city, and to meet 
him with black gowns. They appointed fifty persons to meet him, and 
ordered the propin to be 1000 merks, and the silver keys of the 
city overgilt. The King's arms were painted over the Highgate 
port. The arms were also cut in stone, and placed on the west 
side of the bridge nearest the tolbooth. The Bridge of Earn be- 
ing the town's chartered property, and as the King must pass it on 
his approach, the following appointment was issued : " Appointis 
Henry Bannewis to tak cair upon the bigging of the calsayeis of 
the Brig of Erne, and brig thairof, and to take triel with the 
cosches of his Majesty, that they discretlie be careit langlandis 
the brig, bot hurt to the samen, and to the cosches, and the coun- 
cill to consider his panes, and the said brig to be ledget with tim- 
mer and new daillit." 

The town-officers were ordered to be furnished with clothes 
of red Fleming. The skinners were ordered to " provide for the 



PERTH. 



45 



sword dance, the baxters for the Egyptian dance, and the school- 
master and the bairns gud dance to his Majesty." The wappen- 
shaw was one of the manly and athletic exercises in which the 
youth were accustomed to engage in the North Inch. They went 
under the name of weapon-shawings. The magistrates put them 
under requisition on the occasion, and required them to practise 
for a week before the arrival of the King. 

To gratify his Majesty to the full, four Latin poems were pre- 
sented to him by four of the citizens, full of the most fulsome 
flattery, which would have disgusted any one but James. They 
are to be seen in Mr Cant's notes on Adamson's Muses, &amp;c. 

In accordance with the instruction given in the missive, a speech 
was delivered before his Majesty. The person selected to do it 
was James Stewart, a merchant burgess. It is preserved, replete 
with servile adulation. There is in the town's record an " act 
granting to the children of James Stewart, who made and declaim- 
ed the oration to his Majesty on his entry into the town, in which 
his Majesty took great pleasure, the sum of 300 merks, and the 
same to the survivor of them, and Cathne Peebles, their mother." 

In 1632, Charles I. came to Scotland to receive the crown of 
the kingdom. On that occasion he made a triumphal entry in- 
to Edinburgh, and amidst much pomp was crowned in Holyrood- 
houseon the 18th of June. Thereafter he visited Dunfermline, — the 
place of his birth, Stirling, Linlithgow, Falkland, and Perth. When 
it was made known to the magistrates and council of Perth that 
it was his Majesty's intention to visit the city, they, without delay, 
adopted every measure within their power to give him a suitable 
reception. Inter alia, they ordered the bridge of Earn to be re- 
paired, and some improvements to be made on the south gate-port. 
They ascertained the number of beds and stables that could be 
furnished ; they ordered the best houses to be kept for the En- 
glishmen, i. e. the King's English attendants, and the malt barns 
to be fitted up for stables. They ordered " forty head of oxen to be 
provided," — appointed officers, and assigned them their duties, and 
provided them with new clothes. They issued an order prohibit- 
ing women wearing plaids during his Majesty's stay. They caus- 
ed a speech to be prepared to be spoken before the King by two 
boys equipped in suitable habiliments, for which they were each 
to receive a hundred merks. They appointed a body " of well

clad persons to go out with them to meet the King." Of the many 
amusements furnished for the occasion, " the Sword dance" by 
the Skinner and Glover Incorporation appears to have been the 
most interesting. There is an entry in the council books, 27th 
May 1633, that it should be performed before his Majesty, oppo- 
site to the chancellor's Earl of Kinnoul yard head, on a raft 
upon the water. The following account of the dance is given in 
the register kept by the Glover Incorporation : — " Memorandum 
of his Majesty's coronation, and coming to Scotland, his entry to 
Edinburgh and Perth, 15th of June 1633, — which day, our dread 
sovereign, Charles King of England, France, and Ireland, came 
to Edinburgh, being accompanied with the nobility of Scotland 
riding before, and the nobility of England riding behind him, de- 
sired, out of his gracious favour and love, with his nobility of both 
kingdoms, to visit his own burgh of Perth upon the 8th of July, 
and came to his lodging, and went down to the garden thereof: his 
Majesty's chair being set upon the wall next to the Tay, where- 
upon was a flat stage of timber, clad about with birks, upon the 
which, for his Majesty's welcome and entry, thirteen of our brethren 
of this our calling of glovers, with green caps, strings, red ribbons, 
white shoes, with bells about their legs, shering rapers in their 
hands, and all other abulzement, danced our sword dance with 
many difficult knotts and allafallajessa, five being under and five 
above upon their shoulders, three of them dancing through their 
feet, drink of wine, and breaking glasses about them, which  God 
be praised was acted without hurt or skaith to any, — which drew 
in to great charges and expenses, amounting to the sum of three 
hundred and fifty merks, yet not to be remembered, because wee 
were graciouslie accepted be our sovereign and both estates, to 
our honour and great commendation." 

Thereafter two tailors, David Black and George Pourie, came 
forward, and personating, the one the Tay, the other the City, 
performed a poetic comedy before his Majesty. It is to be found 
in Mr Cant's History. 

Inundations. — The situation of the town being low, and upon 
the bank of a river that is fed by numerous mountain streams, it is 

" These bells, with different pieces of the dresses then worn by the performers, 
are preserved by the glover calling. They are to be seen in their hall in the best 
possible keeping. There is, in the same place, also their flag or banner of yellow 
silk, having a square of blue silk in the centre, with the arms and motto of the cal- 
ling emblazoned on it. It is above 226 years old, and is very little tarnished. There 
is here besides an ostrich egg, which hung in their halls for above 200 years. Tradi- 
tion says, that it came to them in the time of the crusades, from the land of Palestine.

subjected to inundations. The most remarkable of these were in 
1210, 1621, 1740, 1773, and 1814. A particular account of that 
which occurred in 1210 is given by Fordun in his Scotichronicon. 
There is an account of it given also by Major or Mair, an author of 
the fifteenth century, and by Guthrie, an author of the eighteenth 
century. But that of Fordun appears to be the most circumstan- 
tial, white it differs in nothing essential from the others. It is as 
follows : — " Some authors have asserted that in this year 1210, 
about Michaelmas, there occurred such heavy falls of rain, that 
the rivers overflowed their usual channels, and swept away the 
crops from the fields. It is said that the rivers Almond and Tay 
became so much swollen, that the town of Perth was almost wholly 
inundated. A large mound or hillock situated at the old junction 
of the Almond and Tay  was forced down by the waters, and 
overthrew not only several houses, but the bridge over the Tay, 
and an old chapel. King William, his son Prince Alexander, and 
the Earl of Huntingdon, the King's brother, left the town in a small 
boat, and reached the dry land in safety. A few of the nobles who 
happened then to be at court accompanied them in other boats ; 
others on the tops of houses, along with the town's people of both 
sexes, with difficulty escaped a watery grave ; for in consequence 
of an extraordinary spring- tide, and the fall of vast torrents of rain, 
the river rose to such a height, that not boats merely, but large 
vessels could be impelled along the streets and broad ways with- 
out any difficulty or impediment." The historian Major ascribes 
the flood to the sudden and unexpected melting of snow in the 
upper quarters of the country.-j- 

 The old junction of these rivers was at the north end of the North Inch. 

f In the kirk-session records I find the following entry relative to the inundation 
of 1621 : — " Tuesday, 16th Oct. 1621. — The council and elders having convened, 
have ordered a voluntary collection to be uplifted of the haill inhabitants, for decla- 
ration of their thankfulness to God for their deliverance from the fearful inundation 
of water, threatening destruction both of the town and the inhabitants, to be applied 
for the use of the poor, — the manner whereof follows- : '• An remembrance of God's 
visitation of Perth." 

" It is to be noted and put in register in this book, the great and miraculous de- 
liverance that the Lord gave to this burgh of Perth of an fearful inundation of water 
compassing the same in all parts, so that therethrough the Brig of Tay was hailly 
dung doun, except only one bow thereof standing. None could get furth of it, nor

" The manner of the rising of the water was this, — the rain began on Friday the 
12th October, about ten hours of the day ; it continued that day and Saturday ; and in 



 This catastrophe was ascribed to the lowness of the bows of the bridge. The 
water had not free issue through them ; it rose above them, and being thus gorged, 
its force and weight bearing against the upper part of the structure, covered the key 
stones, and the whole at last gave way.

Citadel on South Inch. — In the year 1651, Cromwell, after he had 
defeated the King's troops in an engagement near Burntisland, 
marched directly to Perth. He found the gates shut against him. His 
purpose was to besiege it, but, having proposed honourable terms to 
the citizens, he obtained possession. In the following year he built 

the night, unlooked for, the water rose so high, that all them that dwelt outwith the 
castel gavel port in laigh houses, the water increased so, that they behoved to go to 
high houses, for preservation of their lives ; and heing in high houses, the water rose 
to the loftings in the highest mid houses in the castel-gavel before six hours on Mon- 
day in the morning ; and the wind and weet continuing, the water came up to Gil- 
bert Henderson's yett gate in the Castel gavel, and to Margaret Monypenny's yett 
in the Fish Market, and to Donald Johnston's yett in the Highgate, to the Meal 
Vennel in the South gate, and the water ran like miln-clouses, at the yetts of diverse 
parts on the north side of the High gate. An great tempestuous wind at the east 
blew all this time. The water also came above Henry Sharp's shop in the Speygate. 
The like fearful inundation of water was never seen in no living man's remembrance, 
which brought the people under such fear, that they looked for nothing but to have 
been destroyed. 

" Whereupon Mr John Malcolm, minister, powerfully endowed with Gods spirit, 
caused ring the preaching bell on Sunday at seven hours of the morning, and the 
haill inhabitants came to the kirk ; and there he exhorted them to repent for their 
sins, which had procured the said judgement of God to come upon the town ; assur- 
ing them, that if they were truly penitent therefor, and would avow to God to amend 
their lives in time coming, God would avert his judgements, and give them delive- 
rance ; whose powerful exhortations moved the people to cry to God with tears, 
clamours, and cries, and to hold up their hands to God to amend their lives, and 
every one of them to abstain from their domestic sins. 

" The like humiliation, both of men and women, has not been seen in Perth before 
nor since ; preaching and praying continued all that week. Our pastor with great 
magnanimity insisted in exhorting the people to true repentance and amendment of 
their lives. 

" The waters began to decrease afternoon on Monday 15th, but after day light 
past, there arose a greater tempest of wind and rain than at any time before, which 
so affrighted the people that night, that they looked for nothing but the waters should 
have arisen to greater height nor they were before. Notwithstanding thereof, mi- 
raculously, through the great mercy of God, by without all men's expectation, the 
water greatly in the meantime decreased ; which in the morning moved the people 
in the kirk, and in all other places, to give most hearty thanks to God for his mercy 
towards them. 

" Mr John Malcolm proved the part of a faithful pastor to his flock, with great 
godly courage and magnanimity to comfort them with the mercy of God. 

" Great plenty of corns in all parts, both stacks and stooks, being on haughs and 
valley ground, was carried away by the waters ; and divers ships by tempest perish- 
ed, and born nolt, kye, and sheep were drowned." 

 Cromwell proposed honourable terms, under an apprehension that the town had 
in it a strong military force prepared to make a vigorous defence. An ingenious 
device by one of the inhabitants occasioned this apprehension. He made carts be in- 
cessantly driven through the streets, and drums beat, and a continued and loud bustle 
be kept up, indicating warlike preparations. Cromwell's terms being honourable to 
the town, they were accepted, and the gates thrown open to him. He and his officers 
were conducted by the provost  Andrew Grant of Balhagils, now Murray Hall, to the 
house of the inhabitant referred to — Mr Davidson, who entertained them. After the en- 
tertainment Cromwell asked the Provost how, with such a small force as he now disco- 
vered it to be, he could expect to keep him out of the city  Upon the provost simply 
replying, that they intended to stand out till they heard that the King had come to 
England. Cromwell smiled at his simplicity, but, knowing that it was Davidson 
who had deceived him, observed, that if he had had time he would hang him — Upon 
this a person of the name of Reid entered, and being introduced to Cromwell, pre- 
sented to him a bond which Charles had granted him for a sum of money which he 
had lent him, and requested payment from him. Cromwell refused to accept it, ob-

a citadel on the South Inch, with the view of keeping the place more 
effectually in subjection to him. It was strong, and had a command- 
ing appearance. Its figure was square. It had a bastion at each 
corner, and was surrounded with a rampart of earth, and a deep 
moat filled with water. It was near to and connected with the 
river, and had a pier for loading and unloading vessels. " The en- 
try towards the town had an iron gate. The commanding officer 
ordered great trees to be cut down in the king's hunting-park at 
Falkland and brought to the citadel. The school-house was de- 
molished. It contained 360 scholars, was three stories high, with 
room for the rector, doctors, and music-master. They demolished the 
high walls of the Grayfriars, carried away the stones, with nearly 
300 tomb-stones, and 140 dwelling-houses, with the garden walls; 
also the hospital, a stately building. The stone pillars and abut- 
ments of the bridge, besides many kilns and fishing-boats, all were 
carried away to build the citadel. One hundred and forty families 
were turned out of their houses, and had starved, if they had not 
been supplied by the town. The surface of the two Inches, which 
yielded -2000 merks yearly for grass, was carried off to build the 
ramparts." 

Charles II., upon his restoration to the throne, made a gift of 
the citadel, with " the whole arms, amunition, and others therein," 
to the town, as an indemnification for the losses which they had 
sustained by its erection, and in consideration of their, faithful ser- 
vices to his Majesty 28th June 1661. It soon after this fell into 
disrepair; for in 1666, complaints, which appear in the city records, 
were given in to the magistrates, that, notwithstanding frequent and 
positive prohibitions, some persons had theftuously taken from it 
stones and timber. " This year, 1666," says Mr Cant, « the ma- 
gistrates ordered it to be exposed to public roup auction. It was 
purchased by George Conqueror, merchant and town-treasurer, 
for 4000 merks, besides 702 merks for 1960 stones which he sold 
before, for which he was to answer in his treasurer accounts. In 
the records for 1681, it is entered, that the council, finding the 
time elapsed which they allowed to Bailie Craigdellie to remove 

serving, that he was neither the heir nor the executor of Charles. Reid made this 
pointed and manly reply,—" If your excellency is neither heir nor executor, you are 
surely a vicious intronntter." Cromwell turning to the company said, that be never 
had such a bold thing said to him. Mr Davidson's bouse was that in the Watergate 
in which the late John Richardson, Esq. of Pitfour, resided. He gave a tack of the 
andsof St Leonards for a charger to fight against Cromwell; afterwards he sold 
them to the Perth Glover Incorporation.

the stones and lime out of the citadel, they empower the treasurer 
to remove them, and to use them for repairing the south shore; and 
in the following year, in answer to a petition from David Murray, 
merchant, they granted him liberty to dig such stones as are under 
ground within the citadel, for erecting a dyeing work-house in the 
Castle gavel, and for other purposes. They gave the same privi- 
lege to Isabel Orney, but no longer than to next Martinmas, they 
referring themselves to the council for the price. Bailie Craig- 
dellie's son was allowed to carry away the stones which were left 
by his father above ground already digged. 

The place which the citadel occupied does not now appear, the 
trenches being filled up and the ground levelled. But there are 
persons alive who distinctly recollect both its appearance and po- 
sition in 1771. On Mr Buist's map of the city and its environs, 
1765, preserved in the Antiquarian Museum, its position is dis- 
tinctly laid down. It was 266 feet on each side within the moat. 
On the north side the wall ran parallel to Grayfriars burying- 
ground westward across the present south road into the ground 
where Marshall Place stands. The south wall was nearly as far 
south as the aged thorn tree on the east of the road ; and the east 
wall extended along the river side, and at a short distance from the 
river. For some time before the barracks were built, which was 
in 1793, a part of it was fitted up for cavalry. At one time there 
was in it stabling for 200 horse, besides a riding-house, a tavern, a 
bakehouse, and other corresponding accommodation. 

Perpetual Service.—" December 5, 1701. Gift of Donald 
M'Donald, as a perpetual servant to the Earl of Tullibardine. 
" At Perth, the 5th day of December 1701 years, the Commis- 
sioners of Justiciary of the south district for securing the peace of 
the Highlands, considering that Donald Robertson, Alexander 
Stewart, John Robertson, and Donald M'Donald, prisoners with- 
in the Tolbooth of Perth, and indicted and tried at this court, are, 
by verdict of the inquest, returned guilty of death, and that the 
Commissioners have changed their punishment of death to perpe- 
tual servitude, and that the said pannels are at the Court's disposal, 
therefore, the said Commissioners have given and gifted the said 
Donald M'Donald, one of the said prisoners, as a perpetual ser- 
vant to the Right Honourable John Earl of Tullibardine ; recom- 
mending to his Lordship to cause provide a collar of brass, iron, 
or copper, which, by his sentence or doom whereof an extract is

transport him from the said prison once the next week. And the 
said Commissioners have ordained, and hereby do ordain, the ma- 
gistrates of Perth and the keeper of their Tolbooth, to deliver the

Eminent Characters connected with the parish by Birth, Resi- 
dence, or Burial. — One of the most distinguished characters whose 
history is connected with Perth, was John Knox, who may justly 
be said to have commenced here the work of Reformation in Scot- 
land. In the year 1544, Cardinal Bethune, having obtained an act 
in favour of the bishops and clergy to persecute and punish here- 
tics, came to Perth, when an accusation was forthwith lodged 
against certain persons, for interrupting a friar of the name of 
Spence, while delivering a discourse in which he taught that there 
was no salvation without the prayers and intercession of the saints. 
Three of the persons were indicted for nailing two ram's horns to 
St Francis' head, putting a cow's rump to his tail, and eating 
a goose on Hallowe'en. A fourth was charged with haunting 
the company of those heretics, and the fifth, a woman, Helen 
Stark, was charged with refusing to pray to the Virgin Mary, and 
saying that she would pray only to God in the name of Jesus 
Christ. The men were found guilty and condemned, and on the 
following day, they were, under the windows of the Spey tower,

hanged— the Cardinal feasting his eyes with this deed of horrid 
cruelty. Janet Stark desired earnestly to die with her husband, 
but was refused. She was taken to a pool of water hard by, where, 
having recommended her children to the charity of her neighbo urs, 
and her sucking child having been taken from her breast and given 
to a nurse, she was drowned, dying with great courage and com- 
fort. . 

This barbarous execution, or rather murder of innocent per- 
sons, increased the growing aversion to the priests and their super- 
stitions, and spread the spirit of Reformation throughout the coun- 
try. These and various other atrocious acts of Popish oppression 
perpetrated in the neighbourhood, such as the burning alive Mr 
Georo-e Wishart, the son of the Laird of Pitarrow at St Andrews, 
and, It the same place, Walter Mylne priest of Lunen, in his 
eightieth year, prepared the great body of the people to embrace 
the first opportunity of openly expressing their hatred to the Ro- 
man Catholic superstition. 

John Knox, having been in Geneva, was sent for by some Pro- 
testant noblemen. He commenced his return in 1557, and arriv- 
ed at Leith May 2, 1559. From thence, he immediately came to 
Perth to the aid of his brethren, and having publicly made confes- 
sion of his faith, he entered on ministerial duty. " In a sermon de- 
livered in the Old Middle Church, he declared what command- 
ment God had given for the destruction of the monuments of ido- 
latrie, and denounced the mass as an abomination. The service 
being closed, a priest, opening a splendid tabernacle which stood 
above the altar, was about to celebrate mass, when a boy cried 
out, " This is intolerable." The priest gave him a blow. The 
boy lifted up a stone, and throwing it at the priest, hit the taber- 
nacle, and broke down an image, and immediately the multitude 
dispatched the tabernacle and the other monuments in the kirk, 
before the tenth man in the town understood the matter, for the 
most part were gone to dinner. This being noised abroad, the ras- 
cal multitude assembled, and, finding nothing to do in the kirk, 
ran to Gray and Blackfriars, and after they had destroyed the 
monuments'of idolatrie, they began to seek some spoil."

Methven. He was born in 1577 or 1578. When about eleven 
years old he succeeded his elder brother James, who died a minor 
in 1588. He was carefully instructed in the doctrines of the 
Protestant religion. He was educated at the grammar-school of 
Perth. While attending the university of Edinburgh, and in non- 
age, he was elected Provost of Perth his father, grandfather, and 
great-grandfather, and elder brother had all been in that office. 
In 1594, he went abroad to prosecute his studies. The town-coun- 
cil, as a testimony of their respect for the Ruthven family, and of 
the good hopes which they entertained of him, bound themselves, 
and their successors in office, by a written obligation, to choose 
him annually as their Provost, till he should return to his native 
country. He returned in February 1600 in the twenty-second 
year of his age to the great joy of his friends. The reverse of 
satisfaction was remarked in the King's speaking of him and to him. 
In the month of August, a few months after his return, he and 
his brother Alexander were murdered in his palace at Perth. 
There is a mystery connected with this atrocious transaction, which 
no historian has yet been able to unravel. The scrutiny which 
has been made into the circumstances of the case, leaves an im- 
pression unfavourable to his Majesty, which the ingenuity of his 
most powerful advocates has not been able to remove. His Ma- 
jesty volunteered to give the city a very full and kindly expressed 
charter of confirmation of rights and privileges. This, it has been 
believed, was intended by him to weaken the people's hostility to 
him, occasioned by the catastrophe. To the same cause is ascribed 
his entering his name on the guildry-book as a burgess.-f

The Mercers of Aldie, proprietors of Meicklour, sprung from a 
burgess of Perth, of the name of John Mercer. " According to 
an old inventory of writs," says Mr Scott, the venerable author of 
the former Statistical Account of Perth, " a copy of which I received 
from Mr David Mercer of Aberdeen, a descendant of the family, 
there was and perhaps is still preserved, in the archives of the fa- 
mily of Aldie, ' an charter granted by Mauritius de Cromod in 
favors of John Mercer, burgess of Perth, of the lands of Meick- 
lour, which lands pertained before to Allan of Cambus, and were 
disponed by the said . Allan to the said Mauritius, dated anno 
1106, on Wednesday in the afternoon of St Matthew's day,'" viz. 
September 21st. This charter was granted in the last year of the 
reign of King Edgar, and before the reign of his brother Alexander. 

The family have a burying vault in the Middle Church in the 
north aisle, which extends a considerable way under the wall into 
the street. This was granted them by the King. The grant must 
have been before the year 1126, because in or about that year the 
King had given away "to the Abbey of Dunfermline all right that 
he had to any part of the parish church. The present represen- 
tative of that family is Baroness Keith. 

Mylne was a celebrated architect, under whose direction the 
bridge, that was destroyed 1621, was built. He was the descend- 
ant of the architect Mylne, a special favourite of James III. and 
was master-mason to James VI. A tomb-stone in the Grayfriars 
burying-ground was erected to his memory by Robert Mylne, one 
of his posterity, in the year 1774. Another of his descendants re- 
moved to Edinburgh, and built Mylne's Court, Mylne's Square, 
and some buildings near to the Abbey of Holyrood. Two celebrat- 
ed architects, of the same name, one at London, and the other at 
Edinburgh, were descended from him. One of them, Robert, 
got the highest prize in the first class of architecture in Rome. 
Blackfriars Bridge was built according to his plan, and under his 
direction. He was born at Edinburgh 1734, and died 1811.

• The aisle here referred to was in 1G21 designated Mercer's Aisle. In the kirk- 
session records of that year, Fehruary 21st, there is the following entry : " Andrew 
Conqueror, overseer, for the reparation and theiking of Mercer's Aisle, produced his 
account whilk being read were found equitably given, and admitted, whilk amounted 
to eiht' score eight pounds, sixteen shillings, three pennies ;"_the Session, as hospi-

1536, and educated at the grammar-school of Perth. He was the 
author of a tragedy — " Herod Agrippa, who slew James with the 
sword," and of a poetic paraphrase on the Lamentations of Jere- 
miah, published in the Musa3 Sacrse Poetarum Scotorum, and of 
various other works. With him originated the reproachful term, 
a Tulchan Bishop. In a sermon which he preached against the 
order of bishops, he told his audience that there were three kinds 
of bishops ; the Lord's Bishop, my Lord Bishop, and my Lord's 
Bishop ; the first a minister of Christ ; the second a Lord who sits 
and votes in Parliament, and rules over his brethren ; the third 
one who is the receiver-general of some court nobleman's rent ; 
giving leases for his lordship's behoof, but without the means or 
power of a bishop. This one he called a Tulchan Bishop, be- 
cause, as the Tulchan, which is a calf's skin stuffed with straw 
set up before the cow to cause her give milk, so such bishops 
are invested with the office that their patrons may by them milk 
the bishoprics. He was, by Regent Morton, advanced to the 
Archbishoprick of St Andrews. Thus he himself became a Tul- 
chan Bishop. For this conduct he was summoned before the sy- 
nod of the bounds Fife, and upon his refusing to recognize the 
synod's jurisdiction, he was excommunicated. Their sentence was 
by the assembly removed, in consequence of his giving some ex- 
planations, or making certain concessions. In 1590 he formally 
recanted these opinions concerning church government, which had 
given offence to his brethren, and died in the year following. 

James Crichton. — This gentleman is known by the name of the 
Admirable Crichton, a name given him on account of his extra- 
ordinary endowments of both body and mind. It is believed by 
many, that he was in early life a pupil in the grammar-school of 
Perth. For that reason I have here introduced his name. But I 
can find no authority for such a belief. His father was Robert 
Crichton, Esq. of Eliock, in the parish of Sanquhar, in the county 
of Dumfries. He was born in the mansion-house of Eliock, on the 
9th of August 1560. After his birth his father sold that property 
to a member of the family of Dalzell, afterwards Carnwath, and 
took up his residence on an estate of which he was proprietor in 
the parish of Clunie, in Perthshire. What authorizes the belief 
that he was born in the mansion-house of Eliock is, that the apart- 
ment there, in which his birth took place, has been preserved in 
its original state by the successive proprietors.  Vid. Stat. Acct. San-

Perth, being of great celebrity, he would be naturally sent to it for 
instruction. But it does not appear to have risen to any celebrity, 
till the time when Mr Rhind was chosen rector, which was in or 
about the year 1580. No inference can be drawn from Clunie 
being in Perthshire, as Perth lies distant from it, seventeen miles 
at least. 

The Rev. George Halyhurton, Bishop of Dunkeld. The first 
place of his ministry was Menmour, in the presbytery of Brechin. 
He was admitted minister of Perth on August 4, 1 644. In a meet- 
ing of presbytery, 16th October of the same year, he was severely 
censured for holding intercourse with the Marquis of Montrose, 
'during his stay in Perth, eating and drinking with him, and act- 
ing as chaplain at his table ; the Marquis being at the time under 
a sentence of excommunication. Mr Halyburton acknowledged 
what was laid to his charge, and declared that he had been 
taken by surprise, and was urged thereto ; that he was heartily sor - 
ry for what he had done ; that he had given offence ; and that 
he was willing to give, under his own hand, a declaration anent 
the occasion of his going to the Marquis, and what was the con- 
versation between them. 

By an act of the Commissioners of the General Assembly, No- 
vember 8, 1644, he was summoned to appear before them on the 
27th, to be censured for his holding conversation with the Mar- 
quis ; he appeared accordingly, and a sentence of deposition was 
passed upon him. In the following month, the presbytery of Perth 
joined with him in a supplication to the Commissioners to meet in 
January 1 645. In the month of February, the Assembly passed an 
act in his favour, requiring the presbytery and synod of Perth to try 
his repentance, and to report to the Commission for his reponi- 
tion to his ministry, as the Commissioners shall find reasonable. In 
a meeting of the presbytery, 2d April 1645, he produced that act, 
and being removed, the meeting, after reasoning, concluded that he 
should humble himself upon his knees, and give such signs of re- 
pentance as might convince the brethren of his unfeigned sorrow for 
the offence given in despising the censure of the kirk, and abusing 
the censure of excommunication. Mr Halyburton being called in, 
did humbly on his knees acknowledge the offence, and the scandal 
given to his brethren and the Christian people, and made promise 
that, by God's grace should he be reponed he would walk more 
circumspectly in time coming. Whereupon the brethren declar-

57 



ed themselves satisfied, and ordained the said repentance to be re- 
presented to the ensuing synod, that from both, reports might be 
made, conform to the ordinance of the General Assembly. In 
consequence of the favourable reports of presbytery and synod, the 
General Assembly, May 16, 1645, ordered his reponition, which 
took place in the Old Church of Perth on the 15th of June there- 
after. 

He was made Bishop of Dunkeld on the 18th of January 1662. 
He resigned his charge at Perth in 1664, and died there on the 
5th of April 1665. Mr George Wishart, Bishop of Edinburgh, 
preached the funeral sermon. Mr Wodrow says of him, Vol. i. 
p. 102, " his character was, a man who made many changes, and 
was sincere in none of them." 

In addition to the names of " eminent characters connected with 
Perth, by birth, residence, or burial," it may be proper to introduce 
the names of some of those, who, while the city was the seat of roy- 
alty, made it their occasional residence. The Earl of Gowrie : his 
palace was immediately in front of the South Street, stretching 
somewhat to the south, on the site of the present prison. It and 
the premises connected with it, occupied the square which belongs 
now to the prisons and the County Buildings. — The Earl of Athole : 
his house was on the west side of the Spey-gate, nearly opposite to 
that of Earl Gowrie. — The Earl of Errol : his house was at the 
south end and west side of the Watergate. — The Bishop of Dun- 
keld : his house was near to the same place, and had an entrance 
from the South Street, probably by what is called the Fountain 
Close.— -Lord Chancellor Hay : his house was at the south end and 
east side of the Watergate, immediately contiguous to Gowrie 
Palace. The description of the entertainment given to Charles 
makes this certain. Lord John Murray : his house was a little to 
the north of the Old Glover Hall, in Couvre-feu Street. The 
front portion of it still remains. — Lord Crichton of Sanquhar : 
his house was in the Spey-gate, as appears in a minute of the 
kirk-session, 4th July 1631.  

 Lord Crichton of Sanquhar was' William Crichton of Rayhill, son of John the 
second son of Robert, second Lord Crichton. He was created Viscount of 
Air, by James VI., in 1622, and Earl of Dumfries by Charles I. in 1633. 
He was one of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, who, in a meeting of the 
kirk-session of Perth, the minute of which I shall presently introduce, held 
in HUG, caused it to be sessionally enacted, that the provost and baillies of lie 
burgh should be thenceforth annually chosen members. His Lordship's immediate 
predecessor in the title was Robert Lord Crichton, to whom he succeeded, inconse-

Land-owners,— The principal land-owners in the parish of Perth 
are, The Right Honourable the Earl of Kinnoul, non-resident ; 
The Right Honourable Lord Gray, non-resident; The Right 
Honourable Lord Elibank, non-resident; Sir Thomas Moncrieff 
of Moncrieff, Bart., non-resident; John Nicol, Esq. of Few; the 
City of Perth ; the Glover Incorporation of Perth. 

Parochial Registers.— The date of the earliest entry in the ses- 
sion register is 1577. It consists of 28 volumes. The date of the 
earliest entry in the register of baptisms is 1561. It consists of 23 
volumes. The date of the earliest entry in the register of mar- 
riages is 1567. It consists of 10 volumes. The session appears 
to have been a semi-episcopal court till the period of the Revolu- 
tion. Till then the records were ill kept, several volumes were lost, 
and in those that are extant, there are not a few chasms and muti- 

lat The members of session were not the only ecclesiastical office- 
bearers of the parish, but, in conjunction with them, there were certain 
civil rulers also of the city. And the court thus constituted assum- 
ed and exercised an arbitrary controlling authority in. almost all mat- 
ters civiland sacred, affecting the well-being of the community. On 
some occasions elders and deacons had, on taking office, the oath 
administered to them that they would be « faithful and diligent in 
their employment." And not only so, but if after their election they 
demurred to accept, they were handed over to the bailies and coun- 
cil to be dealt with by them. Thus in a minute, of date October 
18 1584,—" Number of elders elected: ordained their names to be 
presented to the bailies and council, that they may desire and 
command the persons written to take upon them the office of elders

for the present year ;" the election being not ad vitam autculpam, 
but annual. In the minutes there occur instancesof interference with 
the affairs of the inhabitants, cognizable only by authority pure- 
ly civil. Thus, in January 20, 1617, " for as meikle as the session, 
understanding that Gilbert Robertson is tenant of an laigh house 
locate in the tenement of land pertaining to the hospital, whilk 
wants an chimney, and yet has daily ingill therein, to the perilling 
of the hail tenement to be set on fire ; and therefore ordains that no 
ingill be kindled nor used in the said house hereafter, and the bai- 
lies are requested to interpone their authority for that effect." They 
imposed and levied fines on persons guilty of certain offences, and 
sent some whose offences they judged to be peculiarly aggravated, 
to Halkerston's Tower, which stood over the north entry of the 
now West Church, there to be confined during the pleasure of the 
court. The Episcopalian ecclesiastical dignitaries gave their full 
countenance to such a constitution of the session, and the conse- 
quent exercise of arbitrary power. Thus the following stands on 
record: — " Monday penult day of Dec. 1616, present Mr John 
Malcolm, minister. Item, the haill elders were present except Da- 
vid Sibbald. In the New now West Kirk, with the bishops and 
council, the persons present, Archbishop of St Andrews, James, 
Archbishop of Glasgow, Alexander, Bishop of Dunkeld, William, 
Bishop of Galloway, and Adam, Bishop of Dunblane ; William 
Lord Crichton of Sanquhar, and David Lord Scone, Mr John 
Malcolm minister, the bailies, council, and deacons of crafts, and 
elders thereof. Whilk day it is agreed, for better ordering of all 
matters in the kirk and session, that the provost and bailies hereof 
shall always be elected and chosen members of the session, and that 
for this present year James Adamson and Constantine Malice be 
added to the present session, and give their assistance and concur- 
rence to the minister and rest of the elders. As likewise that the 
masters of the hospital, present and to come, shall distribute and 
dispense nothing but i. e. without advice of the ministers and ma- 
gistrates, and that they make yearly account to them and others, 
three or four of the most discreet of the council and session that shall 
be named by the minister and magistrates." This entry is desig- 
nated on the margin, " sederunt of the Lords Spiritual and Tempo- 
ral." Agreeably to such a state of matters, the sederunt of the ses- 
sion frequently commenced " whilk day, council and session being 
convened," &amp;c. 



60 



PERTHSHIRE. 



A new and more constitutional session was formed after the Re- 
volution in 1690, 4th June. Then the elders and deacons were 
formally and presbyterially ordained. From this time the records 
have been regularly made up, and, with one or two exceptions, care- 
fully preserved. But it appears that the session continued to tran- 
sact, at their sessional meetings, the civil business of the hospital, 
and, in their minutes, to mix up that with matters of discipline : 
and, when the three Lethendy mortifications were committed to 
their management in the years 1660, 1686, 1743, to enter the busi- 
ness of these among the minutes. 

In 1796 this irregularity was rectified, and now there is a set of 
books for each of these institutions. 

In 1807, the original parish was divided into four by the Court 
of Session. Since that time the session of each parish has had its 
own register. The two for baptisms and marriages continue, as for- 
merly, for the whole original parish. The two quoad sacra parishes 
lately erected, have, of course, each its own register for matters 
of discipline. 

It may not be out of place to mention here, that the session of the 
Middle Church are in possession of four communion cups of singular- 
ly antique workmanship, chased. They are silver gilt, and have each 
an unique cover. In 1632, there appears to have been only two. In 
the session register of that year, we find the following entry : " May 
21, the two silver overgilt goblets with gold, with the covers for the 
communion, and two basins pertaining to the session, are put within 
the charter kist in the revestry, there to be kept." Another of 
them seems to have been purchased about the year 1639, or soon 
after, for in a minute of session of that year, April 29, it is " or- 
dained that the hundred pounds Scots paid for permission to bury 
Lady Stormont in the kirk, shall be employed for the buying of 
an cup for the use of the communion." In the following year it is 
mentioned, that Mr John Robertson gave L.20 " to help to buy the 
cup." Besides these cups, there is a massy silver baptismal font, 
which appears from the legend to have been the property of the Old 
or Middle Church, since the year 1649. The East Church have 
had it in loan since 1808. The charter kist above referred to is in 
the Middle Church. It contains a small box, in which there has been 
preserved since the year 1685 a calculus— the history of which is 
somewhat curious, and given in the following notice accompanying 
it: " September 10th 1685. This day this stone being cut and

taken from Robert Ferguson, son to Donald Ferguson, by Adam 
Gordon, chirurgeon, before Mr William Hay, parson of Perth, 
and some other witnesses, was ordered to be preserved in the hos- 
pital box, the poore boy being cured att the expense of the session 
and hospital." The calculus is of the mulberry kind, enveloped 
by the fusible calculus. It is an inch and three-quarters by an 
inch and a quarter. The fusible calculus is three eighths of an inch 
in thickness. 

The register books of the presbytery of Perth are extant from 
the year 1618, and the register books of the synod of Perth and 
Stirling are extant from the year 1638. 

Antiquities, Sfc. — In the locality of the city, there are manifestations 
of antiquity, which carry us back to times of which no record gives 
us any account. The soil of the plain on which it stands is of al- 
luvial origin. At the upper and the lower extremities of it, the ap- 
pearance distinctly indicates that at one time it was insulated, — 
that on each side of it there was a water course ; and recent dis- 
coveries seem to make that almost if not altogether certain. When 
St Paul's Church, which is on the west side of the town, was built 
in 1806-7, the workmen, in digging for a foundation, came at about 
ten feet deep to a piece of well-built ashler masonry, stretching 
from north to south, in which there were iron staples and rings, 
such as are met with on piers. The level of the street here is about 
23 feet above the channel of the river at the water engine. At 
some distance from this place, in a northerly direction, Stor- 
mont Street, a well was lately dug. At the depth of about 
20 feet, there were found two willow trees, sixteen inches dia- 
meter in the bole, standing in their natural growing position, but 
with branches broken down. The soil around and above them was 
clay. The surface here is somewhat higher than the site of St 
Paul's. Almost due north from this spot, another well was dug in 
the house built 1826 by the late Mrs Young of Belwood, in Bar- 
rossa Place. And there one tree of the same kind was found at about 
eight feet below the surface, also in its natural growing position, 
having round it such alluvial matter as decayed nut-shells, leaves, 
&amp;c. From these facts, taken in connection with the appearance of 
the upper and lower extremities of the plain, and its immemorial 
name, it is scarcely possible not to conclude, that a stream of water 
must have run at one time in the direction of these places, and 
that thus the plain had been at some remote period an Inch or Is- 



J2 PERTHSHIRE. 

land. From extant documents, it is clear that the town's lade or 
aqueduct, which runs from west to east, must have crossed the line 
of that stream. But the aqueduct is proved to be in all respects at 
present what it was above 600 years ago. Long before the year 1111, 
therefore, the water stream must have existed. To a mere stran- 
ger this may appear to be a matter of no importance ; but to every 
one who is acquainted with the locality it must be one of interest- 
ing speculation. 

The facts which I am now to state refer to a less distant period 
of time. In the excavations which have, for above these forty years 
past, been made for foundations of houses, there have been found 
in not a few places, a compact black rich earth, saponaceous to the 
touch, but friable when dried, which at one time must have been 
in a semifluid state. In that earth, various articles have been 
found imbedded. In some places there has been found what in- 
dicated that cattle had been there kept. A few weeks ago, I ex- 
amined an excavation made on the north side of St John's Church 
for founding a house. In it there was the kind of earth I have just 
now mentioned. The following articles were imbedded in it, viz. 
small pieces of leather, of various kinds, such as are thrown out of a 
shoe or saddle manufactory— such refuse of leather as is found in 
currying manufactories,— a spur of an antique shape ; a pair of scis- 
sors, iiAength similar to those represented on the tailors' arms, af- 
fixed to their seat in the West Church ; the rowels are peculiarly 
formed ; a small copper shield having upon it a bend dexter ; pieces 
of moss' and heath, and straw, and oak, and a few oyster shells ; all 
which articles must have been deposited through mere accident. 
Over the whole of this deposition there were houses, which, through 
great age, had fallen into decay, and are now taken down for the 

erection of others. 

In accounting for such appearances, which are found in many 
quarters of the city, it seems most natural to refer to the repeated 
inundations which befell it in ancient times. In these times, the 
level of the streets was much lower than it is now. This is proved by 
the discovery of causeway pavements, 6, 8, and even 10 feet below 
the present ones ; and any one  who reads the narrative of the in- 
undation in 12 10, given by Fordun, and that of 1621, given by Mr 
Malcolm, particularly the latter, may easily see how disposed the 

 In the year 1666, the causeways between the Ilighgate and the South Street 
port were raised, by order of the town-council.

inhabitants would be to abandon those places of accommodation, 
whether for themselves or their cattle, which had been submerged. 

From many enactments and remarks that occur in the town re- 
cords, it appears that the principal fuel of the inhabitants was peat 
or moss turf. Peat stacks were numerous both within the town and 
on the North Inch, as were " heather stacks," laid up for winter fueh 
The refuse and ashes of these appear to have been accumulated 
occasionally on the streets, so much so, as to require the order of 
the magistrates to have them removed. When the inundation took 
place, they, in part, would be carried into the places now mention- 
ed, and, with the addition of other such refuse materials, thrown in 
by the inhabitants, would soon give the mass a consistency. This 
seems to be the most natural way of accounting for the character of 
the earth, which is purely vegetable, and for the singular blackness of 
its colour, and the complete preservation of various perishable ar- 
ticles found in it — water impregnated with moss being a powerful 
antiseptic and preserver of vegetable and animal substances from 
corruption. 

When Mr James Ballingall, upholsterer, erected these buildings 
on the south of the church, in which are his wareroom and the 
Central Bank, there was found in the excavation made for the foun- 
dation, similar black earth, and imbedded in it a boat clinker-built, 
about ten feet long, resting on its keel. There was lying under it 
a caulking iron, and the soles of shoes. I infer, therefore, from this 
circumstance, and from there being found in other similar places, 
various pieces of cow-house furniture, that the overwhelming inun- 
dation was unexpected, and prevented the people from removing 
what they would not otherwise have allowed themselves to be de- 
prived of; and this is rendered highly probable, by the narrative 
given of the inundation of 1621. " In the night, unlooked for, the 
water increased, so that all those that dwelt outwith the castle-ga- 
vel Port in low houses, behoved to go to high houses for preserva- 
tion of their lives, &amp;c." 

With the lowness of the level of the street corresponded that of 
the channel of the river. It was so low in 1600, that the most 
deeply ladened foreign vessels that traded with Perth did not 
break bulk till they reached the north shore, i. e. to where the 
council -house is, while such vessels now come no farther up the 
river than to the lime shore. 

Adamson, in his poetic history of the town, written in the year 



G4 PERTHSHIRE 

1630, intimates very distinctly that barges sailed past the Palace 
of Scone, and it is highly probable, from the appearance of the 
ground there, that the course of the river was much nearer the Pa- 
lace then than it is now.— His verses are 

« As we then talked, our barge did sweetly pass 
By Scone's fair Palace, sometime Abbey was." 

In the city records, 27th November 1609, there is an entry con- 
taining a prohibition of boats « weighing casting anchor at the 
North Inch head," i. e. the head of the original North Inch, which 
till 1785, reached only to the trees opposite to Boat-land. 

Before the Reformation, Perth abounded in monasteries and 
other religious houses. The monasteries were, 1st, the Dominican 
or Blackfriars Monastery. It was situated at the north side of the 
town, and was founded by Alexander II. in 1231, who, in 1244, 
granted to it the whole ground where his garden was, and also a 
conduit of water from his mill-lead, measuring four inches in wide- 
ness. The buildings were large and commodious, and were some- 
times spoken of as a palace. In this monastery, the Scottish 
kings, when at Perth, usually took up their residence, after the de- 
molition of the old castle. In the church of the monastery, the 
Parliament sometimes met, and the national ecclesiastical coun- 
cils held in it their annual meetings. The designation of the friars 
was, "■ the predicatory or the preaching friars of the burgh of 
Perth." 

2d, The Carmelite or Whitefriars Monastery, designated " the 
prior 'and convent of the Carmelite friars of Tulilum, near Perth." 
It was founded in the reign of Alexander III. and was situated a 
little way west from the town. After the Reformation, when the 
King's hospital was founded, the lands and rents of the monastery 
were annexed to it. 

3d The Charter- House or Carthusian Monastery ; this was 
the only monastery which the Carthusians had in Scotland. It was 
situated at the west end of the town, near to where the hospital now 
stands. It was built or founded by King James I. and his Queen 
in the year 1429. The original letter, sent by the prior of the 
great Chartreux in France addressed to that monarch, and giving 
consent to the erection of a house of the Carthusian order near 
Perth, for thirteen monks, with their competent number of servants, 
is extant among the papers of the hospital. It is beautifully writ- 
ten, and dated August 19th 1426. Its designation was, « The 



3 



PERTH. 



65 



prior and convent of the house of the valley of virtue of the Car- 
thusian order, near Perth." In the church which belonged to it 
there were some royal sepulchres, in which were interred King 
James L, Jane his Queen ; and Queen Margaret, mother of 
James V. 

4th, The Franciscan or Grayfriars Monastery. It was founded 
by Lord Oliphant in 1460, and was situated at the south-east cor- 
ner of the town, near the river. The ground on which the mo- 
nastery and its church stood was, in 1580, ordered to be in all time 
coming, the common burying-ground for the inhabitants of the 
town and parish. 

The religious houses and chapels were, 

1st, The Nunnery of St Mary Magdalene, with its chapel. This 
nunnery, with its chapel, was situated about a mile south from the 
town. The time of its foundation is uncertain. The lands sur- 
rounding it, with some other lands and annualrents of several 
houses in the town, belonged to it. After the Carthusian monas- 
tery was built, the nunnery was suppressed, and its lands and rents 
were annexed to the monastery. 

2d, The Nunnery of St Leonard, the Abbot, with the hospital 
and chapel. It was founded before the year 1296, and lay a little 
way south-west from the town. Lady Elizabeth Dunbar, daugh- 
ter of the Earl of March, who had been privately married to that 
unfortunate Prince, David Duke of Rothsay, and whom he was 
afterwards obliged to reject, devoted herself after his death to a 
single life, and became prioress of the nunnery and governess of 
its hospital in the year 1411. After the Carthusian monastery was 
built, the nunnery was suppressed, and its lands and rents were an- 
nexed to the monastery. But the chapel continued to stand under 
the patronage of the monks. 

3d, Our Lady's Chapel. It was situated at the foot of the north 
High Street, near to the old bridge. It was an old building in 
the year 1210, at which time it was in part overthrown with the 
bridge, by a remarkable inundation of the river. Afterwards it was 
repaired. The old prison is a portion of it. 

4th, St Laurence Chapel. It was situated at the castle gavel, 
or on part of the ground which belonged to the old castle. It was 
founded by the predecessors of Robert III., December 3, 1405. 
He gave it to the monastery of the Blackfriars. The reason as- 
signed for this gift was, that prayers might be offered for the soul 
of his mother, Elizabeth More, « who was resting in the church 

PERTH. E 



66 



PERTHSHIRE. 



of the predicatory friars of Perth." The friars, some time after 
thev got possession of it, suffered it to fall into decay. 

5th. The Chapel of St Ann, mother of the Virgin Mary. It 
was situated at the south side of St John's Church. The time of 
its foundation is uncertain. Sir Walter Eviot, of the family of the 
Eviots of Balhousie, was chaplain many years before 1528. It 
had an hospital adjoining for the entertainment of poor people. 

6th. St James's Chapel. It was situated at the south side of St 
John's Church. It was dedicated not only to the Apostle James, 
but also to St Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. About 
the year 1400, the chapel fell into decay, and a new one was built 
by the alderman and community of the burgh, chiefly by the as- 
sistance which they received from William Whitson, a burgess. 

7 th. Allareit or Chapel of Loretto. It was situated near the head, 
and on the north side of the South Street. 

8th. St Paul's Chapel. It was situated at the north-west corner 
of the street called New Row. It was founded December 25, 
1434, by John Spens of Glendewglie, or Glen Douglas. It had 
an hospital adjoining for the entertainment of strangers, and of 
poor and infirm people. 

9th. The Rood Chapel or Chapel of the Holy Cross. Mr Cant, 
in his History of Perth, says " it stood at the South Street port, 
on the north side." 

10th. The Chapel of St Katherine. According to the descrip- 
tion in the foundation charter, it was situated at the west end of 
Perth, " at the Clay-pots." It was founded June 19, 1523, by- 
Sir John Tyrie, who, for many year, was provost of the Collegiate 
Church of Methven. At the west side of it there was founded at 
the same time, a house " for the entertainment of poor travellers 

coining thither." 

All these chapels, as well as the monastery churches and parish 
church, had altars in them, founded and consecrated to the honour 
of particular saints, at which masses were celebrated, and prayers 
offered, for the souls of the founders or of their relatives. Each 
altar had its particular chaplain, or more than one when it happen- 
ed to be dedicated to two or more saints, which, for want of suffi- 
cient room, was frequently the case. Each chaplain had a yearly 
stipend of L. 10 Scots, besides occasional emoluments. The priests 
and chaplains, who were very numerous, besides performing ser- 
vice at the altars, generally followed the business of the law as pub- 
lic notaries.

After the Reformation, James VI. in 1569, with the advice of 
theRegent Murray, founded by charter an hospital, to be called 
in all time coming King James's Hospital of Perth. The foun- 
dation was confirmed by a new charter, which he granted when he 
came to full age in 1587, and both were confirmed by an act of 
Parliament in 1587. By these charters and some subsequent acts 
of Parliament, the minister and elders of Perth were made the go- 
vernors of the hospital. They were established as a civil corporation 
in the name and on the behalf of the poor members of Jesus Christ 
residing and abiding in the burgh of Perth, with power to hold le- 
gal courts with their dues and ammerciaments, and to have tenan- 
tries, and the service of free tenants." The masters of the hos- 
pital, who were to be annually chosen by the governors, were to 
produce their accounts not only to the governors and to the super- 
intendents of the county, who were a kind of temporary bishops, 
and thereby acted with a degree of civil power, but also when re- 
quired in the Court of Exchequer. For the support of the hospi- 
tal, the King assigned all the lands, rents, and emoluments which 
belonged to the monasteries, churches, chapels, and altars within 
the liberty and privilege of the burgh of Perth, and also what was 
paid out of the liberty and privilege thereof, to any other such re- 
ligious places in the kingdom. But this splendid endowment has 
been much diminished, partly through mismanagement, partly 
through the change in the value of the current coin, and partly 
through the violent seizure of portions of the property by commu- 
nities and influential individuals. 

This hospital has been the means of preserving ancient records 
more fully in Perth, than they are in most other places. The acts 
and canons which were made by the annual assemblies or national 
councils of the clergy of Scotland, and which are said to have been 

 When James, having attained the age of twenty-one, passed the famous act of 
the general revocation of church lands, it became necessary that the rights of the hos- 
pital should be renewed ; and more especially as the former gift of hospitality had been 
granted during the King's minority, money, as well as interest at court, it might be 
expected, would be requisite for that, purpose, both because of the composition money 
which the King might demand as the re-purchase of the gift, and because of the cus- 
tomary expenses of employing lawyers, and of getting deeds expedited by the officers 
of the crown. 

The commissioner from the burgh of Perth to the Parliament held in Edin- 
burgh 1587 was William Fleming, a man of great plainness and integrity, one of the 
most popular and respectable citizens in his day. He was in great favour with the 
Chancellor Maitland, Lord Thirlestane, chiefly through the Chancellor's lady, who was 
Jane Fleming, daughter and sole heiress of James the fourth Lord Fleming, and to 
whom William claimed kindred. The signal services done by this individual to the 
hospital, and the manner in which the gift was obtained, appear in a curious letter, 
which is preserved in an old hospital rent-book, sometime before 1655.

deposited in the Dominican monastery of Perth, were destroyed or 
abstracted at the time of the Reformation. But the following do- 
cuments are extant in the archives of the church or hospital.— 
The chartulary of the Dominican monastery, viz. the book in- 
to which the charters of the monastery, 162 in number, were 
transcribed. Also the account book, or book of the receipts of 
rents which was kept by the prior of the convent, from the 20th 
June 1557, to May 6, 1559, and 162 loose charters or writs which 
belonged to the said monastery ; 20 charters which belonged to the 
Carmelites or Whitefriars ; 92 which belonged to the Carthusians ; 
207 which belonged to the chapels and altars : — all these chapels, 
monasteries, and religious houses lying without the walls of the city. 

The other buildings of note were, 1st, the Castle, which stood 
without the walls, immediately at the end of the Skinner-gate. It 
was the usual residence of the kings previous to the erection of the 
Blackfriars' monastery. Not a vestige of it remains. 

2. The Old Cross. It was not inferior to Mary Magdalene's 
Chapel. The time of its erection is unknown. But it must have 
been long before the year 1578, for in the session record of that 
year, there is the following entry :— " The assembly session re- 
quests the bailies to clear the cross, that the door may open and 
steik, and that, they get a lock and key to the door, and likewise 
the master of the hospital to buy three locks for the three irons 
jugs where delinquents do penance at the cross." It stood in 
the middle of the High Street, between the Kirkgate and the 
Skinnergate, and, as in other towns, it was the place from which 
all proclamations were issued. What entitles it to special notice 
here is the following narrative, which I shall give as I find it in 
Cant's History. " In the guildry register is to be seen ' a. d. 1601. 
Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos,' and under this motto, 
 James R." all written with the Kings own hand. Upon the 
next page of the register we see " Nemo me impune lacessit, July 
24, 1650. Charles R." Written by Charles's own hand. There 
are blank leaves both before and after these royal subscriptions. 
Charles II. was crowned on the 1st of January thereafter. In the 
miscellaneous manuscript in my custody, before-mentioned, Mr 
Dundee, who was on the spot, writes thus :— " Item, on the xv. 
Apprill in anno a thousand vi hundred ane yeir, the King's Majes- 
tie cam to Perth, and that sam day he was made Provest, with ane 
great scerlane of the courteours, and the bancait was made at the 
Crois, and the King's Maiistie wes set downe thereat, and six 



PERTH. 69 

dozen of glassis brokine, with niony owder silver pissis and peuder 
vescillis, and then the King made ane great solleime aith to defend 
the hail libertie of this brouche." With reference to this strange 
occurrence, I may here remark, that James V. demeaned himself 
m a manner somewhat similar on another occasion. There is a 
charter of the Abbot of Melrose, a. d. 1535, constituting that 
prince the bailiff or steward of the Abbey of Melrose, vesting in 
him all the powers which pertained to that office, and requiring him 
to be answerable to the abbot for his exercise of the same. Sure- 
ly James VI. did not act so far beneath his dignity in becoming the 
Provost of a city, as James V. in becoming the bailiff of an abbey. 

Notwithstanding the very positive and circumstantial manner in 
which this matter is presented to our belief, I am much disposed 
to call in question the truth of the fact as related ; and my simple 
reason is, that there is not only no mention of it made in the 
town's records, but a distinct relation given of the election of Sir 
David Murray of Golspetrie, knight-comptroller, to be Provost. 
And it is remarkable that his election was, what had not taken 
place before entered in two books— the red book and the book 
of general entry. It is impossible to believe that such a very 
extraordinary event, as the election of the King to be Provost, 
would be passed without any notice whatever being taken of it in 
the records. 

In 1652, Cromwell demolished the cross and applied its mate- 
rials to the erection of his citadel. In 1668, after the restoration 
ot Charles II. the magistrates contracted with Mr Mylne of Bal 
fargie, the King's master mason, to rebuild it, and make it as ele- 
gant as any in Scotland, for L.200; and in the following year 
when it was fimshed, they issued an order to write Lord Lyon for 
a license to Charles Wilson to gild it with the royal arms, and 
those of the town It had a spacious terrace above. It was twelve 
feet high, and had a flight of steps within. On the anniversary of 
the Restoration, 29th May 1669, « the treasurer was appointed to 
cover the terrass of the new crois with a.carpet, and to prepare 
glasses and two gallons Scots of French wine, to be run out of 
• the mouths of lions, bears, and griffins, and other heads with which 
the cross was ornamented." In 1765, the town-council, in consi- 
deration of the cross being an impediment on the street, empower- 
ed the magistrates to remove it. It was thereafter disposed of 
at a pubhc sale to a mason, he being the highest bidder, for five 
pounds. He immediately took it down, and carried off the stones

3 The Spey Toiver was a fortress upon the city wall, near to 
Earl Gowrie's Palace, and had in it a strong prison. Among those 
w ho were at various times confined in it, were the pious persons 
whom Cardinal Bethune caused to be condemned for heresy.  rom 
it he witnessed their execution. It was the last of the towers on 
the wall, and was taken down about thirty years ago. JNot a ves- 
tige of it now remains. , , 
4. Earl Gowrie's Palace, called in the days of its glory Perth s 
Whitehall, was built in the year 1520 by the Countess of Huntly. 
It fronted the South Street, and part of the Spey gate on the west 
the river on the east, the Water Vennel on the north. The city 
wall bounded its garden on the south, along which wall ran the 
lade which, at its entrance into the river, formed a dock or harbour 
for vessels. After the murder of the noble proprietor, it fell into 
the possession of the city. In 1746, the magistrates made a pre- 
sent of it to William Duke of Cumberland, as a mark of the gra- 
titude of the inhabitants for his services against the rebels. 1 he 
Duke sold it to Government, to be converted into artillery barracks. 
It continued to be thus occupied till the commencement of the 
French war, when the Leith Fort became the artillery head-quar- 
ters In 1805, it was repurchased by the city, and its buildings, 
so deeply interesting to every reader of ancient Scottish story, 
were ruthlessly razed, and the ground given to be the site of the 
public buildings which have been there recently erected. The 
materials of the house were sold for L. 597, 3s. 7d. 

5 The Parliament House.- Meetings of Parliament were some- 
times held in the Blackfriars monastery, but this was the place in 
which they were held in ordinary. It stood on the north side of 
the High Street, a few paces back from the street. The avenue 
leadinto it still retains the name of the Parliament Close. Its 
site was where the Roval Arch Mason Lodge now is, for the erec- 
tion of which it was taken down in 1818. Long before that year 
it had fallen into decay, and was inhabited by some poor families, 
but it retained many traces of its having been a building of high 
pretension The Scottish Parliament meetings were held m it 
till the reign of James II., when they and the courts of justice were 
removed to Edinburgh, that city having then become the seat of 

,0 In lt Mr Cant's lucubration on Boetius' fable respecting Bertha, 
to which I have referred, there is mention made of urns hav- 
ing been found in that place on the bank of the river, worn away

by the strength of the stream. One of them was very large, above 
half an inch in thickness, made of a fine light-brown clay, plated on 
the inside with brass, and capable of containing about ten English 
gallons. Mr Cant had in his custody a bit of the brass and urn. 
He observed on the face of the bank six semicircular pillars of 
earth, about 18 feet in height to the surface of the ground from 
the bed of the river. The earth of these pillars was quite differ- 
ent from that of the bank, being of a dark hazel colour, while the 
earth of the bank was reddish. Round pits had been dug out, and 
urns deposited at the bottom. They were filled with a mixture of 
glutinous earth rammed down. After an inundation, which had 
washed away part of the bank about 150 yards farther up the river, 
he discovered a small urn, in which were a few ashes of oak-wood 
and part of a lacrymatory. It would contain about an English 
quart and a half. The pillars were in lines, about ten feet dis- 
tant from each other. Mr Cant's conjecture was, that the Ro- 
mans had here a station, a castellum, which carries in it great 
probability, as, from their regularly formed castellum at Ardoch, 
there are vestiges of a military way, which leads by Methven to the 
Tay, about a quarter of a mile above Berlha. 

Low's JVark merits particular notice, as it is a part of the charter- 
ed property of the burgh of no inconsiderable value. It is a strong 
and skilfully built weir or dike across the river Almond, about four 
miles up the river, which diverts a large portion of it into an aque- 
duct that formerly encompassed the walls. Before the invention 
of gunpowder, the citizens, in cases of emergency, by means of 
sluices, so filled the ditch or fosse with the water as to render the 
place almost impregnable. This was done by them in 1313, when 
Bruce, as we have seen, invested and took it. At what time, and 
by whom that wall was built, is a matter of uncertainty. Nor is 
it certain what was the special object intended by the aqueduct. 
It has been imagined that it was to strengthen the fortifications by 
surrounding the town with water. But the probability is, that it 
was for the simple purpose ofxprocuring a water power for the city 
mills. The probability is founded on the following circumstances : 
The proprietor of Meiklour, an estate about eight miles from Perth 
in the year 1106, was John Mercer, a burgess of Perth. He was 
the progenitor of the Aldie family. The arms of that family 

• The Rev. Mr Scott, in his account of the parish 1796; says, that there are some 
documents which show that this canal was in existence before the time of Malcolm 
Canmort, who, after the death of Macbeth, ascended the throne in 1057. Where 
these documents are, I have not been able to discover.

bear three mill rhynds.  Mills driven by a water power were in 
these days a rare and valuable property, and possessed only by 
persons of influence and affluence. If these mills were his, as tra- 
dition informs us they were, that may account for the three rhynds 
in the family arms, and go far to establish the antiquity of the 
aqueduct, for nowhere else could water be procured for them. 

But it appears from a feu-charter granted by Robert II. in 
the fourth year of his reign, i. e. 1375, that they were then, 
and had for some time previously been, the property of the Crown, 
for in that year he made a gift of them to the aldermen, burges- 
ses, and community of Perth. We must therefore believe that 
the Aldie family had for some consideration given them up to 
the Sovereign. And this may account for the family possessing, 
by an express royal grant, a burying vault in the Middle Church, 
which grant must have been prior to 1126, for it was in or about 
that year that King David I. gave over to the Abbey of Dunferm- 
line his right to dispose of any part of the parish church. 

The estimation in which this Low's Wark and the aqueduct or 
mill-lade were held in the fifteenth century, appears from an inden- 
ture entered in the city record, 4th November 1494, made by the 
then Lord Ruthven and his son to the burgh, and John Eviot of 
Balhousie,anent the mill-lade, water passage and course of the mills 
of the said burgh, and anent the reparations and upholding of that 

• In Nesbit's Heraldry it is said, " John Mercer in Perth purchased the lands o 
Meiklour from Mauritius de Cromod in the reign of King David II., which were 
confirmed by that King in the thirty-third year of his reign, and afterwards took the 
designation of Aldie. In the same work, Mr Mercer is said to carry Or on a fess 
e ween Un ee cVoss Patees in chief Gules, and a star in base azure," &amp;c. But the fol- 
lowing old verses « on the Arms of Aldie," which Mr Scott many years ago received 
from Mr Mercer, already referred to, are entitled to attention. 

" Behold the arms of the Mercers are, 

Three mill rhynds, three gold balls with glittering star. 

To let the world know that their ancient race 

Possessed three mills for many ages space, 

In pleasant Perth, near situate by Tay, 

Which mills Perth keeps unto this present day. 

Three balls next show them potent in each thing, 

Therefore they gift these mills unto the King, 

Who for their golden gift and loyal mmd, 

With arched tomb in church did them propme, 

With lands, rent, arms, of privilege and fame, 

Kept now by Aldie's lands, chief of the name. 

Lastly, the star, clear, shining as a gem, 

Proves their descent out of Moravian stem. 

Likewise their will and virtue do presage, 

In name and fame to last with shining age. 

Therefore, ,men may avow withjustest breath, 

Mercer's are yea older than old Perth. 
These last lines, as Mr Scott remarks, refer to the fabulous story of Hector Boece, 
that Beitha was prior to Perth.

work called Low's Wark, which is the retainer and closer of the 
said mill-lade. On the east bank of the lade, and within a 
short distance from the city, there is a stone wall through which 
 there is a hole or perforation called a boot or bout, having a strong 
ring of iron at both ends, 32 inches in circumference. Through 
this boot there passes a considerable .body of water, which forms 
the aqueduct that supplies the mills of Balhousie. The antiquity 
of the boot appears from a contract recorded in the city archives, 
between the Eviots of Balhousie, and the alderman, bailies, coun- 
cil, and community of Perth, dated 19th June 1464, that the boot 
shall be taken up and newly made, of thirty -two inches of wide- 
ness within at both ends, and banded with iron both within and 
without at both ends. This stone work was repaired about sixty 
years ago, and the rings adjusted according to the original con- 
tract, in presence of commissioners appointed by the Earl of Kin- 
noul, who had then become proprietor of Balhousie, and the 
magistrates of Perth. 

With respect to " pieces of antiquity dug up in the parish," there 
are none of value and importance. In the rubbish of that part of the 
city wall that was pulled down in 1790, to make way for the erec- 
tion of the George Inn, George Street, there was found a copper 
coin of Csesar Augustus, of nearly the size of the present current pen- 
ny, legend distinct. It is in the possession of Mrs Ramsay of Croft. 
When the Old Parliament House, High Street, was thrown down 
in 1818, there were found in it coins, chiefly Bruce's, BallioPs and 
Alexander's. They were all silver pennies, with the exception of 
a few Braces. Mr Duncan, druggist Edinburgh, the proprietor, 
presented some of them to the Museum of the Antiquarian So- 
ciety. In an old house on the north side of St John's Church, 
there were found when it was taken down last spring, some silver 
coins. They were all Mary's. Two of them .are in my posses- 
sion. 

There is a tradition respecting this boo, which it may be proper to notice. It 
is, that a proprietor of Balhousie, wishing to erect a mill near his house, applied to 
the King, requesting to have from hit lade at a given place, a bootful of water, which 
being granted, he produced a boot without a sole, and that lie thus obtained a per- 
petual current for his mill. The tradition carries absurdity in the face of it. The 
following fact shows clearly enough how the boot may have originated. King Alex- 
ander II. granted to the Dominican Monastery a pipe of water from the same lade or 
canal, " 4 inches in wideness," but with the express condition that it should not be to 
the detriment of a mill belonging to him at Perth. Upon a similar principle may 
the limited quantity of water have been granted to the Balhousie proprietor for his 
mill. 

The tradition appears to have been credited in 1600, as in the original Latin char- 
ter the word is translated " ocream."

Interment of the Dead. — The heathen made it unlawful to inter 
the dead within the precincts of their cities, that the sacred places 
there might not be denied. Accordingly, their usual practice 
was to inter in the suburbs, and on the sides of the highways. 
The early Christians acted in conformity with the established cus- 
tom. But before the end of the fourth century, they, influenced 
by feelings of piety, or rather of superstition, endeavoured to have 
their churches made receptacles for their dead, particularly for those 
of them who had been of distinguished Christian character. This 
the Emperor Theodosius opposed, and published against it an or- 
dinance, declaring that every one found guilty of it should be sub- 
jected to a mulct, " tertia in futurum patrimonii parte mulctetur." 
But the notion, that the souls of the departed would be thereby 
benefited, became prevalent, and was in no small degree strength- 
ened by the introduction of the Popish doctrine of worshipping or 
paying homage to the dead and their relics. Accordingly, in the 
thirteenth century, kirk burial was an object which the Roman 
Catholic population everywhere anxiously and devoutly sought 
after. The state of the under ground in the old churches in this 
county, particularly in those in which the rites of the Catholic 
faith were observed, afford abundant proof how prevalent the su- 
perstitious practice was. 

In the under ground of St John's Church of Perth, the quanti- 
ty of skulls and other bones is throughout so great, that one might 
conclude it to have been the charnel-house of the city. But soon 
after the Reformation in 1 560, the gross superstition which occa- 
sioned and encouraged the practice began to subside ; and in 
Scotland measures were speedily adopted for its prevention. In 
1588, the General Assembly issued a prohibition against its con- 
tinuance. The matter was immediately taken up by the kirk-ses- 
sion of Perth, as the following will shew :— " Decimo die mensis 
Januarii anno domini millesimo quingentesimo octuagesimo octavo : 
Whilk day the bailies of the burgh of Perth conveened,'understand- 
ing that by an act of Parliament  and General Assembly, it is or- 
dained that there shall be no persons buried in the kirks of this 
realm, nor the floors thereof be altered or broken to that effect, 
for sundry good causes and effects mentioned in the said act, which 
the bailies, council, and deacons of crafts, ministers, and elders 
foresaids being minded to cause to be observed, have, according 
thereto, ordained and ordains that the kirk floor of the burgh shall

PERTH. 



75 



not be raised nor broken, nor any burial be made therein in time 
coming, as the said act bears." 

This not having produced the intended effect, the session re- 
newed their prohibition in the following minute :— " 2d September 
1589 : Whilk dav, bailies, council, and deacons of crafts, minister, 
and elders of the burgh of Perth, convened within the revestry, 
understanding that there was an act and ordinance made upon 
the tenth day of January, in the year of God one thousand five 
hundred and'eighty-eight years, by the bailies, council, deacons 
of crafts, ministers and elders of the said burgh, bearing the tenor 
following.—" Here the act is introduced. " And seeing, since the 
date of the said act, certain persons have been buried within the 
said kirk, wherewith they have dispensed, they now of one 
mind, consent and assent, and now have ordained and ordains, that 
there shall be no person or persons, whatsoever calling they may be 
of, buried within the kirk of this burgh, and that the kirk floor 
thereof shall not be raised nor broken, in time coming, without the 
special advices, consents, and assents of the said bailies, council, dea- 
cons of crafts, minister and elders of the said burgh, or the most part 
of the council and eldership, chapterly convened within the revestry, 
be first had and obtained thereto, under the pain of ten pounds 
money, to be paid by every particular person that shall happen at 
any time coming to consent to the contrary hereof, to be employ- 
ed to the repair of the kirk; and also in case of the contravention 
hereof, to satisfy the kirk by their public repentance, attour the 
payment of the said ten pounds. And ordain that this repentance, 
attour the said ten pounds with this act, be inserted in the books 
of council, and in the books of the Assembly of Perth. 

" To the making of whilk repentance James Davidson, deacon 
of the hammermen, and George Robertson, one of the council, 
and deacon of the skinners, dissented." 

As this prohibitory act of session was not absolute, but admit- 
ted of exception, to be judged of by the members chapterly con- 
vened, persons of influence and affluence continued to obtain kirk 
burial. Accordingly, in the record we have such minutes as 
the following : — " Penult day of July 1631 : Which day the coun- 
cil and session being convened in the revestry anent the suit of the 
Laird of Moncrieff, craving licence to bury the corpse of umquhill 
Margaret Beetoun, spouse to Mr David Moncrieff, of Craigie, pa- 
rishioner of Perth, within the kirk thereof, they thought it expe- 
dient the laird himself should come in before them, and propose 



70 



rURTIISIHRE. 



the said errand himself, and what he would offer for the said licence. 
Whereupon his wisdom was incalled, and proposed the matter to 
them, and offered for licence forty pounds Scots money, to be 
paid immediately to Andrew Bell, master of the hospital, in name 
of the session, and thereupon the council and session granted li- 
berty to bury the said corpse in the burial called Balleises burial, 
within the said kirk." And to give one other instance : " Penult 
day of April 1639, Lady Stormont buried beside her mother, in 
the north east neuk of the kirk of Perth, and to pay a hundred 
pounds money Scots, to be delivered to George Bisset, master of 
the hospital, before the breaking of the ground." 

For a long time this practice, reprehensible in every point of 
view, has ceased in Perth. The only exception has been, if ex- 
ception it can be called, is the access which the Aldie family have 
in the Middle Church to their vault, under the north wall and the 
adjoining street. « 

There was a grave-yard around the church. It is now completely 
concealed. There are streets over it. The only mention made of it 
in the session records refers to facts which shew that there was not 
an over strict regard paid to its sacredness as the depository of the 
dead. Thus in 1587, " ordains no stables to be in the kirk-yard 
after Whitsunday, and if ever they be found hereafter, any of the 
setters thereof to pay ten pounds." And again in 1603, " For as 
meikle as the causways of the kirkyard are greatly abused by the 
repair of horses and sleds, the sessions request David Sibbald to 
set up an stock in the West Kirk Vennel, for staying of their pas- 
sage on the west side of the kirk." Thus it appears that there 
had been through sufferance a thoroughfare through the burying 
 ground. Perhaps it had at this time become less an object of 
official care, as a new and spacious place for burying had been lately 
provided in 1580. That place is well known by the name of the 
G ayfriars burying-ground. It was the site of the Grayfriars 
Mon stery, which at the period of the Reformation was destroyed 
by the over-excited multitude. 

In the session records, there is aminute of date 2d November 1602, 
which seems to convey the idea that at that time paupers, inter- 
red at the expense of the session funds, had no coffins provided for 
them. It is in these words, " The session ordains the master of the 
hospital, with all diligence, cause make an common mortkist, where- 
by the dead corpses of the poor ones may be honestly carried to the 
burial." And there is a similar minute in the records for 1618.

5th May. " The session ordains John Bower, master of the hos-

The oldest tombstone in the Grayfriars burying-ground is dated 
1580 ; the year in which it was set apart by the minister and elders 
as managers of the hospital. 

Burgh. — The records of the burgh are of great antiquity, but un- 
fortunately the oldest cannot now bedecyphered. The earliest legible 
date is 1512. Mr Cant who, sixty-two years ago, published anew 
edition of Adamson's valuable Poetic History of Perth, with expla- 
natory notes and observations, has added to it a list of the city ma- 
gistrates from an earlier period than this ; the register from which 
he obtained his information being when he wrote in better preser- 
vation than it now is. He tells us that the proper records before 
ike year 1465 had been mislaid, and having given the only list of 
magistrates before that time which he could find, viz. for 1374, he 
produces a full and uninterrupted list of magistrates from 1465 
to 1765. 

Previous to the passing of the Burgh Reform Bill, the council 
elected their successors in office. The bill has introduced a new 
order of things ; the town is divided into four wards, and the inha- 
bitants in these who hold or rent property of the annual value of 
L. 10, elect the council, and the council elect the office-bearers. 

The magistrates elected from the first reformed council were, 
Adam Pringle, Esq., Lord Provost, Sheriff, and Coroner; Robert 
Bower, Esq. merchant, Dean of Guild ; Thomas Robert San.de- 
man, Esq. wine-merchant, first bailie ; David Clunie, Esq. baker, 
second bailie; John Graham, Esq. boot-maker, third bailie; James 
M'Leish, Esq. dyer, fourth bailie ; James Dewar, Esq. bookseller, 
treasurer. 

The jurisdiction of the Provost, Dean of Guild, and bailies, ex- 
tends over the royalty of the burgh, but the boundary of the royalty 
is not well defined. The property holding burgage situated with- 
out the line of the ancient walls exceeds in extent that within the 
walls. The jurisdiction is exercised by the magistrates, personally 
and directly. The Dean of Guild exercises judicial functions in 
conjunction with a council, consisting of the provost, three mer- 
chant bailies, two members chosen by the incorporated trades in 
their court of convenery, and four members chosen by the Guildry 
Incorporation. There are no dependencies; and there is no delegat- 
ed jurisdiction. The town-clerk acts as assessor, fordoing which 



78

he receives no emolument. There is a Burgh Court held every 
Tuesday, in which one of the bailies presides. Each of them does 
duty for three months. A Guild Court is held regularly on the 
fourth Monday of each month, and occasionally at other times when 
business requires. 

The sheriffship was conferred on the Provost by Robert III. in 
the fourth year of his reign. In this character, as a criminal judge, 
Provost M'Breck acted in 1524. He condemned, by the verdict of 
an assize, John Pearson, to be hanged on the gallows for stealing 
two cows, and John Butcher, for stealing a grey mare taen hand 
havand, and for being an common thief. 

As a royal burgh, Perth had the precedence till Edinburgh was 
made the capital of the ki ngdom. At an early period, Dundee con- 
tended with it for precedence. But the matter was determined by 
a precept under the hand of James VI., dated at Holyrood House 
the penult day of May 1594, in which his Majesty commands that 
the commissioners of the burgh of Perth shall have place next to 
the commissioners of the burgh of Edinburgh. And in the char- 
ter of confirmation of the whole rights and privileges of the burgh, 
it is declared,  our said royal burgh of Perth shall have and enjoy 
perpetually the principality, prerogative, first place, dignity, and or- 
der ; as also, in giving votes and suffrages, shall be preferred before 
our said burgh of Dundee, and the inhabitants, procurators, and 
commissioners thereof ;" ..." and for that cause that they 
altogether cease and leave off, to contend with our said royal burgh 
of Perth, inhabitants, procurators, and commissioners thereof, or to 
do unto them any whatsoever trouble, scaith, or wrong, or to hinder 
or fash them in their lawful commerce." In the rolls of the Scot - 
tish Parliament, the following is the order of the principal burghs, 
Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, Stirling, St Andrews, Aberdeen, Mon- 
trose, Dumbarton, Glasgow. The chief magistrate has the title of 
Lord Provost. His right to it was lately called in question, but it was 
established by the Court of Session on the 12th of March 1836. 

The property of the burgh is large, and greater in proportion 
than that of any other in Scotland. It consists of lands,t houses,

The burah muir was for time immemorial the property of the city, till betwixt 
the year 1800 and 1828, when it was feued out in lots. It was originally in a wild 
uncultivated state. In 1602, the town-council caused it to be ploughed. I he

churches, mills, fishings, harbours, public market, coal and wood 
yards, lime sheds, and a dung depot. The total value of this pro- 
perty, after deducting debts, which amount to L. 28,474, lis. Id. 
and which are in the fair way of being liquidated, is estimated at 
L. 67,510, lis. 10d., and the estimate is under what it should be. 
The total revenue is L. 6300, lis. 9d., and its expenditure 
L. 5169, 4s. The whole of the property and of the revenue is 
let by public roup, and security is taken from the lessee. The 
records kept are — the minutes of council — a register of deeds — a 
register and minute-book of sasines. At the annual election of 
the council, there is a committee appointed for the government of 
the financial concerns of the burgh, composed of men who, by 
reason of their knowledge of commercial dealings, are qualified to 
control financial administration. The magistrates and council 
possess, by charter and usage, the power of imposing certain cus- 
toms, and by statute, the power of levying cess — the customs levi- 
able at the different ports, the flesh-market customs, the meal- 
market dues, the weighhouse dues, the shore dues ; all of these 
duties are applied to the " common good" of the town. These 
facts appear in the Report of the Commission on Municipal Cor- 
porations for 1833. 

The privileged bodies of the burgh consist of two classes, the 
Guildry Corporation, and the Corporation of Trades. 

The Guildry Corporation consist of dealers- who are said to ex- 
ercise certain " sciences." The whole are styled merchant-bur- 
gesses. These sciences are four, — merchants, maltmen, surgeons, 
and dyers. The power of administering their public rights is vested 
in the Guild Court. The Guild Court consist of eleven members. 
The dean, who is the president, the lord provost, the three mer- 
chant bailies ex officio, four guild brethren, elected by the whole 
guildry, and two tradesmen, elected by the Court of Convenery. 
It exercises certain judicial functions and meets regularly on the 

and crafts. By an authorized measurement, it was found to be, in whole, 293 acres. 
In 1-609, it was let for nineteen years, at the rent of 100 merks. Itwas afterwards 
planted with oaks, firs, &amp;c. In 1800, it began to be cleared of the wood, and feued. 
The aggregate amount of grassum prices was L. 4671, 10s. The feu-duties are 
Paid principally in grain, and the aggregate amount is 310£ bolls of wheat, 251 
bolls of barley, and L. 17 in money, giving on an average of seven years an estimated 
income of L. 800, I Is. 6d. 

The town-council were induced, toward the end of the seventeenth century, to 
believe that coal might be found in the muir ; a considerable sum of money was ex- 
pended m the search. It was relinquished as hopeless in 1697, and the apparatus 
sold for 2s. 6d. per stone. 

 The debt of the burgh in 1675 was about 90,000 or 91,000 merks.

fourth Monday of each month ; and occasionally at other times 
when business requires. Independently of its judicial functions, 
its business consists principally in admitting burgesses. The form 
of admission was fixed in 1786.  The fees of admission consist 
of entry money, and of certain small dues, viz. 10 merks as up- 
set, and L. 4 Scots as " foot-ball." The entry money varies ac- 
cording to the ground upon which the application for the right of 
burgess -ship is rested, and likewise according as the applicant 
wishes to be a merchant or trade's burgess. There are three de- 
grees of rates 1. those of sons and sons-in-law ; 2. those of ap- 
prentices ; and 3. those of strangers, applicable to both merchant 
and trade's burgesses. The rate varies according to the age of 
the applicant. A certain portion of the entry money is paid in- 
to the common good, and the remainder to the guildry. The real 
property of the guildry is valued at L. 28,000. Their average 
income was in 1833 stated to be between L. 1300 and L. 1400. 
It has an eleemosynary roll to the extent of L. 800. 

The corporation of trades or "Incorporated Trades," are seven, 
the hammermen, bakers, glovers, wrights, tailors, fleshers, and 
shoemakers. They have a court, termed the Convener Court, com- 
posed of the trade's members of the town-council, and the deacon 
of the weavers. The court has no fund. The Hammermen Cor- 
poration consists of ten sciences, viz. blacksmiths, farriers, gun- 
smiths, watchmakers, saddle, cap, and harness-makers, brass and 
iron-founders, jewellers and goldsmiths, coachmakers, cutlers, 
tinsmiths and plumbers. The Baker Corporation consists of one 
science only ; f the Glover corporation consist of two sciences, 

 In 1608, there was an act as to the admission of guild brethren, that every per. 
son before his entry shall be presented before the conned in his armour 

+ St Obert was the patron saint of this corporation or calling,— whether a real 
or an imaginary being, is uncertain. But believing him to have been a real being, 
thev were accustomed to honour him by holding an annual festival, at which a play 
was performed, known by the name of - Saint Obert's Vhy" On the Uth Decem- 
ber a number of people assembled at even, called - Saint Obert's Eve. They at- 
tired themselves in disguise dresses, and passed through the city piping and dancing, 
and striking drums, and carrying in their hands burning torches, One of the actors 
was clad in a particular kind of coat, which they des.gnated the Devil's Coat, and 
M other rode upon a horse, having on its feet men's shoes. There is no account ex- 
tent of its minute particulars, but, from the manner in which the kirk-sess.on and 
the corporation officials dealt with the performers, it appears to have been idolatrous, 
profane and immoral in its tendency. In December 25, 1581 the Session issued an 
I act against idolatrous and superstitious pastimes, especially against the Sanct 
Obert's play." « In January 7, 1S87-8, the Deacon of the barters of the burgh of

glovers and skinners. The income of this corporation was, in 
1832, L. 1094, 4s. 8|d. It has an eleemcsynary roll to the ex- 
tent of L. 498, 10s. 9d. per annum. It has adopted a scheme for 
giving annuities to superannuated members, and to widows, on the 
principle of a legal right. There is " not a single operative glover 
resident in Perth who is a member of the corporation."  The 
Wright Corporation consists of seven sciences, viz. wrights, barbers, 

craft, ordain that Wil. Thairpe, &amp;c. abide the punishment threatened to them by the 
Dailies and council, and submit themselves in the minister and elders' will i and if 
they or any of the craft shall hereafter be guilty of the like, to lose the liberties of 
the corporation and be banished the toun for ever." This minute was laid before 
tne session, and that court took up the matter as follows : " April 5, lo88. Whilk

vers are not a corporation. They have no right of being represent- 
ed in the council, and do not exercise exclusive privileges. In 1629, 
there was an appointment by the council of a deacon of the wea- 



vers. 



The building in which the town-council have their deliberations 
on the affairs of the city, is at the eastern termination of the High 
Street, in the immediate proximity of the old shore. It was erect- 
ed under the authority of an act of the Privy-council, obtained in 
the year 1696, and comprehended not only the council-room but a 
clerk's chamber, now the chamberlain's office, and a pack weigh 
house. One of the reasons assigned in the application for the act 
was, that the council had to meet in the session-house of the kirk. 
It was built by William Miln, Wright, at Dupplin, and cost 7,500 
merits 

Particular attention was paid to the ornamenting and furnishing 
of the room. A painter was employed to adorn the chimney-piece, 
and « furnish a landscape." Orders were given to provide three 
dozen of « good rushie leather chairs" and a large table, and a 
carpet for it; the carpet to be purchased in Edinburgh, and, if not 
found there, to be purchased in London.

south gavel of the new council-house, and the ruinous tenement 
on the north shore." This was done to complete the western front 
of the building. At this pend or arch the passage boats on the Tay 
were moored. By an act of council they were all ordered to lie 
here during 1 night. 

In 1619, the council appointed their meetings to be on Monday, 
and that, those who should come in later than nine o'clock should 
be fined in 6s, 8d. In the same year they passed " an act prohi- 
biting persons speaking in the council without leave, and that the 
offenders should be fined 2s. for each offence." 

In no burgh of Scotland are the honour, the respectability, and 
the general good of the community consulted with more judg- 
ment and fidelity than in Perth. In confirmation of what I say I 
refer to the contents of the printed " Local Report from Commis- 
sioners on the Municipal Corporations of Scotland." There, there 
is given a state of the city affairs, full and distinct, which reflects 
much credit on its functionaries. 

The office of magistrates, in large towns, is generally difficult 
and laborious, however otherwise it may appear to the many, whose 
knowledge of it is general and superficial. They act without fee 
or reward ; and it frequently happens that, the more vigilant and 
faithful and impartial they are, the more reviling treatment they 
meet with from a multitude of the baser sort of people. Their 
gratuitous services insure to them no return of gratitude. It is 
matter of surprise, therefore, that persons of suitable respectabili- 
ty should be found to fill the office of the magistracy, and parti- 
cularly at the present time, when there is abroad so much of the 
spirit of insubordination, and of a desire among the lowest and most 
uneducated to have the supremacy in every department, both legis- 
lative and executive. Our forefathers knew how much extrinsic 
circumstances, even those that are of no essential importance, in- 
fluence the minds of the mass of the people. They therefore as- 
signed to their rulers certain distinctive insignia of office, from the 
King downwards ; and the practical result has been highly bene- 
ficial. He must be under the influence of the wildest and most in- 
veterate levelling republicanism who will not acknowledge this. It is 
to be lamented, therefore, that among persons, from whose judg- 
ment in other matters, sounder notions might be expected, there 
hould be attempts made to throw ridicule on these insignia. To 
- man of mere empty theory, the disparagement of these has the

appearance of wisdom, but to those who know how to control the pas- 
sions and prejudices of man, it has the reverse. In some of our burghs, 
there has, for some years past, appeared a disposition to diminish 
or abstract altogether the badges of magisterial office, on the ground 
of their serving no purpose but that of ostentatious parade. 1 he 
proper dignity of our municipal officers maybe lowered, but cannot 
be raisedby such a paltrv and impolitic mode of proceeding. The 
magistrates of Perth, in olden times, consulted what was becom- 
ing their rank, and how they should appear before the public 
eye, as the rulers of the City. Thus, in 1688, they were among the 
nobility and other attendants on the.funeral of Lord Strathallan, 
and it stands on record that they appeared there attended by their 

trumpeter. _ . 

It may not be out of place here to mention, that in the list ot 
chief magistrates, there appear the names not only of the princi- 
pal burgesses, but of the most distinguished noblemen and gentle- 
men of the neighbourhood, some of whom had residences in the 
town. I may mention the following : the Earl of Gowne, the Earl 
of Montrose, the Earl of Athole, Lord Ruthven, Viscount Stor- 
mont, Sir Patrick Tbriepland of Fingask, Sir William Murray 
of Tullibardin, Thomas Chartres, a descendant of Thomas a 
Loncrueville, who came from France with Wallace, ancestor of the 
KinFauns family. His famed two-handed sword is preserved to the 
present day in Kinfauns Castle. 

Before the passing of the Reform Bill, the burgh was one of 
four Perth, Dundee, Cupar, Forfar, St Andrews, which sent a 
representative to Parliament. The inhabitants had no voice in the 
matter. The council appointed a delegate, who, with the dele-

gates appointed by the other burghs, made choice of the represen- 
tative, the delegates acting of course in conformity with the in- 
structions of their constituents. By the Reform Bill the burgh is 
entitled to choose a representative for itself. He is chosen not by 
the council, but by the whole population, within what is called the 
Parliamentary bounds, who hold or rent a property of the value of 
L. 10 yearly. These bounds, as defined by the bill, are, " from 
the north-western corner of the North Inch, on the right bank of 
the river Tay, in a straight line to the bridge on the mill-lead at 
the boot of Balhousie ; thence in a straight line to the bridge in 
the Glasgow road over the Scouring Burn ; thence in a straight line 
to the southern corner of the water reservoir of the depot ; thence 
in a straight line to the southern corner of the Friartoun pier in 
the river Tay, passing to the south of the Friartoun Island, to 
the point at which the same is met by the boundary of the respec- 
tive properties of Kinfauns, Kinnoul, and Barnhill meet ; thence 
in a straight line to the north and eastern corner of Lord Kinnoul's 
lodge, at the gate of approach to Kinnoul Hill ; thence in a straight 
line to the north-eastern corner of the inclosure of the Lunatic Asy- 
lum ; thence in- a straight line to the point at which the Annaty 
burn crosses the Blairgowrie road ; thence down the Annaty burn

straight line to the point first described." 

Laurence Oliphant, Esq. of Condie, was the first whom the burgh 
constituency elected to represent them in Parliament. The election 
was on the 27th day of December 1832. He was elected a se- 
cond time in 1834.

of any respectability frequent it. Prices of admission have been lately lowered, not to 
the improvement of the morals of the place, for that has brought to it the lowest and the 
most questionable characters of society. A correspondent of the Perth Constitutional 
Newspaper, Dec. 21, 1836, identifies the multitude of its frequenters with the baser 
sort wh squander their means in tippling-houses.

well is constructed in the Moncrieff Island, into which the water of 
the Tay finds its way through a natural bank of sand and gravel. 
From this well it is conveyed in a pipe under the bed of the river, 
to another under the great reservoir, which is 55 feet high. It is 
raised into this reservoir by steam engine power, and from thence 
it is conducted in pipes through the streets. It is at the option of 
the inhabitants to take it into their dwellings. The establishment 
was got up under the authority of an act of Parliament, and the 
expense defrayed by a legal assessment on the real rent of occu- 
pied houses. The assessment cannot be more than five per cent.

III. — Population. 
In the year 1562 the population is said to have been 6075, 
but the correctness of this cannot be relied on. As reported to 
Dr Webster, when he drew up the widows' scheme in 1755, it was 
9019; in 1801, it was 14,878; in 1811, it was 17,248; in 1821, 
it was 19,068; in 1831, it was 20,016. The population of the 
parish has been of late on the increase, but no remarkable circum- 
stance has occurred to which this may be ascribed. There are 
three villages in the parish. — Tulloch, containing 193 inhabitants ; 
Craigie, containing 250 ; and Pittheaveless and Cherry Bank, con- 
taining 114. The yearly average of births for the last seven years 
is 502 f :' the yearly average of deaths for the last seven years is 
603 ;f and the yearly average of marriages for the last seven 
years is 164f. 

 This is the average number of the births that were reported to the session-clerk, 
and by him enrolled in the baptism register. There were 242 children who, during 
this period, died unbaptued, and were not reported to the clerk. Besides, there were 
several parents who, from various motives, declined to register their children's names. 
It is from the register only that information on the point can be derived. No satisfac- 
tory conclusion, therefore, can be drawn from what is here afforded. 

f The number of persons reported to the keeper of the burying-ground at their 
interment, as having died of Asiatic cholera in 1832, was as follows: — in the month

There are no resident nobility in the parish, and, with respect 
to families or individuals of private fortune residing in it, I have 
not the means of ascertaining with accuracy their number. Of 
proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, there 
are not more in number than 10. In 1831, the number of inha- 
bited houses was 2049; of uninhabited houses, 182; of houses 
building, 11 ; of families, 4956. The average number in each fa- 
mily may be 4 nearly. The people are not remarkable for either 
strength, or size, or complexion, or any other personal qualities. 
The number of insane and fatuous people is 40 ; of blind, 7 ; of 
deaf and dumb, 12. 

Language, c. of the People.— The language generally spoken 
is English. There are some Highlanders in the parish who can- 
not speak any language but the Gaelic, and there is a considerable 
number who can speak Gaelic and English with equal facility. 
There are no popular customs, games, and amusements in the 
parish that are peculiar to this part of the country. The habits

" The games which at present are most common are, foot-ball, casting quoits, crick- 
et, and golf. Within these few years, a number of gentlemen have formed them- 
selves into a society under the designation of " the Royal Perth Golfing Society." 
The golf and foot-ball were, in ancient times, favourite games in Scotland, but the 
Government, in the reigns of the James's, consulting more the security of the realm 
than the amusement of the lieges, discouraged these games, and, by legislative enact- 
ments, encouraged the more athletic and warlike exercises of weaponshawing and of 
archery. It was enacted in the reign of James I. that weaponshaws be made in 
ilk shire, and sicklike in burroughs : — In the reign of James II., that the foot-ball and 
golf be cried down, and bow marks erected in each parish : — In the reign of James 
III., that sheriffs and bailies of regalities hold weaponshawing, and amerciat them 
that are absent or not well abuilzied: — In the reign of James IV.. that neither foot, 
ball nor golf, nor unprofitable sport for the defence of the realm be used : — In the 
reign of James V., that weaponshawing be made twice in the year 4 in the months 
of June and October, at days and places as shall please the sheriff, and bailies, and 
burgesses of the land. The harness of the weaponshaw was as follows : — " For every 
nobleman, sic as earle, lorde, knicht, and baroune, and everie greate landed man, 
havend ane hundredth pounde of zerlie rent, bee an armed in quhite harnesse, licht 
or heavie, as the please, and weaponed efFeir, and to his honor. And that all uthers 
of lower rent and degree in the low-land, have jacks of plaite, halksikes or brigitanes, 
gorget or pesane, with splents pause of mailzie, with gloves of plate or mailzie ; that 
gentlemen, unlanded and zeamen, have jacks of plate, halksikes, splents, salcate or 
steil bonet, with pesane or gorget, and everie with sworde ; — and na maner of wea- 
pon be admitted in weaponshawing, bot speares, pikes stacke and lang, of six elnes 
of length, Lcith exes, halbardes, hand bowes and arrowes, crose bowes, culverings, twa- 
handed swordes, and every man to be an armed as said is, under the peine of five 
pounde to be tane of everie landed man, fiftie shillings of everie gentleman, and twen- 
tie shillings of everie zeaman, alsaft as they be founden faltous in the premisses." 

A damson, in his Muses Threnodie, laments that in his day archery was neglected 
in Perth. Mr Cant, in his notes on the Muses, comments on the lamentation in the 
following terms : — " Archery, of which the gentlemen of Perth were great masters, 
was made an indispensable part of education from the days cf James I. This most 
accomplished and wise prince passed an act forbidding the favourite diversion of 
foot-ball, substituting in its place that of shooting with bows and arrows. Every

of the people do not in any respect differ from those of the inha- 
bitants of the country generally. Their style and manner of dress 

boy, when he came to the age of thirteen, was obliged at stated times to practise archery 
at certain bow marks. There is a piece of ground without the north port, on the 
left hand of the road leading to Hunting Tower, called the Bow Butt, where this exer- 
cise was practised, but the strong and expert archers had their bow marks on the 
South Inch. Near the south end of this Inch stands yet a stone which tradition says 
was the southern mark. The northern is near to the north-west side of the ditch that 
surrounds the mound, Cromwell's citadel. It was fixed on a rising ground called 
the " Scholars Knoul." The stone was but lately carried off. The distance between 
these marks is about five hundred fathoms. They must have been very strong and ex- 
pert archers who could shoot an arrow betwixt these marks. 

From the city records, it appears that the weaponshaw was from an early period 
observed in Perth according to statute. The magistrates, by beat of drum and pro- 
clamation, called out the weaponshawers to exercise on the North Inch at the fixed 
periods, and sometimes oftener. They appointed them a captain and other officers ; 
they gave them an ensign, which was called the lianzgenzicr, and the bearer was de- 
signated the hanzgenzier bearer. At particular times, the flag, having upon it the 
holy lamb en passant carrying the banner of St Andrew, was produced. Absentees 
were fined in 40 shillings each. In 1604, a " Mr Brown, surgeon, and deacon of 
the wrights, produced a letter of exemption under the privy seal, dated 2d February 
lo;7, of divers contents, whereupon the council granted him exemption from all as- 
sizes, and weaponshawings, and others, during his lite." 

There is on record an account of a weaponshawing on the North Inch, 27th July 
1614 — " The performers were assembled by beat of drum ; Alexander Peebles was 
nominated ' hanzsengier bearer.' Persons were appointed to be ' gydaris. and setting 
the pepill rank for ordour, and disobediencents to be warded,' imprisoned. The 
seven officers town sergeants got for the occasion a stand of new red Fleming. 
 Patrick Bresone is ordained to deliver and lay the pledges, whilk ar in his handis, 
of the browsteris, in gardie for officeris clathis to this weaponshawing." A riot took 
place, occasioned by the disorderly conduct of some of the skinnermen and hammer- 
men crafts. The Lord Scone, who was Provost of the burgh, was sent for to ' take 
ordour with the riot.' An investigation took place ; the rioters were required to ap- 
pear next day, and say whether they would refer themselves to the town-council or 
the secret council. The deacons obliged their craft to abide by the decision of the 
town-council. The skinner rioters were fined in 500 merks, to be laid out on the 
east pillar of the bridge, and they paid the penalty. It does not appear what judg- 
ment was passed on the hammermen rioters. 

After the year 1620, there is no account of weaponshawing in Perth. 

Horse racing appears to have existed in Perth from an early period. The place 
appropriated to it was the South Inch ; the course was marked by six stakes. The 
first account which I find of a prize having been run for is in 1613 ; it was a silver 
bell, presented by Ninian Graham of Garvock, in name of John Graham of Bogside. 
In 1631, there were three prize silver bells, but they were declared to be unsuitable, 
and a cup was substituted in their place, which it appears weighed no more than eight 
ounces. The race on that year was run on the day after Palm Sunday, and the prize 
was awarded to Thomas Tyrie of Drumkilbo ; his horse was called Kildair. The 
Palm Sunday race in 1633 was for a piece of plate, value L. 40. In 1637, the cup 
was won by Francis Story, servant to Lord Fenton. Till 1688 the race was called 
" the bell race." By authority of the magistrates it was thereafter called, " race for 
a cup and other prizes." 

The course was transferred from the South to the North Inch many years ago. 
being in several important respects preferable. By an excambion which the town 
effected with the Earl of Kinnoul in 178o, the Inch has been very much enlarged ; 
the course is 2220 yards. For fleet horses it is unrivalled, as throughout the plain 
there is not a single rising ; it is almost a dead level. It may be proper to mention, 
that, before the excambion took place, the course was nearly the same as at present, 
the Earl permitting it to go through his park, and the division wall to be for the 
time taken down. 

 There is an act of the town-council in 1624, " as to children going about weekly 
with their bows and arrows, as ue and wont."

have no peculiarity, as their intercourse with all quarters of the 
kingdom is free and frequent. Their habits are in general cleanly, 
and increasingly so. In the city, in which the poor of the parish 
principally reside, there are places where there is certainly a want 
of cleanliness, arising' in some families from the inadequate means 
of support, and in others from the profligacy, or want of domestic 
economy on the part of the parents. I unhesitatingly ascribe much 
of the squalid poverty that is found in many of the dwellings of the 
labouring classes of the community, to the number and proximity 
of low tippling-houses. These houses have, in many instances, 
proved a most melancholy source of evil to the families of the poor. 
It is scarcely to be expected that much attention to domestic comfort 
can prevail where dissipation and poverty are combined ; but among 
the sober and industrious operatives, even where the wages are very 
limited, there is a marked disposition to habits of cleanliness. The 
truth was lately shewn, when, upon the cholera making its appear- 
ance in the country, a strict scrutiny was instituted into the state 
of every quarter of the parish. A want of cleanliness was dis- 
covered in a few districts, but the utmost readiness was shewn by 
the people to remedy the evil. On the whole, the people enjoy 
the comforts and advantages of society, and are contented with 
their situation. There are, as in all such population, some who are 
discontented with their allotment in society, and are easily moved 
to take a violent part in the political questions of the day, and 
follow the standard of the turbulent agitator. The press is teeming 
with periodicals that are violent on both sides of every matter, 
bearing on the interests of the country, and such productions an 
ignorant and credulous multitude generally prefer to those that are 
moderate and dispassionate ; and thus it happens that our politi- 
cally disposed operatives are particularly violent in their attach- 
ments and animosities. Were there fewer inflammatory newspapers 
brought into active circulation among them, they would be a much 
more sober, prosperous, and happy portion of the community. 

With respect to the general " character of the people, intellec- 
tual, moral, and religious," I am disposed to speak in commen- 
datory terms. The reading portion of them is considerable, and 
they have easy access to various libraries containing useful and 
practical treatises. When we speak of the morality of a place, it 
is always comparative, and I know of no town of the same size in 
which there is more attention paid to moral duty. If, on the one 
hand, it cannot be denied that immoral characters have become 



90 PERTHSHIRE. 

more openly daring, it will not be denied, on the other, that moral 
characters have stood forward more openly and avowedly. The 
religious character of the people may, in some measure, be inferred 
from the fact that, exclusive of a Roman Catholic chapel, there are 
nineteen places of public worship in the parish to a population of 
'20,016. I am not aware of how the matter stands with respect to 
the other places of worship in the parish ; but this I know, that 
there is this year, in the establishment churches, a greater num- 
ber of sittings taken than there was in any preceding year. 

There are persons among us who openly profess infidel prin- 
ciples, and some, also, who openly disregard all religious ordinances, 
and, what in this country is uniformly symptomatic of an abandon- 
ment of all feeling of religious propriety, tbere are some tradesmen 
who walk abroad on the Lord's day in their ordinary working 
habiliments, as if to show a marked contempt of what the com- 
munity in general hold to be sacred. With the exception of these 
characters, who are generally held in the lowest estimation by their 
fellow townsmen, the inhabitants of the parish are entitled to the 
appellation of a moral and religious people. 

There is no " poaching in game or the salmon- fisheries." Smug- 
gling some years ago prevailed to a great extent, but it has now very 
much decreased— whisky being obtained from legal distilleries of 
a superior quality, and at as low a price as it can be obtained from 
smugglers. Pawnbroking is carried on to a very small extent. 
There are several brokers; almost all of them are of the lowest 
order of Irish Roman Catholics. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The number of acres in the parish of Perth, either 
cultivated or occasionally in tillage, is 2606, standard imperial 
measure, or about -2032, Scotch. It has been all, at one time or ano- 
ther, cultivated. The two Inches have for a very long period been 
in pasture. There is no undivided common. There are about 
750 acres of wood ; all planted. The kinds are almost entirely 
Scotch pine and larch. The management is good. 

The average rent of arable land is L. 3, 12s. 5d. per acre. Some 
fields are so high as L. 5 per acre. There are no lands let for 
grazing except the Inches. The lessee is bound by his tack, which 
is front year to year, not to charge more than L. 2, 2s. for each 
cow. Many, however, are admitted for less than that sum. Sheep 
are not pastured on it for the year. That was prohibited in 1697, 
and the prohibition has continued in force ever since. The lessee 



PERTH. 



91 



is permitted to put sheep upon them, only after St John's market, 
which is held on the first Friday of September. 

The wage of a common farm-servant for the year is about 6 
bolls of oat-meal, and a Scotch pint of sweet milk per day, and 
lodging. The wages of artisans, such as wrights and masons, are, 
besides victuals, about 2s. per day in the summer season, and Is. 
8d. in the winter. 

The price of butter is from 7d. to lOd. per pound; of eggs from 
6d. to 9d. per dozen. Very little cheese is made. The price of 
common carts, including wheels and axles, is about L. 10, 10s. each; 
of corn carts without wheels and axles, L. 3, 10s.; of ploughs iron 
L. 3, 10s.; of harrows, L. 1, 8s. ; a thrashing mill of six horse pow- 
er costs about L. 100. 

Little live-stock is reared, as, from the land lying so very conti- 
guous to the city, greater profit arises from the production of corns. 
The stock that is reared consists principally of the Angus breed. 
Short-horned cattle have been of late introduced and successfully. 
No sheep are bred in the parish. 

With respect to the character of the husbandry pursued, it may 
suffice to remark, that the general practice is to take a white and 
green crop alternately. On dry lands, the green crops consist of 
potatoes, turnips, and grass. On strong land, the six course shift 
is followed; 1. fallow ; 2. wheat; 3. beans; 4. barley; 5. grass; 
6. oats or wheat. The farmers are judicious, enterprising, and sub- 
stantial. 

Draining has been carried on to a considerable extent. There 
is much strong land. A considerable portion of it has been fur- 
row drained, and much improved thereby. There are no meadows, 
and there is of course no irrigation. The fields lying close upon 
the Tay have been embanked and secured from the general floods. 

The duration of leases varies from fifteen to twenty-oneyears. As the 
prices of grain have for some years past been falling, the length 
of leases has been unfavourable to the occupiers, in so far as rents 
are paid in money. Most of the rents, however, are now paid, half 
in money and half in grain. 

On the estate of MoncriefF, the rents have been converted en- 
tirely into grain, on terms which were satisfactory both to the land- 
lord and the tenant. In such cases the occupier is of course less 
affected by the length of his lease. 

The farm-buildings are generally good. They have been al- 
most ali of them erected within the last thirty years. There are 



92 



PERTHSHIRE. 



no enclosures in the parish, with the exception of a few in the high 
grounds of upper Friartoun ; their fences are of stone. All the 
dry lands would be greatly improved by enclosures. 

There has been little recent alteration in the mode of farming, 
except in the" increased culture of potatoes, since the London mar- 
ket for that article was opened about seventeen years ago. From 
the proximity of the city, manure can, in abundance and without 
difficulty, be procured, either from the city itself or from London 
by sea/ But it may well be doubted whether the land can bear 
such severe cropping. 

With regard to " the obstacles to improvement," that which 
seems to be most felt, and which is most complained of, is the want 
of enclosures, and consequently of pasturage, in the dry lands. The 
property is almost all entailed, which may be a reason why the ex- 
pense of enclosing is not incurred. The enclosing of the fields 
which are on the highways is obviously of very great importance 
to the farmer, as his crops are never safe without it. But, for some 
cause or other, various high-rented fields are altogether unprotect- 
ed from high-way encroachment. Tenants having only a tempo- 
rary interest in the soil cannot be expected to incur the expense 
of rearing up permanent fences. They entered on their leases with 
sufficient capital for the undertaking ; but that capital has, in some 
cases, been diminished under a management equally prudent and 
vigorous— the prices being lower than they were contemplated to 
be, when the leases were entered on. Thus, the tenant has no 
inducement to lay out on his farm more of his means than what 
is absolutely necessary to the production of such returns as will 
enable him to live, and pay the proprietor. " The covenants of leases" 
are generally fair, and present no obstacle to improvement, the 
want of enclosures, or a provision for making them always excepted. 

Quarries and Mines. — There are no mines in the parish. There 
is one freestone quarry, which appears to have been wrought at 
some remote period to a considerable extent, but the stone is so 
exceedingly soft that the houses in the city, which have been built 
from it, have become very much decayed ; it has, therefore, been 
entirely deserted. There is in the parish an excellent trapstone 
quarry, from which a great quantity of road-metal has been 
recently taken. It lies about a mile and a half on the road to 
Edinburgh. 

Fisheries. The only fisheries in the parish are salmon fisheries. 

The rents of these are at present about L. 1350 per annum. The 



PERTH. 



93 



principal ones belonging to the city are on small islands a short 
way down the river. The whole belonging to the city are let for 
about L. 830. Last lease, they were let for L. 1300; ten years ago 
the rent was L. 1500. All the fish taken in the river above New- 
burgh are shipped from Perth by lighters for the Dundee steam 
ships, in which they are conveyed to London. The number 
shipped in 1835 was above 25,000 salmon and 50,000 grilses, 
making 5000 boxes, or 250 tons of fish. The yearly average of 
ten years, however, might be only about 4500 boxes, or 225 tons. 
The rental of the whole fishings of the district will rate between 
L.8000 and L. 10,000, and employ upwards of 450 men. 

Previous to 1828, the close-time commenced on the 26th of 
August, and ended 10th December. It was then altered by act of 
Parliament, and commenced 14th September, and ended the 1st 
of February. But it has been found that the 14th of Septem- 
ber is too late for shutting, as many of the fish far advanced to- 
wards spawning are killed between the 26th of August and 14th 
of September; and, on the whole, the prolongation of the time has 
been of very little benefit to those interested in the matter, while 
a great many fish that ought to have been left to stock the river 
are destroyed. 

A bill has now been introduced into Parliament to fix the close 
time for the Tay, from about the 25th of August to the middle of 
January, which has the approbation of all concerned in the Tay fish- 
' ings. The act of 1828 was, however, productive of several good 
effects, especially in affording greater facilities to the punishment 
of poachers, and the protection of spawning fish, so that there is 
reason to believe that not one is now killed in close-time, for twenty 
previous to the passing of that act. Owing to the above and other 
causes, grilses have increased very much of late years, — the num- 
ber taken being fully sevenfold to what it was forty years ago. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, may be stated as 
follows : — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man or the domestic 
animals, namely, wheat, pats, barley, pease, beans, about 5,604 imperial quarters, 
which, at an average of the fiars prices for the last threj years, amounts to 
about ... L. 8778 0 0 

Ditto of potatoes from about 189 acres, at L. 10, 10s. per acre, or 

1421 tons at L. I, 8s. per ton, . . . 1984 10 0 

Ditto from 90 acres of turnips, at L. 8 per acre, or 3600 tons, at 4s. per 

ton, . . . 720 0 0 

One-half of the turnips require to be consumed on the farm. 

Grots produce of hay, 44210 stones at 6d. per stone. . 1105 5 0

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, L. 14,687 15 0 

Manufactures. — The manufactures of Perth consist principally 
of cotton-coloured goods, of which umbrella cloth is the staple. 
A great quantity of handkerchiefs, checked and striped ginghams, 
imitation Indian shawls, scarfs, trimmings, &amp;c. are also woven. 

The number of weavers is about 1600, some of whom are em- 
ployed by manufacturers in Glasgow and Paisley. But a consi- 
derable number are employed by manufacturers in Perth, Scone, 
Methven, and Milnathort. 

Most of the umbrella cloths are sent to London, Manchester, 
and other towns in England and in Scotland. But the other goods 
are generally exported to North and South America, the East 
and West Indies. Many of the shawl pieces are for the Turkey 
market. 

There has lately been erected a mill for spinning flax and tow 
yarns, containing 850 spindles. The number of hands employed in 
it are, one manager and four foremen; 18 boys from twelve to fifteen 
years old ; 47 girls from twelve to fifteen years old ; 1 7 girls 
from fifteen to twenty years old ; 16 women twen y years old and 
upwards ; in all 103. The working hours are sixty-nine in the 
week, being twelve each day excepting Saturday, on which there are 
nine only. There is only one set of workers ; but if the arrange- 
ments contemplated are completed, there will be two sets, working 
eight hours each day, or forty-eight hours in the week. There is 
preparation making for additional 400 spindles. 

Tulloch, which lies about two miles to the west of the city, is 
memorable from its having been the first bleachfield established 
in Scotland. It was established about the commencement of the 
eighteenth century, by a gentleman from Ireland, of the name of 
Christie. The present proprietor of Tulloch is Hector Sandeman, 
Esq., who, with great integrity and enterprise, carries on an ex- 
tensive bleaching and printing-work. The number of hands em- 
ployed is 250. He has erected an apparatus for the produc- 
tion of pyrolignous acid, which is used in his works as a solvent for 
various metals and minerals. The charcoal is disposed of to foun- 



PKKTH.

tiers and dyers, and to private families for culinary purposes. It 
may here be mentioned, that the first potatoes produced in Scot- 
land were at this place, from seed brought over by Mr Christie 
from Ireland. 

There are three iron founderies of considerable extent. Their 
work in cast-iron machinery and blacksmith's articles is well exe- 
cuted, and has an extensive sale. 

Navigation. — The direct importation from foreign parts into 
Perth for the year 1835, consisted chiefly of Baltic produce, and 
of the following articles : cheese, 840 cwt. ; clover seed, 780 cwt. ; 
foreign spirits, 120 gal.; flax, 2000 cwt.; lintseed, 50 quarters the 
importations of this article generally consist of from 600 to 800 
quarters yearly; and a considerable quantity of timber, — pine, Nor- 
way, Baltic, and American, the whole imported in twenty-two ves- 
sels, the sales whereon were L. 5191. Besides the above, there 
were corns, bark, hides, smalt, madder, tar, &amp;c. Importations of 
bones and annualized carbon, to a considerable extent, have taken 
place, not only from the continent, but coastways, which have been 
found the bones being ground to be very beneficial in raising 
turnips. 

The articles imported coastways are, coal, lime, salt, manure, 
&amp;c. The quantity of coals in 1835 was, from England, about 
22,000 tons; and from Scotland, about 11,500 tons. The value 
about L. 28,500. 

The exports to foreign parts were trifling. Indeed, from the con- 
tiguity of the great shipping port of Dundee, a great many articles 
were sent thither in lighters for exportation, and a number of car- 
goes, ostensibly for Perth and its county, were entered inwards 
there from the continent, and transhipped into lighters hither. But 
the quantity of potatoes shipped from Perth for the London mar- 
ket during the last year was 27,1 14 tons, or 108,456 Scotch bolls. 
The value in Perth about L. 65,000; and the value in London, 
which includes freight, &amp;c. about L. 101.000. The other exports 
consisted of corns of all kinds, about 40,000 quarters, and a con- 
siderable quantity of timb r, s ; tes, &amp;c. 

The number of vessels belonging to Perth is 78,-5467 tons. 

The number of coasting-vessels which entered the port last year 
was 736,— about 40,000 tons. 

The only navigable river connected with the parish is the Tay. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Town.— Perth is a market-town, and the only one in the 



96 



PERTHSHIRE. 



parish. Its population, as I have already stated, was, at the last 
census 1831, 20,016. 

It was in early times a place of great trade. In Camden's 
Britannia, the following distich is quoted from an English writer, 
Alexander Necham, who was Abbot of Exeter in 1215, and died 
in 1227. 

" Transis, ample Tai, per rura per oppida, per Perth 

Regnum sustentant illius urbis opes." 
" Great Tay, thou passest on through fields, through towns, through Perth. 

The wealth of that city supports the kingdom." 

An extensive commerce was carried on during many ages between 
Perth and the Netherlands. The merchants of Perth visited in 
their own ships the Hans towns. The German merchants, very 
early, frequented the port of Perth, and not a few industrious Ger- 
mans, who wrought in the woollen and linen manufactories, and in 
staining cloth, seem to have fixed their abode at Perth, and to have 
been received as burgesses. But William the Lion, following the 
example of his grandfather, King David, put the foreign merchants 
under a great restriction when they came to Perth with their goods. 
In a charter which he gave to the town 1210, and as a further dis- 
couragement to these merchants, he granted to his burgesses in 
Perth, in that same charter, " that they might have their own mer-

It does not appear that Perth has, since then, been distinguish- 
ed as a place of trade. About fifty years ago, several enterprising 
individuals directed their attention to the manufacturing of cotton 
goods, — there being a demand for them in the market to a very en- 
couraging extent This gave employment to weavers. The num- 
ber of these rapidly increased, as high wages were held out to the 
people who would engage in the trade, and as proficiency in it was 
very soon and very easily acquired. Besides capitalists in Perth, 
there were others in Glasgow who had agents here, employing 
weavers. But, owing to adverse circumstances and events, some ca- 
pitalists failed, and others were necessitated to restrict their opera- 
tions. The number of operatives thereupon diminished. Wages fell 
very low, and no small distress ensued. There can be no doubt of 
the fact, that the temporary prosperity of this branch of trade was 
chiefly owing to the too adventurous spirit of speculating indivi- 
duals. Though it cannot be said to have yet revived, there are 
gentlemen among us, who, by sound and spirited application of skill 
and capital, are employing a considerable body of operatives. 
At the period now referred to, and for long before, the glove

• trade of Perth was prosperous. Perth-made gloves had a prefe- 
rence throughout the kingdom. One tradesman had seventeen men 
employed in cutting out work for his sewers. The quantity yearly 
manufactured for home consumption was between 2000 and 3000 
pairs. But the trade is now almost entirely gone, the sale of the 
article being in the hands of haberdashers and cloth-merchants, who 
obtain it from various quarters in England and Scotland. The con- 
sequence of this has been the falling off of another branch of trade, 
that of skinners, which, not many years ago, was very prosperous, and 
which, in ancient times, occupied such a numerous body of the in- 
habitants, that the main street from the north, being chiefly occu- 
pied by them, was named Skinner Street. About the year 1795, 
the number of sheep, and lamb skins prepared and dressed was 
30,000. The trade is now limited to two or three individuals. The 
number of these skins, prepared and dressed by them, is about 
27,000. 

Perth was, forty years ago, the only town in Scotland, with the 
exception of Edinburgh, and perhaps Glasgow, in which book- 
printing was carried on to any extent. The Messrs Morison, who 
were distinguished for intellectual endowment and literary attain- 
ment, vigorously applied themselves to this branch of trade. They 
printed, Mr Scott informs us in his Statistical Account of Perth, 
between twenty and thirty thousand volumes annually. Since their 
time the trade has been more generally diffused over the kingdom, 
and in many other provincial towns it is prosecuted with consider- 
able spirit. Of course it is not now in Perth what it formerly was. 

Villages.— The villages in the parish are, as I have already 
stated, Tulloch, containing 193 inhabitants; Pitheaveless and 
Cherry-bank, containing 1 14 inhabitants  Upper and Lower Crai- 
gie, containing 250 inhabitants. There was at one time a con- 
siderable village at South Muirtown, but it is now removed. 

Means of Communication.— Perth is a post-town. The net re- 
venue of the office is about L. 4000. The mail from Edinburgh 
arrives at 9 p. m. on its way to the north, to Dundee, Aberdeen, 
Inverness. The mail to Edinburgh is dispatched at 1 a. m. 

The Glasgow mail arrives at half-past 8 p. M., and is dispatch- 
ed at 1 a. m. The mail from Aberdeen and Dundee arrives at 
10 minutes before 1 a. m., and from Inverness at 11 p. m. 

The turnpike roads in the parish, from south to north, are about 
four miles and a half, and from east to west about two miles. 
The roads diverge from the city as a centre,— one to Edinburgh]

on the south; two to Glasgow, on the west; and one to Dunkeld, 
Inverness, &amp;c on the north ; one to Aberdeen on the north-east 
They are not now as they were formerly, ill made and il kept. 
Thev are made and kept in repair entirely upon Mr M'Adam s 
judicious system, to the incalculable benefit and comfort of the tra, 
Veller. On all these roads, four-horse coaches run daily. 

The Bridge of Perth is the only one in the parish that merits 
particular notice. It was founded in the year 1766, and finished 
in 1771. It is simple and elegant. It has nine arches. Its 
length is 880 feet, and its breadth 18 feet of carriage way, and 4 
feet of foot pavement, in all 22 feet between the parapets. It has 
beenrepeatedly proposed to make it wider ; and some advanceshave 
been made with that view. But the parties immediately inte- 
rested have not as yet agreed as to the way of carrying the pro- 
posal into effect. To the spirited and patriotic exertions of the 
late Right Honourable Thomas Earl of Kinnoul, the county are 
indebted for this important building. 

In the traditional account of the origin of Perth, given by Mi 
Henry Adamson in his Muses Threnodie, it is said that Agricola 
having fortified the town with walls and a strong castle, did also, 
with much labour to his soldiers, and probably to the poor natives, 
also construct a large wooden bridge over the river at Perth. 1 his 
may be true ; but he produces no fact to give probability to the tra- 
dition. Among the records belonging to the Abbacy of Scone, 
there is, as I have already stated, an order from King Robert Bruce 
139, to the abbot and monks, to allow the magistrates of Perth 
liberty to take stones out of the quarries of Kincarrathie or Bal- 
cormac, for building the Bridge of Tay, the Bridge of Earn, and 
the church. A citizen of Perth, of the name of Dundee, has re- 
corded several events, with their dates, in a miscellaneous manu- 
script of which Mr Adamson was in possession when he wrote the 
Muse's Threnodie. The manuscript was commenced in 1570, and was 
continued by his son till 1636. In contains, inter alia  notice of 
« the falling down of the three bowis of the Brig of Tay be the 
greet watter, and of Lewis Vaiter, on the 20 day of Dec m anno 
1 73 »—« The downe falling of five bowis of the Brig of 1 ay on 
the 14 day of Janewir in anno 1582 yeiris."_« The downe falling 
of the bra trein pillaris of the Brig of Tay on the 29 day of De- 
cember in anno 1589 zeiris." This must have been the  bridge 
that was built in 1329; and the substantial correctness of Mr Dun- 
dee's notice is established by the contents of a decreet of the Lords 



PERTH.

of Council in 1586, in causa, the magistrates of Dundee versus the 
magistrates of Perth, in which the latter plead, why they should 
not pay certain duties claimed for repairing the shore and bulwark 
of Dundee, that their need was equally great " of sic exactions to 
support the common weil of thair awin burgh, mair requisit to be 
bott and helpit, nor the said shore and havin of Dundee, speciallie 
the brig haiffing twyst fallin doun and decayit, and laitlie being 
erectit of tymmer, is readdy to fall without present help," &amp;c. 
From this time till 1617, the bridge was under repair, and a con- 
siderable portion of it built anew. Among the records of the House 
of Pittheaveless, there is an order from the King and secret coun- 
cil, 7th February 1599, for allowing the magistrates of Perth to 
take stones out of the quarry of Pittheaveless for repairingthe Bridge 
of Tay, on payment of fifty merks yearly, until it be finished. The 
progress of the work, the obstructions which occurred, and the 
means resorted to for obtaining the necessary funds, are entered 
faithfully and fully in the city records. In 1617 it appears to have 
been finished, as in that year 3000 merks were paid as the price of 
the last arch. 

The high national importance attached at that time to this 
bridge, appears from the charter which James gave, during its re- 
pair, to the town, confirming their whole rights and privileges, dat- 
ed at Holyroocl, 15th November 1600. In it he designates the 
bridge " a most precious jewil of our kingdom, and a work pro- 
fitable and primely necessary to our whole kingdom and dominion, 
and for the suppression of rebels and such as are viciously affected, 
most commodious; and also keeping the one-half of the kingdom, 
with the other half thereof in faith, obedience, duty, and office, to- 
wards us their kings, in our kingdom and dominion." But in the 
year 1621, and about four years after the completion of its re- 
pairs, it was, as has been already stated, swept away by a flood. 
Numerous attempts were made to rebuild it. James himself, 
and Charles Prince of Wales, and many of the nobility and 
others, subscribed with that view. King Charles II., in 1662, ra- 
tified all grants given by King James VI. and King Charles I., his 
grandfather and father, of the sum of 40,000 merks for rebuilding 
the bridge. There is preserved in the Antiquarian Society Mu- 
seum the following list of subscriptions,— Holograph— Richmond 
Knox, 2500 merks; Geo. Hay, 1000 merks; Mar, 1000 merks; 
Roxburgh, 800 merks; Erskine, 400 merks; Gray, 800 merks'; 
Carnegy,400 merks; Buccleugh, 800 merks; Asprynie, 400 merks'

There are no canals or rail-roads in the parish. Between Perth and 
Dundee there is one passage steam-boat, and sometimes two, which 
ply daily. The river not being deep enough in several places to ad- 
mit of their passing at all hours, their arrivals and departures are re- 
gulated by the flowing of the tide. There is at present an iron steam- 
boat constructing to ply on the river, through the enterprise of. Messrs 
A. M'Farlane and Sons, iron-founders. It is of 70 horse-power, 
1 12 feet long, and will draw from 33 to 36 inches water when loaded 
with 500 passengers. From the present spirited exertions made 
to remove the fords and deepen the channel of the river generally, 
it is expected that the boat will make the passage twice each tide. 

A rail-road between Perth and Dundee is projected ; surveys 
have been taken, and some subscriptions raised to carry the pro- 
ject into effect. But it does not meet with the concurrence of se- 
veral of the proprietors, through whose parks and pleasure-grounds 
it would require to be carried ; and some obstacles will stand in 
the way of bringing it to the city, which it will not be easy to sur- 
mount. It is not, therefore, probable that the work will be at pre- 
sent proceeded in ; and the more especially, as the improvements 
in the river navigation promise to make water conveyance both 
more rapid and more frequent. 

Harbours. — In the royal charter now adverted to, there is an 
inhibition on all sea-vessels, small and great, coming within the 
water of Tay with merchandise, from disloading or breaking bulk 
till they come to the bridge, i. e. the bridge at the east end of the 
High Street, now called the " Old Shore" and « Old Light." Here 
was the harbour at that time, 1600 ; but it is now removed from 
the town down the river to what is called the Lime shore. This 
removal appears to have been gradual, in consequence of an accu- 
mulation of gravel in the bed of the river impeding the navigation. 

The removal was first to the south shore, opposite to the Gray- 
friars burying-ground ; and, finally, in 1752, to where it now is. 
What was in 1600 the principal, the only harbour, receiving ves- 
sels of the greatest burden that could come up the river, and even 
ships mounting great guns, as appears from the account given by 
Buchanan of an attempt to storm the town in 1544 from the river 
or eastern side, is now frequented by small craft only. 

The citizens of Perth and the inhabitants of the surrounding coun- 



PERTH.

try appear, from an early period, to have paid a vigilant attention to 
the navigation of the river, as it contributed very much to their wealth 
and prosperity. During a great part of the eighteenth century, trade 
was carried on to a considerable extent between the port of Perth 
and the principal ports, not only of Britain, but of Russia, Ger- 
many, France, Holland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Spain, and 
Italy. This foreign intercourse, however, has, particularly of late 
years, been very much diminished. Various causes have operated 
in producing the decline, such as a total change in the description 
of the manufactures of the place ; a successfully pushed competi- 
tion on the part of other ports which are free from the inconveni- 
ence of river navigation; the establishment of extensive general 
agencies, through which our merchants now obtain the products of 
other countries. But the most powerful of all causes has been the 
natural obstructions to navigation which have arisen in our river 
itself. 

Many centuries ago, a superiority over the navigation of the whole 
river of Tay was granted by royal charters to the burgh of Perth. 
Robert the Bruce, by a charter dated the 4th of April 1316, pro- 
hibited stranger merchants coming within the Tay from presum- 
ing to sell or break bulk without the license of the burgh of Perth, 
until they first offered their cargoes to the merchants at the port 
of Perth. This charter was confirmed by David II. the 10th of 
April 1365, and by Robert III. 6th of May 1400, and lastly, 
James VI., 15th November 1600, confirmed the charter already 
mentioned, and granted in addition, to the provost, bailies, 
councillors, burgesses of Perth, the power of charging and up- 
lifting all customs, anchorage, port-money, tributes, and duties 
within the said bounds of the water of Tay, and established al- 
lenarly to the said burgh of Perth, the jurisdiction, liberty, and 
privilege of the sakl water of Tay, and right of the same. These 
powers of liberty and privilege of free port were afterwards limit- 
ed by decreet-arbitral of. King James, 31st December 1602, to 
-those parts of the Tay running opposite to the sheriffdom of 
Perth. 

Notwithstanding the ample powers conferred on the burgh of 
Perth over the River Tay, more attention appears to have been 
bestowed upon the rigid exaction of harbour dues, than the pre- 
servation of the navigable properties of the river; and consequentlv, 
very serious obstructions had arisen, by the formation of sand- 
banks in the navigable channel, while, at the same time, the 



102 



PERTHSHIRE. 



salmon-fishing stations became more numerous and valuable. To 
such an alarming extent had these obstructions arisen, and so long 
had the authorities neglected to assert their right to remove them, 
that many years ago it was judged advisable to consult the most 
eminent engineers, as to the steps which ought to be taken, with 
the view of asking new powers from Parliament. Messrs Smeaton 
and Rennie severally reported their opinion, the former recom- 
mending a line of quay, suited to the craft then frequenting the 
port, — the latter recommending a suite of wet-docks on the' South 
Inch. 

Mr Jardine afterwards surveyed and proposed a new harbour 
on the site of the old one, but projecting much farther into the 
current of the river, together with the removal of the weel-ford, 
it being the greatest obstruction, and nearest to the harbour. 
Mr Jardine's plan was adopted, and an act of Parliament procured 
for carrying it into effect on the 17th June 1830, under the di- 
rection of a board of commissioners twenty-nine in number. The 
commissioners had proceeded so far with the works under this 
act, as to complete the new pier, when doubts were started as to 
the efficiency of the remaining part of the plan, which provided for 
the removal of the weel-ford, and the deepening of the river upon 
an inclined plane, within the very limited space from the County 
Buildings to the Friartown Hole. It is but justice, therefore, to Mr 
Jardine to state, that his recommendations were never fully carried 
out, but were departed from, chiefly because they did not embrace 
other fords between Perth and Newburgh, which would still have 
presented great obstructions to the navigation, although the weel- 
ford had been removed. 

During 1833, this important subject occupied much of the atten- 
tion of the town-council, the merchants, and the public generally. 
It was at last resolved to employ Messrs Stevenson and Son, en- 
gineers, to make a complete survey of the river, and to report fully 
their opinion as to the best mode of improving the harbour and 
navigation. On the 22d January 1834, these gentlemen gave a very 
full report, in which they recommended the removal of all the fords 
in the river from Friartown to Newburgh, by a dredging-machine, 
excavating from 4 feet 3 inches, to 4 feet 9 inches ; the junction of 
the several small islands to the mainland, by which means they an- 
ticipated that the track from Newburgh to Perth would be deep- 
enened to 16 feet at spring tides, and 1 1 feet at neap tides ; there- 
by admitting vessels of 380 tons burden to pass at the former, and 



PERTH. 



103 



of 130 tons to pass at the latter tide  The greatest difficulty in 
the way of this enlarged improvement was the risk to the salmon- 
fishings from the operation. The report of these gentlemen then re- 
commends the formation of a tide-harbour commencing at the 
Friartown ; an entrance lock to a canal leading from thence to a ca- 
pacious wet-dock, to be excavated about 200 yards to the westward 
of the present quay. The total estimated expense of these works 
is as under : 

Improvement of the navigation, - L. 5600 1 4 3

It was recommended that these extensive operations should be 
proceeded with progressively, the benefit of the first branches 
beino- available by themselves, without reference to the remaining 
parts. 

The suggestions of the Messrs Stevenson were substantially ap- 
proved of by the town-council, and at a public meeting of the inha- 
bitants ; and an act of Parliament was applied for, and obtained on 
the 27th June 1834, for carrying these operations into effect under 
the direction of a board of commissioners, thirty in number, of 
whom the Member of Parliament for the city is one, fourteen are 
members of the town -council, six are justices of the peace in the 
county, three are ship-owners, and six are burgesses of Perth. By 
the act, ample compensation is provided for the salmon-fishing 
proprietors for any damage arising to the fishings from the opera- 
tions. The time allowed by the act for the completion of these 
works is twenty years from its passing, 27th June 1834 ; five years 
for deepening and improving the navigation of the river, and the 
remainder for the execution of the other works. 

Since the passing of the act, the commissioners have been 
actively engaged in carrying its provisions into effect. And al- 
though they have met with some difficulties and obstructions in the 
formation of the tide harbour, it is likely that they have now over- 
come the greatest of these, and that the work will proceed with ra- 

 In 1682, the town-council passed an act granting allowances to the then "late 
Provost,  Mr John Glas as tacksman of the fishings, to take out a great stone in the 
fishings opposite the sleepless Inch." He failed in the attempt. The stone has, since 
that time, been very injurious to the fishings. It was this year, 1836, taken out by 
Mr Turnbull, employed to deepen the river, and lies on the contiguous shore. It is 
above four tons weight.

pidity, while the success of their operations on the fords has been 
in the highest degree satisfactory and encouraging. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The original church of Perth was desig- 
nated " the Church of St John the Baptist." It is altogether un- 
known when and by whom it was founded. It could not be built 
before the year 412, for it was not till then that the Picts, who in- 
habited the country to the south of the Grampian mountains, be- 
came converts to the Christian faith ; and if it be the fact, that till 
the time of St Ninian from Galloway there was no church 
built of stone in the country, it could not be before the year 452. 
The Picts were the ancestors of the generality of the people, and 
Ninian laboured as a missionary among them. 

The church edifice was extensive and magnificent, as appears 
from historical facts and from vestiges which still remain. But 
after the year 1226, when it, with the tithes of the parish, was 
given to the Abbey of Dunfermline, the edifice was neglected. 
The monks endeavoured to throw the burden of upholding it upon 
the town, and the town upon the monks ; and when the monastery 
churches began to be built in the parish in the reign of Alexander 
II. its interests were almost entirely neglected. This was parti- 
cularly the case during the national disturbances which began in 
the year 1290. At length, however, Robert Bruce, having in a 
great measure restored good order in the kingdom, directed his 
attention to the repairing of the church of St Johnstone. His 
death, which took place 1329, put an end to these laudable efforts. 
The following letter he addressed to the abbot and convent of 
Scone, as proprietor of some quarries in the neighbourhood, to ob- 
tain the stones which might be necessary. " Robert, by the grace 
of God King of Scots, to our beloved and faithful religious men, 
the abbot and convent of Scorfe, greeting : We request, and that 
very earnestly, that you will grant liberty to take hewed stones 
from Kincarrachie and Balcormac, for the edification of the church 
of Perth and of the Bridges of Perth and Earn, providing always 
that this liberty shall not be of any prejudice or damage to you. 
Given at Glasgow, the 4th day of July, in the forty-third year of 
our reign." 

In the year 1400 the edifice was in good repair. Before that 
time the east end or choir had been rebuilt. The former altars of 
the saints were removed, and a multitude of new ones began to be 
founded ; only the great altar of St John Baptist, according to the 
superstitious feelings then prevalent, required to be kept up and to 



PERTH' 105 

stand in the same place, viz. at the east end of the building. The 
first of the new altars was that of St Ninian, to whom I have now 
referred. It was founded 14th August 1401 by Robert Brown, 
a burgess of Perth. The whole length of the building is 207 feet. 

The most prominent part of the edifice is the square tower. It 
remains the same that it was originally, only that it has been at 
some after period surmounted by a wooden erection of a pyrami- 
dical shape covered with lead, designated in an act of council in 
the year 1675, " the prikit of the steeple," — an erection which is 
by no means in good keeping with the building. The whole height 
is 155 feet. It was repaired in the year now mentioned, and in 
1767 the pricket received a new covering of lead. The magistracy 
under whose reign this work was done have their names perpetuat- 
ed upon it in alt. It had anciently one dial or horologe on the 
north. — another was put on the south side in 1675. 

There was at one time in it a set of bells of celebrated power 
and tone. Respecting them there is the following entry in the 
city records, of date 2Jst March 1652.

To the oldest of these bells, the skelloche little bell, cast in 
1400, there is reference made in the session records of 1578, Oc- 
tober 6. " The session ordains James Sym, uptaker of the ca- 
sualties that intervenes in the kirk, to buy a tow to the litte skellit 

bell the which bell shall only be rung to the affairs of the kirk, 

also to the examinations, or to the assemblies" i. e. the sessions. 
Unfortunately this bell was a great many years ago injured. It 
was removed, therefore, from its place. It was given in loan for 
a temporary purpose in 1810, to the builders of the depot, for re- 
taining prisoners of war. It is now to be seen attached to a paltry 
temporary building, opposite to the sheriff-clerk's office, for the 
purpose of being rung at the stock-market meetings. The session 
in 1578, did not contemplate that the little skellit bell would, at any 
future time, but particularly in its 436th year, be put to such an in- 
glorious use. 

To another, the Curfew, age unknown, there is also reference 
in the session register, " February 6, 1586-7, the session ordains 
Nicol Balmain to ring the Curfew and workman bell in the morn- 
ing and evening, the space of ane quarter of an hour, at the times 
appointed, viz. four hours in the morning, and eight at even ;" and, 
in the town record, 1657, is " an act requiring obedience to the 
ringing of the bell for putting out fires." The tradition, that the 
Curfew bell hung in the Curfew Street is thus rendered highly 
improbable. Besides, as that street was without the burgh, it is 
not to be supposed that it would have been fixed upon as the pro- 
per place for sounding forth to the inhabitants such a peremptory 
and important proclamation. Whim or some passing event may 
easily be supposed to have occasioned the name given to the street. 

In the burgh records of 1618, there is reference to the bell No. II. 
There was an act passed that year by the council, prohibiting the 
inhabitants from being out of their houses after ten o'clock at night. 
The prohibition was not duly attended to — the inhabitants alleg- 
ing that they did not know the hour. It was therefore ordained, 
that this, the great bell, should be tolled nightly at ten o'clock, 
that none pretend ignorance. It was so tolled ever after till 



PERTH.

some years ago, when it was broken and destroyed; and then the 
bell No. I was tolled, and has continued to be so to the present time. 

Since the inspection in 1652, there have been three bells pur- 
chased for the city. One in 1769, measuring between the lips 3 
feet 1 inch, with this inscription, " I was made for the town of 
Perth in the reign of George III., in the year 1769 — Congregate 
— Lister, Pack, and Chapman of London, fecit." While ringing 
for the afternoon service on Sabbath, 11th September of the present 
year 1836, it cracked, and has become unfit for use. 

Another bell was purchased in 1785, measuring between the 
lips 3 feet 9 inches, with the inscription, " Thomas Mears and Son, 
London." And the third in 1 805, measuring between the lips 4 
feet 4 inches, with this inscription " William Mears of London." 

From the raggle on the west side of the steeple, it is manifest, 
that the western portion of the edifice had been very lofty ; and the 
elegance and grandeur of it may be easily conceived, by those who 
have in their recollection the two stately and beautiful arched win- 
dows, in the deserted and solitary wall in the north side of the now 
West Church, with the adjoining Hackerstein's tower— a wall which 
corresponded with the height of the roof, pointed out by the raggle 
now referred to. But this last remnant of ancient grandeur was 
thrown down in 1828, when a re-edification of this part of St John's 
Church was commenced, according to a plan drawn by Mr Gil- 
lespie, architect. It must be lamented by every one who sees what 
of Mr Gillespie's plan has been executed— that the city authori- 
ties have not found it expedient to carry it into full execution. 

It appears from various minutes in the kirk-session records, that 
not only the spiritualia but the temporalia of the church of Perth 
were, at and for a long time after 1569, entirely under the jurisdic- 
tion and management of the minister and elders ; in virtue of the 
charter of James VI. giving them as governors of the hospital, and 
for purposes specified, inter alia « churches, burying-places, cha- 
pels," &amp;c. Thus, « May 4, 1579, the session ordains the master 
of the hospital to repair the walls of the burying-ground," the 
burial ground was then around the church. " October 28', 1587, 

• In the session record for July 10, 1560, there is the following entry • « The

the session ordains the lofts to be put up in the kirk." " March 
5, 1593, the session ordains the masters of hospital to cause repair 
the kirk floor." " June 18, 1599, the session condescends that 
L. 3 be given to the tailors for the reparation of their seat in the 
kirk, which was transported at the desire of the minister." " March 
29, 1609, James Adamson, master of the hospital, produced 
account of sums of money disbursed by him at the command of 
the session, for bigging of twa lofts in the kirk, the one for the pro- 
vost, bailies, and council, and another for common people, and the 
scholars of the grammar-school, which account being heard and 
allowed, the accounter was found to have super- expended L. 160, 
Is. and 6 pennies, which sum they ordain to be paid to him of the first 
and readiest casualties of the hospital." « April 1600, the session 
ordains a collection to be made the next Sabbath for reparation of 
the kirk, and for that effect ordains twa baillies to be at every kirk 
door, and the elders to be with them." " June 10, 1616, the ses- 
sion ordains the pulpit to be repaired, with a new sad green cloth 
fringed with green silk, like the pulpit of Edinburgh." " January 

21, 1639, whilk day the session ordains the of the 

burgh of Perth to put forth their auld seat equal with their new 
seat, and to repair the glass windows forenent both their seats." 
" September 3, 1639, whilk day the session ordains the masters 
of the kirk wark to do nothing of the kirk wark till the spring time, 
but only point and mend the sclates." 

Numerous similar extracts might be produced to evince the fact, 
that the temporalia of the church of Perth was, at the early period 
referred to, under the jurisdiction and management of the ministers 
and elders,— that all things connected with it were arranged and 
disposed of as they pleased. It is true they had no power given 
them as a kirk-session over the temporalia, but they had the power 
as the appointed hospital managers. 

A complete change has taken place. The temporalia are now 
entirely under the jurisdiction of the civil authorities of the city, 
and the kirk-session or ministers and elders have not even a sitting 
in the church to dispose of to any individual, however destitute. 
As a matter of curiosity, it may be worth while to inquire how 
this change has been brought about— whether members of the town- 
council holding office in the session, which they did for a consi- 
derable time during the semi-episcopalian semi-presbyterian period 
of the church of Scotland, may not have contributed to effect the 
change.

k is an illustrative fact, and not out of place to mention, that the 
town-council got possession of, and retained for many years, till 
obliged to give it up, a property of considerable value belonging 
to the hospital. James VI., among other immunities and privileges, 
gifted to the hospital by charter L. 69, 6s. 8d. of yearly burgage farm, 
formerly paid to the Exchequer, and for that sum the town was 
to hold count annually to the Exchequer, at the filling up of the 
eeque, as paid by them to the hospital. The town agents contriv- 
ed to conceal the grant, and might have continued to do so in 
all time coming, had not one of the ministers, in 1754, discovered 
the fact, in consequence of an incidental perusal which he had got 
of the town's great charter. An investigation forthwith commen- 
ced, and demands were made to obtain possession of the property. 
These were upon various grounds resisted, particularly the not very 
honourable one of negative prescription. Recourse was then had to 
the civil court, and in 1758, the Lords of Session decerned against 
the town, requiring them to pay in all time coming the said sum 
of L. 69, 6s. 8d. and also to make count for thirty-nine years, with 
certain deductions of bvgones, to the amount of L. 2377, 12s. 8d. 
Sterling. Another illustrative fact may be mentioned. Immedi- 
ately upon the charter being granted, the minister and elders, as 
hospital managers, entered on possession of the Blackfriars and 
Charter- House lands. In a few years, the magistrates and council 
claimed as their right to have the management of the property. 
Their claim was indeed resisted, but they contrived to gain their 
point by means of that most disgraceful and outrageous transaction, 
which I have before particularly detailed page 59. Having, at this 
illegal self-constituted session, got into the management of the hospi- 
tal affairs, they contrived to appropriate to the use of the town the 
proceeds of these lands. The presbytery interfered, and threat- 
ened legal measures. They then proposed to the session to alie- 
nate the said proceeds to the maintenance of a third minister. The 
session applied to the presbytery for advice, who referred the matter 
to the General Assembly. The Assembly appointed a committee 
of legal members to consider it and report. The report was decid- 
edly against the town-council. Still, however, the council continued 
to hold the property, and appropriate and draw the rents. A num- 
ber of the councillors being members of session, the session was 
gained over. The presbytery coming to the knowledge of this, did 
at their own risk, and with their own means, and even though oppos- 
ed by the kirk- session, commence a process before the Court of

PERTHSHIRE. 



Session, 1758 against the town, for recovering that property to 
the hospital, and for count and reckoning with respect to bygone 
abstracted rents. After a very keen litigation for more than two 
years, in the course of which the cause was carried to the House 
of Peers, Mr Boswell, one of the presbytery's counsel, craved 
that the hospital should be found entitled to the mails and duties 
of Blackfriars and Charterhouse lands since the commencement of 
the process, and passed from the other claim of bygone mails and 
duties, pro loco et tempore. Accordingly, the Lords pronounced 
their final decree on the 25th of July that year, ordaining the town 
of Perth to cede the possession of the Blackfriars and Charterhouse 
lands to the hospital masters, and the tenants to pay their rents in 
all time coming to the said hospital masters, &amp;c. One other illus- 
trative fact I shall mention, and which is immediately to the point. 
The parish church of St John the Baptist was specially gifted in 
the charter to the hospital, and for many years the kirk-session 
exercised the uncontrolled administration of its concerns. They 
originated and appointed every alteration or repair that was made 
upon it, externally and internally. All the seats in it were erected 
by them, or by others with their permission. And both its walls 
and its roof were repeatedly repaired by them. Nay, the steeple, 
and its clock, and its bells, were theirs, and they employed and paid 
persons for keeping them in proper order. The extracts which I 
have given pp. 105, 6, 7. from the session records make this ma- 
nifest. Now the session have no acknowledged claim to the church, 
or to any thing pertaining to it. It is in the possession of the city 
and other incorporations, and it does not appear that there has ever 
been a legal transference of the property from the hospital to any 
individual or body of men whatever. The hospital has lost this 
with other property, through the incapacity of its managers to re- 
sist encroachments. 

From the year 1560 to the year 1595, the church was supplied 
by only one minister. From 1595 to 1716, it was supplied by two. 
In 1715 the town-council took into consideration, that "the inha- 
bitants of the town and parish had considerably increased," and 
being, with zeal for the glory of God, concerned for the advance- 
ment of the work of the gospel, and in compassion to the souls of 
many hundreds of people, " agreed that a third minister should be 
called and elected by the town-council and kirk -session, or present- 
ed by the council, if calling and election will not suffice," and un- 
animously agreed to assign the sum of 1000 merks Scots yearly,

out of the common good for his maintenance, with the promise 
that the sum shall revert to the common good when the popula- 
tion shall so far diminish that one church shall be sufficient for the 
accommodation of the inhabitants. 

Accordingly that portion of the Old Church which had been se- 
parated from it, some time before the beginning of the seventeenth 
century, and which had, fora few years before this, been occasion- 
ally used as a place of worship, was fitted up to be an additional 
church. Mr Wilson preacher of the Gospel, was presented, called, 
and ordained accordingly, November 1, 1716. From that time 
till 1740 there were thus three ministers. But in that year Mr 
Wilson having been found guilty of following divisive courses, was 
deposed, and no one was appointed to succeed him. Matters re- 
verted to what they were previous to 1715, — only the two ministers 
preached alternately in the two churches. 

In 1771, the choir or east end of the edifice was separated from 
the old church, as the west had been, and converted into a third 
church. An additional minister thus becoming necessary, an or- 
dained assistant was appointed. But it was not deemed expedient 
that each should have his own distinct church. The three there- 
fore observed a rotation, making the round of the churches every 
three weeks. This unedifying and uncomfortable practice con- 
tinued till the year 1807, when the town council with the two mi- 
nisters, the landward heritors, and the presbytery, applied to the 
Lords of Session, and obtained a decreet disjoining f the parish, 
and erecting it into four. A fourth church being thus required, 
it was accordingly, in conformity with the condition of the decreet, 

 The particular purpose to which it was originally appropriated is unknown. But, 
as appears in the city records, it was in 1G04 in a state to require repair. In 1G08, a 
general meeting of the inhabitants was held in it to raise the funds for the bridge which 
was building. In February Hi 18, the council issued an order to red the house where 
the guns lay in the new West Kirk, to receive the corps of Lady Montrose, mend the 
lock and key, and to lay the guns in the north side of the said kirk." In the same year, 
A.ugut 25, the General Assembly of the church was held in it ; when, through the bully' 
ing and threatening of James, the famous five Perth articles were passed. In 1628 the 
convention of burghs took place in it, preparatory to which the great west window was 
repaired. In 1654, " a room was divided oft" in it for the purpose of holding courts.'' 
In 1671, the Justiciary Court met in it. The seat erected for the judges cost nearly 
L. 173, 12s. In 1684, the council gave license to the Marquis of Athole to hew stones 
in it. 

From the time when it became one of the city churches, 1716 till 1 7 7 1 , neither bap- 
tism nor the Lord's supper was dispensed in it. , These sacraments were dispensed in the 
Old Middle Church only. It was not till 1772 that these ordinances were dispensed 
in all the three churches, Middle, West, and East. 

f The city record for 1603 contains an order to speak to the Laird of Weem to stand 
the town's favourer and friend in their adoes, and specially anent the division of the Ses- 
sion in Edinburgh, to see if the same may be had "in our town."

erected, and each minister was restricted to his own church and 
parish. 

In the year 1788, a chapel was built by subscription and by col- 
lections made in the churches throughout the synod, for the High- 
landers who resided in Perth and its neighbourhood. By an act 
of Assembly in 1834, it became a church in common with many 
other chapels, and, as it was intended for the benefit of the High- 
landers in the city and neighbourhood, the presbytery assigned to 
the minister of it as his charge the whole Gaelic population resid- 
ing within four miles round it. 

In the year 1834-35, a number of the friends of the Establish- 
ment, taking into consideration the increased population of Perth and 
its vicinity, and the great need of additional church accommodation 
occasioned thereby, agreed to build, by subscription, a new church. 
It has been built accordingly. A constitution has been obtained 
for it from the General Assembly ; and a minister has now been 
officiating in it for above twelve months. Thus there are six 
Established churches in Perth. 

Their sittings are 6650 ; but none of these is free, or accessible 
to the community rent free. Two thousand nine hundred and fif- 
ty-four belong to the city corporation. The remaining 3696 are 
the property of other corporations, and the proprietors of St Ste- 
phens and St Leonards churches. 

The seat rents drawn by the city and other incorporations amount 
at present to L. 1050, 15s. 7d. The city expenditure on the 
churches, as stated in the report of the Commissioners, is L. 989, 
19s. 4d. Thus the income to the city and corporations from the 
churches is L. 60, 16s. 3d. more than what is expended on them 
by the local authorities. That the city is a pecuniary gainer, by its 
connections with the Church Establishment, to a higher amount, 
I shall hereafter show. 

It may not be improper to remark here in passing, that the prac- 
tice of seat-letting is at variance with the fundamental constitutional 
principle of an endowed church. The great design of an endow- 
ed church is, that the poor as well as the rich may have free access 

 In 1650, the population in the landward part of the parish was so great, that the 
Presbytery found it to be their duty to recommend the erection of it into a separate 
charee • and, in order to carry that into effect, to lay the matter before the Commis- 
sioners 'for Plantation of Kirks. Two of the brethren were deputed by the Presby- 
tery to hold conference with the heritors thereanent. Repeated conferences were held ; 
but obstacles were thrown in the way, and they proved unsuccessful. The minute 
of Presbytery, 9th April 1651, says, " the affairs of the landward parish of Perth de- 
layed, because of the troubles of tie times."

to the dispensation of religious ordinances. But that privilege they 
cannot enjoy, if heritors and corporations may at pleasure deny it 
to those who cannot pay them the rents exacted. The moral in- 
terests of the poorer classes in Perth, as well as in other such 
towns, have suffered severely from this. There are not a few poor 
families in it who cannot possibly pay rent for the sittings which 
they require. The melancholy consequence of this is, that many 
young persons never acquire church-going habits, and gradually 
fall into the habitual neglect of Sabbath observance; and then these, 
when they become heads of families, render the evil more inve- 
terate and extensive. It is a miserable and short-sighted po- 
licy to raise a revenue for any purpose, however important and va- 
luable, at the expense of the religious instruction and moral im- 
provement of the industrious poor. But such a policy does exist, 
and by wise worldlings is defended. The poor may be urged by 
the ministers of the church to attend ordinances with their families ; 
but in many-cases the requiring it is almost a mockery, as they are 
excluded by the proprietors of the sittings, who will not accommo- 
date them without their advancing a sum which their limited in- 
come puts it out of their power to advance. The want of proper 
and sufficient church accommodation for the poor is a demoralizing 
evil which is every day becoming more apparent. Those who le- 
gislate and rule upon an enlightened Christian principle, unbiassed 
by considerations of party attachment, must admit that it is a pa- 
ramount duty to make spiritual provision for those of their subjects 
who are spiritually destitute. 

The ministers of the East and Middle Churches have each a 
stipend of 70 bolls of barley and 80 bolls of oat-meal paid by the 
heritors of the old parish, and L. 130 each paid out of the city re- 
venues. The minister of the East Church has, in addition, the 
vicarage teind, which is L. 7, 8s. 10§d. The stipend of the mi- 
nister of the West Church is L. 250, and that of the minister of St 
Paul's is L. 280, both paid out of the city's revenue. That of the 
minister of St Stephen's Gaelic Church is L. 80, and to increase 
as the income from the seat rents increases. That of St Leonard's 
is L. 100, and to increase in like manner. There are neither 
manses  nor glebes. The town-council are patrons of the East, 

 The parish church, which had been dedicated to St John Baptist, the manse which 
belonged to it, and another house in the city, with the whole tithes of the parish, were 
given by David I. to the Abbey of Dunfermline. The abbot and monks received the 
rectory tithes, and employed a vicar to officiate at Perth. At the Reformation the pro- 
perty of the abbeys, and of other such religious houses, reverted to the Crown. In

West, Middle, and St Paul's. The minister of the Gaelic Church 
is chosen by the male heads of families being communicants, and 
so also is the minister of St Leonard's. 

By the Court of Session decreet 1807, the council guaranteed 
to the minister of the East and Middle parishes, besides victual 
stipend, L. 80 each of money stipend, and to those of the West 
and St Paul's, L. 200. Put afterwards they voluntarily gave aug- 
mentations to the ministers of the West and St Paul's L. 80 each, 
and to the ministers of the East and Middle, L. 50 each. In 
1835, the West Church became vacant by the death of the Rev. 
Mr Kennedy. During the vacancy, it was at different times keen- 
ly contested, by a party in the town-council, that the augmentation 
granted to Mr Kennedy should be withheld from his successor. 
The Strathmore Journal, a Perth newspaper, took up the point, 
and emitted, on the 4th February 1836, the following strictures, 
which, as they entirely accord with the sentiment that I enter- 
tain, I shall here introduce.—" Stipend of the West Church mi- 
nister.— We have not been much fascinated with the resolution of 
the town-council to restrict the stipend of the new incumbent in 
this parish to L. 200 in future : and we cannot comprehend the 
conduct of some of those who voted for that motion, and yet hold 
forth that by doing so they merely wished to delay a settlement of 
the matter. It does appear to us quite unreasonable that, in a 
city such as this, one of the clergymen should be restricted to the 
minimum rate of stipend in the Church of Scotland, when the ex- 
pense of living is so much greater than in country parishes. It 
must be noticed, also, that the Perth ministers have neither glebe, 
garden, nor manse ; and so the. L. 200 proposed to be given is not 
worth more than L. 150 comparatively. This stinted remunera- 
tion is not economy, but positive parsimony, and it can hardly be 
expected that a clergyman of talent, such as Perth should have, 
will be obtained, or, at any rate, remain long in a situation where 
he is only to receive such a reward for his labours and attainments, 
as is to be found in the poorest livings in the church. For the 

1"P9 James VI. conferred on Anne of Denmark, at the time of his marriage with that 
Process, the lands and other property of the Abbey of Dunfermline. The deed was 
confirmed by Parliament in 1593, but it was enacted that she should allow for the offi- 
ciating clergy and for some other purposes specified, one-third of the benefits of those 
churches which had belonged to the Abbey. The tacksman of the tithes of Perth was 
John Poss, laird of Craigie. He paid a third part for the purposes enacted, and trans- 
mitted the overplus to the Queen. Her Majesty, however, soon after the year 1G0U, 
gave up her right to the tithes of Perth, and the town-council became patrons of the 
parish.

sake, therefore, of the respectability of this parish, and the city 
generally, we look forward with some interest to Mr Dewar's mo- 
tion at the next council meeting, when the delay party will, we 
trust, vote more in accordance with their avowed wishes, than they 
did on Monday last." The discussion here commented on is re- 
corded in the provincial newspapers, and presents to the public a 
curious and not very creditable specimen of the reasoning, by 
which the members of a town-council came to the conclusion, 
that the stipend of L. 280, previously given to the minister 
of the West Church of the city, was L. 80 too much, and 
that therefore it should be for the future, or in the mean- 
time, only L. 200. The liberality displayed may be judged of 
by the fact, that though the burgh of Perth be the first in Scot- 
land in point of unincumbered property, and freedom from local 
taxation, it now proposes to remunerate its ecclesiastical office- 
bearers at a lower rate than any other burgh in the nation. The 
ministers of Edinburgh receive per annum, L. 520 ; those of Dun- 
dee, L. 275 ; those of Aberdeen, L. 300 ; those of Glasgow, 
L. 425 ; those of Montrose, L. 340 ; those of Paisley, L. 313. 
The discussion referred to ended in a motion, carried by a ma- 
jority, that the stipend of the West Church should, in the 
meantime, be L. 200. At a future meeting of council, it was 
carried that the sum should be raised to L. 250. In consequence 
of reiterated broad averment, by some municipal rulers who are 
hostile to the Establishment, that the church is a burden on the 
funds of the city, Mr Dewar, one of the magistrates, published a 
pamphlet, entitled " an Inquiry as to the pecuniary gain or loss 
arising to the town-council of Perth, from its connection with the 
Established Church, containing a translation of Queen Anne's 
charter, of date 20th November 1604, which conveyed certain lands 
properties, and revenues to the town on account of the church." 
In this pamphlet, Mr Dewar has discussed the subject in a man- 
ner clear, masterly, and conclusive, and, by authorities the most 
unquestionable, has established the fact, that the town has by its 
connection with the Established Church been not only no loser, but 
a gainer to a very considerable extent ; that it « is at the present 
moment a pecuniary gainer to the extent of at least L. 300 per 
annum." By the Queen's charter, it became titular of the teinds 
of the parish, and obtained possession of considerable propertv. 
which has never to the present time been valued or paid an fractio 
of stipend- Mr Dewar thus concludes his able pamphlet : « In the

meantime churchmen, those in Perth at least have reason to be 
glad, that their religion does not cost the community a fraction, 
but has been beneficial to it both in a pecuniary, and in a far more 
important point of view. The dissenters in Perth have reason to re- 
joice, that the burden of supporting the Established Church which 
they have been taught to consider so galling, has never pressed 
upon either their purses or their persons, or on any thing else con- 
nected with them excepting their imaginations." 

There are in the city two home missions, appointed and super- 
intended by the General Session. The expense is defrayed by a 
subscription. One of the missionaries is appointed to officiate every 
Lord's day evening in the Middle Church. 

In 1814, a Sabbath Evening School Society was organized, to be 
conducted upon the localizing system. The office-bearers, teachers, 
and taught, were of all the religious denominations in the place. The 
returns of children in the schools wer" frequently as high as 1400, 
and visible good effects resulted to the community. But its pros- 
perity was blasted, by the voluntary agitation introduced among us 
some years ago. It then decayed and disappeared. In the Mid- 
dle and West parishes, Sabbath schools have been since establish- 
ed, under the superintendence of their respective sessions. In the 
Middle parish, there is one congregational school, attended by 81, 
and eleven local schools, attended by 200 young persons. In the 
West parish, there is one congregational school, attended by 215. 
The erection of local schools is in progress. The teachers of all 
these schools are the ministers and elders, and those- religious 
friends who are zealous in the cause. 

With respect to Dissenting and Seceding meeting-houses — there 
are both. The dissenting houses are, one for Independents, another 
for Baptists, another for general Baptists, and another for Glassites. 
The Seceding houses are, one for Old Light Burghers, another 
for Old Light Antiburghers, two for the New Light Burghers and 
Antiburghers, or United Secession, and two for Relievers. The 
ministers of these places of worship are paid by the seat-holders 
and hearers, out of seat rents and collections. One of them has 
a stipend of L.200, another of L. 180, another of L. 170, another 
of L. 100, and another of L. 90. The other ministers have no 
fixed sums allotted them. They depend on " the spontaneous li-

are in debt,— some of them to a considerable amount. But there is 
in some cases a satisfaction connected with the debt, as it forms a

ed, there is an Episcopalian chapel, a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, 
and a Catholic chapel.

According to this table, there were in the year referred to, in 
all the places of public worship in the parish, 15,024 sittings; of 
these, 6197 belonged to the Establishment, and 8827 toother de- 
nominations. Of the sittings belonging to the Establishment 4744 
were let or occupied of right, and of those belonging to other de- 
nominations 3881 were let or occupied of right. The sittings un- 
let or unoccupied of right belonging to the former were 1453, f 
and those belonging to the latter were 4946. In the memorial 
which certain Voluntaries presented in November 1834 to the Lord 
Chancellor Brougham, on the subject of church accommodation in 
Perth, they set forth that the Establishment sittings were 6094 
and those of the Dissenters 8693 ; that the unlet sittings in the 
Establishment were 2172 at least; and those in the dissenting 
places of worship 4321. I have not access to know whether the 
number of their unlet sittings has diminished or increased, since 
the presentation of the memorial. But there can be no doubt 
that, assuming its averment to be correct, the let sittings in the 
Established churches have made an increase since then of 719 
In point of fact, the let sittings in the Established churches have 
considerably increased since the year 1 835. 

The number of unlet sittings in five of the churches, East West 
Middle, St Paul's, and St Stephen's is certainly considerable 
But that can easily be accounted for. St Stephen's is entirely for

the Gaelic population,. which is limited, and not for the inhabitants 
generally. In the East, West, Middle, and St Paul's, there are 
about '200 sittings so inconveniently placed in respect of seeing 
or hearing, or of both, that none would occupy them except from 
necessity. St Leonard's was opened last year. By the judicious 
arrangement of the proprietors, the great proportion of the sittings 
was let at low prices. This naturally drew to it many who, in 
the other churches, were paying high prices, and who on that ac- 
count could not get their families accommodated. 

The unconstitutional and unjust exactions, by the city corpora- 
tions, of high seat rents, and thus shutting the pews against many 
of the industrious poor, has had, and continues to have, a most 
pernicious effect on the religious and moral habits of the popula- 
tion. The churches are for the accommodation of the people, and 
not for the raising of money by any corporation, or for any secular 
purpose whatever. The rights of the people in this matter are a 
subject which demands special and immediate investigation. On 
these rights it is a manifest infringement. Were the town and 
other incorporations of Perth to act in letting their sittings, as the 
proprietors of St Leonard's did in letting those of that church, they 
would promote the substantial interests of the community, much 
more effectually than by any distribution of the profits accruing 
from such a holding. Were it not for the extra Sabbath evening 
services, many of the poor would be entirely deprived of the be- 
nefit and comforts of public worship. 

The amount of population, according to a census recently made, 
is 19,601, which is 415 less than what it was according to the Go- 
vernment census in 1831. Of this number 11,683 belong to the 
Establishment, 7101 belong to other denominations, and of the 
remainder, some make no religious profession whatever, while 
others are attached to no particular religious body. The number 
of Roman Catholics is 228. 

In the Established churches the average number of communi- 
cants is 3536. 

With respect to societies for wligious purposes, 1 may observe, 
that they were more numerous, prosperous, and active, lately, than 
they are at present; There is still a Missionary Society, two Bible 
Societies, and a Tract Society. There are also Societies for gene- 
ral charitable purposes,— for relieving the destitute sick, supporting 
aged and indigent women, clothing indigent old men, clothing in

digent old women, upholding a dispensary, supporting two infant

It is very much to be lamented that the liberality and harmony 
which, a few years ago, prevailed among all classes and denomina- 
tions of the community, in the formation and upholding of these and 
other such valuable institutions, have suffered a considerable dimi- 
nution. This lamentable evil I unhesitatingly ascribe to the intro- 
duction of voluntaryism into the place, the object of which is to 
overthrow the religious establishments of the country. It has oc- 
casioned a grievous infringement of the royal law of our Master's 
kingdom, " brotherly love." It has produced a separation among 
brethren in matters upon which they should be cordially united. 
May the time soon return when Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and 
Judah shall not vex Ephraim. 

The state of the public charities of the city of Perth for 1833, 
is published in the Church of Scotland Magazine for 1835. As 
that is, to my certain knowledge, accurate, and as it has been freely 
circulated in this place, as well as in other places, that the chari- 
table institutions in our chief towns owe more to the liberality of 
Dissenters than to that of the Establishment, I beg leave here to 
introduce it.

which continue in existence. 

The average amount of church collections yearly for religious 
and charitable objects is about L. 730. 

Education. — Perth is the most centrical town in Scotland. It 
is not matter of surprise, therefore, that in 1 697, when, with a view 
to the public interest of the nation, it was proposed to remove the 
University of St Andrews to another place, this city should be 
made choice of, and particularly as it is more accessible than St 
Andrews to the population of the highland districts. A corre- 
spondence upon the subject was, for some time, carried on by Sir

PERTHSHIRE. 



James Stuart, the King's Advocate for Scotland ; and the Earl of 
Tullibardine, the Principal Secretary of State; Mr Munro, Provost 
of the Old College of the University of St Andrews ; Mr Craigie 
of Glendookie ; the magistrates and town-council of Perth, &amp;c. 
The arrangement did not take place. How it failed is matter of 
uncertainty. The following extract of a letter of Provost James 
Cree of Perth, 1698, to Mr Anderson, Rector of the University, 
shews how the city of Perth regarded the proposition. " For as 
we are confident that it will be found in due time a meane through 
God's blessing, to advance the public good of the Universitie, and 
also of the kingdome, so we are resolved to cum as great a length 
for advancing so noble a design as we are able, whereof we hope 
we have given sufficient evidence in the offer of a fund for pro- 
vyding of lodgings and accommodations needful for that effect." f 
Perth has been for a long time celebrated for distinguished 
teachers in its schools of learning. The first Rector of the Gram- 
mar School after the reformation, whose name is on record, was Mr 
William Rynd. Such was his reputation that he was appointed 
governor and travelling tutor to the young Earl of Gowrie, and his 
brother Alexander, when they went to study at Padua. His suc- 
cessors in office, of whom a list has been regularly kept, appear to 
have been men of professional eminence and great ardour in train- 
ing their pupils. Mr Logan, a gentleman of high scholarship, is 
the present Rector. 

 Mr Craigie alleges various reasons of translation, among which are the following : 
It would contribute much to the civilizing of the Highlands, Perth being near to them. 
The victuals are dearer at St Andrews than anywhere else, viz. fieshs and drinks of all 
sort:;.- — St Andrews is ill provided of all commodities and trades, which obliges us to 
sen J to Edinburgh, and provide ourselves with shoes, clothes, hatts, &amp;c, and what are 

here are double rate St Andrews is ill provided of fresh water, the most part being 

served with a stripe, where the foul clothes, herring, fish, &amp;c. are washed, so that it is 
most pairt neasty and unwholsome. — St Andrews is a most thin and piercing air, even 
to an excess, seeing that nitre grows upon the walls of chambers when fires are used, if 
there be a light to trie north, for the most part of the whole year, as in Mr Ramsay, &amp;c. 
and this is the reason why old men coming to this place are instantly cut off. — As also 
why infectious diseases have been observed to begin and rage most here, as in the visi- 
tation in 1640, when Dr Bruce died ; and last year a most malignant flux, whereof 
dyed upwards of two hundreth persons in a few weeks, which much prejudiced the Uni- 
versity. — St Andrew's being now only a village where most part farmers dwell, the whole 
streets are filled with dunghills, which are exceedingly noisome, and ready to infect the 
air, especially at this season when the herring gutts are exposed in them, or rather in 
all corners of the toune by themselves, and the season of the year apt to breed infection, 
which partly may be said to have been the occasirn of list year's dissentirie, which from 
its beginning here raged through most part of the kingdom." 

f In the city records, February 21, 1698, there is entered an act for offering the 
town-house and yard tor the college, or the sum of 20,000 merks to build one. 

In the articles of communing between the commissioner of the university and the 
town-council, the town-house is designated that great lodging situated next to the Spey- 
gate, whereof the council are heritable keepers, i. e. Gourie's Palace, and the whole 
proffer is estimated at 80,000 merks.

known Professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aber- 
deen, and author of " Inquiry into the Rise and Progress, the Re- 
demption and present State of Management of the National Debt 
of Great Britain," was the rector of it for ten years before he was 
raised to the professorship. Its present rector is Dr Adam Ander- 
son, of distinguished scientific attainment.

I have not been able to ascertain with sufficient accuracy the 
number of persons, young and old, who cannot read and write. But 
I am able to state, from personal knowledge, that the number of 
-those is great, whose instruction in reading is lamentably defi- 
cient. They are reported to be taught to read, and are rated ac- 
cordingly. But in general, theirs is the reading of half-educated 
children. Of the simplest book they cannot make out a page, 
without difficulty and much hesitation. They cannot comprehend 
aright, therefore, the import of what they are reading. This un- 
happy state of matters, among many of the labouring classes of 
the community, may be ascribed to two causes. The first is the 
strono- temptations which are held out to poor parents of numerous 
families, by manufacturers and certain master tradesmen, to employ 
their children, at a very early period of life,— which temptation many 
of them have not moral principle to resist. Thus we often find 
children employed in spinning-mills and in weaving shops, sent 
thither by their parents ere they have been above a few months at 
school. There are indeed evening-schools with good teachers 

not oresume to learn any boys to write," and l ' the janitor of the grammar School was 
aimointed to visit the women's schools, and put the council's act in force." 

 Each scholar pays Id. per week ; the average number ot scholars is between id 

l Wi'th half of the fees, and half of the price of the work done.

attached to many of our manufacturing institutions, and the pro- 
prietors of these have acted laudably in this respect. But it must 
be acknowledged that the schools have much more value in ap- 
pearance than they have in reality : for how is it possible that such 
young creatures — a great portion of whose time, nature says, 
should be spent in amusing pursuit — can apply with requisite at- 
tention to the tasks of an evening school after a long day's toiling 
in a spinning-mill. They in general require to be then put to 
rest, and not to any new exertion whatever. That children, at 
whatever age they be, may be taught efficiently, it is necessary 
that their physical strength be unexhausted. 

Another reason to which I am disposed to ascribe the present 
deficient instruction in reading, that prevails among, many of 
the labouring classes of the community, is insufficiency on the 
part of the teachers. Many of those whose pupils are from among 
the poor do not look upon teaching as an art which requires any 
previous training, but an employment which any one almost may 
easily follow ; and they, therefore, cannot be expected to conduct 
a school with advantage to the pupils, unfortunately placed under 
them. In short, they know nothing, as they ought to know, of the 
deeply important business in which they have engaged. Incalcu- 
lable detriment arises from this to the young generation. Their 
attention is. directed solely to the drudgery of tasks, in reading 
words and sentences, and nothing is done to engage their under- 
standing in the import of what they read. With such schoolmas- 
ters, teaching is a mere mechanical operation. By them the 
young idea is not taught to shoot at all, and their good scholars, 
as they call them, are at best mere readers, not understanders of 
what is read. 

These remarks are intended to have a general and not a local 
application. In Perth there are teachers who have ability and 
zeal in no ordinary degree, and who make it their special endea- 
vour to train their pupils, from the commencement of their reading 
exercises, to see and understand the import of what they read ; and, 
what is of prime importance, to make them acquainted with scrip- 
ture truth and moral duty. They sustain a character for pro- 
fessional attainment and vigorous discharge of professional duty, 
which will not be found equalled in many other such towns in 
Scotland. 

In 1834, the magistrates and town-council, with a laudable con- 
cern for the elementary instruction of the young among the ope-

rative portion of the community, caused a survey to be taken of 
the city and suburbs, to ascertain the state of school accommoda- 
tion. A great deficiency was ascertained to exist, and measures 
were promptly adopted to correct the evil. A public subscription 
was opened for the purpose of erecting additional schools, and ap- 
plication was made to the Lords of the Treasury for aid out of the 
sum set apart by Government for the erection of schools in the 
large towns in Scotland. The town gave a donation of L. 200, 
and individual gentlemen subscribed to the amount of L. 200 
more. This having been represented to the Treasury, and satis- 
factory pledges having been given that the schools would be erect- 
ed, and conducted in conformity with the requirements of govern- 
ment, the sum of L. 400 was obtained. L. 800 being thus secured 
for accomplishing the benevolent object, the building of the school- 
houses immediately commenced, and they are now nearly finished. 
They will accommodate 400 scholars. The city is pledged to 
give to each of the teachers a salary of L. 10 per annum, and the 
scholars are to pay, for the day school, 8d. per month, and for the 
evening school, 6d. per month. The mode of teaching is to be, as 
far as it may be found practicable, that of Mr Wood of Edinburgh. 
The magistrates and town-council are the patrons. 

Literature. — There are in Perth six circulating libraries. Of 
these, the principal one is that which goes under the designation 
of the Perth Library. Tt was instituted in 1786. It originated 
with the late Rev. Mr Peebles, minister of the Episcopal Chapel. 
By his judicious management, it was settled on that basis on which 
it still rests. By certain unalterable articles of agreement in the 
deed of settlement, respecting the trustees, the curators, the gene- 
ral meetings, and election of office-bearers, it is preserved entire, 
and cannot be alienated. It is consigned over to the public, and 
conveyed in trust to certain official characters in the town and 
county, for the purposes of the institution. It contains between 
five and six thousand volumes, chiefly of history, philosophy, and 
belles lettres. It is kept in an apartment, fitted up for it within the 
monumental structure erected by the citizens to the memory of the 
late Thomas Marshall, Esq. of Glenalmond, formerly provost of 
Perth, to whose public spirit the city and its neighbourhood are in- 
debted for many of its most important improvements. The libra- 
rian attends for two hours each lawful day ; and 15s. per annum 
entitles to the use of the library. 

The other circulating libraries are the property of private asso-

ciations. In some of these the books are numerous and well 
selected. 

The Literary and Antiquarian Society was established in 1784. 
Its founder was the late Rev. James Scott, one of the ministers of 
the city, who, to the mind and manners of a gentlemen, and the 
piety and zeal of a Christian minister, added an unpretending but 
ardent love of literature and the fine arts. Its primary object was 
to investigate the history, and preserve the antiquities and records 
of Scotland generally, and more particularly of that portion of it 
of which Perth may be considered as the capital ; but when many 
literary and scientific men proffered their countenance and co- 
operation, Mr Scott and his associated friends enlarged the scheme 
of the society's pursuits, and gave it the name which it now has. 
It has lately obtained a charter or seal of cause from the magis- 
trates. Since the year 1818 it has issued diplomas. An annual 
general meeting of the members is observed. On these occa- 
sions, papers are frequently read on literary, scientific, or antiqua- 
rian subjects, and, generally, deposited in the society's archives. 
Among these there are some by Dr Anderson of the Academy, on 
scientific questions, characterized by originality and a profound 
power of investigation. The society has a museum, consisting of 
scarce and valuable books, manuscripts, and coins ; also of subjects 
of natural history, and of various articles of dress, &amp;c. which cha- 
racterize the habits and manners of barbarous nations. It has re- 
ceived of late many valuable additions from natives of Perthshire — 
and others in foreign countries. The present Noble President is the 
Right Honourable the Earl of Kinnoul, and its annual meeting is 
held in the museum, which is under the same roof with the public 
library. 

There is in the city a public reading or news-room. It is spa- 
cious, and brilliantly lighted with gas. It is supplied with about 
twenty newspapers, English, Irish, and Scotch, and of every shade 
of political opinion. There are also magazines, reviews, and other 
periodicals. 

There are four weekly newspapers printed in Perth — the Courier, 
which commenced in 1809 — the Strathmore Journal, which com- 
menced in 1820 — the Constitutional, which commenced in 1835 
— and the Chronicle, which commenced in 1836. Mr Morison 
publishes annually " the Perth and Perthshire Register, contain- 
ing accurate lists of the nobility, constituency, and institutions 
of the county and city, also the Tay shipping- lists.

In 1772, a periodical, under the designation of ' ; the Perth Ma- 
gazine," commenced. After the publication of five volumes it ceas-

not succeed. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — King James VI. Hospital or 
Alms House. To this institution I have already adverted, but the 
following particulars it may be proper here to introduce respecting 
its history. In neither of its charters — the one obtained before, 
the other after, the King's coming of age, is there any injunction 
to build a house for the reception of the poor. They speak mere- 
ly of property given for their aliment. They bear that his Ma- 
jesty, moved by certain weighty considerations, deemed it his duty 
to provide, by all honest ways, an hospital for the poor, maimed, 
and distressed persons, orphans, and fatherless children within his 
burgh of Perth, had therefore given, granted, and disponed to the 
poor members of Jesus Christ, now and in all time coming, abid- 
ing in, and residing within the said burgh, certain properties — the 
designation of which evinces the endowment to have been most 
munificent. 

But it appears that soon after the endowment was granted, an 
hospital-house was considered to be necessary, to carry into proper 
and full effect the intention of the Royal donor : for, so early as 
1579, i. e. about ten years after the first charter was granted, there 
is in the session record the following entry : " Ordains Js. Sim, 
uptaker of the casualities pertaining to the hospital, to give to the 
poor folks in the hospital straw to lie upon." Thus there was 
then an hospital-house. But it must have been only a temporary 
one, for on the 7th December of the same year, this entry occurs : 

 These properties consist of " All and hail the lands, tenements, houses, buildings, 
churches, burial-places, chapels colleges, yards, orchards, crofts, annual rents, feu-farms 
canonries, pensions, mills, mill-lands and their sequels, fishings and fish mercat, fruit

altarages, prebendaries, founded on whatever kirk, chapel or college within the liberty 
or privilege of our burgh, in possession whereof the chaplains or prebends thereof 
were originally, the said tt cetera are lying, or were uplifted respectively with the ma-

" The Assembly," i. e. the session or managers, " think it good 
that the minister and some of the elders propose to the council, 
when they converse towards the advising of an hospital in which 
the poor may remain, either the Grayfriars or St Paul's Chapel." 
And again: on 9th April 1595, the ministers and elders conde- 
scend and agree that an hospital-house shall be erected for the main- 
tenance and entertainment of such aged and honest persons as are 
impoverished, and have not to maintain themselves, &amp;c. And again, 
in the following year, " the Session with one voice think it expe- 
dient that, an hospital-house for the entertainment of the poor 
within our own congregation be erected and builded — the place 
to be in the chapel called our Lady's chapel at the shore, and for 
this effect, ordains James Anderson, master of the hospital, with 
all diligence, to buy timber and other materials for the furtherance 
of this work." That it was finished and occupied in 1599, appears 
from an entry of that year : " The session ordains the master of 
the hospital to cause outred the timber work of the nether house 
of the hospital with all diligence, that some honest failed men may 
be put therein and maintained." 

Cromwell, in 1652, having taken the city, demolished the hos- 
pital, with other public buildings, and applied the materials to as- 
sist in raising his citadel in the South Inch. With a reference to 
that catastrophe, the following report was given in by the ministers 
of Perth to the presbytery, at a presbyterial visitation in 1676. — 
" They had no hospital-house, it having been pulled down by the 
Englishers, and never yet rebuilt." 

The present hospital-house was erected near the site of the 
Carthusian monastery, which had been destroyed at the commence- 
ment of the Reformation in 1559. To defray the expense of its 
erection, money was raised by subscription, collections were made 
at the churches within the bounds of the synod, and the city con- 
tributed 2000 merks Scots. Mr Cree, provost of the city, laid the 
foundation. It was finished in 1750. It is a large and well ar- 
ranged building, three stories high. 

The foundation charter expressly limits the application of the 
funds to the " poor members of Christ's body, residing" not in the 
parish, but " in our burgh of Perth." And accordingly, the poor 

 At the time when James granted the charter, which was a short lime after the 
Reformation, there were only two denominations of professing Christians in the 
country, — these of the Protestant Established Church, and tli ose ct the Roman 
Catholic Church. The Established Church was designated, in different acts of Par- 
liament, particularly in that which ratified its form 1592, " the trcw and hally kirk ;"

residing in the burgh were alone admitted into it, while it was in- 
habited by poor. There was a teacher for the young, and the 
master acted as chaplain. 

A new arrangement took place in 1814. After due inquiry in- 
to the most economical mode of management, it was agreed to 
break up the establishment, and, reserving the hospital master's 
apartments, and the managers room containing the records, to let 
the house, and make each pauper an out-pensioner, at a certain 
sum per annum, to be paid weekly. Since the above-mentioned 
period, that system of management has been followed. 

The net income of the hospital is L. 597, 8s. 6d. 

The number of poor receiving from it is 61. 
In the year 1660, James Butter, sheriff-clerk of Perthshire, dot- 
ed two fifth parts of the lands of Scones Lethendy, to maintain 
four poor persons of the burgh of Perth. In the year 1686, Mr 
Jackson doted one- half of one-fifth of the lands of Scones Leth- 
endy to support one poor relation, whom failing, one of the name of 
Jackson, whom failing any other. In 1743, Mr Cairnie doted two- 
fifths of the lands of Scones Lethendy, to the poor of the burgh 
of Perth, reserving two-thirds of the free rent to two of his descen- 
dants nearest the age of fourteen years, one-half to be paid to them 
annually, for ten years, and at the expiry of the ten years, the re- 
served half to be paid in full, but without interest, the other third 
annually to the hospital poor. Of these mortifications, the minis- 
ters and elders were appointed trustees, and the patronage of the 
two first was vested in the Magistrates and Ministers. 

It so happens that these lands are contiguous, and form one dis- 
tinct estate, in all 610 imperial acres, including 145 imperial acres 
of planting. 

The free rental is L. 513, 8s. 6d. ; two persons of the name of 
Cairnie get at present annually, L. 130 ; the hospital poor L. 50, 
1 8s. 6d. ; total L. 180, 18s. 6d. 

Under Butters' s and Jackson's mortifications, L. 170 are given to 
twelve annuitants, and a balance of L. 162, 10s. is applied for re- 
demption of about L. 1500 of debt incurred in building steading, 
&amp;c. &amp;c. 

Dispensaries. — The Perth Dispensary commenced in 1819. The 
objects which it was intended to embrace, were the relief of the 

the poor members of Christ's body, therefore, in such a charter, granted at such a 
time, could be those only who were bona fide members of the Established Church.

of Perth are entitled to the benefit of the hospital funds.

sick and diseased poor, by furnishing them with necessary advice 
and medicine — inoculation for cow-pox to all who might apply, 
without regard to recommendation, and the delivery of poor preg- 
nant women. For the proper administration of the institution, 
rules and regulations were drawn up, and medical officers and a com- 
mittee of management were appointed. Annual reports have been 
regularly made to the stated meetings of the institution, and these 
have been most flattering and satisfactory. 

In January 1834, it was resolved, after mature deliberation, to 
adopt, in addition to the charity, the self-supporting system, which 
has been introduced with so much advantage in England, with 
the view of extending the usefulness of the institution, and ena- 
bling the honest and industrious mechanic or labourer, by means of 
a trifling weekly payment, to procure for himself, his wife, and his 
children, that medical advice and medicine which he would other- 
wise be unable to obtain, without resorting to the aid of public or 
private charity. 

The following table of results /or the last year may serve to give 
a view of the operations of the Dispensary. The patients admit- 
ted were as follows :

Total of pauper patients 661, and 31 of free member patients, 
giving the number 692 cases during the season. 

There is a separate establishment from the above, but with the 
same designation. It originated in a disapprobation of the Dis- 
pensary's adoption of the self-supporting system in 1834. It em 
braces no other object than the relief of the necessitous poor. It 
has not as yet published any table of results. 

Infirmary.-The erection of an Infirmary in Perth has been 
long desired and long contemplated. It is now in progress. Funds 
to the extent of about L. 5000 have been realized, and the building 
agreeably to an approved plan drawn by Mr Mackenzie, architect' 
is far advanced. When finished, it will be capable of receiving 
titty-six patients. The foundation was laid on the 5th of October 

pertr 6 Honourable Lord Kinnaird, with masonic honours.

Friendly Societies.— About the time that the Highland Society 
directed its attention to the ascertainment of the true principles 
upon which friendly societies should be founded, there were m 
Perth eighteen in active operation, viz. the first, second, and 
third shoemaker's, the coachman's, the mason's, the labourer's, the 
carter's, the fisher's, the stocking-maker's, the cabinet-maker's, the 
Scone and Perth free-mason's, the provident, the new Row, the 
High Street, the South Street, the Pomarium weavers', societies. 
The " first shoemaker's society," and the « coachman's," were in- 
stituted in 1776. The former continued fifty-nine years; the 
others were gradually formed in succession. When the Highland 
Society's report was published, the most of them were experien- 
cing difficulties which sprung from their originators being ignorant 
of the true principles on which they should have proceeded. The 
light thrown upon the subject by this report, the subsequent 
attempt of Government to legislate upon it, and various internal 
causes, threw them into a state of alarm, and although many of 
them were possessed of considerable funds, and, with good manage- 
ment, might have struggled through, yet, in the course of a very 
few years, the great majority of them were abandoned. Those 
now in existence are " the Scone and Perth," the » mason's," the 
« carter's," and the " labourer's," but even these are in a languish- 
ing condition. Little can be said of the benefits resulting from 
them to the community. That the community was ever much 
benefited by these institutions is questionable, for though many 
individuals and families received timely relief while in distress by 
their means, they were accompanied with evils of a deteriorating 
description. 

In the early period of the Societies' history, the members were 
very reluctant to be put upon the fund. Indeed, it was consider- 
ed by some of them as equivalent to being put upon a pauper 
fund. It very often happened that individuals in distress would 
defer reporting themselves for eight days or a fortnight, to see 
whether they might not get better, and render application to the 
fund unnecessary. This reluctance, however, soon evaporated, 
and at length it happened that no sooner was an individual affect- 
ed with a slight cold, or headach, or trifling temporary ailment, 
than he was reputed to be sick, and immediately received for a 
week or two something in the shape of aliment. Others again 
who were members of two or three societies, would continue on the 
sick list, drawi ngmore money than they were able when in health

to earn, at their ordinary employments. These things were ob- 
served by the honest-minded and industrious members, and a 
spirit of jealousy and discontent was engendered in their minds 
even against those who were in real distress. 

Their frequent meetings for business was another evil. Most 
of the societies laid out their funds in the purchase of property. 
That required many committees, in which disputes arose which 
could not be finally settled without a meeting of all the members. 
These meetings not only consumed much time, but not unfre- 
quently ended in an adjournment to some public-house, where the 
matter was of new discussed, and where, amidst bumpers drunk to 
the prosperity of the institution, &amp;c. scenes of not the most sober 
description took place. 

It was not unfrequently the case, that some of the principal orators 
had, through their benevolent and disinterested exertions at these 
seasons, to be placed on the sick list, and receive aliment for a 
week or two. 

Banks.— There are two provincial banks,— the Perth Bank, and 
the Central Bank; and four branch banks,— one of the Bank of 
Scotland ; another of the British Linen Company ; a third, of the 
Commercial ; and a fourth, of the National. 

Saving Banks. —There is a savings bank in Perth. It was formed 
in the year 1815. The sum at present lodged is L. 3188, 13s. lOd. 
The sum deposited this year, 1836, is L. 381, 16s. 9£d. ' The' 
sum drawn is L. 334, 19s. 8d. The investments are generally 
made by the labouring classes out of their savings. When the 
deposit of any one amounts to L. 10, he is required to draw it and 
lodge it elsewhere. The interest allowed is 3 per cent. The 
bank is open every Monday morning at nine o'clock. It would 
be to the benefit of the industrious poor and for the well-be- 
ing of the country, though not to the interest of the banking cor- 
porations, were the Government scheme of such institutions intro- 
duced. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— There are two separate funds out 
of which the poor receive aliment. One arises from an assessment 
on the whole inhabitants of the parish, producing, at five per cent 
on the real rent, L. 2128, 13s. 3d. The other arises from the 
collections, &amp;c. in the Established churches, amounting to L 723 
5s. 2±d.; in all L. 2851, 18s. 5d. From this sum must be de- 
ducted the expenses of management, which for the assessed fund, 



132 PERTHSHIRE. 

are L. 88, 6s. 3£d, and for the church fund, L. 25,— in all L. 1 13, 
6s. 3id. 

The funds arising from the assessment are distributed to the 
poor of the parish generally, without any respect to religious 
denominations. The funds arising from the church collec- 
tions are distributed to the poor belonging to the Established 
church, and to those especially who are advanced in life, as they 
are supposed to have contributed to these in the days of their 
strength and prosperity. The parish was in 1807 divided into four 
parishes by a decreet of the Court of Session, and it was ordered 
in that decreet, that the money collected for the poor in each 
church should be placed at the disposal of the sessions of the four 
parishes, forming one general session. This general session ac- 
cordingly distributes these funds. It has a meeting on the first 
Thursday of every month for this purpose. It has been alleged 
that the proceeds of these two funds should be thrown together as 
a common stock for the support of the parish poor generally. But 
to this there are material objections. The Dissenters and Se- 
ceders have collections at the doors of their meeting-houses for 
their own poor exclusively, and they will not consent that these 
collections shall form part of a common stock for the parochial 
poor. If, therefore, the legally assessed funds, and the Establish- 
ed Church charities, be made common stock, the poor connected 
with the Establishment will be in less favourable circumstances 
than the poor in connection with the Secession. It is reasonable 
that if the church door collections be joined to the assessed funds, 
so should the meeting-house collections. 

The number who receive out of the session funds is 219 ; and 
the number who receive out of the assessed funds is 576 ; but a 
good many poor receive out of both. 

The following Incorporations give to their poor members, whose 
number at present is 217,

There are charity societies. The sums distributed by them in 
the year 1833 were as follows : by the Destitute Sick Society, 
L. 74, 6s. 6d. ; by the Aged and Indigent Female Society, 
L. 67,' 10s. ; by the Society for Clothing Indigent Females, L. 60, 
18s. 5d. ; by the Society for Clothing Old Men, L. 118, 8s. 6d. The

free proceeds accruing to the poor from the hospital of King James 
VI. is on an average L. 435, 5s. Id. — and those accruing to them 
from the mortifications of Butter and Jackson are L. 312, 10s. 

I have not access to know to what extent the Seceders and Dis 
senters contribute to the support of their poor. 

It may not be out of place here to state, that there is a charity 
school for young females, supported by a subscription ; the sum 
subscribed is about L. 46, — two for infants, supported by a sub- 
scription also ; the sum subscribed is L. 50, — one for the poor 
generally, supported by the magistrates and council — the accommo- 
dation furnished by the hospital ; the sum given is L. 50, there is 
also a dispensary for the poor ; the sum subscribed is about L. 50. 
The sum total, arising from these sources, may thus be about L. 196. 

There is no indisposition in the great body of the poor to ap- 
ply for parochial relief. The high-toned feeling of independence, 
which at one time characterized the lower orders of society in Scot- 
land, is now seldom to be met with in town and country parishes, that 
are densely peopled ; and by few comparatively is mendicity account- 
ed degrading. The causes of the poverty, which exists in Perth, 
are various. Among women, they are chiefly the want of suitable 
employment, such as spinning, knitting, &amp;c. by which many of 
them were wont to earn a comfortable subsistence ; and, in not a few 
cases, to improvident marriages, and an extravagance in dress, and 
living, which they have unfortunately acquired when in the service 
of the more opulent. Among men, they are chiefly the frailties 
of age, or weakness occasioned by diseases, which incapacitate 
them from engaging in laborious work. I lament that I am ne- 
cessitated to confess, that no small number of poverty cases in 
Perth must be ascribed to habits of intemperance, in both men and 
women, — an evil which the increased n umber ofdram-drinking- shops 
has greatly promoted. 

The great proportion of those who are on the Perth pauper list 
are foreigners. They have come down from the Highlands of the 
county, driven from their cottages, and pendicles, and little farms, 
by the unpatriotic and illiberal system, prosecuted by some proprie- 
tors, of letting out their estates to a few individuals. They come 
with the miserable capital of a few pounds, scraped together with 
much toil and industry, into the town, and generally at an advan- 
ced stage of life. There it is soon spent, and they sink into pau- 
perism. 

Police.— The police is administered under two statutes, obtain- 



134 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ed in 1811 and 1819. The commissioners are, the Lord Pro- 
vost, the Dean of Guild, and the four bailies, seven members of 
the guildry, and one member for each of the seven incorporated 
trades chosen by these bodies, according to certain statutory rules. 
The territory is divided into a certain number of districts and 
wards. The power of the commissioners extends to paving, clean- 
ing, loaded carriages, gunpowder, &amp;c. and the regulation of the 
market-places. When any cause of complaint occurs, the matter 
is brought before the Lord Provost, or one of the bailies, by the 
procurator-fiscal of the city, or the police superintendent, or it is 
Drought before the sheriff-depute of the county, or his substitutes, 
by the procurator-fiscal of the county, or the police superintendent. 
Power is given to commit to hard labour or solitary confinement, 
for a period not exceeding sixty days, and to impose a fine not ex- 
ceeding L. 5. 

The bill of 1819 was obtained to amend and correct what was 
wrong and awanting in that of 1811. But still there is a material 
defect in the police establishment of the city. In all criminal cases 
it is complete ; but it is not so in those cases which affect the com- 
fort and safety of the inhabitants. Whatever nuisance or obstruc- 
tion takes place in the streets may be found fault with by the su- 
perintendent, and complained of to the judge, but he is without au- 
thority to effect the removal of these, and punish the transgressor, 
by a summary procedure. Recourse must be had at common law, 
which is at once tedious and expensive. It is principally owing to 
this that those nuisances take place in the city, which occasion fre- 
quent and severe animadversions from strangers and others. But 
neither the police magistrate nor the superintendent is to be blam- 
ed, but the bad construction of the bill. It is essentially defec- 
tive, and never will the peace, and comfort, and good order of the 
town be effectually secured till another be obtained, constructed 
upon a more comprehensive principle. 

Besides, the operation of the bill, such as it is, does not embrace 
sufficiently extensive bounds. It extends very little beyond the 
royalty. This is an evil of great magnitude. The population without 
the royalty is fully greater than it is within, and there is no visible 
line of demarcation between the habitations in the one place and 
those in the other. It is the interest, therefore, of the whole com- 
munity, both within and without burgh, to unite, without delay, and 
apply for a legislative enactment, extending the police establish- 
ment over the whole suburban population. Hints may be most ad-

Prisons. The number of persons committed to the jail of Perth 

during the year ending October 1835, from, the city and county, 
was 375. Causes of committal stand thus : 



Assault ... 222 Contempt of court, 

Theft, ' - - 100 Issuing of base coin, - - 2 

Poaching, - - 25 Fire raising, - 3 

Forgery, - - -7 Trespassing, - - - 2 

Murder, - - - 3 Rioting, 2 

Rape, 1 Derangement, • - 7 



About 70 more were committed for a few days from other coun- 
ties to be tried at the Circuit Court. 

The prison is reckoned to be very secure. Only two or three pri- 
soners have effected an escape since its first occupation, which was 
in 1819. The ground floor is not sufficiently ventilated. Three 
prisoners sleep in one cell, and four in each of the rooms, but in 
separate hammocks. They are allowed to associate daily in the air- 
ing-ground, and in a dirty day room in complete idleness, thus neu- 
tralizing all attempts at reformation. Each prisoner is allowed per 
day one-half quartern loaf, and a portion of oat-meal and milk. The 
superintendence is by a jailor and turnkey, who live within the pre- 
cincts. There is no matron to take the superintendence of the fe- 
male prisoners. A chaplain was appointed about three years ago, 
who gives instruction through the week, and preaches twice on the 
Lord's day. 

The inspector of prisons in Scotland, Mr Hill, reports as follows : 
" Very little good effect can be produced by imprisonment in the 
Perth jail. The number of recommittals is very considerable, as 
may be inferred from the fact, that two of the prisoners at present 
in it both women have been there more than twenty times be- 
fore. Indeed, it is believed that no small number of the lowest 
class at Perth are well content to be in the prison occasionally, as 
they fare better there than at home, and are not required to do 
any work. The conduct of the prisoners is generally bad, and 
sometimes very turbulent. Occasionally, they enact what they 
call a " Hell scene." "[Having assembled in the day-room, and 
provided a plentiful supply of water, they put out the candles, and 
then, amidst shouts and yells, and other discordant noises, and ut- 
tering revolting exclamations, they pull the fire to pieces, and fling 
the live coals round in every direction ; others, at the same time, 
dashing water about, and in every way creating uproar and confu- 
sion."  £ It is but justice to the town-coun- 



13G 



PERTHSHIRE. 



cil of Perth to state, that they have not been inattentive to the 
condition of the prison. About three years ago, they appointed a 
committee of their number to inquire fully into the subject. The 
report of this committee points out many of the existing evils in a 
forcible manner, and strongly recommends the erection of a bride- 
well at the joint expense of the burgh and county." 

The old prison at the foot of the High Street, abandoned in 
the year 1819, when the present one was erected, has been lately 
fitted up partly for a police-office, and partly for a small bridewell 
establishment for police prisoners, on the principle of complete se- 
paration. It contains eight cells, one of which is without light, and 
is intended for such as are violent and refractory. Each prisoner is 
provided with a hammock and a seat. The hammocks are carried out 
in the morning into the lobby, by the prisoners in rotation ; there 
they are hung up for airing during the day. Each in his turn washes 
in the lobby, and returns immediately to his cell. They are made 
to work in teasing hair or picking oakum, or at their own ordinary 
employments, if circumstances will admit of it. The arrangement 
of the cells is such that they cannot converse or communicate with 
one another, nor with any one excepting the jailor, when he attends 
to their wants, and the chaplain, when he visits them in his official 
capacity. For aliment, they are allowed two diets during the day, 
— in the morning they have oatmeal porridge and milk ; and at 
three o'clock afternoon, they have broth and bread. Thus fed, 
they enjoy excellent health. The, beneficial effects of this small 
establishment cannot yet be sppken of with confidence, as it has 
existed but little more than twelve months. But there are very 
encouraging grounds of hope, that substantial good has accrued 
from it to several of those who have been there confined. In the 
common jail, the prisoners are necessarily exposed to contamina- 
tion of every kind. A prisoner of comparatively decent character 
is made the associate of persons, the most profligate and aban- 
doned, — the consequence of which is, that the majority leave 
the prison not only unreformed, but more vitiated in principle. But 
here the prisoners are privileged to have a well regulated discipline, 
calculated to produce in their minds sober reflection on their past 
irregularities, and to lead them to a new and better course of living. 

From August 1835 to August 1836, there were thirty-nine 
committals. The average number of days to each was thirty-six 
and a fraction, say thirty-six. The expense incurred beyond the 

 The prison must have been originally very small, for it was not till 1666 that 
the back or northern division of it was erected.

prisoner's earnings, including aliment, washing, and a sum of mo- 
ney given to each at his dismissal, was L.10, 4s. 9d., or If d. each 
per day. 

This is an experiment which has wrought well, and reflects 
much credit on Bailies Graham and Dewar, with whom it ori- 
ginated, and under whose judicious and vigorous superintend- 
ence it has been conducted. It was warmly opposed by some 
members of the town-council, when these gentlemen at first sug- 
gested it as a measure of prison discipline entitled to consideration. 
Upon what principle the opposition proceeded, one may not pre- 
sume to say, but the result distinctly shows that it could not be one 
of a sound saving economy,— for while the prisoners in the common 
jail cost the town upon an average 5d. each per day, those who 
are here confined cost the town only lfd. per day. Those who 
are entrusted with the charge of a public jail should consider that 
their duty is not the mere keeping of the inmates in safe durance 
and economically, but also and principally to make them the sub- 
jects of a rational moral discipline, with the view of sending them 
back to society corrected and reformed. 

Some Ladies in the city and neighbourhood have, with a most 
praiseworthy zeal for the good of the female prisoners, formed 
themselves into an association for visiting and instructing them. 
As classification is impossible in the present state of the prison, 
there being a want of the requisite apartments, little good can be 
expected in the meantime to result from their exertions. But 
their zeal and active virtue may bring about what other agencies 
have failed to attain — such a system of prison discipline, as may 
operate successfully, on the moral condition of the objects of their 
compassion. 

In the unoccupied portion of the old prison there is abundant 
room for the erection of as many cells as have been got up for the 
police male prisoners ; and it is in contemplation to have them 
constructed for the reception of female police prisoners. 

Courts. — The Justiciary Court meets in Perth twice in the year, 
spring and autumn. 

 This old prison is obviously a building of great antiquity. Its architecture and 
generaLappearance verify the tradition, that it was a part of St Mary's or our Lady's 
Chapel, before the Reformation. Between it and the river, and close by the old 
bridge stood the chapel, which Fordun says was destroyed funditus in 1210, along 
with the bridge. The existing building was most probably reared up in its stead, 
but removed for safety a little farther from the river's edge. It is all that remains 
of the Popish chapels in the city. In 1578-9 the masters of the hospital got per- 
emptory instructions to " warn the possessors of it to remove, and to insist diligently 
in pursuit thereof."

PERTHSHIRE. 



The Sheriff- Court is divided over two districts, those of Perth 
and Dunblane. At Perth the court is held every Wednesday and 
Friday of the sessions. At Dunblane, it is held every Wednesday 
of the sessions. 

Fairs. — There are two weekly fairs or markets in the city, on 
Wednesdays and Fridays. That held on the Friday is the princi- 
pal one. The chief business is among the farmers of the neigh- 
bourhood, who convene at the cross, give and receive intelligence 
on the subject of current prices, or of whatever in any way affects 
the agricultural interests of the country. It is the day when but- 
ter, eggs, &amp;c. are brought in for sale, and when, as was particu- 
larly the case in former times, housewives lay in their stock of 
provisions for the week. 

But there are also what may be called great fairs or markets in 
the course of the year. 1. The first of Luke, the first hail ouk 
of March. It is held on the first Friday of that month. Horses 
and cattle are sold at it. — 2. Palm-sun-even. It is held on the first 
Friday of April. Cattle, barley, lintseed, and grass seed are sold 
at it. — 3. Midsummer. It is held on the first Friday of July. It 
is a season of holyday enjoyment among the peasantry, when they 
repair to the town to meet with one another. Farm-servants were 
formerly hired on this day. The sale of horses and cattle is usual- 
ly great. — 4. St John's day. It is held on the first Friday of Sep- 
tember. The principal articles sold at it are salted butter and 
c } ieese . — 5. Little Dunning or St Dennis. It is held on the third 
Friday of October, f It also is a butter and cheese market, and 
is" the understood time for hiring servants for the year. — 6. An- 
drew's Mass. It is held on the 11th day of December. It is at 
this season that tenants of houses give up their leases, or enter on 
new ones for the following year. 

Inns and Alehouses. — The number of these in the parish is 249. 
As to their effects on the morals of the people, I have no hesi- 
tation in saying that they are most lamentable. Inns and ale- 
houses in every such town are necessary. But when there is an 
excess of them, and license is given without a scrupulous attention 
to the character of the applicants, the morals of the place must 
suffer ; and Perth affords a most distressing demonstration of the 
fact. In the public streets, and in the private lanes and closes, 

 The right to hold this market or fair was granted by Charles on his visit to 
Perth 1633. 

+ There is in the town record for 1 670 an account of expenses incurred by the 
Provost in procuring from Parliament a fifth mercat, to be held on the 9th of October 
on the North Inch, for cattle. 



PERTH.

there are small houses in which tippling is carried on to a fearful ex- 
tent, by day and by night— and in which, as the police books can 
testify, the most worthless characters are found to congregate, and 
from which they often issue in the night season, to the annoyance of 
the sober citizens. To the existence of these houses may be easily 
traced the poverty and domestic wretchedness of many a family. 
We condemn the infatuated beings who frequent them, but equal- 
ly, nay more, worthy of condemnation is the Publican who, to gain 
a livelihood, encourages the dissipated in the habits of dissipation. 
And those incur a heavy responsibility who, either directly or indi- 
rectly, contribute to the increase of those foul pest-houses of the 
city and neighbourhood, by aiding their procurement of the license. 
When from some of those places, and on account of improper 
conduct, the license is threatened to be taken away, it is often 
pleaded, and too often successfully, that that would " break the 
poor man's bread," or ruin some poor family, or poor widow, who, 
being the proprietor of the house, depends for subsistence on the 
rent — for the rent of a tippling-house is always high ; but a sound 
regard to the moral order of the community should, with every 
magistrate and justice of the peace, be paramount. Certificates 
of character from the clergymen of the city are not required. — 
And wherefore  

Besides the 249 inns and alehouses, there are 74 grocer shops, 
in which spirits and beer are sold, and in not a few of which, spirits 
in single glasses, and in very small quantities, are sold over the 
counter. This is a fruitful source of intemperance among the 
lower orders, as it brings the getting of the article within the power 
of the poorest who have a penny to squander. It is no matter of 
wonder that intemperance prevails, when such and so many facili- 
ties abound to encourage it. It is a disgraceful fact, that some of 
these dram-drinking shops are kept by persons of religious profes- 
sion. The sellers of spirits and beer are at present 249 + 74 = 
323 

Fuel. — With respect to the fuel used in Perth, it is pit-coal. 
There are no coal mines nearer than twenty miles — in Fifeshire. 
The article, therefore, is brought by sea from Newcastle, and from 
the coast of Fife. It is sold both by measure and weight. The 
met measure contains three bushels, which is equal to 2 cwt. or 16 
stones imperial. The price of that quantity varies according to 
the expense of sea carriage, from Is. 6d. to 2s.

portance which the city must have had in ancient times. It was a 
walled city, but the period when it became so is unknown. 

After the battle of Falkirk in 1298, Edward L of England 
having reduced all the fortresses in Scotland, strongly fortified 
Perth, and repeatedly made it the residence of his deputies. For 
some time, his son Edward, who succeeded him, resided in the 
city. He was succeeded by Sir Aymer de Vallence, who defeat- 
ed Robert Bruce at Methven 1306. In 1311, King Robert 
stormed the town, which was fortified by an English garrison. 
At the head of a chosen band he waded through the deep water 
m the moat, and was the second man who mounted the wall. 
He put the garrison to the sword, razed the walls and filled up 
the moat. In 1335, Edward III. strongly fortified it, laid the ex- 
pense on six rich abbacies,  and appointed Sir Thomas Ochtred, 
Governor. In 1339, Robert the Lord High Steward, who was 
afterwards raised to the throne, laid siege to it. The siege 
continued for four months. By means of mines, the water in the 
moat was drained off, and the place becoming untenable, the Go- 
vernor surrendered. In 1443, it was besieged and taken by Sir 
William Wallace. In 1644, after the battle of Tippermore, it was 
taken possession of by the Marquis of Montrose. In 1651, 
Cromwell, when about to besiege it, proposed honourable terms, 
and gained possession of it ; and to overawe its inhabitants, built 
a strong citadel on the South Inch. In 1715, the Earl of Marr, 
and the rebels took refuge in it, after the battle of Dunblane, and 
kept possession till they were dislodged by the Duke of Argyle. 
In 1745, the rebels again obtained possession of it, and attempt- 
ed to repair the fortifications, but the government forces followed 
them, and compelled them to retreat. 

In 1769, Sir David Dalrymple published " Historical Memo- 
rials, concerning the provincial councils of the Scottish clergy, 
from the earliest accounts to the era of the Reformation." From 
these memorials it appears that they were held in Edinburgh, 
Perth, Dundee, St Andrews, Linlithgow, Scone, Roxburgh, Car- 
lisle, Northampton, and York, to the number of 37. Of this 
number sixteen were held in Perth, in 1201, 1206, 1211, 1221, 
1242, 1269, 1275, 1280, 1321, 1420, 1428, 1436, 1450, 1457, 
1459, 1465. 

 Major, the historian, says—" ex sumptuosis lapidibus urbis muros extrui jubet 
sex senobiorum expensis scilicet, Sancti Andrea, Dunfermilingae Lundoris, Balmu- 
rinoch, Arbrothae, et Cupri ; et arces aliquot reparare jussit, scilicet, Sanctum An- 
dream, Lochris, Strivilingum, Puellarum Arcem, et Koxburgum inquibus, suoscus- 
todes et Locumtenentes locavit." — Lib. v.

To those who are acquainted with the localities of the city 
and its neighbourhood, it may be somewhat interesting to have 
the following facts brought before them. The walls, which were 
once esteemed a sufficiently strong protection, have complete- 
ly disappeared, except in one place on the north side, where 
a small fragment remains. The fosse or aqueduct which sur- 
rounded the walls, and which was broad and open, has been 
much reduced in breadth, and been, since about 1802, arched 
over, on the south, and on part of the west side. Before this 
took place, Canal Street was an unpaved and narrow pathway, 
along which ran the aqueduct. Between it and the South Inch 
there were gardens, which, having originally their principal en- 
trance by the Spey Port, were called the Spey Gardens. In 1801, 
Marshall Place, on the South Inch, began to be built. This occa- 
sioned the removal of the gardens, and the cutting down of the 
northern division of a beautiful avenue of lofty trees which sur- 
rounded the Inch. 

The road to Inverness via Dunkeld was, at a remote period, 
nearly where it now is, only it commenced at the High Street Port, 
passed through the Miln Wynde, and the field on which the barracks 
stand. Its course, as far as to the Bridge of Almond, was changed, 
at an after period, — and, commencing at the north end of the 
Skinner Gate, where was the North Port, ran through the centre of 
the North Inch, and the Muirtoun village. In 1664-5, missives 
passed between the town-council and the presbytery of Dunkeld, 
" as to the helping of the Muirtoun causeway." The present line 
of road was formed about the year 1790. Before this time, the 
north road to Stirling via Methven and Crieff, commenced at 
the High Street Port, and ran by Dove-cot-land, and Goodly Burn. 
The south road to Stirling commenced at the South Street Port, 
and ran by the Hospital House, Earls Dykes, and Pittheaveless 
Castle. The road to Edinburgh commenced at the same port, 
and ran by Leonard Causeway, and the Bridge of Craigie. It 
was afterwards changed, when it issued from the Spey Port, 
and passed to Mordun Hill, through the east side of the South 
Inch — intersecting the ruins of Cromwell's Citadel. The present 
road to Edinburgh by Princes Street was not opened till about 
the year 1770. The bridge over the Tay to the east of the city, 
which was destroyed by a flood in 1621, was not replaced till 1771. 
The river was crossed by means of boats and barges, which plied 
between the Quay at the foot of the High Street, and that on the

opposite shore — called the Gibraltar. Immediately after the 
building of the bridge, George Street, leading from it to the 
High Street, was opened. Charlotte Street, leading from the 
bridge also to the Dunkeld road, was not built till 1783. John 
Street, lying between the High Street and South Street, was 
opened in the year 1801. The suburban population was very in- 
considerable, till within these fifty years. Within that period al- 
most all the houses on the south of the city, including Pomarium, 
have been built, — and a great portion of those which are on the north 
and west. But the populous viaglles of Balhousie and Muirtoun, 
in the neighbourhood, have been thrown down, or allowed to fall 
into decay.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. THOMAS CLARK, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, fyc. — It is not known by tradition, neither 
is it to be found upon record, that this parish ever had any other 
name than that which it now bears, the orthography of which, it is 
said, is derived from the Gaelic word " Meodhan" signifying " mid- 
dle ;" and it is understood that the name, or rather the word from 
which the name is derived, has special reference to the situation of 
the parish, in regard to the Great Strath, or Strathmore, which ex- 
tends from Stonehaven on the east, to Dumbarton on the west, and 
is bounded on the north by the Grampians, and on the south by 
the ridge of the Ochil hills, — near the centre or middle of which 
strath this parish is situated. 

The average length of the parish from east to west is 5 miles, 
and the breadth from north to south between 3 and 4. The whole 
area is estimated at about 17 square miles, or, more accurately, 
10,700 imperial acres. It is bounded chiefly on the north and on 
the east, by the river Almond ; on the west, by the parish of Fow- 

 This Account has been chiefly drawn up by Mr R. Wilson, schoolmaster, Meth- 
ven ; and Mr Thomas Bishop, overseer, Methven Castle.

lis Wester, and on the south, by a small stream, called the Pow, 
which separates it from the parishes of Madderty, Findo Gask, 
and Tibbermore. We have said chiefly on the north, because the 
Almond runs through part of the parish in that direction ; the lands 
which constituted the original estate of Lynedoch more properly 
Lednoch forming part of this parish, are situated on the north 
bank of that river. 

Topographical Appearances. — There is neither hill nor lake of 
any note in the parish, but the surface is agreeably diversified by 
hollows and rising ground, and as the higher parts are in general 
tastefully laid out in patches of thriving plantation, the landscape 
effect in many instances is highly creditable to the taste and skill 
of the proprietors. 

Soil. — The soil consists principally of clay, but there are tracts 
of considerable extent, both of loam and gravel, with moorish soil, 
recumbent on a tilly bottom. With the exception of 100 acres of 
moss, and about 250 acres of moor, the land in the parish is all either 
in a state of cultivation, or under plantations. There is a tract of up- 
wards of 1000 imperial acres towards the north part of the parish, 
which, until about forty years ago, was a common ; but soon after 
that time, it was divided among the heritors and feuars in the pa- 
rish, and is now in a comparatively high state of cultivation. Here, 
now, several farm-steadings are erected, and many families decent- 
ly and respectably supported, and wealth is now derived from, and 
comfort enjoyed upon, this extensive tract of ground, which was 
formerly a perfect waste. So much for the spirit of enterprise and 
the hand of industry. 

Climate and Diseases. — The climate may be said to be mild and 
salubrious, especially towards the south, for the lands in the parish 
in general have a southern exposure ; but in the northern parts, 
the climate is not so genial, evidently on account of their greater 
elevation above the level of the sea, and of their proximity to the 
Grampians, from which the boundary of this parish on the north- 
west is not farther distant than a mile and a half. It is evident, 
however, that the climate here has undergone a very material im- 
provement since the year 1793, when the former Statistical Ac- 
count was written, both from the agricultural improvements effect- 
ed since that period, by the important operations of draining, and, 
not less so, from the great extent of land in the parish, now cover- 
ed with thriving plantations, which was then in little else than a 
state of bleak barrenness.

PERTHSHIRE. 



It cannot be said that there is any distemper, disease, or species 
of sickness peculiar to this parish, and we may regard it rather as 
remarkable for health and longevity than otherwise. Several of the 
parishioners have, from time to time, attained very advanced ages, 
one of whom, a female, died in the month of August last, in the hun- 
dredth year of her age. It may not be improper to notice here a 
fact, which we consider worthy of record, namely, that in the year 
1832, when that scourge of the human race, cholera, was permitted 
to visit this country, and to commit its mournful devastations in 
some of the neighbouring parishes, the inhabitants of this parish 
were not only mercifully preserved from that direful visitation, but 
the mortality here that year did not much exceed the half of the 
average annual mortality for the seven years immediately preced- 
ing, or for that of the four years that have since elapsed. 

Meteorology. — The prevailing winds are from the W. and S. W., 
and it is from these points we have the greatest quantity of rain. 
We have also occasionally very heavy rains from the east, and in the 
spring months we have frequently cold and stormy weather from 
that quarter. A register of the weather has been regularly kept 
here for many years, at an elevation of about 300 feet above the 
level of the sea, from which we have constructed the following 

Meteorological Table.

Hydrography. — The Almond, which is a bold and rapid cur- 
rent, though it intersects a portion of the parish at Lynedoch, is 
rather a boundary to this parish than a river belonging to it. It 
takes its rise among the hills which lie between Loch Earn and 
Loch Tay. It winds its way through the steep and rugged moun- 
tains of Glenalmond, receiving in its course the numerous tribu- 
tary streams which descend, through the extensive tract, of Logie- 
almond, from the hills on the north, — passes this parish, — becomes 

3 



METHVEN. 



145 



a boundary between the parishes of Redgorton and Tibbermore, 
and falls into the Tay two miles and a half above Perth. As it 
passes Lynedoch House, the seat of the Right Honourable Lord 
Lynedoch, and the woods at Methven Castle, the seat of Robert 
Smythe, Esq. which are contiguous, the scenery is grand and pic- 
turesque, and furnishes some views, which, for beauty and roman- 
tic effect, are rarely surpassed. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The sole rocks in this district belong 
to the old red sandstone or trap groups. On the line of the river 
Almond, up to near Lynedoch, as well as throughout the southern 
part of the parish, the sandstone is of a bright-red colour with 
greyish spots, and dipping slightly towards the north. This is soft 
and friable, containing large portions of clay and lime ; it quickly 
moulders down by the action of the air. At the new bridge of 
Lynedoch, a thick-bedded, fine-grained, pale gray sandstone makes 
its appearance, and occupies all the north-western parts of the pa- 
rish. This is worked as a building stone, and is eminently adapted 
for architectural purposes. In the space of less than two miles from 
Pitcairn, up the Almond, no fewer than five veins or dikes of trap 
cross the country, from north-east to south-west, nearly parallel to 
each other. These are chiefly of that variety called greenstone, 
and afford excellent quarries for road metal and causeway stones. 
One of these veins, which appears at Cromwell Park dam dike, 
has a singular aspect. The middle portion is amorphous trap, like 
the cement of an old castle wall, while on both sides of it, like the 
hewn ashler work, are walls of horizontal basaltic columns, lying at 
right angles to the axis of the vein. The whole may be about fifty 
feet in thickness. There are no minerals found in the parish wor- 
thy of notice, or not of ordmary occurrence in similar localities, if 
we except the innumerable veins of satin-spar with which the red 
argillaceous sandstone is everywhere intersected. These vary 
from an inch and a half to an eighth of an inch in thickness, but 
they are too friable and ill-coloured to be of any value. 

Botany.— A considerable number of plants might be enume- 
rated, as natives of this parish, and rarely to be found in other 
districts of the country, but notice shall be taken only of the 
following few, which are rare. 1. Corallorhiza innata, found 
m the wood of Methven in 1804, being upwards of thirty years 
from the time that it had been previously found in the country. 
It ceases to show itself in flower when the coppice is cut down 
around it, until it be again protected with the shade of the younsr

shoots. The Epipactis grandiflora, latifolia, and ensifolia are 
also found in the same wood, as also are the Listera nidus-avis, 
Paris quadrifolia, Chrysoplenium altcrnifulium, and Convallaria 
majalis, the latter in great abundance ; the Erigeron alpinus, on 
a rock by the side of the Almond, near to the house of Lynedoch, 
— and in a morass near the south boundary of the parish and close 
by the turnpike road from Perth to Crieff, the Scheuchzeria pa- 
lustris, this being its only habitat as yet known in Scotland. 

Woods and Plantations.— The natural woods occupy about 260 
imperial acres, and are contiguous to the banks of the Almond. 
They consist chiefly of oak, Quereus pedwiculata, with a mix- 
ture of birch, ash, alder, and hazel. The Quereus sessiliflora is not 
indigenous here. These woods have been treated as coppice 
for some hundreds of years, and they are still periodically cut 
as such, at a proper age. Some of the aged reserves are oc- 
casionally taken away, and some of the best seedling growths left 
to supply their place. There are about 1500 acres under planted 
trees of intermediate ages, from 150 years old and downwards; and 
to these, annual additions are making, not only of species which 
are indigenous, or which have long been naturalized, but also of 
others recently imported. The soil in general appears to be 
most congenial to the oak, producing timber of great durability. 
Beech also succeeds well on all the hard-bottomed land that has 
been previously under cultivation ; and on moor soils the larch 
thrives uncommonly well, of which there are several hundred acres, 
which for quality cannot be surpassed. 

Remarkable Trees. — A noble and venerable ash, known by the 
name of the Bell Tree, supposed to be coeval with the first religi- 
ous establishment in this parish, stands in the west corner of the 
churchyard. At 3 feet above the surface of the ground, this tree 
measures 20 feet in circumference ; and it contains in all 380 cubic 
feet of timber. Forty years ago it exhibited a magnificent top, 
but, wearied, as it were, of its former pliancy, it now chooses ra- 
ther to break than bow, and yearly it does homage to the soil which 
nourishes it, by surrendering a portion of its withered branches. 

The Pepper Well oak at Methven Castle is a tree of great pic- 
turesque beauty, and contains 700 cubic feet of wood ; the trunk 
measures 17 feet in circumference at 3 feet above the ground, 
and its branches cover a space of 98 feet in diameter. It has at- 
tained an increase in girth of 3 feet since the year 1796. In the 
vear 1722, 100 merks Scots were offered for this tree, and tradi-

tion reports that there is a stone in the heart of it, but, like the 
Golenos oak, it must be cut up to ascertain this. 

A black Italian poplar, Populus acckdesca, stands by the burn- 
side at Tippermallo, which was planted on the 5th May 1776. By 
a measurement of it taken in 1836, it was found to contain 300 
cubic feet of timber; at 3 feet from the ground the girth is 11 feet 
6 inches. There are perhaps but few instances of such a rapid 
increase of timber, this being at the rate of 5 feet yearly since it 
was planted. 

The management of woods and plantations is now better under- 
stood and more successfully practised than formerly, when the' error 
of planting too thick, which is still too prevalent, and of neglecting 
to thin in proper time, operated so injuriously against the rearing 
of timber trees. The planter by this method may have had in 
some instances an earlier return of profit, when small wood was 
in request, and this is the only recommendation which in gene- 
ral can be bestowed upon too thick planting. There is perhaps 
no proprietor in Scotland who has realized a greater amount for 
trees of his own planting than the venerable Lord Lynedoch, from 
w 7 hose plantations many thousands have been shipped to England. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, Robert Smythe, 
Esq. of Methven ; Lord Lynedoch ; Lord Elibank ; and Baroness 
Keith. The property belonging to the latter forms part of this 
parish only quoad civilia, and is situated at a distance of several 
miles north-east from the rest of the parish, on the confines of the 
parish of Auchtergaven, and at the bottom of the Grampian hills. 
The parish otherwise is of a compact form. The relative propor- 
tion of the lands in the parish, belonging to each of these proprie- 
tors, may be estimated at a half, a fourth, an eighth, and a sixteenth 
respectively, and the remainder, being about another sixteenth, is 
held by small proprietors and feuars. The ancient valuation of the 
parish, as appears by the county cess-books, and that by which the 
public rates are still charged, is L. 6400, 4s. 6d. Scots. 

Parish Register. — The earliest register of this parish extant, or 
known ever to have existed, appears to have been commenced in 
the year 1662, and, with the exception of nineteen years, that is 
from 1730 to 1749, the record has been continued up to the present 
time. This omission is supposed to have been occasioned bv the 
political troubles which then distracted the country, — at least no 
other cause for it can now be assigned. The register is not volu- 



148 



PERTHSHIRE. 



minous, considering the extensive period which it embraces, but, 
with the exception above noticed, it seems upon the whole to have 
been regularly kept. 

From this register we learn a fact which has perhaps but few 
parallels in the history of the church, namely, that the present in- 
cumbent is only the fourth presbyterian minister in this parish since 
the period of the Reformation. The first was Mr William Mon- 
crieff, who was ordained here on the 14th June 1694, and after 
a ministry of fifty-six years, was succeeded on the 12th December 
1750, by Dr James Oswald, who resigned the living in the year 

1783, and died in August 1793. Upon Dr Oswald's resignation, the 
Rev. John Dowe, who had then been eleven years minister of Can- 
nobie, in Dumfries-shire, was translated to this charge in February 

1784. He died in November 1823, and was succeeded in August 
following by the Rev. Thomas Clark, the present incumbent. 

Antiquities. — We take this article, without alteration, from the 
former Statistical Account written by the late Rev. John Dowe, 
who was eminently distinguished for extensive and authentic anti- 
quarian research, and whose authority we regard as unquestion- 
able. 

« The first mention found of Methven in history is about the 
year 970, when Colenus, reputed the 79th King of Scotland, is 
said to have been killed in its neighbourhood, by Rohard, Thane 
of Methven, whose daughter he had deflowered. Before 1323, 
the lands of Methven belonged to the Mowbrays, whose ancestor, 
Roger Mowbray, a Norman, came to England with William the 
Conqueror. The first religious establishment here was a pro- 
vostry or collegiate church, founded anno 1433, by Walter Stew- 
art Earl of Athol, who amply endowed it with lands and tithes, 
for the salvation of his soul, according to the superstition of those 
times ; and who was a principal actor in the horrid murder of King 
James I., his own nephew. An aisle, which was connected with the 
last church, appears, from a stone built in the wall, to have been 
erected by some of the royal family. On this stone is sculptured 
the Royal Lyon of Scotland, with the crown above, and there are 
some defaced illegible Saxon characters below. This aisle may 
have been built by Margaret the Queen Dowager, when she re- 
sided at the Castle of Methven. It is now the burying-place of 
the family of Methven." 

In reference to the Mowbrays above-mentioned, occasion is 



METHVEN. 



149 



taken to introduce the following illustrative note, which, in our 
opinion, is highly deserving of a place here. 

" A branch of this family afterwards established itself in Scot- 
land, and became very flourishing. To Sir Roger Mowbray be- 
longed the baronies of Kelly, Eckford, Dalmeny, and Methven, 
lying in the shires of Forfar, Roxburgh, Linlithgow, and Perth ; 
but for adhering to the Baliol and English interest, his lands were 
confiscated by Robert L 9 who bestowed Eckford, Kelly, and 
Methven on his son-inrlaw, Walter, the eighth hereditary Lord 
High Steward of Scotland, whose son, Robert, was afterwards 
King, and the second of the name, in right of his mother, Mar- 
jory Bruce, daughter of Robert I. The lordship of Methven was 
granted by him to Walter Stewart, Earl of Athol, his second son, 
by Euphame Ross, his second wife, and after his forfeiture remain- 
ed in the crown a considerable time. It became part of the 
dowery lands usually appropriated for the maintenance of the 
queen dowager of Scotland, together with the lordship and Castle 
of Stirling, and the lands of Balquhidder, &amp;c. all of which 
were settled on Margaret, Queen Dowager of James IV., who in the 
year 1524, having divorced her second husband, Archibald Earl 
of Angus, married Henry Stewart, second son of Andrew, Lord 
Evandale, afterwards Ochiltree, a descendant of Robert Duke of 
Albany, son of King Robert II. Margaret was the eldest daugh- 
ter of Henry VII. of England, in whose right James VI. of Scot- 
land, her great grandson, succeeded to that crown, on the death 
of Queen Elizabeth. She procured for her third husband a peer- 
age from her son, James V. under the title of Lord Methven, an- 
no 1528; and on this occasion the barony of Methven was dis- 
solved from the crown, and erected into a lordship in favour of 
Henry Stewart and his heirs-male, on the Queen's resigning her 
jointure of the lordship of Stirling. By Lord Methven she had 
a daughter, who died in infancy before herself. The Queen died 
at the Castle of Methven in 1540; and was buried at Perth, be- 
side the body of King James I. Lord Methven afterwards mar- 
ried Janet Stewart, daughter of the Earl of Athol, by whom he 
had a son, Henry II. Lord Methven, who married Jean, daughter 
of Patrick Lord Ruthven, and was killed at Broughton, by a can- 
non ball from the Castle of Edinburgh, in 1572, leaving a son, 
Henry III. Lord Methven, who died without issue. This third 
Lord Methven is mentioned on the authority of Stewarts Genea- 
logical Account of the House of Stewart. In the year 1584, the 



150 PERTHSHIRE 

Lordship of Methven and Balquhidder was conferred on Lodo- 
wick Duke of Lennox, in whose illustrious family it continued till 
it was purchased in 1664, by Patrick Smythe of Braco, great 
grandfather of the present Lord Methven, from Charles the last 
Duke, who dying without issue, anno 1672, his honours, of which 
Lord Methven was one, with his estate and hereditary offices, fell 
to Charles II. as his nearest male heir ; the King's great-grand- 
father and the Duke's being brothers." 

" It is only necessary to mention farther, under this article, that 
Bessy Bell and Mary Gray, celebrated in one of our most po- 
pular songs, are said to have been buried in this parish, about halt 
a mile west of the present house of Lednock." And that « the 
common tradition is, that Bessy Bell was daughter of the Laird 
of Kinvaid, and Mary Gray of the Laird of Lednock. Being 
near neighbours, a great intimacy subsisted between the young 
ladies. °When they were together at Lednock, the plague broke 
out, anno 1645 ; to avoid which they retired to a romantic spot 
called Burn Braes, on the estate of Lednock, where they lived 
for some time, but afterwards caught the infection from a young 
gentleman, an admirer of both, who came to visit them in their 
solitude : and here they died, and were buried at some distance 
from their bower, near a beautiful bank of the Almond." 

Resident Landed Proprietors.— The only landed proprietor per- 
manently resident is Robert Smythe, Esq. of Methven. Seat, 
Methven Castle, " which stands with a dignified appearance" on 
a bold and steep eminence in the park, where, according to Guthrie 
the historian, Bruce, in the year 1306, was defeated by the Earl 
of Pembroke. The castle is a good specimen of the style of an- 
cient baronial building, and was finished in the year 1 630. Its ori- 
ginal dimensions have been greatly enlarged by extensive addi- 
tions built to it from time to time, both by the late Lord Methven, 
and by the present proprietor, Mr Smythe. 

Lord Lynedoch, the only other landed proprietor, who has a 
seat in the parish, resides also occasionally at Lynedoch House or 
Cottage, which is pleasantly situated on the north bank of the Al- 
mond, and is justly celebrated for the beauty of the surrounding 
scenery. 

III. — Population. 
The actual statement of the population of this parish, at any 
very remote period,— if any such statement ever existed— cannot 
now be traced. The earliest account we have of it is in the year 



METHVEN. 



15 i 



1755, when it was said to be 1790. Again, in the year 1793, it 
was stated at 1786. It is supposed, however, that in each of 
these cases the population was estimated by the very imperfect 
mode of allowing three, four, or five individuals to each family. — 
a method, which, even under the most favourable circumstances, 
can be viewed only as an approximation to the truth, while in no 
case can it be depended upon, if any thing like accuracy be re- 
quired. By the Parliamentary census taken at different periods, 
the population was found to be as under : — 

Year. Population. Increase. Decrease. 

hi 1801, 207.3 

1811, 5:654 581 

1821, 2904 250 

1831 2711 li0 

The chief cause assigned at the time for the increase from 
1801 to 1811, was the general introduction of vaccine ino- 
culation, which, previous to 1801, was scarcely known in this 
parish. Another reason then given was the encouragement afford- 
ed by Colonel Graham of Balgowan, now Lord Lynedoch, and 
by the Honourable Lord Methven, father of the present pro- 
prietor of the estate of Methven, to enterprising agriculturists to 
settle upon their estates. The apparent increase of 250 from 
1811 to 1821, was evidently owing to this circumstance, viz. in the 
former case it was the population of the quoad sacra parish that 
was enumerated, while in the latter, it was that of the parish quoad 
civilia. The decrease of 190, between the years 1821, and 1831, 
was principally occasioned by the almost entire depopulation of 
the estate of Bachilton, the property of Lord Elibank, which in 
the year 1821 was occupied by twelve tenants, — farmers, besides 
their cottars and dependents ; whereas at the latter date, this ex- 
tensive and valuable property may be said to have been, as it still 
is, in the hands of one person. 

The village of Methven contains a population of 1000; and 
that of Almondbank 300, these being the only villages in the pa- 
rish. The rest of the population are chiefly engaged in rural and 
agricultural employment. 

It is impossible accurately to state the average number of births 
in the parish ; for although all those who belong to the Establish- 
ed Church regularly attend to the registration of their children's 
names, even before they are baptized, yet very few of those who 
are in connection with the Seceders take the trouble of discharg- 
ing this duty to their children. If, however, we suppose the births 



15'2 



PERTHSHIRE. 



of the latter to be half the number of that of the former, the ave- 
rage annual number of births in this parish for the last seven years 
would be 58. If there be any advantage in the registration of 
births, either in a public or private point of view, the method by 
which this can be most generally accomplished is certainly a desi- 
deratum of no mean importance. 

The average number of deaths for the last seven years is 37 ; 
and that of marriages, 17. 

Within the last three years there have been 10 illegitimate births. 

Character of the People— It is not to be expected that every few 
miles of different locality should furnish the observer with striking 
peculiarities of character, but there are advantages possessed in 
one place which another does not enjoy, and which have a consi- 
derable influence in modifying the feelings and habits of a com- 
munity. Thus, without facilities of reading, and freedom of inter- 
course with other districts, how slow would be the march of im- 
provement, — how imperceptible the change of society. The in- 
habitants of this parish possess both these privileges. Having a 
library of considerable extent and variety, they have within their 
reach the means of knowledge, and, living in a district intersected 
by the great road which connects Glasgow with Perth and Dun- 
dee, they become early acquainted with what is transacted in these 
populous cities, and imbibe some portion of the activity and enter- 
prise of their inhabitants. Thus they are an intelligent and in- 
dustrious people, devoting their time to the acquisition of the means 
necessary for their support, and spending their leisure hours in 
amusing or profitable reading. They are, moreover, kind and 
hospitable, moral and religious, shewing a becoming regard for the 
authority of the gospel, and a most exemplary regularity in attend- 
ing public worship. 

IV. — Industry.

The gross rental of the parish exceeds L. 1 1,000 ; and the ave- 
rage rate of the arable land let is about L. 1, 7s. per acre, compris- 
ing the various gradations from L. 3 per acre down to 12s. The 
extent of the farms varies from 280 acres to 40, — and pendicles 



METHVEN. 



153 



and cottage holdings from 20 acres to less than one. Leases are 
generally for nineteen years. No particular breed of bestial can be 
stated as peculiar to the parish. Many Ayrshire cows, for the 
purpose of the dairy, have of late years been introduced. The 
grazing of a cow for the season costs about L. 3. Every farm has 
a thrashing-mill, and none but iron ploughs are in use. Ploughmen's 
wages vary from L. 12 to L. 18 per annum, with victuals. 

Husbandry. — The alternate system of cropping is generally 
practised, and, on account of the diversity of soils, this is judicious- 
ly modified to suit the capabilities of land, localities, and climate. 
The best wheat lands are cultivated under a six course rotation, in 
which grass with clover has a place only for one season, beans and 
pease, with other leguminous plants, occupying the intermediate 
years between the grain crops. 

Lands of medium quality, which include the greater portion of 
that which is arable, are kept under a five years rotation, with two 
years under grass, the first year hay, and the second pasture. On 
dry and gravelly soils, and also on the inferior moorlands, a six 
years rotation is followed, with three years grass in succession, while 
the generality of small pendiclers and occupiers of village acres 
practise that of four years ; the first, green crop ; the second, bar- 
ley with grass seeds; the third, cutting grass or hay ; and the fourth, 
oats. 

Bone-dust has been used with much advantage as a manure, for 
the raising of turnips, on the dry lands which admit of the crop 
being eaten off with sheep ; but lime is the stimulant most in .use, 
many thousand bolls of which have of late years been carted from 
Perth, it being brought there by shipping from the Frith of Forth 
and the north of England. 

Potatoes, particularly the Perthshire red, are extensively culti- 
vated for the London market, and, for several years have brought 
higher returns to the farmer than the rest of his other crops. Ex- 
cellent crops of turnips are also raised for home consumption, 
especially for feeding cattle, which find purchasers both from Perth 
and Glasgow. Some good crops of mangold wurzel have also been 
raised. Several tenants now see the advantage of sowing out their 
fields with different kinds of natural grass seeds suited to the soil, 
in mixture with rye-grass and clover. As this system will improve 
the pasturage, so it will be the means of extending it, and conse- 
quently of lessening the quantity of land, so frequently held under

Manufactures. — The only manufacturing establishment in the 
parish is at Woodend, in the immediate vicinity of the village of 
Almondbank, and belongs to the Messrs Turnbull of Hunting- 
tower Bleachfield, in the adjoining parish of Tibbermore. This was 
formerly a paper manufactory, but was lately converted into a weav- 
ing establishment, and is fitted up with power looms. It gives em- 
ployment to a considerable number of people in that quarter. The 
population of the village of Almondbank is chiefly employed at the 
public works on the river Almond, which are numerous and ex- 
tensive, but none of them are in this parish but the one now men- 
tioned. 

The principal employment of a great part of the population of 
the village of Methven is hand-loom weaving. They are chiefly sup- 
plied with work by resident agents, who obtain it on commission 
from manufacturers in Glasgow. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Roads, fyc. — The north road from Perth to Glasgow by way of 
Crieff passes through the village of Methven, which is situated six 
miles from Perth, eleven from Crieff", and fifty-eight from Glasgow. 
There is no other turnpike road in theparish, but several county roads 
intersect it, which greatly facilitate the intercourse between this 
parish and the neighbouring districts in all directions. These roads 
are generally kept in a state of excellent repair, and are maintain- 
ed by the funds arising from the statute labour conversion. Two 
coaches one of them the royal mail pass and repass from Perth 
to Glasgow daily, and there is a penny post-office here, which was 
established about five years ago, in connection with the post-office 
at Perth. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which is conveniently 
situated, is a large commodious and substantial building, although 
not an elegant one, and, with the addition of an aisle built to it in 
the year 1825, at the private expense of Robert Smythe, Esq. of 
Methven, the patron and principal heritor of the parish, contains 



METHVEN. 



155 



about 1100 sittings, which are in general nearly all occupied. The 
only other place of worship in the parish is a meeting-house in con- 
nection with the United" Associate Synod, formerly Antiburgher 
Seceders. 

About the year 1770 this parish had become one of the most 
thorough Seceding parishes in Scotland, and the parish church at 
that time was almost entirely deserted. By an enumeration, very 
carefully taken in the beginning of the year 1836, it was found 
that the gross population of the quoad sacra parish was then '2450, 
and that the number of communicants belonging to the Establish- 
ed Church was 903. 

In this parish there are no Dissenters in the proper acceptation 
of that term, for all those who do not belong to the church are 
connected either with the United Associate Synod, or with the As- 
sociate Synod of Original Seceders, who have a place of worship in 
a neighbouring parish. 

The number of families in the parish altogether is 630 ; of 
these, 354 belong to the Established Church ; 234 to what were 
formerly Antiburgher Seceders : and 21 to the Original Seceders. 

The manse is an elegant modern edifice, built in the year 1830, 
at a very considerable expense, and may justly be regarded as an 
unquestionable proof of the liberality and good taste of the heri- 
tors. It is the largest, and perhaps the best finished and most 
convenient, manse in the presbytery. 

The stipend, as modified in the year 1829, is 18 chalders, half 
meal, and half barley, payable by the fiars of the county. 

The glebe consists of 15 acres of good land, capable of bearing 
all kinds of crops, besides 10 acres of unimproved moor land, which 
was allotted to the minister, as his portion of the common, at the 
time it was divided. 

Education. — Nothing can be more satisfactory than the state of 
education in this parish. There are very few if any adults that 
cannot read, and by the exertions of the benevolent, the poorest 
children have the means of instruction afforded them. About one- 
ninth of the population is continually employed in attending 
school, and while the general progress is extremely gratifying, 
there are many instances of great proficiency in every department 
of education. The parochial school has, for above twenty years, 
been under the superintendence of the present eminent teacher 
Mr R. Wilson, whose services and whose character have earned 
for him the esteem and confidence of all those among whom he 



156 



PERTHSHIRE. 



has so long and successfully laboured. And besides his profes- 
sional duties, which have been uniformly discharged with great 
fidelity and talent, he has rendered invaluable services to the com- 
munity in the management of several benevolent institutions. 
The advantages of the savings-bank in this place are chiefly ow- 
ing to his business talent, and gratuitous labours. The existence, 
and happy effects of the friendly society, as it is now constituted, 
have the same origin ; and much of the comfort of the poor is 
to be traced to the kindness and accuracy with which he conducts 
their pecuniary affairs under the direction of the heritors and kirk- 
session. The salary paid to the schoolmaster is the maximum, 
and the amount of school -fees actually received may vary from 
L. 25 to L. 30 per annum. The rate of fees is 2s., 2s. 6d. and 
3s. per quarter, for the ordinary branches of education, and 5s. 
for Latin, book-keeping, practical mathematics, &amp;c. &amp;c. The 
number of scholars attending the parochial school varies from 120 
to 150. 

There is an unendowed school in the village of Almond bank, 
numerously attended, there being from 70 to 90 scholars who re- 
ceive instruction in this place. The right of nominating the teacher 
to this school belongs to Robert Smythe, Esq. of Methven, who 
along with some other benevolent individuals, contributes an- 
nually a few pounds for the education of poor children in that dis- 
trict. 

There is also in the village of Methven a school supported en- 
tirely by the Secession congregation of this place, and, so far as we 
know, this school is well attended and well taught, so that the 
means of education are abundantly supplied in this parish. 

Literature. — A library was established here in the year 1790, 
and now consists of more than 1100 volumes. It contains many 
standard works in divinity, science, and general literature. It is 
supported by the annual contribution of its members, the" number 
of whom at present is 130. The members meet quarterly for con- 
ducting the general business of the society. It is governed by a pre- 
sident and committee of management, who are annually elected. 
The institution is in a prosperous condition, and eminently fitted 
to promote the dissemination of general knowledge. 

Friendly Society.— A Friendly Society was instituted here in the 
year 1790, but, from the imperfect knowledge, or rather the perfect 
ignorance which then, and for many years afterwards, prevailed re- 
garding the equitable principles upon which institutions of this 

4 



METHVEN. 



157 



nature ought to be founded, this society, like all others of the 
same kind, had long to grope its way in uncertainty, and from 
time to time to vary and adjust its rates of contributions and allow- 
ances, according as the funds were supposed to be adequate to the 
purposes contemplated or not. This state of ignorance was evi- 
dently the true cause, both then and afterwards, of the almost uni- 
versal failure of Friendly Societies. But by the caution and fore- 
sight of some of its leading members, this Society was safely guid- 
ed through those difficulties which proved so fatal to others, and 
was even comparatively in a prosperous state in the year 1824, 
when the Report of the Highland Society of Scotland upon Be- 
nefit or Friendly Societies was published. 

For this important production, the public owe a deep debt of 
gratitude to Charles Oliphant, Esq. W. S. 

Upon the appearance of the Highland Society's Report, the 
members of this society, generally, eagerly availed themselves of 
the information it afforded, and showed a resolution, in spite of every 
difficulty, to reduce to practice, in their own case, the principles 
therein expounded. They, therefore, immediately set about re- 
modelling the Methven Friendly Society, in strict conformity to 
the data contained in the Report of the Highland Society, and for 
this purpose they appointed a large committee of their number, to 
whom, in terms of the Friendly Society Act of 1802, they dele- 
gated all the power and authority the society itself possessed, to 
alter, to amend, and to enlarge its laws, its principles, and its ob- 
jects. 

The society accordingly, on the 22d May 1826, adopted a new 
constitution, principally derived from, and entirely founded upon, 
the Highland Society's Report, embracing the three great schemes 
therein exhibited, namely, 1st, For affording weekly payments 
in money during sickness, until the member attains the seventieth 
year of his age. 2c, For affording annuities to members for life 
after the sixtieth, sixty-fifth, or seventieth year of their age, and 
also for affording, at any age, single annuities, i. e. an annuity for 
the life of one person. And, 3d, For a funeral allowance, or a sum 
payable at death. 

With regard to the first scheme, the member who subscribes 
for an allowance in sickness must, at the same time, contribute 
also for an annuity to commence with the seventy-first year of his 
age, if he lives so long, when the sickness allowance terminates, 
and the contributions for both cease ; and the relation which these 



158 



PERTHSHIRE. 



benefits bear to each other must always be such, that for everv 
shill ing a member's weekly allowance in sickness consists of, his an- 
nuity must be L. 2 ; that is, if his allowance in sickness be 5s. per 
week, his annuity after seventy must be L. 10; if the one be 8s. 
the other will be L. 16, and so on. But no member is allowed to 
contribute for a weekly sick allowance higher than 10s., nor for 
an annuity above L. 20. As to the second scheme, any member 
is allowed to subscribe for an annuity of any amount not exceed- 
ing L. 20, to commence with the 61st, 66th, or 71st year of his 
age, without reference to any of the other schemes. By this 
scheme also, a present single annuity may be purchased by ad- 
vancing, in one payment, a sum corresponding to its value at the 
time of entry, according to the age of the annuitant. The third 
scheme is merely a life insurance, and to this department, as well 
as to the single annuity portion of the second scheme, both males 
and females are admissible. 

Any one or all of the benefits which this society is intended to 
confer, may be secured either by annual contribution, or by a single 
payment. The rates of contribution chargeable in all the schemes 
are regulated by a set of tables constructed for the purpose, which 
were submitted to, and approved by, the most competent judges, 
previously to their being adopted. By means of these tables, — 
the number and ages of the members being known, — the affairs of 
the society can at any time be investigated, and its ability or in- 
ability to answer all the demands to be made upon its funds, can 
be readily ascertained, in a manner similar to that practised by re- 
gular Insurance Companies. This society, therefore, as may be 
supposed, is in a very prosperous condition ; its members are nu- 
merous, and its funds are amply sufficient to meet all its engage- 
ments. Such is a brief outline of the Methven Friendly Society, 
— an institution well calculated to answer all the purposes for which 
associations of this nature are intended. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was instituted here in the year 
1815, chiefly under the direction of Robert Smythe, Esq., the 
principal heritor. It would be a difficult task to estimate the be- 
nefit which has already been derived from this institution, not only 
by many individuals and families belonging to the parish, but also 
bv a very considerable number of persons in the neighbouring pa- 
rishes, where either no attempt has been made to establish a si- 
milar institution, or where the attempt has been unsuccessful. It 
is true, that in several of the surrounding parishes, savings banks 



METHVEN. 



159 



were commenced about the time this one began its operations, but 
from some cause or other, most, if not all of them, lasted only a 
few years, and then vanished without leaving behind them any 
perceptible trace of their usefulness. On the contrary, the Meth- 
ven Savings Bank came into existence without a single word to re- 
commend it to the attention of those classes of the community for 
whose benefit it was intended, beyond the contents of a very brief 
hand-bill, and having continued to prosper for twenty- one years, 
without interruption, it has in an eminent degree been the means 
of promoting the comfort and comparative independence of not a 
few of those who have wisely taken the advantages which savings 
banks, properly constituted, are calculated to bestow. The sim- 
plicity of the mode, and the unostentatious manner in which the 
affairs of this bank have hitherto been conducted, form one 
of the principal causes, if not the very principal cause of its 
success. It has never been placed under the protection of any 
statute relating to saving banks, for in its nature and operations 
it resembles more a branch of a provincial bank, although on a 
small scale, than may be conceived by the generally entertained 
notion of a parish or savings bank. The heritors and the minis- 
ter of the parish are directors, and the schoolmaster has, from its 
commencement, acted as treasurer or cashier ; indeed, it may be 
said, that upon him alone has devolved all the burden of conduct- 
ing its affairs. The directors meet annually, when the proceed- 
ings of the preceding year are laid before them, and a general 
statement of them docqueted. All the money deposited is lodged 
in the Perth Bank as soon as the deposits amount to a sum worth 
sending, for any sum not less than Is. is received. A deposi- 
tor may withdraw the whole of his money or any part of it at any 
time he pleases, and if there be not money on hand sufficient to 
answer the demand, the treasurer gives him an order upon the 
Perth Bank for the amount required. The savings bank gives the 
same rate of interest upon every separate deposit of 16s. 8d., as 
the Perth bank gives upon the gross amount lodged with them. 
And yearly, at 31st May, the interest due to each depositor is 
added to his account, both in the books of the institution and in 
his own pass-book. When a person's deposits amount to L. 20, 
L. 30, L. 40, or upwards, the usual way is to transfer that sum 
from the stock of the savings bank into that of the Perth Bank, in 
the depositor's own name, which is always done with his consent ; 
and he thereupon obtains a separate bank receipt, which, in ge- 



160 



PERTHSHIRE. 



neral, he takes charge of himself. In this way, many who com- 
menced depositing their savings in the Methven Savings Bank 
have become annual depositors, to a very considerable amount, with 
the Perth Banking Company; for when they go there at the end 
of the year to have their bank receipt renewed, they add to it not 
only the interest due upon it at that time, but also all that they 
have been able to save for the preceding twelve months. In this 
way several of these depositors have been enabled to become pro- 
prietors of houses, sufficient, at least, to accommodate themselves 
and their families, and this is evidently a result, which, humanly 
speaking, would not likely ever have happened, had it not been 
for the opportunity which the saving bank afforded them, of com- 
mencing the accumulation of the little fortune which has enabled 
them to acquire this enviable degree of independence. The be- 
nefits of this institution are open to all, without regard to age, sex, 
or residence ; hence, there are some depositors from a great dis- 
tance, and several females who commenced early to deposit have, 
now, each, the command of not less than L. 60, L. 70, and some of 
them L. 80, while others similarly situated, but less provident, 
cannot perhaps command as many shillings. The total amount 
deposited up to 1st January 1837 is L. 4316, 8s. 8d. ; the total 
number of depositors is 331, and the lowest amount of deposits 
belonging to any individual is 2s. We could say much more up- 
on this subject, were it not that we would thereby extend this ar- 
ticle to an improper length; but we cannot conclude these remarks 
without expressing our conviction, founded upon our knowledge of the 
benefits which many have derived from this institution, that savings 
banks, properly constituted, and judiciously conducted, are eminent- 
ly calculated to promote the comfort and happiness both of indi- 
viduals and families, and that were the working-classes of the com- 
munity once led more generally to embrace the benefits they of- 
fer, we cannot conceive a method better fitted to advance their in- 
terest, nora plan better adapted to promote their real independence. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The funds for the support of the 
poor are derived from two sources ; the one is an assessment up- 
on the parish expressly for that purpose, — the other, the collec- 
tions at the church door. These are kept entirely separate, and 
are appropriated to different classes or lists of poor. The assess- 
ment or poor's rate was introduced here so early as the year 1775, 
when the church-door collections were found altogether inadequate 
to the wants of the poor, in consequence of by far the greater part 



METHVEN. 



161 



of the parishioners, a little before that time, becoming Antiburgher 
Seceders ; and although it has not hitherto been found altogether 
practicable to discontinue the assessment, matters are, however, 
in this respect, now very much changed. The average annual 
amount of the assessment is L. 100, of which the heritors pay the 
one-half, in proportion to their valued rent, and the tenants and 
householders the other, according to their means and circum- 
stances. The funds arising from the assessment, with the ex- 
ception of the expense inevitably incurred by this mode of provid- 
ing for the poor, are almost exclusively bestowed upon the poor 
belonging to the Secession, or upon such poor as do not belong 
to the church. On the other hand, the kirk-session of the parish 
are in general enabled to aliment all the poor belonging to the 
Established Church, from the collections received at the church 
door, which, for the year 1836, being a fair average, amounted to 
L. 85. There are thus two lists or classes of poor in the parish, 
— the one maintained by the assessment, which is levied by the 
authority of the heritors and kirk-session, in their collective capa- 
city, — the other maintained by the kirk-session alone. The whole 
of the proceedings of the kirk-session, so far as these relate to pe- 
cuniary matters, are annually submitted to the heritors at their 
regular meetings, and are both approved of and confirmed by them. 

The average number of regular poor upon both these funds is 
about 38, the greater part of whom are at present alimented by 
the kirk-session. The minimum monthly allowance is 2s. 6d., 
and the highest ordinary rate is 13s. Many persons in indigent 
circumstances are from time to time prevented from falling per- 
manently upon the poor's roll, by the aid of the kirk-session, ju- 
diciously administered, in such occasional cases as imperiously call 
for relief. In few parishes with a population equal to that of 
Methven, are the poor better attended to, or the funds for their 
support less felt to be burdensome. 

Inns.— There are no fewer than 10 licensed alehouses in the 
parish. Large and populous as the parish is, if that number were 
reduced to a half, we should think that all the good purposes for 
which houses of this kind are intended would be answered, and 
the effect that would be thus produced, in a moral point of view, 
upon a certain class of the community, would be desirable. 

Fuel— The fuel generally used is coal, which is to be had in 
abundance at all seasons, at the port of Perth, brought by ship- 
ping,— the Scotch coal, from the pits adjacent to the river Forth 

PERTH. L

and the English coal, from the coal-fields in the neighbourhood 
of Newcastle. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The improvements that have been effected in this parish since 
the publication of the former Statistical Account are numerous 
and varied. The extensive pleasure grounds and gardens, both at 
Lynedoch House and Methven Castle, with their beautiful ap- 
proaches and enlarged accommodation, deserve to be mentioned, 
and the sylvan scenery, which decorates not only these mansions, 
but extends all over the parish, forms a delightful contrast to the 
bleak and cheerless aspect which it formerly exhibited. In the 
year 1793, there were only three slated farm-houses in the parish, 
with as many enclosed farms. Now, every farm is enclosed, with 
the exception of a few pendicles on moor-land, — the farms are all 
subdivided, and have substantial slated houses, with corresponding 
offices. Agriculture is certainly in a high state of improvement 
in this parish. Much has been done by Robert Smythe, Esq. of 
Methven, to aid the industry of his tenants, by blasting and re- 
moving stones, and by draining, all of which drains Mr Smythe 
opens at his own expense, and the tenants perform the rest of the 
labour. Subsoil ploughing has been introduced, and is likely soon 
to become general. The bridge now building over the Almond, 
at Dalcrue, near Lynedoch, will, when finished, be an object of ge- 
neral attraction, both for elegance of design and workmanship, and 
for its singularly romantic situation.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. WILLIAM LISTON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Afome.— The name of this parish has been variously written 
Redgorton, Regorton, and Rogorton. The two latter spellings 
are evidently corruptions of the first. But the most ancient or- 
thography is Rochgorton, as appears by a charter by King David 
II. preserved in the chartulary of Scone, in which his Majesty con- 
veys the church of Rochgorton to the abbacy of Scone. Roch or 
Ruach in Gaelic, signifies red, and Gorton or Garton signifies a 



REDGORTON. 



1G3 



little field. The meaning, therefore, is the same, either in the an- 
cient or modern orthography, and signifies the Red-field, i. e. the 
field of blood. The current opinion, therefore, which derives the 
name of the parish from the battle of Luncarty, seems to be well 
founded, although the popular derivation [quasi Red-gore-town 
appears too bald for admission. 

Origin, Boundaries, Topographical Appearances, fyc. — The pa- 
rish consists of three united parishes, Redgorton, Luncarty, and 
St SerfFs. Redgorton belonged to the abbacy of Scone; St 
Serffs, a corruption from St Servanus, belonged to the diocese 
of Dunkeld ; and Luncarty, as appears from Keith, was a parson- 
age, i. e. a church not appropriated to any religious house. The 
period of the union of these three parishes is not precisely known ; 
but it is most probable that it took place at the time of the Re- 
formation, as the presbytery records, which extend back to 1619, 
speak of them as having been already united. 

The parish consists of two parts, a lower and an upper part, 
very unequal in point of magnitude, and very dissimilar in every 
respect. The lower, or principal part, though of an irregular fi- 
gure, approaching nearly to two triangles, may be stated as six 
miles long by two miles broad, though its greatest breadth great- 
ly exceeds, and its smallest falls as much short of it. This part, 
therefore, contains about 10.125 square miles. It lies at the con- 
fluence of the Tay and the Almond, and is bounded on the east by 
the former of these rivers, which separates it from the parishes of 
Scone and St Martins ; and on the south-west by the latter river, 
which separates it from the parishes of Tibbermuir and Methven. 
It requires three lesser streams, the Coldrochie, the Shochie, and 
Ordie, to divide it from the parish of Moneydie, on the west and 
north-west. And it is separated on the north from the parishes of 
Auchtergaven and Kinclaven, partly by imaginary lines, and partly 
by smaller streams, whose magnitude has not been considered of 
such importance as to acquire for them a distinctive appellation. 

The surface of this part is varied and undulating, presenting 
something diversified in its aspect at every step. The tide, in its 
highest floods, flows up to Scone, or within half a mile- of the 
mouth of the Almond ; so that the lowest fields of this part are 
little above the level of the sea, whilst the highest may be 100 
feet above it. The soil is very diversified, changing, sometimes 
very suddenly, from the deepest loam to the coldest till, on the one 
hand, and to the most arid gravel, or even pure sand, on the other. 

The whole lands in this part of the parish are cultivated and 



164 



PERTHSHIRE. 



improved, and, in general, subdivided by thorn hedges. The 
higher ridges and knolls are for the most part planted with wood, 
of which there is a great extent in the parish. No property in the 
country has been more improved, or had more attention paid to it, 
in this respect, than that of Lord Lynedoch, who possesses two- 
thirds of the whole parish. No expense has been spared in ex- 
tending, or altering, in any way, the arrangement and boundaries 
of the woods, wherever it would contribute to the ornament of the 
estate, or the beauty of the outline. The grounds, accordingly, 
abound with beautiful prospects. Few panoramic scenes, perhaps, 
are finer than that which is seen from Redgorton ridge, which 
commands a view of Scone Park and Palace, of the bridge and city 
of Perth, and the fertile valley on which it stands, with the mighty 
Tay seen rolling through it, wherever the sweeping of the ground, 
or the opening of the woods, permits the eye to reach its channel ; 
the whole bounded by a semicircle of hills, consisting of the Ochils 
on the one hand, and the Sidlaw Hills and the hills of Kinnoull 
and Moncrieff on the other, with the Fife Lowmond starting up to 
shut up the opening betwixt the one and the other. 

The other part of the parish, which is quite detached from the 
rest, lies beyond the parish of Moneydie, at the foot of the Gram- 
pians, running up the shoulder of one of them to the top, and com- 
prehends the barony of Mullion. The aspect of the barony is 
very different from that of the lower part of the parish. There 
are here no woods or lines of hedges, with which the lower part is 
so abundantly clothed and sheltered, but open moorland, field, and 
heathy mountain. The soil, however, wherever it has been culti- 
vated, — and a great deal has been done in this way by a very in- 
dustrious tenantry, — is a sharp, gravelly, or moorish loam ; and in 
favourable seasons yields excellent crops, but liable, from the ele- 
vation of the district, to be nipt by the early frosts, before they have 
reached their full maturity. The barony of Mullion is about three 
miles long by three-quarters of a mile broad, and thus may be 
stated as containing 1.875 square miles, so that the whole parish 
comprehends twelve square miles, or 7680 acres. The Shochie 
here again bounds the parish, and separates it from the parish of 
Auchtergaven on the north ; whilst another mountain stream cal- 
led Crachie, which falls into the Shochie at the boundary of the 
barony, separates it from the parish of Monzie, annexed to the pa- 
rish of Moneydie quoad sacra. 

Hydrography. — There are no rivers that run through the parish, 
unless the united waters of the Shochie and the Ordie were to 



REDGORTON. 1G5 

be dignified by that appellation ; and even they run only a very 
short distance before they fall into the Tay. They do not now, how- 
ever, follow their natural course, but run in a cut that has been 
made by the Luncarty Company through a steep bank, in the 
nearest line to the Tay. The lower part of the parish is bounded, 
as already stated, for nearly six miles by the Tay and the Almond 
respectively, which are of the greatest importance to the parish, as 
will be fully noticed under the article Industry. The only lake in 
the parish worthy of notice is a very small one in the barony of 
Mullion, which never was of any great extent, and which had its 
scanty boundary circumscribed last year by the draining off of a 
considerable proportion of its water. It is, however, said to be of 
considerable depth. 

Climate— Diseases.— The lower part of the parish lies at a con- 
siderable distance from the Grampians, which are on the north, 
and is still farther removed from the Ochil Hills on the south. 
This circumstance undoubtedly contributes to render the climate 
so dry and healthy as it is. We frequently see these hills enveloped 
m dense clouds, and know that they and the adjacent lands are 
drenched with torrents of rain, whilst we are breathing a compa- 
ratively dry atmosphere, or luxuriating in bright sunshine. The 
parish is accordingly healthy, and free from any local distemper. 
It is stated in the last Statistical Account, that the people are sub- 
ject to ague. But whether it be from the complete drainage which 
the land has undergone, or from the quantity of wood that has 
been planted and reared, since that date, which of itself takes up a 
quantity of moisture, and through which surface drains are cut in 
all directions, which rapidly run off the water that would otherwise 
be stagnant ; so at least it is, that the ague is now almost entirely 
unknown amongst us. J 

Ga'ne.-The common kinds of game are very abundant: hares 
rabb.ts pheasants, and partridges, with snipe, woodcock, and land 
mi m their seasons. The pheasants, however, in proportion as 
they have mcreased, have diminished the nnmber of part d "eT 
For bemg much the stronger party, though only recent settler's in 
the country, they, m notation perhaps of a nobler animal, drive 
back the weaker, though aboriginal inhabitants. Roe-deer are 
frequently met with in the woods, and now and then a few \2 
deer come down to us in winter, and remaining in the woods do 
great destruction to the crops in summer.

menclature. Its extreme north-western position in the barony 
of Mullion is occupied by greywacke to a considerable extent. 
Through the southern edge of this passes that bed of clay slate, 
which extends nearly throughout the lower range of the Gram- 
pians from sea to sea. Its character, adjuncts, and position are simi- 
lar to those of the slate deposit at the great quarries near Dunkeld, 
and in the Stormont. It dips at an angle of 45° towards the north. 
It is worked as a roofing slate at Ruchummon in this parish. To 
the south of this, chlorite slate is found, and farther south a coarse pe- 
culiar variety of conglomerate. In the lower part of the parish a gray 
sandstone in thick strata prevails. This is a continuation of the 
sandstone which is quarried to such an extent at Gelly Burn. It 
is a first-rate building stone ; and in some places abounds with 
charry impressions of various land plants. The southermost rocks 
along the channel of the Almond consist of argillaceous red sand- 
stone. This is thickly marked with pale bluish spots, sometimes 
supposed to be caused by organisms, and is in many parts inter- 
sected with very thin veins of satin spar. It contains about 16 per 
cent, of carbonate of lime, and in some parts of the country is used 
as a top-dressing for pasture, under the name of rock marl. 

As this parish forms part of the angular territory, bounded on 
two sides by the rivers Tay and Almond towards their confluence, 
it is supposed to be traversed from side to side by the five or six 
trap veins which make their appearance in each of these rivers in 
the space of about two miles. But these are nowhere else visible 
in the parish, except where the surface has been intersected by 
ravines or water-courses. 

Woods. There are from 760 to 800 acres of wood on Lord 

Lynedoch's property ; about 60 on that of the Duke of Athole ; and 
a few acres on that of Mr Smythe of Methven. The woods on Lord 
Lynedoch's property were originally planted with Scotch fir, and 
larch, except some places which were thought fitter for oak, which 
is now cut as coppice. As the Scotch fir and larch are cut down, 
their place is uniformly supplied with young plantations of which 
the principal part is oak. His Lordship has been at great pains 
in procuring acorns for rearing plants, and, so far as I have been 
able to ascertain, they prove to be the true Quercus robur. This, 
however, I may remark, is not the case with some other planta- 
tions in the vicinity, where I have observed the Quercus sessili- 
florus to prevail. The latter is a tree of much softer wood, and 
greatly inferior value. The attention of landed proprietors, in 
making oak plantations, cannot be too strictly or earnestly direct- 



REDGORTON. 



167 



ed to the choice of their plants, or acorns, that they may not ob- 
tain an indifferent, instead of a verv valuable wood. The discri- 
mination is easily made, especially in collecting acorns for seed. 
In the inferior kind the acorn sits close upon the branch, whereas 
it hangs upon a longish foot -stalk in the true Quercus robur. 

Botany. — This parish consisting of open fields of all kinds of 
soil sheltered with hedges ; and of deep and shady woods, in some 
places dry, in others wet and marshy, running here and there into 
petty lakes or pools ; having within its bounds the banks of two 
larger rivers, and two smaller streams ; and consisting in the barony 
of Mullion of lake, and moor, and mountain, — offers an extensive 
and varied field of botany. Accordingly, almost all the more com- 
mon, and a good many of the rarer plants are to be found within 
it. It would be more than useless to attempt to give an account 
of the former. But we give the following list of those that are 
more uncommon, giving the habitat of the rarer species, with what 
notes occur, at the foot of the page.

 I do not think that it has yet been experimentally ascertained, whether the bark 
Of Sesstltfi&amp;nu be as much inferior to that of Robur as its wood; but I think the pre- 
sumption is that the bark of the hardest wood contains the greatest quantity of tanin. 

 1  Wood on Redgorton hill. It is surprising that this plant has not come into cul- 
tivation, wherever lands are laid down in permanent pasture. Its creeping roots dis- 
qualify it, in some measure, from being sown where the lands are speedily to be broken 
up. But this is the reverse of an objection where they are to remain for a length of time 
in pasture; and its faculty of pushing its roots deep into the clay, would prevent its 
being thrown out in cold, lands, while its fine soft herbage forms excellent food either for 
sheep or cattle: I observe that some curious cultivators in this neighbourhood give 
the name elatior to the trueawa, which latter, though a much stronger, isamuch 
coarser plant.

3 Lily of the valley.— Banks of the Almond. There is a quarter of an acre of

24 Sir J. Smith gives this as a distinct species, but Sir W. J. Hooker does not 
admit of its being distinct from Alpinum. Where such authorities differ, it would 
be presumption in us to decide ; the more especially as there are some circumstances 
connected with the plant and its habitat, which seem to favour respectively both sides 
of the question. On the one hand, the Alpinum is not found in the vicinity of the 
habitat of uniflorum, and the plant has always a single terminal flower, with erect 
rays ; which seem to favour Sir J. Smith's position. But, on the other hand, the 
plant is only found on the shelving rocks of the Almond, which are occasionally co- 
vered with water, which seems to favour the supposition that the seed may have been 
brought down by the river from the higher ground where Alpinum grows. But 
then again the plant is not found on rocks similarly situated on the Tay ; and there 
seems reason to think that, if the one river should bring down the seed of Alpinum, 
so would the other, as is the case with Saxifraga aizoides, above referred to. 

Sir W. J. Hooker mentions that Alpinum is often single flowered ; and states 
also that it is sometimes found with rays erect. If it should turn out, on farther ex- 
amination, that it is only the one-flowered specimens that have erect rays, it would cer- 
tainly establish Sir J. Smith's specific distinction. 

25 This pretty plant, though found growing wild here, and though so common 
in Ayrshire, as, in some places, to be considered a troublesome weed, is not allowed 
to be a native, and has not been admitted into any British Flora. 

26 This uncommon plant, which has been rarely found in this parish, grows co- 
piously on the opposite banks of the river Almond, in the wood of Methven. We 
may here mention that Corallorhiza innata, which is stated by Sir W. J. Hooker to be 
destroyed there, has been recently found, and carefully preserved by Mr Bishop.

tum nigrum, Blechnum boreale, and Lycopodium clavatum. We can- 
not but regret that we have no station for the very pretty Adian- 
tum capillus veneris, and the no less curious Hymenophyllum Tun- 
bridgense ; and that the magnificent Osmunda regalis is not to be met 
with in all this country. It would be needless to enumerate all 
our fungi, of which we have a great variety, but we may mention 
that we but too frequently meet with Phallus fcetidus, the most dis- 
gusting of all nature's productions. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — Chalmers has shewn, in his Caledonia, that the 
Roman station, Orrea, was situated at the confluence of the Tay 
and the Almond, in this parish, f and there are still circumstances 
existing that afford pregnant presumptions of the fact. The Ro- 
man road from Ardoch, of which the remains are so distinct and 
well known, on the ridge of Gask, leads upon this station; 
and is again discovered on the opposite side of the Tay, a little 
above the parallel of the Almond. The piers also which support- 
ed the bridge by which they crossed the Tay, are still to be seen 
in the bottom of the river at this place ; and Roman urns have 
been found in the banks of the Almond, containing ashes and 

 Neither of these two plants, the latter of which is the most beautiful of all 
the Aspidia, not even excepting the finely pinnatified Filix-faemina,— is mentioned 
in Hooker's Flora Scotica ; and the first is not noticed in Sir J. Smith's Flora 
Britannica. 

f The remains of the camp at this place are not yet quite obliterated. Although 
it has been levelled by the plough, the direction of the mound, which formed the de- 
fence on the north and west sides, are distinctly visible, by the remarkable elevation 
of the ground. The length of this mound on the north side is 860 feet. Nearly on 
the centre of this side there is a small space, which is not raised, like the line both 
to the east and west of it, and which it is not difficult to recognize as the gateway. 
Along the whole of this line, at a little distance from it, and parallel to it, there are 
the remains of a road, some parts of which, when the ground was ploughed some 
years ago, were found to be quite closely paved, corresponding exactly to other Ro- 
man roads, and the people themselves remarked that every one of the stones had a 
smooth face on the upper side. There can be no doubt that this is the remains of 
the iter which conducted to the bridge across the Tay, the piers of which are still 
in the river exactly opposite the camp. The remains of the fortification are not so 
distinct on the west side, though still visible. The length of this line is only 437 
feet, nearly half the space, which must have been occupied by the camp, having been 
washed away by the encroachment of the Almond, which, as is well known, now 
empties itself into the Tay considerably to the north of its former embouchure

burnt bones ; particularly two large urns, mentioned in the notes 
to " The Muse's Threnodie," and conjectured there, and in the 
last Statistical Account, to have contained the ashes of Agricola's 
son, who died in the eighth year of his expedition into Britain, 
and of Aulus Atticus, who was killed in the celebrated battle with 
Galgacus, at the foot of the Grampian Mountains. It is stated 
by Tacitus, and noticed by Buchanan, that Agricola reached the 
Tay in the third year of his expedition ; and it is expressly stated 
by Agricola himself, in his address to his soldiers before the bat- 
tle with Galgacus, as given by Tacitus, that they were then in the 
eighth year of that expedition. The camp at Orrea, therefore, ex- 
isted for five years previous to that battle. If it was fought, as has 
been supposed, at Battle-dikes, or to the east of Blairgowrie, then 
it must have been from Orrea that Agricola marched with his 
light-armed troops, previous to that battle ; and probably to it, or 
to the station in medio at Inchuthel that he led his army after 
the battle, when, Tacitus tells us, he conducted them into the bor- 
ders of the Horesti. Orrea also continued to be an important 
station during the twenty-five years that Lollius Urbicus was Lieu- 
tenant in Britain, that is, down to the year 161. It was no doubt 
abandoned, along with all the other country to the north of 
Adrian's wall between the Tyne and the Solway, in the year 170. 
But there is as little doubt that it was again occupied by the Em- 

 Chalmers has supposed that the battle with Galgacus was fought at Victoria, 
or Dalgenross near the Ruchel, at the top of Strathearn ; and that Agricola ap- 
proached the scene of action, from Fife, through Gleneagles. But in order to make 
good this idea, he is obliged to get rid of the direct testimony of Tacitus, who says 
expressly, that Agriccla, in the third year of his expedition, subdued all the nations 
as far as the Tay. Nationibus usque ad Taum aestuario nomen est subactis. 
And for this purpose he has recourse to a supposition, which appears a very strange 
one. He says that by Taum is meant the Solway Frith. And why  because the 
British word Taw signifies " any thing spread out," which he thinks is an appro- 
priate description of the Solway. But he forgets that Tacitus directly affirms that 
Taus is the name of the frith, and consequently that it cannot be taken as a descrip- 
tion of it. For the same purpose, when Tacitus states that, after the battle, Agricola 
led his troops into the borders of the Horesti, as Victoria is in their territory, he is 
obliged to suppose that the author means that he led back his troops to the borders 
of the Horesti ; which is an interpretation which the passage will not bear. Taci- 
tus 1 expression is, " in fines Horestorum exercitum rfeducit," which clearly implies 
that he was without their bounds. Had it been the intention of the historian to say 
that he led back his army from Victoria to Carnock, which were both within the ter- 
ritories of the Horesti, as Chalmers makes him do, he must necessarily have said, 
" ad fines Horestorum exercitum reducit ;" and could not have expressed himself as 
he has done. Lastly, the idea that the battle took place at the top of Strathearn is ir- 
reconcilable with the account of Tacitus, when he says that Agricola came to the Mons 
Grampius with his light troops, having sent his fleet before him, " praemissa classe." 
How could he possibly be said to have sent his fleet before him, when it must neces- 
sarily have sailed in an easterly course, down the Frith of Forth, whilst he was him- 
self to march from the camp at Carnock to the top of Strathearn, in a north wester- 
ly direction  But this would be quite properly said, if he sent his fleet from the Tay 
to the Esk, the station iEsciea whilst he proceeded in a shorter direction from 
Orrea across the country, towards the same point,

peror Severus in 209, in his celebrated war with the Caledonians, 
in which he lost so many men. The treaty with Caracalla in 211, 
finally deprived the Romans of all the country to the north of the 
Clyde, if not of the Solway. From first to last, therefore, the 
Romans were in possession of Orrea for upwards of 125 years. 

The bridge at the mouth of the Almond was the only one 
across the Tay which the Romans possessed ; which rendered the 
station of Orrea at all times of great importance, as, from the line 
of their approach, it formed the key to the possession of the fer- 
tile valleys of Strathmore and Gowrie, and all the country to the 
east of the river. 

About two miles above the station of Orrea, at Pitcairn, on the 
banks of the Almond, there are the distinct remains of a camp, 
which is called the Roman Camp, but which, from its being 
not square but round, was certainly not Roman. It may, not im- 
probably, however, have been a camp of the natives, for the pur- 
pose of watching the motions of the Romans, who had so distin- 
guished a station in the vicinity. If the occupation of Orrea w r as 
of importance to the Romans, it could be of no inferior importance 
to the natives, especially after the erection of the bridge across 
the Tay ; because the possession of that one station would have 
cut off the retreat of the Roman troops, who had crossed the river, 
and have secured to the British the whole country to the east. 
It is natural, therefore, to think that efforts were not wanting to 
disturb the enemy in the possession of this station. It was pro- 
bably, then, from this place that the attempt was made, in the ab- 
sence of Agricola, by the united forces of the Picts and Scots, to 
surprise the ninth legion, which was almost successful, and which, 
but for the unexpected return of Agricola himself, would have been 
entirely so. If the camp at Pitcairn was formed with the same 
intention, it was skilfully selected, and well adapted to the object in 
view. It is situated upon an eminence, commanding a view, not in- 
deed of Orrea itself, but of the whole line of approach to that station 
for several miles ; having the steep bank of the Almond as a de- 
fence to the south ; and a deep ravine, descending to the very bed 
of the river, interposed betwixt it and Orrea, to the east, with 
room to draw up an army on the level ground betwixt the camp 
and the ravine. 

Sibbald has supposed that it was at Loch Ore that the attack was made upon 
the ninth legion. Is it possible that he has been misled by the similarity of the 
name of the loch to Orrea  At all events, it was certainly quite impossible that 
Agricola could hear of an attack made in the night-time at Loch Ore, in his camp in 
the par:sh of Caraock, and arrive with his troops at the scene of action, before morn- 
nmg, as Chalmers supposes. 



172 



PERTHSHIRE. 



It is natural to think that the ever-watchful Romans would not 
permit a camp, so situated, and so fitted to annoy them, to remain 
undisturbed in the vicinity of so important a station as Orrea. Ac- 
cordingly, judging from the number of tumuli, or cairns, the vici- 
nity of this camp would seem to have been the scene either of a 
succession of contests, or of one great and bloody battle. No ac- 
count, or even tradition, indeed, concerning this camp, or these 
tumuli, has come down to us. But this is perhaps the most con- 
clusive circumstance that removes their date to the time of the 
Romans. For, had such transactions as they unquestionably in- 
dicate taken place in more recent times, we may conclude that 
some tradition, at least, about them would have come down to us, 
as has been the case with the battle of Luncarty with the Danes. 

That these tumuli or cairns were erected over native chiefs, and 
not over the leaders of the Romans, or other enemies, is establish- 
ed by one circumstance, besides the practice of our ancestors, 
which of itself, however, might appear conclusive on the subject, 
whilst the same circumstance, as well as the magnitude of the prin- 
cipal cairn, bespeak the quality of the person intended to be com- 
memorated, and at the same time connects these cairns with the 
camp in question. The circumstance to which I refer, is the name 
which is given to the lands on which the camp stands. The names 
of places are one of the best evidences which we possess of ancient 
historical events, in the absence of historical records. The lands 
on which the camp stands are called Pitcairn, that is to say, the 
cairns of the graves; pit, in Gaelic, signifying a grave. This name 
then connects these cairns, which stand on the lands of Balm- 
blair and Bridgeton, with the camp, which stands on the lands of 
Pitcairn ; and therefore proves that the persons buried under these 
cairns perished in battle. 

The same name, which is compounded entirely of Gaelic ety- 
mons, proves that these tumuli were the burial places of native 
chiefs. For had they been erected over Romans, the name would 
have given some indication of its Roman origin. And, the cir- 
cumstance that these cairns have given the name to the adjacent 
lands, proves that the principal person intended to be commemo- 
rated was a great landed proprietor in the country. For if he had 
been any inferior personage, or even any person of equal import- 
ance from a distance, though he might have given his name to the 
place of his burial, it is not likely that lands, which had never be- 
longed to him, or with which he had no connection, would have 
taken the name which is given them in tenures, from the circum-

stances of his death. Now in the time of the Romans the land 
was not parcelled out amongst a number of small proprietors as at 
present, but was held in great districts by a few nobles or'petty 
princes. In this way, by putting together the different circum- 
stances in our possession, and comparing them with the ancient 
state of society in our country, we arrive, almost with certainty, at 
the conclusion, that the principal cairn in this place, of which an 
admeasurement is given at the foot of the page, is the burial-place 
of a great landed proprietor, or British Chief, who perished in bat- 
tle, in defence of his country, most probably against the Romans. 

Battle of Luncarty. — Not much inferior in interest to the site of 
the Roman station of Orrea, is the scene of the battle of Luncarty, 
so extraordinary and almost romantic in its circumstances, and so 
important in its results. The field on which this battle was fought 
lies on the banks of the Tay, about two miles above the mouth of 
the Almond, and within the period of the incumbency of the last 
minister, which extended to forty years, was covered with small 
tumuli ; but there is now no other memorial of the contest but two 
upright stones, one of which, about four feet high, retains the name 
of Denmark. Although this battle is mentioned by all our his- 
torians, by Boetius, Fordun, and Buchanan, the precise year in 
which it was fought is not accurately known ; but it took place un- 
der the reign of Kenneth III. about the year 990, or somewhat 
earlier, Kenneth having been assassinated by Fenella in 994. 

The Danes had landed in great force at the mouth of the river 
Esk ;f and having taken the town of Montrose, they levelled both 
the town and its castle with the ground, massacring all the inha- 
bitants without distinction of age or sex. They then marched 
across the whole province of Angus, laying the country waste in 
their progress till they reached the Tay, where they encamped on 
one of the hills in the vicinity of Perth. The King was at Stir- 
ling when intelligence of these occurrences was brought him; from 
whence he immediately marched with all the strength he could 
muster, to watch the motions of the enemy ; having written to 
those nobles who were not at hand, to follow him as soon as pos- 
sible, with all their forces. He speedily arrived at Moncrieff Hill,

— Buchanan says at the confluence of the Tay and the Earn, — 
where he fixed his camp, which was soon filled by a multitude 
of his countrymen ; the nobles having joined him with all their re- 
tainers. Whilst he was here organizing his forces, word was sud- 
denly brought him that the enemy had crossed the Tay, and were 
laying siege to the town of Perth, then called Bertha. When the 
King heard that a place of such importance, and so near, was in 
danger, he immediately marched thither, and, passing by the ene- 
my, took up his position at Luncarty, to the north of them. 

The Scots were next day eager for the encounter, and drew out 
their forces in order of battle, on a level piece of ground; but the 
Danes, who were stationed on an opposite eminence, would not be 
drawn from their advantageous position, and the Scots could not 
attack them in it without great danger. The King therefore threw 
forward his archers and javeline throwers, sagitarii et jaculatores 
who so annoyed the enemy from a distance, that they were forced 
to advance to the contest on more equal terms. A terrible battle 
ensued on the level ground, which was fought for some time with 
doubtful success. At length, the centre of the Scottish army was 
exposed by the flight of both wings, which the Danes were pursu- 
ing with great vigour. It would have been a most disastrous day 
to the Scots, says Buchanan, had not assistance been providential- 
ly brought to them in their extremity by one man.f The battle 
was observed by a man of the name of Hay, who, with his two 
sons, all of them of great strength both of body and mind, J were 
employed in a field, on the opposite side of the river. His love 
of his country, for which he was remarkable, was touched by the 
danger of his countrymen ; when, seizing on the yoke of his 
plough, and his sons on whatever they could find, and crossing the 
Tay at the shallow part of the river, they reached the field of bat- 
tle at the critical moment of the flight, which, first by entreaties, 
and then by threats, they endeavoured to stop, declaring that they 
would put to death those who persisted.§ Then throwing them- 
selves with fury upon the foremost of the pursuing Danes, they 
gave the Scots a moment to rally on an eminence, which still re- 
tains the name of Turn-again hillock. The battle was now re-

newed on somewhat different ground, when Hay, leading some of 
the clans down a deep ravine, took the Danes in flank and rear, 
which threw them into confusion. At this critical moment again, 
another circumstance occurred which completed their disorder. A 
great shout was raised by a number of grooms, and a rustic crowd 
of peasants, which appeared to the Danes to be a new army, and 
increased their panic. The fortune of the day was now, therefore, 
entirely changed, and the Danes were routed with such prodigious 
slaughter, that those who escaped the sword perished in the river. 
A despairing effort was, however, made to save their commander's 
life, by defending an eminence close to the banks of the river ; but 
all their efforts were unavailing. For here the Danish General, 
according to Fordun, the King himself, was slain ;-f and the stone 
mentioned above, which yet retains the name of Denmark, still 
marks the spot of his fall. 

Such was the celebrated battle of Luncarty, which, having been 
turned from defeat to victory, by the undaunted valour and success- 
ful conduct of one man and his sons, laid the foundation of the for- 
tune of the family of Hay, which includes in it the three earldoms 
of Errol, Tweeddale, and Kinnoull. 

After this complete victory, the King wishing to march in tri- 
umph into Perth, directed that splendid robes should be brought 
for the gallant Hay and his sons, that they might make a suitable 
appearance, but he refused to put them on ; and, having only wash- 
ed off the dust, and marching into the town, dressed in his every-day 
garments, and carrying the yoke with which he had done such ser- 
vice over his shoulder, he fixed the eyes of all men upon him, and 
received the whole credit of the fortune of the day.j An assem- 
bly of states having been held shortly after, at Scone, it was there 
decreed to give the valiant Hay his choice of the Greyhound's 
course or the Falcon's flight, as a suitable reward for having deli- 
vered his country from so formidable an enemy. Hay having 
chosen the Falcon's flight, the noble bird was unhooded on the top 
of a hill in the vicinity of the city, and stooped not in his flight till

he reached the confines of the parish of Errol, where he alighted 
on a large stone, which still bears the name of the " Hawk's stane." 
All the intervening ground was given in property to the family of 
'« Hay of Errol," though it has since that period been either ap- 
portioned to different members of the family, or alienated to other 
parties. In memory of these events, the family of Hay still wear 
as their arms, argent, three scutcheons, Gules : with the yoke in- 
scribed, i. e. three golden shields in a silver shield ; an indication, 
as Buchanan thinks, that the public safety was defended by the 
singular valour of three men, in an important battle. 

• Of the existence of this battle there can be no doubt. And although some critics 
have pretended to find improbabilities or impossibilities in its principal circumstances, 
there is such unquestionable evidence of their truth, besides the direct testimony of 
all our historians, as no criticism can overcome. Lord Karnes, in his " Sketches of 
the History of Man," has said, 44 This story has every mark of fiction. A man 
ploughing in sight of a battle, on which depended his wife and children, his goods, 
and perhaps his own life ; three men, without rank or figure, with only a stick in the 
hand of each, stemming the tide of victory, and turning the fate of battle. I mention not 
that a plough was unknown in Scotland for a century or two after that battle ; for 
that circumstance could not create a doubt in the historian, if he was ignorant of it." 
A little attention, however, to the circumstances narrated above, will, I think, remove 
this objection. If it be remembered, that the Scottish army did not arrive at the 
scene of action till the preceding day, and that the field in which Hay was at work 
was on the opposite side of the river from the field of battle, it will not appear so ut- 
terly incredible that he was at work as is pretended. Besides, the fair inference from 
this part of the criticism, only extends to the circumstance of his being actually en- 
gaged in agricultural labour. It does not follow that he could not be in the fields 
observing The action, nor imply the impossibility of his seizing the yoke; and his me- 
rit would be as great on the one supposition as the other. Again, the criticism of 
this able and respectable author is as full of self-contradictions as the story itself. In 
order to give point to his criticism, he is obliged to suppose what is not stated by 
any historian that Hay was « unconcernedly" following his ordinary occupation, and 
thre at the very moment that his own narration represents him as roused into rage at 
the flight of his countrymen. 

If the interest he should naturally have taken in the fate of the battle from ' his 
•wife and children, his goods, and perhaps his life" being dependent upon it, ren- 
dered it impossible for him to be an unconcerned spectator, as the criticism implies, 
would not these be excitements to strong and even desperate efforts in behalf of his 
countrymen  Add to this that the learned author, in order to make his case the 
stronger, has founded on Hay and his sons wanting " rank and figure," which yet, if 
they had possessed, would not have been of the slightest avail to them in the given 
circumstances. Not only in that age, but especially in the circumstances supposed, 
personal prowess was every thing, and « rank and figure" nothing in stemming the 
tide of victory. Lastly, the learned author concludes his remarks on this battle by 
saying, " that a plough was unknown in Scotland for a century or two after that bat- 
t ]g » j t ; s a pjty that the author had not quoted the authority on which so confident 
an assertion is founded. It is certainly contrary to all that we have read of the an- 
cient state of our country. A plough not known in Scotland till about the year 1 100 
or 1 200 ' 1 One might have thought that the Romans would have introduced the 
knowledge of the plough into our country eight hundred or a thousand years before 
this, if it had not been previously known. But what do their historians say on the 
subject  Caesar De bello Gallico, lib. v. says that those " qui ex Belgis transierunt" 
inhabited the coasts " atque agros colere caeperunt." Tacitus, De Julii Agricolee 
Vita," speaking of Caledonia, says, " Solum— patiens frugum, fiecundum, tarde mites- 
cunt] cito proveniunt." Our own historian, Buchanan, says, " Picti agris fertilioi i- 
bus secundum mare Germanicum colendis assuescerent." How, we may ask, could 
they cultivate the soil without some kind of plough Surely, in making the above

asseveration, Lord Kames had either forgot the date of the battle of which he speaks, 
or had not remembered that Luncarty is in the very heart of the kingdom of the 
Picts. and in the vicinity of its capital. The battle of Lunearty was fought about 
the year nine hundred and ninety of our era. Agricola was settled in his camp at 
Orrea, almost on the same spot, about the year eighty, or nine hundred years he- 
fore. Not a plough known during all this time  Credat Judreus  Tacitus shows 
us, at great length, the care of Agricola to initiate the Scottish youth in the arts and 
luxury of the Romans ; 1 wonder he never gave them any lessons in agriculture ; the 
more especially as some knowledge of that art was absolutely necessary to enable them 
to pay the tribute, which, the auihor tells us, consisted of money and corn. And one 
cannot help wondering how the Scots could discharge these vectigalia before a plough 
was known among them. Abernethy and Brechin still testify to us, that the Picts 
were great artificers, but they could be no agriculturists, for a plough was not known 
in Scotland for three hundred years after the overthrow of their kingdom

Ancient Manners. — For a long time after the Reformation, so- 
ciety was in a state of disorder, the contemplation of which is apt 
to fill us with profound astonishment. The corruption of manners, 
which the depravity of the Popish clergy had introduced, and coun- 
tenanced, was not so speedily reformed as the errors of their faith; 
and for more than a hundred years after the introduction of Pres- 
bytery, not only the immoralities of drunkenness and debauchery, 
but the grosser and more enormous crimes of adultery, incest, as- 
sault, and murder, prevailed to an almost incredible extent. The 
criminal law against these crimes seems neither to have been regu- 
larly nor vigorously enforced, and the correction or punishment of 
them seems to have been left, in a great measure, to the church. 
The records of our Presbytery, which extend back to 1619, teem 
with such enormities, and present us with strong pictures of the 
corruption of manners, — the defective administration of the law, — 
and the ancient power of the clergy. There are two instances of 
this kind, connected with this parish, which are so extraordinary in 
their nature as to deserve to be recorded. In 1620, Harry Shaw 
of Pitmurthly, made an assault upon Mr Young, his minister, an 
aged and infirm man, because he had executed a summons against 
him, by direction of the Presbytery, " pursuit him" as the record 
says, " invadit him to the danger of his life, having in his hands 
ane rung, with ane long dirk or else ane dalger ; and, although the 
poor old man repeatedly called for mercy, made him swear that he 
icould never speak of him before the Presbytery, or by the blood of 
Jesus he should instantly die." Yet the only punishment inflicted 
for this dastardly and cruel assault was, that he should appear in

REDGORTON. 



170 



the kirk of Redgorton " ane Sabbath in lynen clothes" " and confess 
that he did the minister wrang in the manner foresaid."  

The other case referred to is more extraordinary still. On the 
23d November 1619, Colin Pitscottie, eldest son of John Pitscot- 
tie, of Luncarty, which was then a barony, was charged before 
the Presbytery with having murdered Alexander Lamb, in Ben- 
chill, under cloud of night, in the house of Walter Whytock, 
smith, within the parish of Redgorton. No notice was taken of 
this murder by the civil authorities. But, after various procedure, 
Colin Pitscottie appeared before the Presbytery, and confessed 
himself guilty of the murder. Yet the only punishment inflicted 
on him for this crime, was, that he was ordained " to make his 
public repentance for the murther of umquhil Alexr Lamb, in the 
kirk of Redgorton, in lyning clothes ane Sunday afoirnoon." The 
details of thsse very singular proceedings will be seen in the ex- 
tracts from the presbytery records given at the foot of the page. 

" Extract from the Records of the Presbytery of Perth — The presby of Perth 
halden in the revistry, 12th Septr 1620. Quhilk day William Young, minister 
of Kedgorton, complains to the brethren upon Harry Shaw of Pitmurthly, of the 
quhilk complaint the tenour follows, bearand in effect,- that the said Wm upon 
Thursday the 7 of Septr instant, he being among the stooks upon his own 
gleib, in ane solitar and quyet place, callit the How of the Park, at his meditations 
in quyet and sober manner, thinking of na evil to have been said or done to 
him of person or persons, but to have lived under God's pace and our sovirane 
Lord's. In the meantime, the said Harry Shaw of Pitmurthlie haveing conceivit ane 
dedly haterit againest the said Wm Young, for citing him before the Presbytery 
of Perth, upon an sclander of adultery committed by him wt Janet Mar, the spouse 
of John Patone, sometime in Pitmurthlie, of set purpois, provision and forethought 
fellonie wt crueltie invadit and pursuit him of his lyfe, haveing in his hands ane rung 
with ane long durk, or else ane dalger, and the said Wm Young seeing him in ane 
rage, and threatning him of his lyfe, ran away, the said Harry followed him ane great 
spaice, and cryed theif thy ' feit shall not beir the from me,' the said Wm Young being 
ane eagit man, and feiring he sould have fellit him wt the rung, cryed many tymes 
God's mercy, the said Harry overtaking him that was fleeing callit him traitor, and 
askit quhat he said of him to the presby, and quhen the said Wm answerit he might 
speir at Mr Johne Straquhan, his good friend, the said Harry Shaw commandit him 
to sweir that he sould neevir speek of him again to the presby, or be the blood of 
Jesus he sould presently die. And wt greit difficultie was steyed from farder troub- 
ling him, be some puir men that cam from sheiring of the corns, and immediately 
thereaftir the said Harry made vant of his doing to his ain scheiriris, and expressly 
declared that he had causit the minister swair, and cry many times God's mercy. The 
presby ordains information hereof to be sent to my Lord Archbishop of St Andrews, 
to rais ane summonds to summond the said Harry Shaw before the hie commission 
for the said violent and barbarous fact. 

At Perth, 8th day of October 1620. — Quhilk day compeirit Harry Shaw of Pit- 
murthlie, and being accusit of the wrangis done be him to Wm Young, his minister, 
and being demanditin special gif he boistit the said Wm Young, and cheisit him and 
cryit ' theif thy feit sail not beir the from me.' And when the minister cryit God's 
mercie, gif he said then to the minister, theif quhat said thou yesterday of me to the 
presby, and bade the minister sweir that he sould never speak of him any moir to presby. 
The said Harry Shaw with great humilitie confessit the samyne and eveiypoynt thereof. 

The presby ordains him to mak his public repentance in the kirk of Regorton ane 
day in lyning clothes, and thair exprimlie confess he did the minister wrang in man- 
ner foresaid.

formation, — was formerly the parish to which the barony of Hun- 
tingtower belonged. Abbot Milne, in his History of the Bishops 
of Dunkeld, gives a curious account of the reason why that church 
was abandoned as the place of worship of the ancient family of 
Ruthven, to whom the barony of Huntingtower belonged, and 
who had their residence at that ancient castle, on the opposite 
side of the River Almond. He tells us, " that a son of Lord 
Ruthven, having come to this church to be baptized, was drowned in 
the River Almond in returning home, and that from that time the 
church of St Mary's, at Tippermuir, became the parish church 
of the whole lands on that side of the river." 

But the lands whose history is most interesting are the lands 
of Benchill. These lands were long the property of the Gowrie 
family, who were generally provosts of Perth. After the Gowrie 
conspiracy, they were forfeited to the Crown, along with the rest 
of the family property. They subsequently came into the pos- 
session of the Arnots of Benchill, who also, for a long time, were 
provosts of Perth. They next came into the possession of the 
family of Nairne, and after the Rebellion 1745, were a second time 
forfeited to the Crown, with the exception of Nether Benchill, 
which a few years before had been disponed to Graham of Bal- 
gowan, and concerning which a curious historical notice is given 
below. 

The Chief Land-Owners. — The principal landed proprietors 
are, Lord Lynedoch, who possesses two-thirds of the whole pa- 
rish ; the Duke of Athole ; Mr Smythe of Methven ; and Sir J. 
Stewart of Murthly. 

Modern Buildings. — Almost the only modern building worthy 
of notice in the parish is the Chapel of Ease, now formed into 
the Ecclesiastical Church of Stanley. It is a very handsome 
structure, with a tower 85 feet high on the northern end. It is 
capable of containing 1000 hearers, and was erected at the ex- 
pense of L. 3000, laid out solely by Denniston, Buchanan, and 
Company, for the benefit of their work people employed at their 
extensive cotton-mills at Stanley. Being situated on the top of 
a bank, of considerable elevation above the river, it forms an ob- 
ject of interest and ornament for a great district of country round it. 
There are also at present building, and nearly finished, a mill

count will be given under the article Manufactures. 

Parochial Registers. — The first entry of births in the parochial 
register is 18th November 1706. The record has been kept pret- 
ty regularly since that time, with the exception of the period from 
September 1709, till June 1715, which is blank, and the year 
1743, in which there are only two entries.

The season 183'2, in which Asiatic cholera prevailed, was the 
year in which the greatest number of deaths occurred, the number 
in that year being 28, of whom 13 died of cholera. If the 13 who 
died of cholera were not taken into account, it would reduce the 
average of deaths in the seven years to 17, and render it very nearly 
equal to the number of marriages. The year 1833, which succeed- 
ed the season of the cholera, was more than usually healthy, the 
number of deaths in that year being only 8. This would seem to 
prove that some of those who were carried off by cholera were 
those of feeble constitution, and who would have died by other 
diseases, or by the course of nature, in the following season. The 
deaths in the season of the cholera itself too, if the number who 
died of that disease be deducted, falls below the average ; which 



REDGORTON.

seems to favour the supposition, that some who died of cholera 
would have died that very year of other distempers. At the same 
time, it is certain that some young and healthy persons, who, by the 
calculation of human chances, might have survived many years, 
were carried off by that dreadful malady. 

The number of children in the parish has been taken, in the 
district of Stanley, under fifteen years of age, and in the rest of the 
parish, under twelve, which give as nearly as possible the same re- 
lative result. 

The number of children in Stanley district under 15 years of age is . 239

The onlv residing heritor in the parish is John Marshall, Esq. 
the principal partner of the Luncarty Company, who hold a feu 
of upwards of 130 acres from Lord Lynedoch. 

The language generally spoken in the parish is Scotch, which, 
as education advances, is receiving an admixture of indifferent 
English. None of the natives speak Gaelic, but some recent set- 
tlers are imperfectly acquainted with English, and some, as they 
express it, have the advantage of the " twa tongues." Their ha- 
bits are cleanly, — at least much more so than in country parishes, 
where there is not such an admixture of people employed in pub- 
lic works. 

With the exception of the inhabitants of Stanley, most of those 
who are employed in public works are engaged in bleaching, 
which may be regarded as the staple of our manufactures. The 
people employed at such fields enjoy regular but not extravagant 
wages ; which, with prudence, are sufficient to provide for the 
comfortable subsistence of an orderly family; but do not give 
scope for that extravagance, arising from exorbitant wages, which 
is the fertile source of all manner of dissipation. This secures a 
propriety in their deportment, and a steadiness in their character, 
above what is ordinarily found in those who are engaged in public 
works. We cannot, therefore, free ourselves from some appre- 
hension that the flax and cotton spinning-mills that are erectino- in

the parish, may introduce a dissoluteness of manners, and a disre- 
gard of religion, which is as yet foreign to the character of our 
people ; and of which we have only had a slight specimen in the 
few strangers that have been attracted to the flax spinning-mill 
that is already in operation. 

Poaching salmon formerly prevailed in some degree, but is now 
entirely suppressed- Poaching in game also was formerly more 
prevalent than it is now. There are still some characters, how- 
ever, that are suspected to be addicted to it ; but these are al- 
ways looked down upon by the rest of the people. Smuggling 
and pawnbroking were never known among them. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

There are in the parish 7fi80 acres. 

Of these there are under wood, - - 860 

uncultivated, including roads, fences, &amp;c. 440 
in grass about - - 600 

under culture, - - 6780 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land in the parish may be 
stated to be from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2 per acre. The grazing of a 
full-grown ox may cost from L. 2, 10s. to L.3; of a two-year old do. 
L. 2 to L. 2, 5s. ; of a yearling do. L. 1, 10s. to L. 1, 15s. ; of a 
Highland sheep 8s. to 9s. ; of a Leicester do. 12s. to 16s. 

Live-Stock. — The breed of black-cattle in this parish was not, 
till within these twenty years,- distinguished by any peculiar charac- 
ter, but consisted of a mixture of all different forms and sizes. 
About that time, however, an importation was made of the Tees- 
water, or short-horned blood ; and the prevailing stock on the 
best farms is now a cross, in various proportions, of that breed 
with the Ayrshire, or some other breed. 

Most of the farmers are also getting into the way of keeping a 
few Leicester sheep ; and Lord Lynedoch has in the parish a 
small flock of Southdowns. With these exceptions, there is no re- 
gular breeding-stock of sheep kept in the parish, but most of the 
farmers are in the way of having a flying stock, which is bought jn 
autumn, and sold at different periods. If the stock purchased be 
three year old wedders, they are flaked through the winter on tur- 
nips, and sold early in spring. If they be two-year old wedders, 
they are kept on turnips through the winter, and grazed the fol- 
lowing summer; or if, as is the more common case, they be 
Highland ewes, they are crossed with Leicester rams, and after 
feeding their lambs, are generally got fat by autumn, when they 



REDGORTON. 



185 



are disposed of to make way for a new stock. This system re- 
quires the land to be retained for three years in grass, which makes 
what is called the six course shift, and is followed with great ad- 
vantage by the best farmers. There are some, however, that still 
pursue the older practice of keeping their land only one year in 
grass, and thus taking a white crop every alternate year; which 
brings the rotation of crops so quickly round, and thereby so tires 
the land, that speaking in general, there is not more grain rais- 
ed on a farm by the four than by the six course shift. 

Putatoe Crop. — The principal dependence of the farmer in this 
parish, as in the rest of this county, is on their crop of potatoes. 
The Perthshire reds have for a number of years held a high cha- 
racter in the London market. The price, however, has been 
very fluctuating, having varied from 7s. to 15s. per boll of eighteen 
stones. An average crop on tolerably good ground may vary from 
30 to 40 bolls per acre. So that a crop of potatoes is more valu- 
able than any crop the farmers can raise ; and it is only from this 
circumstance that they have been enabled for a number of years 
past to pay their rent. But unfortunately a great failure has 
taken place, very generally, in this crop, for several years, from a 
defect of vegetation in the sets planted. In some cases this fail- 
ure has extended to half the crop ; and in some, it has been so 
complete, that the whole has been ploughed up. Wherever agri- 
culture is treated of, a short statement of the causes and remedies 
of a failure, which is of such vast importance to the community at 
large, and of such transcendent interest in the rural economy of 
this great county, cannot be misplaced. Having paid some at- 
tention to this subject, I may state very shortly some considera- 
tions, which could be easily established by referring to what has ' 
occurred in the practice of various agriculturists. 

There are two classes of causes which must be taken into view, 
to account for this failure, and for all the phenomena which have 
occurred with respect to it. The first of these may be denomi- 
nated the remote cause ; the second the proximate causes. 

The remote or primary cause appears to be a failure in the ve- 
getative power of the potatoe, arising from its age ; or the length 
of time that it has been planted since it was raised from seed. 

The potatoe cultivated in Perthshire has been in existence for 
perhaps sixty years. It is not certainly so long since it came into 
general use. But its age is to be determined by the number of 
years that it has been planted, and not in any measure by the ex- 



186 



PERTHSHIRE. 



tent of its propagation. The potatoe then seems to be in that 
stage of its existence in which, under favourable circumstances, it 
will grow as luxuriantly, and produce nearly as good crops as ever 
it did ; but in which its vegetative vigour is so far diminished that 
its growth is obstructed by causes, which, in the earlier stage of 
its existence, it would have overcome. 

These causes I have denominated the proximate causes of the 
failure ; and, so far as they have come under attentive observation, 
they may be reduced to four. 

The first, and perhaps the most general of these is permitting 
the potatoes to spring in the pits. The farmer will tell you, if 
you state this as a cause of the failure of his crop, that this can- 
not be the case. For he has repeatedly planted potatoes, when 
they were much farther sprung, without having a blank in his field. 
He forgets that a plant will push out its shoots much more fre- 
quently in one stage of its existence than in another. 

The second proximate cause of this failure is the practice, which 
has been generally resorted to, of planting the potatoe crop at too 
late a period of the season, by which means the plant has not time 
to ripen, or come to full maturity. Betwixt the new and old terms 
of Whitsunday is the period generally adopted for this operation, 
whereas it ought to be performed in the middle of April. 

The third cause is keeping the potatoes too long above ground 
after they have been cut. This I know to have been remarked in the 
practice of several farmers, and was very strikingly exhibited in my 
own immediate vicinity ; where two sacks of old cut potatoes were 
placed at one end of a field, and two sacks newly cut, placed at 
the other, and two women set to plant them. They filled their 
baskets alternately from the one and the other as they reached the 
ends of the field, and the result was, that every two alternate drills 
was a complete failure, whilst in the other alternate two, there was 
scarcely a blank. 

The fourth cause is the practice of planting the potatoe sets 
upon the dung, especially if it be hot from the yard. The soil is the 
natural place for a plant to grow in ; and it will often grow there, 
when it will grow nowhere else. But my observation of this cause 
is not founded on this reasoning, but upon what occurred in the 
practice of a clergyman in the north. Having a portion of a field 
on which the dung was spread in the drills, but which he could 
not get planted over night, he directed the harrows to be drawn 
longitudinally over the drills, in order to throw a little earth over 



REDGORTON. 



187 



the dung, that it might not be dried before the morning. The 
result was, that the potatoes planted upon the hot dung were a 
great failure, while those planted in the soil were a full crop. 

The statement of these causes will in a great measure suggest 
their proper remedy ; and therefore a few words upon the subject 
will suffice. It is obvious that the first or remote cause can only be 
remedied by having recourse to plants recently raised from seed, 
which is the method provided by nature for renewing or preserv- 
ing the vigour of every one of her productions. Upon this point 
I cannot but refer to the experiment made by Mr Bishop at Meth- 
ven Castle, who has been successful in raising a very excellent 
potatoe from seed, which he has now cultivated to some extent. 

It must be a long while, however, before plants raised in this ' 
way can be diffused over the whole country, and therefore it is of 
importance to attend to the remedy of the secondary causes ; and 
of these the first is the only one which does not itself suggest its 
own cure. Upon the first cause also, it is necessary to say the less, 
that the farmer has practically fallen on a partial cure by bringing 
his seed potatoes from the hill country. Plants raised in a cold 
climate are slower in springing than those raised in a warmer la- 
titude; and if they be not only raised, but kept till about the season 
of planting, in the upland districts, they are often found not to have 
put forth a single shoot, whilst in the low country they have grown 
together like a mat, and perhaps are pushing through their cover- 
ing. Where this remedy is not attainable, its want may be in a 
great measure supplied by burying them deep in the pits, or put- 
ting a great thickness of earth over them, to prevent if possible the 
warmth of spring from reaching them before the season of planting. 

Draining fyc. — Draining has been carried on to a good extent 
in the parish ; and almost all the waste land has been improved, 
except in the barony of Mullion. There is only one water-meadow 
in the parish, which has been irrigated within these few years, by 
Lord Lynedoch. But it is upon a very poor gravelly soil, and al- 
though it be certainly an improvement, it has not been found to 
answer expectation. 

Produce.  — It has been seen above that there are 5780 acres 
in the parish under culture ; and about 600 in grass. If from the 
latter be deducted what is occupied by manufactories, &amp;c. it will 
leave 500 available for pasture. 



 For woods, see page lf6. 



188 



PERTHSHIRE. 



The raw produce from the whole, taking the rotation of crop- 
ping to be five years, may be as follows : 

1156 acres of oats, at 5 bolls per acre, at 15s. per boll, L. 4335 

578  do. potatoes, at L. 1 1 per acre, . 6'358 

578 5 do. turnips, at L. 7 per do. . . 4046 

1 1 56 do. barley, at 5 bolls per acre, at L. 1 per boll, 5780 

1 1 56 do. hay, at L. 4 per acre, - _ 4624 

1156 do. second year's grass, at L. 2 per acre, - 2312 

500 do. permanent pasture, at L. 2 per acre, - 1000 



L. 28,455 

Fisheries. — The Tay has long been famous both for the quan- 
tity and quality of its salmon. But a great diminution has taken 
place of late years in the value of the fisheries. This defalcation 
has taken place over the whole course of the river, and is to be 
ascribed partly to a decrease in the number of the fish taken, and 
partly to a fall of the price in the London market. This defalca- 
tion has taken place to such an extent, that the rental of the river 
is not now above one-eighth of what it formerly was. Lord Lyne- 
doch's fishing, forinstance, in this parish, which used to bring L.550, 
now lets for L. 65 per annum. 

Manufactures. — Although the village of Stanley, which is con- 
nected with the extensive cotton-mills at that place, now the sole 
property of James Buchanan, Esq. of Duanhill, and his sons, be 
partly situated in this parish, yet, as the works themselves are in 
the parish of Auchtergaven, they will fall to be described in the 
account of that parish. 

It has been already stated that bleaching may be regarded as 
the staple of the manufactures of the parish. But, besides the 
three bleachfields at Luncarty, Pitcairnfield, and Cromwell Park, 
there are also in the parish two power-loom establishments, a flax 
spinning-mill in operation, and a cotton spinning-mill, ready to be 
put in motion, all at Cromwell Park, where there are three falls of 
the Almond : and a flax spinning-mill at Pitcairnfield, also on the 
Almond, where there are two falls. 

Luncarty has long been considered the most extensive linen 
cloth bleachfield in Scotland. The ground belonging to the com- 
pany extends to 130 acres and upwards, held in feu from Lord 
Lynedoch, for the payment of a feu-duty of L. 150. The power 
required for driving the machinery is obtained by water brought 
from the Tay, by a dam dike, carried nearly across the river, and 
conveyed in a lead about two miles long, and which takes in the 
united waters of the Shochie and the Ordie, by the bed of these 
rivers being raised to the level of the lead by a powerful dike car- 



3 



REDGORTON. 



189 



vied across them. The waters of the Shochie and Ordie are, how- 
ever, previously brought into the works, by a separate dam-dike, 
which gives a fall of twelve feet, on these waters by themselves. 
They are then conducted into the same channel with the water 
from the Tay, along with the superfluous water which had escaped 
over the upper dam-dike ; and the whole form a very powerful 
stream, on which three several falls are obtained. 

The power thus obtained, gives motion to twenty-four sets of 
beetles, which are in full operation, along with the corresponding 
number of calenders, and also to the necessary bleaching machi- 
nery, such as washing-stocks, rubbing-boards, &amp;c. &amp;c. ; besides a 
fall reserved for giving motion to four other sets of beetles, in a 
separate building, which can be set agoing, should a press of busi- 
ness or other emergent, at any time require their operation. 

The first part of the operation of drying in some descriptions of 
goods, and the whole operation in others, which is" often a very 
tedious process, is here accomplished in a very beautiful and ex- 
peditious manner, by the cloth being carried over fourteen cylinders, 
which are heated by being filled with steam. The cylinders are 
placed in two rows, every one being placed opposite the interstice 
of two in the other row. The cloth being wove round the cylinders 
in the two rows alternately, is thus drawn over three-fourths of 
every one of them, and is taken out in the state of dryness re- 
quired. 

It is stated in last Statistical Account, that there were then 
500,000 yards of cloth annually bleached here. There is now 
at least four times that amount of business done. 

There are therefore annually bleached here, of linen cloth, of 
which a considerable proportion is damask, 2,000,000 yards. In 
these different operations there are regularly employed from 120 
to 130 hands, all of whom are resident on the company's grounds, 
and the greater part of whom have been born and brought up on 
the place. 

Cromwell Park is situated on the Almond, the water of which 
is collected and raised by a very beautiful dam-dike, in the form 
of an arch, having its convex side of course up the stream, and 
abutting on each side, upon one of those dikes, or veins of trap, 
which cross the river. Before this mode of arching the dam- dike 
was adopted, it was repeatedly carried away by the violence of 
the river when in flood, and from its waters being here con- 
fined by the trap dike already mentioned. But from the form 



190 



PERTHSHIRE. 



now adopted, it promises to stand as long as the abutment shall en- 
dure. By this means, three falls are obtained, which give motion 
to as many different works. 

The uppermost of these is that which belongs to Alexander Reid, 
Esq., and consists of a flax spinning-mill, power-looms, anda bleach- 
field ; so that the whole operations requisite to work up the flax 
into a finished article, ready for the market, are conducted on the 
premises. 

In the spinning-mill, there are 430 spindles, which spin flax 
from 2 to 3 lb. per spindles, and of tow from3£ to 7 lb. per do., 11,000 
spindles, per week, amounting to, per annum, 57,200 spindles. This 
is worked up by 40 power-looms capable of working, per week, of 
cloth each 150 yards, making per annum, after allowing for stop- 
pages, &amp;c. a total production of about 300,000 yards. 

The whole is afterwards bleached upon the premises, and fi- 
nally finished by four single sets of beetles, for the markets. 
The whole of these operations employ 120 hands. 
The two next falls are possessed by Hector Sandeman, Esq. who 
has upon the upper of them a cotton spinning-mill, and power-looms. 
The spinning-mill is just finished and ready to be started, and will 
be in full operation before this account passes through the press. 

It contains of self-acting mules 1728 spindles; throstles 1152 do.; 
capable of spinning of No. 40 for warps per week 1000 lbs. ; of No. 
36 for wefts per do. 1000 do. ; making a total per annum of about 
100,000 lbs. The whole is intended to be worked by power-looms, 
of which there are for five-fourths 42 looms ; for eight-fourths 
20 do. ; of which there are in operation 34 do. The water- 
wheel for weaving is 10 horse power ; do. for spinning 20 do. 
The third fall is employed in driving beetles for dressing cloth, 
which is bleached at Tulloch-field, and carried back there to be 
printed. The water-wheel is 17 horse power, and drives four single 
sets and two double sets of beetles. There are at present employ- 
ed 45 hands; will be required in spinning 30 do; the whole 
employing 75 hands. All these different works are on the pro- 
perty of Lord Lynedoch. 

Upon the same river there are, at Pitcairn-mill, two falls ; to 
the upper of which the river is taken in by a dam-dike run ob- 
liquely across the river, and abutting upon the rock, upon which the 
old bridge of Almond is founded ; a mine being driven through 
the rock, behind the foundation, for the passage of the water. 
This fall, which has been for some time employed in driving a 



HKDGORTON. 



191 



flour-mill, is intended to drive a flax spinning-mill by day, which 
is now erecting, and the flour-mill by night. It is held by a com- 
pany of bakers in Perth, on a subset from R. Sutherland Esq. of 
which there are only seven years to run, who have again subset it 
for driving a flax-mill to Messrs M'Dougal and Langlands. The 
flour-mill, which was formerly capable of grinding 200 quarters 
per week, will by this restriction not be capable of grinding above 
50 quarters, or per annum, 21600 quarters. 

The spinning- mill will contain 800 spindles ; capable of spin- 
ning per week of 3 pound yarn, 2400 spindles ; giving a fabrication 
per annum of 124,800 do.  

The bleachfield at Pitcairnfield is in the possession of Ro- 
bert Sutherland, Esq., who holds it and the preceding fall on 
a long lease from Robert Smythe, Esq. of Methven. The power 
here is obtained from the old mill-dam of Pitcairn, where there 
has been a mill as far back as our records go. This fall, besides 
the other requisite machinery, gives motion to eleven sets of beetles, 
which, besides finishing the goods bleached at the field, are em- 
ployed in dressing a considerable quantity of umbrella cloths ; an 
article, the fabrication of which is much attended to by the manu- 
facturers of Perth. There are employed at this work 50 hands. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town, there being none in 
the parish, is Perth, which is upwards of two miles from the most 
adjacent part of the parish ; and upwards of eight miles from the 
remotest part ; except the barony of Mullion, which is from ten to 
twelve miles distant. Perth is also the post-town. 

Roads. — The only turnpike road in the parish is the road from 
Perth to Dunkeld, which runs through it for four miles, and a 
branch from it passing Stanley. On this road, the Dunkeld coach 
passes and repasses every day, as is the case also with the Inver- 
ness mail. 

There are four statute labour roads in the parish. One cros- 
ses it from east to west ; one from north to south ; one branching 
off from the Dunkeld road crosses a part of it from south-east to 
north-west ; and one crosses from south-west to north-east. 

Bridges.— In a parish situated as this is, at the confluence of 
two rivers, the one of which is seldom fordable, and the other ex- 
tremely dangerous when in flood, and which cannot be approach- 
in izvt sr«ef ce this w  —

ed, except from the north-west, through the middle of the Gram- 
pians, without crossing one or other of these rivers, — bridges must 
always be an object of great importance. 

There is no bridge across the Tay betwixt Perth and Dun- 
.keld, the former about two miles and a- half from the southern 
boundary of the parish ; the latter about eight from its northern 
limits. The only communication which we have across the Tay, 
therefore, is by a boat impelled by oars ; and which can carry four 
or five horses, half a score of cattle, or a couple of scores of sheep 
at a time. This mode of conveyance, however, is not applicable 
to the River Almond, over which all our communication with the 
south and west takes place. The Almond is a very rapid river, and 
often comes down in a flood of four feet in a perpendicular breast, 
in which no kind of boat could live. Accordingly we have three 
bridges across that river. Of these, the middle one, called the 
Old Bridge of Almond, has now stood for more than two hundred 
years. It consists of one arch, founded on two rocks, and was 
built in 1619, by a number of gentlemen, the chief of whom was 
John Graham, Esq. of Balgowan, the ancestor of Lord Lynedoch, 
as appears from the following very curious entry in the presbytery 
record. 

" The presby of Perth hauldin in the revestrie of the paroch 
kirk thereof the 26th day of Maii 1619, Mr Johnne Guthrie 
moder. Quhilk day comperit Johnne Graham of Balgowan, 
and exponit to the presby that the water of Almond being ane 
gryt river, quhairn be the violence thereof many ar yeirlie perishit 
as is mair nor notorious, for remeid quharof he and certaine 
uthir gentillmen has concertit with certaine measones to sett ane 
stone brige over the same, quhilk is ane wark wery deir and cost- 
lie, and cannot be gottin performit without that godlie and well 
affectat gentillmen, and utheris, contribute to the building of the 
same. And in respect that it is ane necessarie wark for ane com- 
mon well and wary costlie, he desiris that the brithiring of the 
ministry every ane will deal with their awn parochineris for helpe 
to the samin with als greit diligence as possibly they can, that the 
wark may be endit befoir winter come. Quhilk desyre, as godly 
and reasonabill, the brithrin promises to obey, every ane for their 
awn pairt." 

The lower bridge is on the line of the Dunkeld road, from two 
to three miles below the former. It consists of three arches, each 
of them forming the segment of an ellipse, and was built in 1827. 



UED«ORTON. 



193 



It is a very neat structure, but the settling has sunk the parapet 
over the central arch about an inch below the level of the rest of 
the wall. 

The third bridge is that on which we are most disposed to pride 
ourselves. It is situated at Dalcruive, about as far from the old 
bridge to the west, or up the river, as the second is below it. As 
a modern structure, it is remarkable for its elegance and simplicity, 
for the grandeur of its elevation, and the beauty of its workman- 
ship : — as a benefit, as well as an ornament to the district, it is 
worthy of the splendid scenery amidst which it is placed : — as an 
example of munificence and public spirit in an individual, it stands 
by an unmeasurable distance at the head of all the public, or re- 
corded transactions of this great county. This bridge, like the 
Old Bridge of Almond, is founded on two rocks, or rather upon a 
dike, which here crosses the river, and affords a firm foundation 
for the superstructure on either side. It consists of one semicir- 
cular arch of 80 feet span ; the abutment of which is upwards of 
10 feet high, so that the height of the top of the bridge above the 
bed of the river is fully 50 feet. The foundation stone was laid 
25th August 1832. The arch was keyed 20th August 1836, and 
the centre struck the 1st of September following ; and such is the 
accuracy of the workmanship, that no perceptible settling has taken 
place. The approach to this bridge has required the cutting down 
of two hills, and the filling up of the valley betwixt them ; the 
whole of which, as well as the building of the bridge, has been ac- 
complished, we may say, at the sole expense of Lord Lynedoch, 
the county having as yet contributed only L. 150 from the road- 
money towards the expense. One of these cuts too, having been 
carried through the ridge, along which the ride from Lynedoch 
to the bridge of Bertha runs, has been crossed by a beautiful little 
bridge of a semicircular arch, a miniature as it were of the former, 
at the cost of L. 500. The whole of this public improvement,' 
the building of the bridges, the filling up of the valley over which 
the road is carried, with the cutting of the hills, and erecting the 
corresponding retaining walls, has cost his Lordship about L.4000, 
a sum rarely expended by an individual in one undertaking for the 
public benefit. 

The erection of the Old Bridge of Almond has transmitted the 
name of his ancestor, as a benefactor of the public, for two hun- 
dred years. The erection of this bridge promises to transmit his 
Lordship's fame in the same character, to a still more remote posteri-

ty ; — and forms, indeed, a monument to his memory, more perish- 
able only than that deathless name which he has carved out with 
his sword on the field of Barossa, and at the sieges of St Sebas- 
tiau and Bergen-op-zoom. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated about the 
centre of the lower part of the parish ; and though not in the im- 
mediate vicinity of any village, is as convenient as it could be for 
the general population, being at an equal distance from the vil- 
lage of Luncarty on the east, and Pitcairn-green on the west. It 
is therefore from three to four miles from the extremities of the 
lower part of the parish ; but it is upwards of eight miles from the 
extremity of the barony of Mullion. Though conveniently situated 
for the lower part of the parish, it is impossible that it can be so, 
for a district located from six to eight miles from it, as Mullion is. 
It was built in 1776, and the only repair it has since received is, 
that it was ceiled at the commencement of the present incumbency 
in 1812. It is accordingly both defective in comfort for those 
whom it contains, and inadequate to the population of the parish. 
Its discomfort consists in its not being floored or paved below ; 
and in the narrowness of the pews, which do not admit of persons 
sitting in them without being cramped, unless they sit obliquely, 
which the state of the occupancy does not admit of It is seated 
for 414, and there are upwards of 500 communicants; so that it 
cannot contain the whole communicants at one time. And if it 
be admitted that every young communicant should have seen the 
solemn ordinance of the Lord's supper only twice administered be- 
fore he comes to be a partaker of it ; then there must, on a com- 
munion Sabbath, be 160 communicants who cannot find accom- 
modation in the church. Accordingly it happens that on such oc- 
casions, not only is the church overcrowded, but, from the church 
door to the church-yard door, there is a mass of human beings who 
cannot get entrance into the church to keep with decency the me- 
morial of their Redeemer. 

The manse was built at rather a later date than the church, and 
was repaired in 1829. The glebe consists in all of about 8 
acres of land; and there is a rent of 4 bolls of meal, and 10s. 
Scots paid by Mr Smythe of Methven, for the possession of an- 
other. The stipend has been recently modified to 17 chalders, 
half meal, half barley. But it is as yet uncertain whether this will 
be made good. 

There is a Chapel of Ease, now erected into an ecclesiastical

parish, at Stanley. The minister has a stipend of L. 150 for the 
payment of which he holds a bond by Denniston, Buchanan, and 
Co., and that company has also very handsomely given him a house, 
for which there is no compact iu the deed of erection. 

There are two Dissenting meeting-houses in the parish ; one of 
which belongs to the United Secession, and is attended by 61 in- 
dividuals, young and old, belonging to this parish, according to a 
list taken in 1 835-36 ; — the other of which belongs to the Ori- 
ginal Seceders, which is attended by 63 within the parish, ac- 
cording to the same list. But part of both congregations come 
from the adjacent parishes. The ministers of both chapels are 
paid, I believe, entirely from the seat rents, and may be stated to 
have a stipend of L. 70 or L. 80 each. 

There are at present belonging to the Establishment 1617; to 
other denominations 280 ; not known to belong to any denomina- 
tion, 15. This, however, would not give a just view of the state 
of dissent in the lower part of the parish ; for it gives nearly a 
sixth of the population as Dissenters. But it is worthy of observa- 
tion, that there is a remarkable difference in the proportion of dis- 
sent in the two districts of the parish ; a difference which shews 
that dissent is greatly increased by removal from the means of in- 
struction and superintendence in the Establishment. In the barony 
of Mullion, which contains a population of 100, there are 56 Dis- 
senters, which gives a proportion of more than one-half of the in- 
habitants ; whilst in the lower part of the parish, in the midst of 
which the church is situated, there are only 224 Dissenters out of 
a population of 1812, which gives only a proportion of one-eighth 
of the inhabitants.

would be a still more numerous attendance ; as many are withheld 
from going to church by not knowing where they are to sit, or 
whether they may obtain a seat at all.

ritable purposes is L. 27, 5s. lid.

Education. — If there be any thing like a reflection upon the he- 
ritors of the parish, implied in the statement which has been given 
of the state of our church accommodation, it is gratifying to turn 
to the encouragement which they have uniformly given to the in- 
terests of education in the parish. In the year 1828, when the 
parish school became vacant, — in order to invite a person of 
respectability to the office, they doubled his house accommodation, 
and added an additional piece of ground to his possession. And 
this year, when they found that the number of scholars, whom 
the character of the person they had selected for teacher had 
drawn together, could not be accommodated in the school-room, 
they have added fifteen feet to its length. The number of schools 
in the parish is three ; of parochial schools one. The salary is the 
maximum, and the school fees may amount to upwards of L. 30, 
if the whole are paid up. 

There are no children betwixt six and fifteen years of age who 
cannot read or write ; and only one above fifteen destitute of these 
qualifications, which is regarded as a phenomenon by those who 
are aware of the deficiency. 

The whole of the barony of Muliion is beyond the distance which 
children can possibly travel to school ; and, together with some 
portions of the parishes Auchtergaven and Moneydie, quoad sacra y 
would be greatly benefited by an additional school. 

Poor. The average number of poor on the stated roll who are 

provided for by assessment is 25 ; average amount of monthly 
payments L. 4, 12s. 3d. ; of yearly do. L. 55, 7s. Besides these, 
there are a number of poor who are left to the management of the 
session, who receive L. 47, 2s. 2d. ; making the whole expenditure 
for the poor per annum, L. 102, 9s. 2d. ; of which the average 
amount of church collections, dues of morthcloths, &amp;c. is L. 27, 5s. 
lid. 

Alehouses. — There are no less than eleven houses in the pa- 
rish licensed to sell ale and spirits. But of these, there are five, 
which being placed on the public roads, and not in villages, may be 
regarded as supplying the demands of the public beyond the bounds 
of the parish. Still six remaining houses should be more than 
adequate to supply the necessary demands of the parish, though 
the others should sell no spirits to the parishioners. And it would 
be desirable if the means of doing so could be devised, that some 
of them should be suppressed. Any attempts that have been made

by the kirk-session for the accomplishment of this object have 
been counteracted from other quarters. 

General Observations. 
There are few parishes in Scotland that have undergone greater 
improvement, since the date of last Statistical Account, than this, 
■whether we look merely at its external aspect, or regard it in an 
agricultural, or in a mercantile point of view. The woods which 
were then but recently planted have grown up, both for ornament 
and for utility. The marshes have been drained, and the waste 
land improved ; and a new and better system of agriculture in- 
troduced. It begins to be generally understood that the land 
cannot stand a constant system of cropping, without intervals of 
rest. The sheep husbandry is, therefore, daily gaining ground ; 
and the breed of cattle has been improved both in size and easi- 
ness of maturity. In manufactures those anticipations of future 
prosperity which were then indulged have been in a great mea- 
sure realized, though not exactly in the anticipated lines. There 
were then five hundred thousand yards of cloth bleached an- 
nually iu the parish, there are now from three to four millions. 
There were then about two hundred thousand yards of cloth print- 
ed, there is now nearly double that quantity made. The cotton- 
works now about to be put in motion may be nearly equal to those 
which were then in contemplation ; besides which there are or 
will be from twelve to thirteen hundred spindles, for spinning flax, 
and the introduction of power looms has opened up an extensive 
branch of manufacture, which was then altogether unknown. 

In the midst of such extensive operations, it would be useless to 
speculate upon the capabilities of the parish for future improve- 
ment. It is only to be wished that the agricultural and commer- 
cial interests of the country may continue, or be increased; of which 
its local advantages, and the spirit of its people will always make 
this parish a proportional participator.

rRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. J. W. THOMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish of Money die spelt Mo- 
nedie in the former Statistical Account is of a long irregular 
form, extending from S. E. to N. W. about 10 miles in length, 
and varying from 1 to 3 miles in breadth. Its superficial extent 
may be reckoned about 18 square miles. 

It may be necessary here to explain the reason of the wide dis- 
crepancy between these statements, and those of the former Statis- 
tical Account. The present parish of Moneydie consists of two por- 
tions, viz. the old or original parish, and the new parish or Logieal- 
mond, which, about eighty years ago, was disjoined from the neigh- 
bouring parish of Monzie, and annexed quoad sacra to Moneydie. 
Of these two portions, the author of the former account treated 
separately, — giving the statistics of each by itself. As the two 
districts differ so widely from each other in many particulars, some 
advantage might no doubt be gained in point of minuteness, by 
giving a distinct and separate account of each. It is hoped, how- 
ever, that every important and practical end may be gained, and 
some confusion avoided, by conjoining the two, and describing the 
parish as one whole, distinguishing them only in those particulars 
where circumstances seem to render such distinction necessary. 

The parish of Moneydie is bounded on the east by the parish 
of Redgorton ; on the south by Redgorton and Methven ; on the 
west by Fowlis; and on the north by Auchtergaven, Little Dunkeld, 
and a detached portion of Redgorton. The western, or Logieal- 
mond section of the parish, lies on the southern face of the first 
range of the Grampians, sloping down toward the River Almond, 
which forms the march with the parish of Methven. The eastern 
extremity reaches almost to the River Tay, near Luncarty bleach- 
field. With the exception of the Logiealrhond hills, which rise 
to a height probably of 1800 feet above the level of the sea, there 
are no rising grounds of any importance in the parish. 



M0NEYD1E. 

Rivers.-The Almond is the only river of any consequence in 
the parish, and abounds with salmon and trout. There are be- 
sides two smaller streams, the Shochie and the Ordie, both ot 
which take their rise in the Grampian range, and flow into the 
Tay, affording excellent trout-fishing. 

Geology, Soil, c— With respect to geological structure, the pa- 
rish is distinguished by nothing remarkable. The Logiealmond 
Hills consist for the most part of blue slate rock, blended with 
smaller portions of other primitive formations. In the lower 
grounds, every diversity of soil almost is to be met with. In the 
vicinity of the streams, a light alluvial soil chiefly prevails, varied 
occasionally by a rich black loam, on a hard gravel bottom. A 
little farther from the bed of the river, a kind of strong red eartH 
is found, and a considerable proportion also of black loam. On 
the more elevated grounds, the soil consists for the most part of 
cold wet till. Clay is of rare occurrence ; and, except in the re- 
mote parts, near the hills, there is little or no peat moss. 

Quarries.— In Glenshee, there is a slate quarry, which is now 
but little worked, owing to the greatly superior quality of the slates 
found in the neighbouring quarry of Craiglia, situated a few miles 
to the westward in the same range of hills, but in the parish of 
Fowlis. About the middle of Logiealmond, there is a quarry of 
grey freestone, of a remarkably fine quality, and easily wrought. 

TI. — Civil History. 

In Roman Catholic times, the parish of Moneydie seems to have 
been a parsonage connected with the diocese of Dunkeld. Little 
informtion tending to throw light upon this period of its history 
can now be obtained. About the year 1480, the living was held 
by Alexander Myln, Canon of Dunkeld, who also styles himself 
" Prebendary of Moneydie." Myln was the author of a work en- 
titled " Lives of the Bishops of Dunkeld," a rare and curious work, 
containing much interesting information both of a general and lo- 
cal nature. In the Cathedral Church of Dunkeld, the following 
inscription is found :-—Hic jacet eximius vir Magister Alexander 
Douglas, Rector de Monidie, qui obiit 17 Dec. anno Dni Millesi- 
mo quigentesimo xlviii. 

Ancient Proprietors of Land. — According to Myln's account a 
large proportion of the property of the parish seems to have been 
in the possession of his diocesan. About the middle of the fifteenth 

 This work has been recently reprinted in be fust volume of the Transactions 
of the Literary and Antiquarian Society of Perth.

PERTHSHIRE. 



century, he tells us, that Bishop Brown " purchased from Ro- 
bert Waus, citizen of Edinburgh, for three years of the fruits of the 
Church of Cramond, the lands of Wester Kinvaid, Wester Low- 
stown, and Easter Lowstown. These lands he mortified to the 
church, and got them united to the barony of Dunkeld, but upon 
the express condition that a layman was to hold them of the 
church, and to perform the services to the King which fell to 
these lands." In addition to these, the bishop was proprietor of 
the lands of Pittendynie and Kinvaid. The present glebe of the 
parish, which has evidently belonged originally to the estate of 
Pittendynie, was in all probability allocated during the time of 
this bishop. The next largest proprietor in the parish in these 
Says seems to have been the master of Gowrie : for in an old 
" list of lands and baronies contained in the seizin of James Mas- 
ter of Gowrie," and executed on the 1 1th April 1584, we find enu- 
merated " the whole and entire lands of Moneydie, Balmblair, 
Ragilmy, with the half of the milns, multures, and miln-lands." 
The estate of Strathord was then in the possession of Sir Patrick 
Crighton, from whom it was purchased by the ancestor of the first 
Lord Nairne. The only other proprietor of that period was An- 
drew Malcolm of Moneydie Roger, father of the Rev. John Mal- 
colm, minister of Perth, a distinguished scholar, and intimate 
friend of Andrew Melville. The above were all in the old or ori- 
ginal parish of Moneydie. The annexed district of Logiealmond, 
which extends to more than double the size of the original parish, 
appears then to have been in the possession of a family of the 
name of Logie. 

Present Proprietors. — At present, the original parish of Money- 
die is entirely in the possession of Lord Lynedoch and the Duke 
of Athole : and almost equally divided between them. Logieal- 
mond is wholly the property of Sir John Drummond Stewart, 
Bart, of Grandtully. 

Eminent Persons. — In the former Statistical Account, there are 
notices of two eminent persons connected with this parish. The 
first " Bessy Bell," celebrated in song as the companion of " Mary 
Gray," a daughter of the house of Lynedoch, who, during the ra- 
vages of the plague, which seems to have been remarkably se- 
vere in this quarter, took refuge together in a sequestered spot, 
still pointed out on the banks of the Almond ; where, however, 

 In digging the foundations of the new church about twenty years ago, the work- 
men came upon an immense accumulation of bones, as if they had been thrown to- 
gether into a pit, supposed to have been the remains of victims of the plague. 



MONEYDIE.

receiving occasional visits from a lover, they both caught infec- 
tion, and fell victims to the desolating malady. The other indi- 
vidual mentioned is a great-grand-uncle of the late Sir William 
Drummond of Logiealmond, a zealous partisan of the house of 
Stewart, who signalized himself at Sheriffmuir, not more for his 
bravery, than for his prodigious feats of strength. His formidable 
broadsword is still exhibited as a curiosity in the Tower of Lon- 
don. Without any disparagement to the merits of this redoubted 
warrior, it is presumed that posterity will be more disposed to re- 
cognize as the ornament of his family and of his country, his late 
eminent and accomplished kinsman, the author of " Origines," 
and the " Academic Questions." 

Antiquities. — In the department of antiquities, few parishes, it- 
is believed, are more barren than Moneydie. Some years ago, 
a few vestiges remained of the old castle of Kinvaid, which are 
now completely removed. The author of the last Statistical 
Account speaking of this ruin says, " it seems to have been 
built before lime was known as a cement." From Myln's history 
we learn that it was built by Bishop Brown, for the purpose 
of protecting his tenantry from the predatory incursions of some 
of their lawless neighbours, and cannot therefore be above 350 
years old. A spot, supposed to have been the site of a Roman 
. camp, is still pointed out ; but its genuineness is very doubtful. 
Like many other Roman camps, if its history were known, it would 
very likely turn out to have been a sheep-pen. Or if it must be 
held to have been a military post, it is more likely to have belong- 
ed to the Scots or the Danes, being in the immediate vicinity of 
the spot where the battle of Luncarty is supposed to have been 
fought. Several cairns of stones have been met with, which upon 
examination have been found to cover human bones. One or two 
circles of stones also may still be seen, which are not unlikely to 
have been places of Druidical worship ; and particularly at the 
western extremity of Logiealmond, there is one remarkable block 
about 12 feet high and 18 feet in circumference, standing upon its 
narrow end, with three other stones in its immediate vicinity. It 
is commonly called the Kor Stone. 

In the boundary line between Logiealmond and the old parish, 
there is a point at which the three dioceses of Dunkeld, Dum- 
blane and St Andrews met. Tradition has it, that the three bishops, 
happening to meet at this point in the course of their perambula- 
tions, pledged each others health out of three wells that happen- 



2 °2 PERTHSHIRE. 

ed to exist within the limits of their respective territories. One 
of these wells was in existence forty years ago, and may possibly 
be so still. 

The parish of Moneydie belonged originally to the presbytery 
of Dunkeld, and was annexed to that of Perth only about eighty 
years ago. From the presbytery seat of the former it is distant 
about ten miles, while it is only six from Perth. 

Parish Register, 8fc. — The parish register goes back as far as 
the year 1655, and has been kept with tolerable correctness. One 
volume, however, embracing the period between April 1680 and 
August 17 J 7, has been lost. There is also an important blank 
from August 12, 1666, to August 28, 1670, which is supposed to 
have been occasioned by the unsettled state of the church at that pe- 
riod. The following is a list of the ministers of this parish, with the 
dates of their settlement and death, so far as has been ascertained : 
David Drummond, ordained May 17, 1655 ; William Smythe, or- 
dained before 1679; Alexander Chapman, ordained before 1705, 
died 1716 ; John Gardner, ordained August 6, 1717, died June 20, 
1738; Gilbert Mann, ordained July 19, 1739, died April 30, 
1754; Patrick Meek, translated from Rattray, December 26, 1754; 
and again translated to Kinnoul July 1761 ; George Fraser, trans- 
lated from Redgorton, May 27, 1762, died 1807; James Somer- 
ville, ordained 1807, died November 30, 1827 ; the present incum- 
bent was ordained August 7, 1828. 

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish seems to have been at one time 
much greater than it now is. The causes of decrease may be easi- 
ly stated. In the old parish, within the last fifty years, many popu- 
lous hamlets have been completely rooted out, and the small pen- 
dicles possessed by cottagers have been thrown together and form- 
ed into large farms. In Logiealmond, where the system of large 
farms has not yet been adopted, and where the population is large 
in proportion to the soil, any decrease that has taken place has 
been in consequence of emigration. Within the last eight years, 
upwards of 100 persons have emigrated to Canada from Logieal- 
mond alone. 

The population is entirely agricultural, with very few excep- 
tions. 

Births, Deaths, and Marriages. — The yearly average of births 
for the last seven years is 17; of marriages 8; and of deaths no 
register is kept. It is proper to remark, however, that the num- 
ber of births here given, docs not exhibit an accurate average, as

At present there are no persons in the parish who can come un- 
der the denominations of " insane or fatuous." There are one or 
two who may be called of weak intellect ; one who is deaf and 
dumb, and one blind. 

Social Comforts, c— The people generally speaking are healthy 
and robust, and seem upon the whole to enjoy a reasonable mea- 
sure of the comforts and advantages of society. Among the pea- 
santry, the staple articles of food are potatoes and oatmeal. There 
are few cottagers who do not keep pigs ; but, with the exception of 
pork, animal food is rarely to be seen, except in the houses of the 
more substantial farmers. 

General Character, 8fc. — With regard to " the general character 
• of the population, intellectual, moral and religious," it is believed 
that they are pretty much on a footing with other parishes simi- 
larly situated. The outward forms of religion are in general punc- 
tually attended to ; few, if any, habitually absent themselves from 
public worship ; and the general tone of morals is upon the whole 
sound and healthy. The most prevailing vice perhaps in the pre- 
sent day, and in all parts of the country, is intemperance. Among 
the many causes that have contributed to bring about this melan- 
choly state of things, there can be no doubt that the lowering of 
the duty on spirits has had a most material effect ; at the same 
time it may be questioned whether or not the needless increase in 
the number of public-houses has not contributed as largely to the 
same mischievous result. Upon this point, the following fact is 
worthy of notice. In the old parish of Moneydie there was not, un- 
til within the last six months, a single whisky shop of any descrip- 
tion, nor was there known to the minister a single individual ha- 
bitually addicted to drunkenness. In the Logiealmond district of 
the parish, on the other hand, there are unfortunately five public- 
houses, and, as might be expected, the sin of intemperance and its 
accompanying vices are found to prevail in a proportionate degree. 
Such a fact as this goes strongly to corroborate the view of those 



204 



PERTHSHIRE. 



who trace the increase of intemperance to the increased facilities 
of indulgence afforded by the multiplication of public-houses. It 
is a comparatively rare thing to find persons drinking to excess in 
their own dwellings. The public-house is the invariable place of re- 
sort. It is there the habit is first acquired, and there it is strength- 
ened and confirmed. A bottle of spirits is seldom or never found 
in the house of a person addicted to drunkenness ; and, on the other 
hand, it is as seldom found awanting in the houses of sober persons, 
in the same rank of life. From this it would appear, that if, instead 
of adopting the temperance society principle, which is neither more 
nor less than entire abstinence, and the chief defect of which seems 
to be, that it aims at more than the word of God enjoins, an associa- 
tion could be formed for discountenancing the practice of frequenting 
public-houses, the members of which association should resolve 
never to enter the door of a public-house, except on certain occa- 
sions to be specified ; and if at the same time every exertion were 
made for diminishing the number of such houses throughout the 
country, it is humbly conceived that more practical good would be 
achieved in the way of suppressing intemperance, than by any other 
mere human means that have yet been suggested. 

Smuggling and Poaching. — At one time, the practice' of illicit 
distillation prevailed to a considerable extent in the parish. It is 
now, happily, almost unknown. Salmon poaching, however, still 
continues to be carried on ; but chiefly by persons unconnected 
with the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
In the old parish of Moneydie there are : 



Imperial acres, a arable, 2718 
Do. pasture, 771 



In Logiealmond :

Imperial acres, arable, 2237 
Do. pasture, 4869 



-7106 



Total, 10,595 
Of the land under pasture there are about 300 acres in the old 
parish, and probably 600 in Logiealmond, which, by a judicious 
application of capital, might be brought under tillage. About 800 
acres are under wood ; a large portion of which is old and valuable, 
and consists for the most part of Scotch fir. In the more recent 
plantations, larch, spruce fir, and oak, chiefly prevail. Of late 
years, oak has been very extensively planted on the estates of Lord 
Lynedoch ; and as this kind of wood seems to thrive upon every 



MONEYDIE. 



205 



kind of soil, and to find nourishment where hardly any other trees 
will grow, there is little doubt that it will turn out a profitable 
mode of employing waste land. 

Rent. — The rent of arable land varies from 10s. to L. 3 per 
acre. The average in the old parish is about L. 1, 10s., and in 
Logiealmond L. 1, 3s. The real rent of the whole parish is about 
L. 7800, whereof about L. 3700 are in Logiealmond. The valued 
rent is L. 3023 Scots. 

Improvement. — That great improvements have been introduced 
into the practice of agriculture within the last forty years, are suf- 
ficiently indicated by the fact, that the rental of the parish, which 
was then only L. 2600, is now exactly trebled ; a circumstance 
which cannot be attributed to any rise that has taken place in the 
price of corn, for at the close of last century, the value of wheat 
did not differ materially from that which it has borne for the last 
five or six years. Within the period before-mentioned, however, 
an immense deal has been done in the way of draining, enclosing, 
and improving waste land. The system of run-rig, which then 
prevailed to a great extent, is now completely abolished ; numbers 
of small pendicles are thrown together into one large farm ; and 
land, which formerly afforded subsistence to a hundred or a hundred 
and fifty individuals, is now in the possession of one tenant, not 
giving food to above twelve or fifteen persons, but proportionally 
augmenting the rent to the landlord. From these causes, together 
with various improvements in agricultural implements, — the intro- 
duction of new and improved seeds, better systems of rotation, and 
in general the superior character of the whole mode of farm manage- 
ment, land which used seldom to yield more than three or four 
returns, now produces eight or ten, and sometimes more. 

The most decided improvement that has of late years been in- 
troduced is the application of bones as a manure for raising tur- 
nips. By means of this discovery, the farmer is now enabled to 
apply the whole strength of his dunghill to his potatoe crop ; and 
by sowing his turnips with bones, and then eating them off the 
ground with sheep, his whole fallow break is completely manured, 
and put in excellent order for the succeeding crop of barley. The 
advantages of this system are great. Of late years, the quantity 
of potatoes raised in this part of the country, and exported to the 
London market, has been very large. With the low price of grain 
for some time past, the chief dependence of many farmers for pay- 
ing their rent has been upon the potatoe crop. But experience 



206" 



PERTHSHIRE. 



has shown, that, without very heavy manuring, there is no crop 
that more speedily exhausts the land. And there is little doubt, 
that, in process of time, it must have proved utterly destructive to 
all light soils lying beyond the reach of town manure, had not the 
introduction of bones come so opportunely to the aid of the far- 
mer, and enabled him to apply the whole of his farm manure to 
the potatoes. The ordinary price of bone-dust in Perth is about 
2s. per bushel, and about ten bushels are employed to the acre. 

Another decided improvement in husbandry consists in pastur- 
ing grass land with sheep and cattle, instead of cutting it for hay ; 
but this is a practice, of course, which can only be followed with 
advantage in those farms which are peculiarly adapted for stock. 

Cropping. — The system of cropping most commonly followed 
is what is technically termed a four-course shift, viz. oats, green 
crop, barley, and grass. Most farmers, however, let their land lie 
two years, and sometimes even more in grass. There are no beans 
grown in the parish, and very little wheat. Lint, which at one 
time was cultivated to a considerable extent, is now seldom sown, 
owing to the almost entire discontinuance of the practice of do- 
mestic spinning. 

Stock. — Cattle of all descriptions are reared in the parish, from 
the bulky Teeswater to the diminutive west Highlander. The 
rate of grazing differs of course very materially, according to the 
size and description of the animal. The summer grazing of a 
large full-sized beast when fattening for the butcher, may be rated 
at L. 3 to L. 3, 10s. The sheep are principally of the Leicester 
breed, those at least which are fed upon the low grounds. Besides 
being peculiarly adapted to the nature of the pasture, they are 
prized chiefly on account of their fattening so easily, being less 
destructive to the fences than Highland sheep, and also on ac- 
count of the superior value of their fleeces. Large numbers of 
wedder hogs of this description are annually reared, and sent to 
the Glasgow market from this parish, by Mr Richmond of Money- 
die, one of the most extensive and enterprising agriculturists in 
Perthshire, by whom this kind of stock was first introduced into 
this part of the country, about forty-five years ago. The grazing 
of a full-grown sheep, including a few turnips in winter, may be 
rated at from 5s. to 12s. according to circumstances. 

Produce. — The gross amount of raw produce, according to the 
nearest approximation that can be formed, may be stated to be,

10595 L. 21825 



Wages. — The wages of farm-servants vary from L. 10 to L. 14 
per annum, together with 6 bolls 140 lbs. per boll of oatmeal 
in the year, and 1£ Scotch pints of milk daily. Married men have 
besides, a house and garden, rent free, and as many potatoes as 
they can furnish dung to raise upon their master's field. Many of 
them have, besides, an allowance of coals. The ordinary wages of 
women servants are from L. 4 to L. 6 per annum. Day-labourers 
receive Is. 6d. per diem, and women working in the fields from 
8d. to lOd. Harvest-work is for the most part done by threaving, 
which is generally at the rate of from 2d. to 3d. per threave. 

Manufactures. — There has been recently established in Logie- 
almond, a flax spinning-mill, driven by water-power from the river 
Almond. It affords employment to about fifty persons, chiefly fe- 
males, and natives of the country. When trade is prosperous, as 
at present, the mill is kept going throughout the whole twenty-four 
hours, by means of relays of workers — one set commencing at six 
o'clock in the evening, and another relieving them at six o'clock 
in the morning. There can be no question that this establishment 
has tended greatly to promote the physical comfort of the inhabi- 
tants of the district, by affording constant work and good wages to 
many individuals, who formerly could obtain neither. But it may, 
at the same time, be seriously doubted, whether or not these ad- 
vantages are not more than counterbalanced, by the usual train of 
moral evils which the introduction of manufactures seldom fails to 
bring along with it. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns, 8fc. — There is no village in the parish. Perth 
is the nearest market-town, and is six miles distant. It is also the 
post-town ; although there are penny post-offices at Methven and 
Aughtergaven, each of them at the distance of four miles. No por- 
tion of a turnpike road passes through the parish : it is traversed 
however, by a statute labour road, which branches off from the 
Dunkeld turnpike towards Logiealmond and Glenshee. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which is a handsome and sub- 
stantial edifice, was built about twenty years ago, and is seated for 



208 



PERTHSHIRE. 



460 persons. Nothing, however, could be more awkward or in- 
convenient than its situation. It is set down at the distance of two 
miles from the eastern, and seven from the western extremity of the 
parish, where the great bulk of the population reside. A circle 
with a radius of two miles round the church, includes only about 
330 parishioners, out of 1050, leaving 720 at an average distance 
of 5 miles. Accordingly, as might have been expected, there is a 
Secession meeting-house, planted in the midst of this population, 
in Logiealmond at the distance of six miles from the parish 
church. Under such disadvantages, it is not to be wondered at, 
that, in the course of nearly a hundred years, a large body of the 
inhabitants have become Seceders. It may be remarked also, that 
there are no Seceders with one solitary exception within two miles 
and a-half of the church. The following is a statement of the num- 
bers of church people and Dissenters. Individuals belonging the 
Established Church, 724 ; United Secession, 325 ; Episcopalian, 
2; total 1051. 

At Chapelhill, in Logiealmond, there was an ancient place of 
worship, which had lain in a ruinous and dilapidated state since 
the beginning of last century, but which it was thought, by a little 
repair, might be rendered fit for the reception of a congregation. 
A subscription accordingly was set on foot in the district, and 
through the exertions of the people themselves, aided by the liberal 
contributions of the sole proprietor, Sir John Stewart, and the 
Misses Drummond of Logiealmond, the edifice was completed in 
a neat and substantial manner, at an expense of about L. 150; 
and opened for public worship by the minister of the parish on the 
5th of October 1834. Since that time, divine service has been 
regularly performed in it every Lord's day, to the unspeakable 
comfort of very many persons, who before, on account of this dis- 
tance from church, were almost excluded from the enjoyment of 
public ordinances. The Rev. Mr Omond, now minister of Mon- 
zie, was the first regularly officiating preacher. 

The chapel, which is situated at the distance of four miles from 
the parish church, and two miles from the Secession meeting-house, 
is seated for about 320 persons ; and is completely filled, and to 
a great extent, by persons who formerly, for convenience sake, took 
sittings in the Secession place of worship. A small seat rent is 
exacted, averaging 2s. 6d. which, together with the collections at 
the church door, constitutes a fund, out of which the preacher's sa- 



MONEYDIE. 



20f 



lary and other necessary expenses are defrayed. All the poor are 
accommodated with free sittings. 

Although the erection of this place of worship has had the effect, 
as was to be expected, of diminishing considerably the congregation 
assembling in the parish church, it is no small satisfaction to think that, 
instead of fifty or sixty worshippers, which was all the usual atten- 
dance from Logiealmond at the parish church, there are now up- 
wards of 300 in the regular enjoyment of the means of grace in 
connexion with the Establishment. 

Manse, Stipend, Sj-c. — The manse, which was built about the 
same time as the church, is in good repair, but inconveniently small. 
The offices are old and ruinous. The stipend was augmented in the 
year 1830 to 16 chalders; but the teinds not proving sufficient, it 
amounts only to 130 bolls of victual, two-thirds meal and one-third 
barley, and L. 103, 5s. 2d. in money. The glebe contains 7 
Scotch acres of good average land. 

Education. — There are three schools in the parish, viz. the paro- 
chial school at Moneydie, another at Chapelhill, and another at 
Heriotfield, both in Logiealmond. The parish schoolmaster has 
the maximum salary L. 34, 4s. 4d. The fees are small, and 
do not amount to above L. 10 per annum. He is also session-clerk, 
the emoluments of which office are about L. 5, 16s. The teacher 
at Chapelhill has a free school-room and dwelling-house, with 100 
merks Scots of salary from the heritors ; he has also about two acres 
of land as cow's grass. The teacher at Heriotfield has merely a 
free school-room, which is attached to the Secession meeting-house. 
The branches taught in all these schools are nearly the same, 
reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, book-keeping, and 
practical mathematics. The parish schoolmaster is also qualified 
to teach the elements of Latin, Greek, and French ; but for these 
branches there is little or no demand. In all the schools the 
Scriptures are regularly read, and the catechisms of the church 
taught. The following is a statement of the number of scholars : 
At the parish school, 50 ; Chapelhill school, 76 ; Heriotfield school, 
60; total, 186. It will be seen that there are thus somewhat more 
than one-sixth of the population at school. It is necessary to remark, 
however, that many of these are not permitted to remain above eight 
months out of the twelve, as the circumstances of the parents often 
render it desirable thai; their children should begin as soon as pos- 
sible to do something for themselves. The consequence is, that,

whenever summer begins, numbers of the children are taken from 
school, and sent to herding or some other employment. So far as 
is known, there are no persons in the parish of sufficient age, who 
are unable to read, except perhaps one or two aged individuals, 
and the greater proportion are able also to write. All classes are 
fully alive to the benefits of education, and anxious to obtain it 
for their children. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The district of Logiealmond be- 
ing annexed to this parish only quoad sacra, the kirk-session have 
nothing to do with the poor of that quarter. In the old parish, 
there are only five persons receiving aid from the poor's funds. 
They are allowed from Is. 3d. to 3s. per week. The average amount 
of collections at the church doors is L. 17 per annum. The kirk- 
session have besides a sum of L. 70 laid out at interest. There 
is no assessment ; and any deficiency of funds is made up by a half 
yearly donation of a few pounds from the heritors. 

Alehouses. — The number of alehouses, or as they should ra- 
ther be called whisky-shops, for comparatively little malt-liquor 
is consumed, has been already adverted to. 

Fuel. — In Logiealmond, peats and wood are almost the exclu- 
sive articles of fuel. In the east end of the parish, coals, princi- 
pally English, are used, and which cost at Perth about Is. lOd. 
per cwt.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JOHN ROGERS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The etymology of Collace is uncer- 
tain. It is situated 7 miles north-east from Perth, is perfectly in- 
land, and surrounded by the parishes of Cargill, St Martins, Kin- 
naird, and Abernyte. Its length and breadth being nearly equal, 
and upwards of 2 miles, it contains nearly 5 square miles. 

The surface upon the whole is rather flat, except towards the 
hills, where the ascent is too steep for the plough. The soil in

general consists of a light, sharp, blackish loam, in some places in- 
termixed with clay ; but the bottom is free, being a dead reddish 
sand. The Sidlaw hills, which commence in the parish of Kin- 
noull, here assume considerable elevation. Sid or Sud, in the 
Gaelic, signifies South, a name most appropriate, as they form not 
only the boundary of Collace on the south, but also of a great part 
of the valley of Strathmore. Ranging north-east, they traverse the 
country with little interruption for thirty miles, and lose them- 
selves in the German Ocean, at the promontory in Angus-shire 
called the Red-Head. The climate is variable. In winter and 
spring, piercing and stormy winds from the south-east, are accom- 
panied with a chilly hadr from the sea ; but in general the atmo- 
sphere is clear, temperate, and salubrious. The mean annual tem- 
perature, ascertained from careful observations taken twice a-day 
for a series of years, is about 47° of Fahrenheit. 

There are no epidemical diseases, and as to longevity there are 
not a few both of men and women seventy years of age and upwards, 
enjoying wonderfully good health, and engaged in their various 
occupations ; several are above eighty. 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers. — There are neither ancient nor modern 
historical accounts of this parish, nor have any events taken place 
worthy of public record. The parochial registers go back to 1713, 
and have been pretty accurately kept. They consist of six thin 
folio volumes. 

Eminent Men. — In reference to the eminently good men connect- 
ed with this parish, and now numbered with the dead, we have much 
pleasure in doing justice to the memory of William Nairne, Esq., a 
younger son of the family of Dunsinane. Bred an advocate at the 
Scotch Bar, he soon became Sheriff of Perthshire, and in due time 
was promoted to the important offices of a Senator of the College of 
Justice, and member of the High Court of Justiciary, with the title 
of Lord Dunsinnan. A more upright Judge never sat upon the 
Bench. In 1809, when his public duties were becoming oppres- 
sive to his declining years, he resigned both gowns, and retired to 
his residence at Dunsinnan. He had become sole proprietor of 
the parish some thirty years before, by purchase from his nephew 
Sir William Nairne, at whose death the title also devolved on 
him. To the improvement of his paternal estate, he had as early 
as possible applied, with unabated zeal and perseverance, and so 
judicious were those improvements, that Lord Dunsinnan lived to 
see his rents doubled, and often quadrupled. 



212 



PERTHSHIRE. 



To the welfare of the parish, and more especially to their reli- 
gious instruction, he was equally attentive. He feared God, and 
honoured the King. He remembered the Sabbath day, and was 
never absent from church, except from necessity. His example 
was highly useful in his own time. Still more useful must such 
praiseworthy conduct be in our times, to put to shame, if possible, 
increasing impiety, and to stem the overflowing tide of iniquity. 
Lord Dunsinnan died 22d of March 1812, being upwards of eighty 
-years old, and was buried within the walls of the old church of 
Collace, now converted into a mausoleum for the Dunsinnan fa- 
mily ; and to which there is access by a large arched gateway of 
uncommon beauty, and of the rare and ancient order of Saxon ar- 
chitecture. Lord Dunsinnan was succeeded by our present sole 
heritor, James Mellis Nairne, Esq. who has followed the exam- 
ple of his predecessor, and has laid out a great deal of money in 
improving and beautifying his estate, though it is strictly entailed 
on heirs-male. 

Modern Buildings. — Dunsinnan House, situated in the north- 
west corner of the parish, with a fine southern exposure, and screen- 
ed from the winter blast by extensive plantations, has been lately 
greatly enlarged and modernized by Mr Nairne. No pains have 
been spared to render this mansion not only elegant, but capable 
also of containing the largest family. The offices have been re- 
built on the newest and most approved plan, and are uncommonly 
spacious and convenient. The new church, which was finished 
in 1813, is a handsome Gothic structure, with a square tower sur- 
mounted by minarets. Built on commanding ground, and sur- 
rounded with venerable trees, it is highly ornamental, and much 
and deservedly admired. 

In 1825 a new school and school-house were erected, furnish- 
ing ample accommodation for master and scholars. This build- 
ing, combining every desirable requisite, with a prudent regard to 
economy, may be safely recommended as a model for all such pa- 
rochial new structures when they are required. The garden, partly 
surrounded by a substantial wall, eight feet high, is tastefully laid 
out, and the whole premises are kept in excellent order. 

Quarries. — Two quarries, which have been long wrought on the 
estate, furnish freestone in abundance, and of the best quality, for 
all the houses and other mason-work in the parish. 

Antiquities. — Of these the most remarkable is the far-famed 
hill of Dunsinane, which rises nearly 800 feet above its base, and 



COLLACE. 



213 



1114 feet above the level of the sea. Its oval and conical sum- 
mit is 169 yards in length, by 89 in medium breadth. Upon this 
insulated and chosen site, Macbeth, the Thane of Glammis, in 
1043, and soon after his usurpation of the Scottish crown, erected 
a strong and lofty castle. Here he held his court, and for some 
years was attended by his reluctant vass;tls, and kept the surround- 
ing country in the most degrading subjection. In the meantime 
Malcolm, son of the old and good King Duncan, whom Macbeth 
had murdered, fled into England for protection. The reigning 
prince, Edward the Confessor, not only gave him a kind recep- 
tion, but was prevailed upon also to support his claim to the Scot- 
tish throne by a powerful army, commanded by his brave General 
Siward, Earl of Northumberland. The discontented barons flock- 
ed to the English standard reared in Malcolm's behalf ; and in the 
course of the year 1094 this overwhelming force approached to 
Du nsinane. Being observed from the battlements by Macbeth, 
he considered his fortifications untenable, and immediately fled 
northward. He was pursued, overtaken, and slain, according to 
common report, at Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire. His fortress 
was immediately razed to the ground, and that the destruction 
might be the more complete, fire was employed, as appears from 
the calcined matter and scorched materials among the rubbish. 
Such as take the trouble of ascending this remarkable hill, will find 
themselves amply repaid. The enthusiasm of classic ground will 
be felt and acknowledged by the scholar. The scenery, indeed, 
may call up some of the blackest pages of Scottish history, but 
our recollections will be accompanied by the grateful feeling of as- 
surance that such barbarous times are for ever gone by. The view 
presented from Dunsinane on every side is rich, varied, and pic- 
turesque. Nor is it a more delightful, than it is a commanding 
station. In a clear day, there is nothing to prevent the practised 
eye from taking in fifty miles all around, and obtaining a glimpse 
of sixteen different counties in the horizon. This eminence is 
also favourable to devotion. Turning to the north and north-west, 
an amphitheatre of uncommon grandeur and beauty rises before 
us. Grampians piled on Grampians in countless succession, rear 
their heads beyond the clouds. They display the majesty of the 
Almighty Creator, and fill us with the most sublime conceptions 
of the power of him " who meteth out the heavens with a span, 
weigheth the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance.

The gradual increase of the population is chiefly among the la- 
bourers and handicrafts, which is in a great measure owing to the 
increase of trade and manufactures. Three- fourths of the people 
live in the villages, the remainder in the farm-houses and bothies.

Of the 730 inhabitants in the parish 351 are males, and 379 fe- 
males. The number of families 142, each family at an average 
consisting of about five persons. Inhabited houses 141. One 
person blind, and two others fatuous. 

During the last three years there have been 7 illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — All the land in the parish 
which is considered arable is under cultivation by the plough, and 
in a high state of improvement. Iron ploughs are becoming ge- 
neral, and, when drawn by two good horses, can overtake the work- 
ino- of 50 acres Scotch measure. Iron harrows are also coming 
into use. 

The number of imperial acres under tillage, is . • 1747 

under wood, chiefly Scotch fir and larch, . 560 
under pasture, . . 100 

Hard wood thrives very well in hedgerows. Some of it was 
lately cut, measuring 3| feet in diameter. There are some beech 
trees at Collace village whose girth is not less than 9 feet. 

The rent of land varies according to quality. Some of it is so 
low as L. 1, some of it so high as L. 3 per acre. The average 
may be taken, therefore, at L. 2. The tenants, while they are most 
frugal and industrious, are considered, from the crops they raise, 
as managing their farms in the most skilful manner. Owing to 

clair, and published under the title of " Additional information respecting the Castle 
of Dunsinnan." Sir John, though then only eighteen years old, gave promise of those 
talents, and of the powers of that inquisitive and discriminating mind, which in due 
time was to be directed to the acquisition and diffusion of such important practical 
knowledge, as has raised him to the highest rank among the benefactors of his country.

the nature of the soil and climate, wheat and beans are not always 
profitable. The green crop system is therefore commonly follow- 
ed — a five-shift rotation, including two years in grass, has been 
found most advantageous, and best adapted to the soil. Plough- 
men's wages from L. 12 to L. 14 per annum, with the usual al- 
lowance of meal and milk ; women's wages, from L. 6 per an- 
num to L. 6, 6s. ; mason's and carpenter's from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per 
day ; day-labourers Is. 6d. In winter, their wages are proportion- 
ally less. Women employed at out-door work, 8d. per day ; when 
lifting potatoes, Is. without victuals. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of value of raw produce 
raised in the parish, as far as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Imperial acres. Quarters. 

78 of wheat, produce 245 at L. 2, 8s. per qr. L. 589 4 0 

264 of barley, 1064 at L. 1, 9s. - 1542 16 0 

453 of oats, 1916 at L. 1 , 4s. - 2299 4 0 

500 of grass, artificial cut and pastured, value 1303 0 0 

193 of potatoes, - - - 1721 0 0 

2414 of turnips, - - - 859 0 0 
1 8 of tares or fallow. 



17474 Total value of raw produce, L. 8314 4 0 

In the above calculations, the green crop with the exception 
of part of the hay and potatoes is understood to be consumed on 
the farms, which is the practice generally followed in this parish. 
A few horses are reared for sale, the breed of which, as also of 
the cattle, being very much attended to, have greatly improved of 
late years. A considerable number both of cattle and sheep are fed 
off every winter, and disposed of at a fair profit to the butcher. The 
farm-steadings are among the best in the country, and kept in ex- 
cellent repair. The principal farms are let on leases of nineteen 
years — those of small dimensions for shorter periods. 

Manufactures. — The produce of the loom has long been our 
staple article of commerce, and has of late greatly increased. In 
the progress of human improvement, it has been ascertained, that 
yarn fit for being woven into linen cloth, can be produced by ma- 
chinery, not only cheaper and better, but also in inconceivably 
greater quantities, than by the former tedious means of hard la- 
bour—a new direction has thus been given to the industry of this, 
and of many other parishes in Scotland. The spinning-wheel has 
been entirely superseded, or used only for the very refuse of flax ; 
and the spinsters, thrown out of their old and congenial employ- 
ment, have been obliged to have recourse to the loom. In weav- 
ing the lighter fabrics, we are happy to find they are succeeding

remarkably well, and without any apparent injury to health. This 
increasing branch of business has attracted a new set of agents, who 
weekly resort to the mill- spinners of Dundee, purchase their yarn 
to the annual amount of some thousand pounds, and bring it home 
in carts, when they distribute it amongst their customers, who 
work it into cloth, according to pattern laid before them. The 
webs when finished are returned to Dundee, where they find a 
ready market, — but with this drawback, the prices are more fluc- 
tuating in this than in any other trade, there being a continual de- 
pendence on the precarious state of distant and foreign markets, 
over which the home merchant can have no control. — Upon the 
whole, however, there is such a profit to the agents as is consider- 
ed remunerating, and which enables them to give sufficient en- 
couragement to those whom they employ. There are upwards of 
100 looms in the parish in full operation, by young and old of 
both sexes. This new channel for labour, as was to be expected, 
has occasioned in the meantime a slight rise in the wages of ser- 
vants, and handicrafts of every description. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

In former times, there were two considerable annual markets in 
Kinrossie. The ancient Cross now only remains. The business 
in cattle and small wares has been transferred to Burreltown, and 
other places in the neighbourhood. Perth is the chief market- 
town, to which there is access by an excellent turnpike road, which 
traverses the parish for two miles, leading eastward to Cupar- An- 
gus, to which there is a daily post-boy from Perth, leaving and 
taking up letters at a receiving-house as he passes. There is 
also a splendid daily coach called the Defiance, with four very su- 
perior horses, which follows the same route, in its way from Edin- 
burgh to Aberdeen. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which was built, as has been 
observed, in 1812 and 1813, is kept in good repair, and is socentri- 
cally and conveniently situated, that the bulk of the people are 
within a mile of it, and none further distant than two and a-half 
miles. There is accommodation for upwards of 400 sitters. The 
church is generally well filled, and the number of communicants 
has often exceeded 400. This includes nearly 100 strangers from 
the neighbourhood, whose parish churches are at such a distance 
as renders it next to impossible for their being regularly attend- 
ed. The unequal, and, as it may be called, reckless division, of 
many of the parishes in Scotland, is an evil which has been long

felt, and justly complained of. Should this grievance be inquired 
into by the proper authorities, they would find it quite practicable, 
and easy to reform so glaring an abuse. This would greatly pro- 
mote the interests of religion, and contribute much to the comfort 
and convenience of many thousands, in country parishes. As it 
would not -be proposed to interfere with the civilia, but merely with 
the quoad sacra of the church, the arrangements, to give conveni- 
ency to the fullest extent, would be settled without the smallest 
opposition. 

The glebe contains nearly 9 imperial acres, and may be worth 
L. 15 per annum. The manse and offices, which were built in 
1778, on rather a small scale, have been repaired within these 
twenty years, and so much improved and enlarged, as to render 
them more commodious. The amount of stipend is L. 150 yearly, 
including L. 87, 3s. 8d. from Government. 

The average number of persons receiving regular parochial aid 
is 7. The average sum allowed to each is about L. 4 per annum, 
including 6s. to each for coal money. A house and garden are 
provided for each of them gratis. Small sums are occasionally 
given to such as are reduced to straits, but who are not on the 
poor's roll. There is also an extended roll for coal money, which 
is distributed annually on the Monday after the sacrament. 

The number of families in the parish attending the chapels of 
Dissenters or Seceders is 12. 

Education. — The parochial school, which is centrical, being close 
to the church, is the only one in the parish. The salary is the 
maximum, and the accommodation most complete. The fees 
may amount to L. 30 per annum, and this arises more from the 
number of scholars averaging upwards of 70 for three quarters 
of the year, than from the rate of payment, which is very mo- 
derate ; beginning with 2s. per quarter for English, and rising 
only to 3s. and 4s., when writing, arithmetic, and geography are 
included. 

The schoolmaster, besides being qualified to instruct the rising 
generation in the common routine of country schools, is capable 
of teaching geometry, mathematics, and many other branches 
of education, which are seldom required here. There is no fa- 
mily without a Bible, and no member of it exceeding ten years of 
age who cannot read it. To assist in effecting this in the case of 
poor scholars, there is a small fund available. It arises from the 
mortification of seat-rents in the old church of Collace, by the fa- 



218 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ther of Lord Dunsinnan, upwards of one hundred years ago, and 
the transaction being engrossed in the session records of Collace, 
is in substance as follows : " The Hon. Sir William Nairne of 
Dunsinnan, hath by letter under his own hand, of date 16th Au- 
gust 1736, doted the seats in the east loft and those under it, to 
be let, and the money to be bestowed for the benefit of teaching 
of poor children in the parish of Collace." The amount of these 
during the last thirteen years was L. 11. There has been a very 
considerable falling off in this fund, which has arisen chiefly 
from the erection of thevnew church, as it contains fewer seats 
for letting, but Mr Nairne has generously made good the defi- 
ciency. 

There is a library, under the patronage of Mr Nairne, consist- 
ing chiefly of historical, geographical, and religious books, the 
foundation of which was lately laid, by a handsome donation of ex- 
cellent works from the patrons, and although only in its infancy, 
it is most acceptable to the people, and is rapidly diffusing a taste 
for reading among them. 

Parochial Poor Funds. — These arise from the interest of money, 
the use of the mortcloths, and other small sources ; but chiefly 
from collections, made every Sunday after divine service in church, 
which amount on an average to L. 12, 10s. a year. Donations are 
also occasionally given by Mr Nairne. About L. 40 are annually 
distributed to the poor by the kirk-sesion. 

Inns. — There is only one inn or public-house in the parish, 
which is very useful, and under the best regulations, and against 
which no complaint was ever made, as encouraging in the smallest 
degree drunkenness or immorality. 

Fuel. — The fuel generally used in the parish is English coals 
from Perth, at the average cost of Is. per cwt.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES WILSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— Tun name Abernyte seems to be of Gaelic origin, 
referring to the situation of the principal village of that name in 
the angle near the confluence of two rivulets. One of these, per- 
haps, was anciently called the Nyte. 

Boundaries, Extent. — The whole parish, including Glenbran, 
annexed to it quoad sacra, is an irregular kind of oblong parallelo- 
gram, terminated by the highest hills above, where several parishes 
meet from Strathmore, as well as this district. It is bounded by 
the parish of Inchture below ; Longforgan on the east; and Kin- 
naird on the west. Its greatest length may be about 3 miles or 
little more, and its greatest breadth about 2, and it contains 4 
square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The most populous parts of the 
parish in the lower grounds are nearer Dundee ; but those conti- 
guous to Dunsinnan hill, in the parish of Collace, are nearer Perth. 
The whole is situated in those eminences that rise gradually from 
the Carse of Gowrie to the top of the Dunsinnan ridge. The 
highest point here is called the King's Seat, which, according to 
an average of various measurements, seems to be 1155 feet 
high. The most cultivated parts of the parish are probably 
not above 300 feet above the level of the Tav, and about three 
or four miles in a straight line from it. The highest range 
of hills, which commands a noble prospect, runs parallel to 
Strathmore on the north-west side, and on the south-east in most 
places, to irregular undulations of inferior heights, with some hol- 
lows between. These inferior heights also form very interesting 
points of view through the whole extent, and in this parish protend, 
nearly at right angles, two other eminences like arms, on the north 
and south sides, embracing the beautiful glen of Abernyte. It 
opens toward the Carse on the south-east, and is bounded on three

sides by bold acclivities of well cultivated fields, watered below by 
the two united rivulets sufficient for a good mill. And this con- 
formation of the hills and vale, with the nature of the substratum 
in some places, is well adapted for emitting springs and rills. 
Meteorology. —

was here only . . 570

The climate here is good, and the air salubrious; consequent- 
ly, since the ground has been well drained, the people in general 
are healthy, not much subject to any particular distempers. The 
most prevailing complaints are, colds, rheumatism, fevers and 
dropsy, besides those incident to youth. But the natural small- 
pox rarely appears; and now at least, there seem to be few or no 
instances of scrofula, and none of ague, which was formerly very 
prevalent. 

Hydrography.— There are some cold perennial springs in dif- 
ferent parts of the parish. These, with the drainings, contribute 
mainly to the united rivulets that pervade the vale, and in con- 
fluence with a larger stream below, in the parish of Inchture, de- 
volve meandering to the Tay. Here is a beautiful cascade of forty 
feet, almost all perpendicular, at the head of a romantic den, a 
deep wooded ravine in the low grounds. 

Geology.— The rocks in this parish are sandstone with amygda- 
loid containing agates or pebbles. 

The arable ground in the lower parts of the parish is in general 
of a light, but fertile soil, lying mostly on a bed of gravel, and 
some of clay, or both united. In some places, the soil is pretty 
deep. The higher ground in general is, of course, by no means 
so fertile. In some places, it produces little except coarse grass 
or heath. But now, there is little of that last description left 
unplanted. 



ABERNYTE. 



221 



II. — Civil History. 

Land-Owners— There are seven heritors, but none resident ex- 
cept one. James Miller, Esq. of Milton, and R. A. Bannerman, 
Esq. of Abernyte, are the principal heritors in point of valuation. 
Lord Kinnaird, too, is a non-resident heritor, whose ancestors in 
very ancient times resided in their beautiful domain of Kinnaird, 
in this neighbourhood, whence they derived their name. 

Parochial Register. — The parochial register commenced in the 
year 1664. The first entry is in these words: 

" December 4, 1664. The whilk day Mr Androw Shippert 
was admitted minister of Aberneit, by Mr Robert White, minister 
at Instur, being authorized by my Lord Bishop of Dunkelden to 
that effect." " Collected that day 7 shillings two pennies." Scots. 
At the first meeting of session, the new minister found, that there 
was no session record, nothing in the poor's box, no money lent 
out, and no mortification for behoof of the poor. He preached 
his first sermon on Romans 8th ch. ii. ; and on every succeeding 
Sabbath for a long time, the entry in the session book is, " the 
minister preached both sermons upon his ordinar." There is 
something interesting about church discipline, which was frequent 
and severe. But the register is not very regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — " Upon the top of a hill called Glenny law, are 
two cairns," said the Rev. James Adamson, " and a few years ago 
there was another on the glebe, under which a few bones were found. 
These cairns were said to have been raised in consequence of a 
battle between two powerful families, the Grays of Fowlis, and the 
Boyds of Pitkindie, in this parish, in which the latter were victo- 
rious. On the same hill, is one of those circles called Druidical, 
consisting now of only seven stones. And in Stockmuir, about a 
mile from this one, there is another of nine stones ; both consisted 
of more ; three or four have been taken from the first not long ago. 
In a few years there will be no vestige of either. Upon the top of 
King's Seat there is the ruin of a circular enclosure, similar to Mac- 
beth's Castle, but much smaller. This commanded a more exten- 
sive prospect than the castle itself; probably a watch-tower or out- 
post." 

The " Long Man's Grave" is a noted spot at the road side, 
north-east from the classic ground of Dunsinnan hill. There 
is a tradition that a traveller had committed suicide there. Hence, 
perhaps, he was buried there. Others say he was murder- 
ed. North from Ballairdie, in the planting, are some remains of 



222 



PERTHSHIRE. 



an ancient ruin, called in Stobbie's map " Carquhannan Castle," 
in Knox's Basin, " Carguhannan." In the neighbourhood, it goes 
by the name of Balchuinnie. There is a fine spring near it, called 
" the King's Well." The writer of this account found here, at the 
manse, what seems to have been in ancient times a baptismal font, 
an old octagon of hewn stone, perforated in the bottom, to emit 
the water occasionally. 

III. — Population. 
There are here seven proprietors of land above L. 50 of yearly 
value. At no distant period, the population was probably double 
of what it is at present, owing to the smallness of farms in those 
days, to the great number of cottagers, who possessed a large com- 
mon as cow's grass, owing also to the number of mechanics, parti- 
cularly weavers, on the old fashioned loom. There are still 64 
young and old in two villages, including farm-servants and their 



families. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is . 5 
of deaths, ... .3 

of marriages nearly ... 2 

The average number of persons under 15 years of age, is . 94 

between 15 and 30, . . 76 

30 and 50, . . 51

There is but one insane pauper, who had been sent to an asy- 
lum several years ago. None blind, deaf, and dumb. 

The farms have been much enlarged within these forty years, 
and the mode of living is surely improved. But with increased 
rents and taxes, &amp;c, the farmers are so burdened, that even they 
can afford very few luxuries. The lower orders are much at a 
loss for want, of the usual employments of females. For spinning 
yarn, and knitting of stockings are at so low a rate, that it is now 
hardly worth the while to attempt that kind of work, and they 
have hardly any other means of subsistence out of service, except 
for a time in the fields in summer and harvest. 

IV. — Industry. 
In this parish, are cultivated about 1703 acres of standard im- 
perial measure, including a small portion in occasional tillage, and 
172 of improved pasture, without any undivided common for man v 
years. There may be 297 imperial acres, which cannot well be 



AliERNYTE. 



223 



improved but by planting. And some even of that number may 
be under .roads and streams of water. Of plantations, there may 
be about 341 imperial" acres, chiefly firs of various kinds, espe- 
cially larch and Scotch firs, thriving and properly attended to. 
Ash, elm, and plane trees thrive well also. 

Rent— The average rent of land is about L. '2 per Scotch acre, 
of grazing an ox or cow L. 1, 10s., ewe 6s. for the season. The 
real rent of the parish is about L. 2037. 

Wages. — Farm-servants come to maturity receive from L. 10 
to L. 15 per annum, and 6 bolls of meal, with a pint of sweet 
milk daily ; labourers from 8s. to 10s. weekly ; and artisans 
from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. dailv, without meat, Female servants 
in the house have its common fare, and about L. 6 of wages per 
annum. In summer, at day's work in the fields, when occasion re- 
quires, females receive about 9d. without victuals, and the same 
rate at threaving in harvest as in the Carse. Carts cost from L. 6 
to L. 12 ; ploughs from L. 1 to L. 4; rollers from L. 1 to L. 10 ; 
turnip sowing machines from L. 1 to L. 6, harrows from 10s. to 
L. 3 per pair ; wheel-barrows, from 10s. 6d. to 16s. 

Husbandry. — There are few parts of the country better cultivated 
than this, considering the high rents, and the very low prices of grain, 
which are great checks to enterprise. The proprietors, too, are 
heavily burdened themselves, and yet make great reductions of rent, 
notwithstanding the clamour even of many substantial citizens about 
cheap grain. The land seems sufficiently drained, and, owing to 
its declivity, it does not admit of irrigation. Very little embanking 
is here required. The duration of the leases is from nineteen to 
twenty-one years. The farm-buildings have been greatly improv- 
ed, and in some instances rebuilt within these few years. But some 
are deficient, especially for feeding bought cattle, to which attention 
has been turned of late. The principal improvements recently- 
made consist chiefly in the use of bone dust, in more extensive 
and regular green cropping, in feeding cattle, and eating a certain 
proportion of the turnips on the ground with sheep. The improve- 
ments in farming are considerable ; but cannot be equal in magni- 
tude to those in manufactures by machinery, especially from the 
fortunate discovery of steam engines. Hence, from the very low 
prices of the staple commodities, both proprietors and farmers are 
much depressed in many places. The rents, though greatly re- 
duced, are still too high for material improvements in manuring, 
deepening, and transporting soil, &amp;c. Exhausted capitals, and 



224 



PERTHSHIRE. 



want of enclosures in most places, especially on the higher ground 
for sheep, are great additional disadvantages ; so that a consider- 
able proportion of the land is in the landlord's own hands. 

The old valuation of the parish, according to the cess-book, is 
L. 1126, 13s. 4d. Scots. 

Produce. — It is difficult to ascertain completely the gross amount 
of raw produce. But the following statement seems to approxi- 
mate to the truth. 

The value of wheat, with straw, 280 quarters at L. 2, 10s. - L. 700 0 0 

barley with straw, 879 quarters at L. 1, 8s. - 1230 12 0 

oats, with straw, 1 140 quarters at L. 1, 2s. - - 1260 0 0 
potatoes 80 acres at L. 10, - - 800 0 0 

turnips, 200 acres at L. 5, ... - 1000 0 0 

hay and second crop, 240 cultivated acres at L. 6, - 1440 0 0 
land in pasture, 720 acres at L. 1, 10s. - - 1080 0 0 

inferior improved pasture, 297 acres, at 1 Os. - 148 10 0 

natural pasture, 172 acres, - - - 21 10 0 

all the gardens, - - - - 24 0 0 

one orchard. - - - - 1700 



Total value of raw produce, L. 7721 12 0 

There are few trees full-grown in the parish, and it is seldom 
that any of them are cut down. The profits of thinning and prun- 
ing young trees do not much exceed the expense as yet ; and the 
profits arising from feeding cattle are already included in the 
value of the raw produce. There is no trade nor manufacture here, 
but for domestic purposes. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There are a few small bridges here in tolerable repair. The 
roads, within these few years, have been Macadamised, and kept in 
good order without a toll. Some of the fences are pretty good. 
But three-fourths of the land are unfortunately defenceless. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is at the lowest extremity of 
the parish, near three miles from the thinly inhabited places above. 
But it is commodiously situated for the extremities of some neigh- 
bouring parishes. The church was rebuilt in the year 1736, and 
has been lately repaired. It may accommodate the whole po- 
pulation ; and there is no seat rent. The people are very ac- 
commodating to one another, and to strangers. The manse seems 
as old as the church. But about 1820, the manse received con- 
siderable repairs and additions, partly at the expense of the in- 
cumbent, as well as of the heritors ; for the accommodation was 
too little. But now, it is as commodious as can well be expect- 
ed. The glebe consists nearly of 7 acres arable, besides 3 of pas- 
ture, and a pretty large garden. Being a small living, the sti- 



ABERNYTE. 



225 



pend, of course, should amount to L. 150; but it has been less for 
several years, owing to the low fiars. 

There is a tabernacle here, built about forty years ago, by Mr 
Haldane, for the missionaries, when he was an heritor in this pa- 
rish. It is now occupied by a few Burghers, who have no stated 
minister. All the families in the parish except four, containing 
eight individuals, commonly attend the Established Church, and 
partake of its ordinances. The average number of people who at- 
tend both places of worship, though small, it is difficult to state ; 
because it varies so much on different days, according to circum- 
stances. But about 130, on an average, commonly attend the Es- 
tablished Church ; and much fewer, the Dissenters. The average 
number of communicants is about 160. The average amount of 
church collections yearly for religious and charitable purposes is 
between L. 2 and L. 3. 

Education.--There is one parochial school, which seems suffi- 
cient for the parish, except a female school, which has been some- 
times attempted without a salary. The public school-house, in- 
cluding the school-room lately built, is large and commodious, 
and could accommodate some boarders. The master has the 
maximum salary; and teaches English, writing, and arithme- 
tic, geography, and the principles of religion, very successfully, and 
could well teach mathematics and every other branch that might 
be required here,— he being now a preacher of the gospel The 
probable amount of the school fees may be L. 25 per annum : and 
trom other sources the teacher may receive about L. 4, 10s Der 
annum.   

Poor and Parochial Funds.-Besides a pauper lunatic, there are 
at present only three families receiving a regular allowance, about 
a gumea ,„ four weeks. But there are some other families who 
rece.ve occas.onal supply. The average amount of collections for 
the poor, smce the Seceders commenced preaching here is onlv 
abo Ut 4 6d it „ the addition of so P me aiiQ g an s o y 

nages, and for the mortcloth at funerals. There is a regular assess

rish, and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Account, 
seem to consist in improved instruments of agriculture, in using bone 
dust for turnips, and in the general introduction of thrashing mills by 
water, where it is practicable ; also, in the enlargement and im- 
provement of farms, and raising of rents : though both the rents 
and servants wages have fallen since the peace. There is a con- 
siderable difference also in the prices of work, of horses, and espe- 
cially of cattle fattened for the butcher. There is a remarkable 
difference in the low rate for spinning yarn, in the disuse of lint 
and of fallow, which is reckoned unnecessary for our free light 
soil, while potatoes are cultivated to such advantage, and the 
ground is sufficiently cleaned. But some farmers subdivide their 
land into too many little patches. There is little waste land 
here. But it is well known that there are many millions of that 
description in Great Britain and Ireland. Now, as humble ad- 
vocates for the comforts of the poor and labouri'ng classes, we 
beg leave humbly to suggest a plan of general improvement, 
equally beneficial to rich and poor, especially to labourers, be- 
ing aware of no public reform more important for the temporal 
benefit of all classes of the community, without encroaching on 
the rights and privileges of any. A great proportion of the land 
in the United Kingdom that is too poor for bearing some useful 
crop may be still more improved for pasture. And what is unfit 
both for tillage and for pasture ought to be planted with useful 
kinds of trees, suitable to the soil. Even the heathy rugged Gram- 
pians may be planted to the great advantage of the community, 
especially of the proprietors themselves. Of this, the late patriotic 
Duke of Athol set a noble example, whose extensive plantations, 
in less than seventy years, will, in the opinion of a good judge, who 
has been appointed to survey them, be worth eight millions Ster- 
ling, at Is. the solid foot. Roads had previously been made through 
them ; and there is still, at the sides of the roads in various direc- 
tions, sufficient room for grouse and deer, &amp;c. and shelter for all. 
Whatever ground in Great Britain and Ireland is capable of im- 
provement, and yet every way neglected, should, by Act of Parlia- 
ment, be taxed or fined at so much per acre, until the suitable im- 
provements are made. Or, perhaps, the same good effects might be 
produced more agreeably by the stimulus of premiums ; or with- 
out premiums, the plan would benefit the revenue. The proprie- 
tors, indeed, are in many cases too much depressed already. But 
the plan in time would tend to enrich them, and improve even 



ABERNYTE. 



227 



the soil itself. In cases of entail, as much land might be per- 
mitted to be sold as would be sufficient. Multitudes of additional 
labourers might be furnished with cottages, and each with a few 
acres of improveable land at a moderate rate. It is unnecessary 
to enter on details. But it may be added, that in every district 
where it may be expedient, there might be a public ploughman with 
a pair of horses and implements of husbandry, like common car- 
riers at present. All should be served in their turn, by lot, every 
year ; and the ploughman might have three or four acres, himself. 
As part payment he might get his horses fed for the day, where he 
might be working. How greatly this plan would beautify and en- 
rich the country  of what immense importance to the State and to 
all concerned, to retain thus by encouragement, and to employ be- 
neficially, a race of hardy, healthy, and industrious peasantry, of 
peaceable and virtuous habits, rather than drive them murmur- 
ing and disaffected to great towns, where they would necessarily 
cause greater stagnations of trade and manufactures, by gluts in the 
markets, and, perhaps great and dangerous commotions; or to 
banish them expensively to foreign lands, where they may swell the 
number of our enemies  This simple plan would meet the grow- 
ing demand for timber, procure useful employment for the indus- 
trious poor, save much of the poor's rates, and in a great measure 
prevent the needless drain of the precious metals for many foreign 
commodities. It is unnecessary to say more than that such a plan 
as this, with embankments and enclosures, and the draining of bogs, 
with the making and improving of roads, and such public works] 
would afford employment to the industrious, and advantage to all,— 
besides improving the climate, adorning the face of nature, and ad- 
ding greatly to the strength and wealth of the united kingdom.

<head>PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6414018">KINNAIRD</name>.</head>
<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JOHN SPENCE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— The name of the parish as observed in the former 
Statistical Account is of Celtic origin, and is compounded of two 
words signifying" high end or head." This is descriptive enough, 
whether it refers to the parish or to the estate of Kinnaird, both of 
which are higher at the one end than the other. An old castle or 
manor house, belonging to the latter, stands on the upper part of it. 

Situation, Boundaries. — The parish lies about half-way between 
Perth and Dundee, and has a beautiful southern exposure, looking 
down on the Carse of Gowrie, part of which is contained within 
its bounds. It is bounded on the south by Errol ; on the north by 
Collace ; on the west by Kilspindie ; and on the east by Abernyte 
and Inchture. The extent is about 2 miles in one way, and near- 
ly 3 in the other. Several points command an extensive view in 
all directions, particularly of the Highland mountains. We have 
nothing here to attract naturalists ; the productions of the earth, so 
far as yet discovered, being all of the more common kinds. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — This part of the world has not been the scene of 
any remarkable events, nor has any individual distinguished in the 
history of his country ever belonged to it ; the only thing in any 
respect curious is Kinnaird Castle, an old and stately ruin, but 
of which there is little on record. It presents an excellent spe- 
cimen of the sort of dwelling-places in use, when safety was 
more considered than comfort, — having walls of an enormous 
thickness, and the different storeys floored by stone arches. We 
find that the Noble family of Kinnaird, whose present seat is 
Rossie, in the neighbouring parish of Inchture, were once connect- 
ed with this property, though they have long ceased to be so. " In 
the reign of King William, 1170, Randolph Rufus obtained from 
that prince the lands of Kinnaird, in the county of Perth, which 



K1NNAIRD. 



229 



continued in his family till the time of King Charles I., and from 
that barony took his surname ; from him descended Sir Richard 
Kinnaird of that Ilk, whose son, Reginald, marrying Margery, daugh- 
ter and heiress to Sir John Kirkaldy of Inchture, in the same 
county, he with her had those lands, in which he was confirmed 
by the charter of Robert III." 

Land-owners. — The sole land-owners in this parish are, Colonel 
Allen of Inchmartine ; Sir Peter Murray Thriepland of Fingask ; 
Robert Richardson, Esq. of Kinnaird ; and Alexander Greig of 
Hallgreig. 

Parochial Register. — A parochial register is kept with great 
neatness and regularity ; the first entry is dated December 1633. 

III. — Population. 

Population in 1811, - 445 

1821, - 465 

1831, - 461 

The average number of persons under 15 years of age, . 153

50 and 70, . 70 

upwards of 70, . .13 

Widowers and bachelors upwards of 50 years of age, . 6 

Widows and unmarried women upwards of 45, . 1 6 

Average number of children in each family, . . 4

Average number of births yearly for the last seven years, . 14 

marriages, . . 2 

deaths, ... 7 

Number of families in the parish, .... 90 

chiefly employed in agriculture, . .30 
trade, manufactures, or handicraft, . 27 

During the last three years there have been 2 illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

Resident Heritors.— No heritor at present has a residence in this 
parish. Beautiful situations for houses, however, abound, and there 
are great facilities for building. Very fine stone for this purpose is 
found close at hand. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The number of cultivated acres is about 1550 
imperial measure ; the number of acres that have never been cul- 
tivated is about 1500 ; the number of acres that could be culti- 
vated with advantage does not exceed 50. The average rent 
of the land in cultivation is about L. 1, 16s. per imperial acre. 
The uncultivated part of the parish, consisting chiefly of moor 
ground, is pastured with sheep from the Highlands in winter, at 
about Is. 3d. per head, say from December 1st to April 1st; 
the remainder of the season, it is pastured with oxen. The highest 



230 



PERTHSHIRE. 



price per head for pasturing oxen is about L. 1, 10s. Farm-ser- 
vants are hired by the year. They receive about L. 12 in money 
with sixty- five stones of oatmeal annually, and three imperial pints 
of milk daily ; day-labourers in summer get Is. 8d. per day, and in 
winter Is. 4d. ; artisans, such as wrights, masons, &amp;c. about 2s. 
— no victuals being provided. 

Raw Produce.— The raw produce consists chiefly of grain, po- 
tatoes and turnip. Potatoes, for a number of years past, may have 
averaged 2s. per cwt. ; turnips when sold off the land from L. 6 to 
L. 1 2 per acre ; grain prices vary a good deal. This year best wheat 
is L. 2, 4s. per quarter; barley, L. 1, 6s. 6d.; oatmeal 14s. 6d. per 
boll. Grain is the principal production of the parish, and all the in- 
habitants may be said to be more or less engaged in agriculture. 
Rearing of stock is little attended to ; the ground which is not arable 
being unenclosed and of inferior quality. The grain raised is gene- 
rally of the first quality. The arable land is almost all fit for carry- 
ing crops of wheat. The quantity of grain of all sorts raised is 
about 3250 quarters; of potatoes 1800 bolls of 5 cwt. per boll; 
of turnips about 100 acres ; of hay about 10,000 stones ; of flax 50 
stones ; of fruit, apples and pears, the average value is nearly L. 60 
Sterling. The total yearly value of raw produce is about L. 7700 
Sterling. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Totcns. — There are no market-towns. Markets are, 
however, held on a small scale in some villages at no great distance. 
Perth and Dundee are the chief places of resort for the sale and 
purchase of commodities. Each of these towns is distant from us 
ten or eleven miles, and the great road passes within half a mile of 
the parish. There is a port on the Tay, about four miles off, from 
which much of our grain is shipped, and at which coals, lime, &amp;c. 
are laid down. This is a great convenience. There is a post- 
office within rather less than three miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is conveniently situated. It 
was built only a few years ago, and is abundantly large as well as 
comfortable. The manse is quite new, and is substantial and 
commodious. The glebe consists of 7 or 8 acres, and is of good 
soil, though with the disadvantage of a northern exposure. The sti- 
pend is as follows: Imperial quarters wheat, 2.994768; ditto bar- 
ley, 68.399616 ; bolls meal, 91.561392 ; money L. 8, 6s. 8d. 

Dissenters. — There are no dissenting chapels in this parish. 
Only one of the inhabitants is a Seceder. The rest belong to the 



KINNAIRD. 



23 1 



Established Church, and attend divine service with much regu- 
larity and decency. 

Education. — There is no seminary of learning besides the pa- 
rish school, which, however, is abundantly sufficient. The peo- 
ple are all anxious that their children should receive a good edu- 
cation, and never grudge laying out money for this purpose ; con- 
sequently the attendance is very numerous. The heritors have 
built a large and comfortable school-room, and are soon to erect 
a new house for the teacher, — the present one being very old. He 
has the highest salary allowed by law. His fees may amount to 
L. 24 per annum. 

Libraries. — There is no public library ; but one or two have been 
established in the immediate neighbourhood, which answer every 
purpose ; a taste for reading seems to spread fast, from which, if 
always properly directed, much good may be anticipated. 

Poor. — The average number of persons who receive parochial aid 
is about 3. They get from 4s. to 8s. per month according to circum- 
stances. There is. still an aversion to take assistance in this way, so 
long as it can possibly be avoided, and, under the influence of this 
very laudable spirit, many submit to considerable hardships before 
making an application. It has never yet been necessary for us to 
make an assessment for supporting the poor. This is avoided prin- 
cipally by maintaining a fund, the amount of which at present is 
upwards of L. 300. The interest of this, together with collections 
at the church doors, amounting to about L. 12, 10s. per annum, 
usually does more than answer all demands. 

Alehouses. — We have only one alehouse, and there is no occa- 
sion for another. The fewer of these the better. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There does not seem to be a very remarkable difference in this 
parish, since last Statistical Account was published. No doubt, the 
mode of agriculture has been improved; some new methods have been 
successfully tried to make the ground yield her fruits more abun- 
dantly, and of superior quality. Several new houses have likewise 
risen on the ruin of old ones, every way superior to their prede- 
cessors. Sundry spots of waste land have also been planted, and 
much more it is to be hoped will soon be done in this way. One 
great improvement has recently been made. The higher and lower 
parts of the parish have been connected by means of a new road, 
over which carriages of all kinds may travel in any weather; 
whereas, formerly, there was nothing but a precipitous rut, danger- 



232 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ous even for horses. This road is now become a sort of thorough- 
fare between the Carse of Gowrie and Strathmore, and is of public 
advantage, as well as privale benefit.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. JAMES MITCHELL, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation, Extent, Sfc. — This parish is in the centre of Strath- 
more, bounded on the north-west and north, by the rivers Isla and 
Dean; on the east and south, by the parishes of Essie and Nevy, and 
Newtyle ; on the south-west and west by those of Kettins and Cu- 
par-Angus. It lies in 56° 36' north Lat. and 5" east Long, from 
Edinburgh, being in length 4 miles from west to north-east, and 
from ] to 2 miles broad. It probably derived its name from its 
local situation, — the church and manse being built on a plain be- 
tween two marshes or " gills," which might thus have given rise to 
the word Midgile or Meigle. 

Strathmore. — Strathmore, " the great strath or vale," reaches 
from near Perth to Brechin, about 40 miles long, 4 — 6 broad, 
bounded on the south and south-east by the Sidla Hills, and on 
the north and north-west by the Grampians. There are no caves 
in the parish, and no part of it is hilly. The gentle eminence on 
which Belmont Castle stands says Dr Playfair is 204 feet above 
the level of half-flood mark at Panbride, near Arbroath. The 
village of Meigle lies quite contiguous to the church, and is watered 
by the burn of the same name. 

Geology, 8fc. — Two quarries of red sandstone have been wrought, 
and used for building. The dip inclines to the west. Marl was dug 
in great abundance in the Gill, on the south. It was covered with 
peat-earth. The remains of the marl are now mixed with the moss 
by cultivation. But where a bed of marl is found as under the road 
to Dundee it is very soft and white, retaining scarcely any remains 
of shells. 

Alongst the side of the marl-moss called My res, and occa- 



MEIGLE. 



233 



sionally running into it, there is a stratum of sand, apparently sea- 
sand, which seems to be the deposit of an arm of the sea, that had 
flowed through the strath, from near Perth to Douglaston, and 
thence towards Arbroath. It may, however, be the deposit of an 
interior lake long ago emptied. On the Sidla hills, distant only 
one mile and a-haJf, geologists have observed some marine or aque- 
ous remains. 

The soil in general is a fine black mould, inclining to brown, on 
a bottom of mortar, and yields good crops of wheat, barley, oats, 
and green-crop. There are also some sandy and clayey soils. 
Each of them is generally well improved and cultivated. 

In the river Dean, good perch, pike, and trout are caught. 
The trout are often taken in February and March. Their flesh is 
red, and the flavour excellent. A few salmon ascend the Isla, but 
very few are taken. The common white trout and also pike are 
caught in that river. 

There are no forests. The plantations are of Oak, ash, beech, 
elms, and of the plane and service-trees, of the larix and different 
sorts of pines. On moist soils, the birch, alder, and willow are 
planted, and occasionally elsewhere. There are some fine aged 
elms, beeches, and ash, chiefly in Belmont park, formerly Kirkhill, 
where the Bishop of Dunkeld occasionally resided. One of the 
beeches, standing in a back-court at Belmont, is somewhat re- 
markable. The height of it to the top is 74 feet, the girth is 13 
feet 9 inches at 3 feet from the ground. The solid wood below the 
offset of the branches, which are large and extended, is 276 feet. 

There are some springs of excellent water in the parish ; some 
of them flowing from sandstone rock, others from clay and gravel. 

II. — Civil History. 

No ancient history of this parish is known. Boece mentions it, 
speaking of Vanora's tomb erected here. And there is no modern 
account of it, previous to the late Statistical Account, by Dr Play- 
fair, then minister of Meigle, afterwards Principal of the United 
College of St Andrew's, and known to the world by his chronolo- 
gical and geographical works. 

Land-owners.— The chief land-owners are, Lord Wharncliffe; 
Lord Strathmore, by late purchase ; Mr Murray of Simprim ; Mr 
Nairne of Drumkilbo ; and Mr Kinloch of Kinloch, whose pro- 
perty is « temporaliter" in Cupar Angus. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest date of the register of bap- 
tisms is the 31st of July 1727. It is pretty regularly kept ; but 



234 



PERTHSHIRE. 



no register will be ever quite complete, till it be made imperative 
on Dissenters and all persons to record the baptism of their 
children. 

Antiquities. — In the park of Belmont, there is a tumulus call- 
ed " BellidufF," which tradition gives as the spot where M'Duff 
slew Macbeth ; and about a mile distant, stands a large whinstone 
nodule, or block of twenty tons weight, called Macbeth's stone. 
In all probability there has been fighting near these apparently 
sepulchral monuments ; but it is more probable that Macbeth was 
slain at Lumphanan in the Mearns. 

A font or trough for holy water was dug out of the rubbish, 
when the body of the old church was taken down. Its form is oc- 
tagonal, each compartment having some emblem of the crucifixion 
upon it, as the " mock robe," the " spear and sponge," &amp;c. It is 
a very hard stone, and placed on a pedestal in the minister's gar- 
den. 

In the church-yard are the remains of the famous sepulchral 
monument of Vanora, or Guinevar, wife of the fabulous King Ar- 
thur, according to tradition. It relates that Arthur lived in the 
sixth century — that he lost a battle with the Picts and Scots — 
and that Vanora was made a prisoner, and detained in captivity on 
Barryhili, distant about two miles and a half from Meigle. Barry- 
hill, in the parish of Alyth, was fortified of old. Vanora, says tra- 
dition, held an unlawful intercourse with Mordred, a Pictish King; 
and Arthur, when he received her again, enraged at her infidelity, 
caused her to be torn to pieces by wild beasts. She was buried at 
Meigle, and a monument erected to perpetuate her infamy. Such 
is the traditional story. But even Arthur's existence is now doubt- 
ed, while of the Arthur of romance every one has heard. 

The monumental stones called Vanora's have been described 
so often, and so minutely, that it seems unnecessary to dilate upon 
them in a work intended to be as concise as possible. Pennant, 
Dr Playfair, Pinkerton, Forsyth, and Knox, have given ample de- 
tails, and to them the curious inquirer will at any rate have re- 
course. Let it suffice to say, that on each of these stones, now quite 
separated, there is a variety of sculptured figures, chiefly of the 
monstrous kind. One is a huge serpent fastened to a bull's mouth ; 
another like a centaur — and there are two representations of wild 
beasts tearing a human body,— and one where the body seems 
tied or close to chariot wheels, — which may relate to Vanora, or 
may have given rise to the tradition. 



MEIGLE. 



235 



Buildings.— The body of the church was built about fifty-four 
years ago ; but two aisles of the old one remain. It is a plain building 
of stone. Belmont House, the seat of Lord WharnclifFe, called 
Kirkhill till about seventy years ago, when it was rebuilt, is a hand- 
some quadrangular building, retaining part of the ancient tower, 
in the back court. The lawn is extensive and finely wooded, and 
well kept, as is the garden. 

Meigle House, Drumkilbo, and Kinloch, are good mansions, 
and pleasantly situated. Potento, a moderate sized house, occupied 
by a tenant, is delightfully situated on the south bank of the Dean ; 
surrounded with wood, and near the rocky banks of the river. 
On the opposite side of the Dean, is Caerdean, where there are 
still the vestiges of a camp. 

III. — Population. 

There is no authentic record of the population till Dr Playfair 
Statistical Account gave the amount at 1148. Since then it 
has decreased. 

Population in 1811, - 923 

1821, - 847 

1831, - 873 

The causes of the decrease are the enlargement of farms, and 

the removal of a linen manufactory. About 301 persons reside 

in the village of Meigle ; 45 in Longlees ; and in the country 530. 

The average number of baptisms is . .18 

of proclamations, . . 9 

But marriages less by 4-5, one of the parties residing elsewhere. 
The average number of persons under 15 years of age is 316 

betwixt 15 and 30 245 
30 and 50 191 
50 and 70 110 
above 70 . . 30 

Number of families, 191 
chiefly employed in agriculture, ... 81 
in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, - 83 
The number of bachelors and widowers upwards of 50 years of age 18 
unmarried women under 45 years of age, . 35 

children in each family, .... 3 nearly. 

One insane a man is in the asylum. There are two males 
fatuous; and six of both sexes idiots, or quite silly. 

One peer occasionally, and three families of independent for- 
tune, reside in the parish. There are seven proprietors of the year- 
ly value of L. 50 and upwards. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The arable acres in the parish, exclusive of Kin- 
loch, are 2726; about 178 acres are under wood, and 100 acres 
in pasture, a small part of which is in the natural state. In parks 



236 



PERTHSHIRE. 



and lawns, trees have been for a long time planted, and pasture 
and wood-land are thus intermixed. There is no undivided com- 
mon, but a small part of what was such may be profitably im- 
proved by tillage, or planted with trees. The woods and beltings 
are regularly thinned and pruned. 

Rent. — Land rent is very various. The average rent partly in 
grain and money of land fit for wheat is reported to me, by fac- 
tors and tenants, at L. 2 to L. 2, 15s.; that of land fit for bar- 
ley and green crop, L. 1, 10s. ; and of land of an inferior quality, 
L. 1. But of this last description of soil there is little in the pa- 
rish. There is little permanent pasture, except in lawns and 
parks, of much value, and it is either pastured by the proprie- 
tor, or let together with arable land. The rent may average about 
L. 3 to L. 4. The rental of the parish is about L. 5000. 

Wages. — Wages, including the value of victuals, oatmeal and 
milk, and lodgings of a farm-servant for one year, are stated at L. 20 
to L. 24, lis.; and for a woman, living in the house, at L. 5 to L. 7. 

Day -labourers get 2s. a day from March to September. Women 
for field work, 8d. ; masons and carpenters have from 2s. to 3s. 
in the long day — less in winter in proportion. 

Live-Stock. — Few sheep are bred. In this parish and the neigh- 
bourhood the Leicestershire is generally most esteemed. Angus-shire 
cattle are the principal stock ; but some are bred from a cross with 
the short-horned Teeswater bull, and accounted good feeders, 
and early fattened. The general duration of leases is nineteen 
years. The farm-buildings and enclosures are well-preserved. 
Proprietors give encouragement to improvements, and in most 
instances have given deductions of rent since the late war — or 
when times required abatement. And their kind consideration is 
generally admitted by the tenants. 

There is no regular manufactory now in the parish. About 
fifteen men and women are chiefly employed in weaving coarse 
linen. Machinery has nearly put an end to hand-spinning, and 
old women, especially, get little or nothing to do, and are many 
of them reduced to poverty. 

A Perth manufacturer who resides here has a work-mill, &amp;c. 
for dyeing and dressing cotton cloth, for umbrellas. The people 
employed from six to eight live comfortably, and work only twelve 
hours every lawful day. About 72,000 yards are finished and 
sent to London annually.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets — Meigle is a market-town, but has now no regular 
weekly market. Lately it has had a fortnight tryst for the sale of 
cattle, which is well attended. It has also two fairs in the year, 
for cattle and horses, and ordinary traffic, when a considerable mul- 
titude assemble. The nearest market-town is Cupar Angus, five 
miles distant, but Dundee 13 miles is the principal market-town, 
and port for shipping of grain. The quantity of grain and of po- 
tatoes sold is not ascertained, but is very considerable. 

Means of Communication. — Meigle has a post-office, and three 
post-runners daily. There are about six miles of turnpike-road 
in the parish. Every lawful day a coach runs to and from Edin- 
burgh and Aberdeen, by Perth and Queensferry, and one from 
Blairgowrie, — and one from Cupar Angus, to meet the rail-road 
coach, to and from Dundee, at Newtyle, two miles from Meigle 
three times a week. 

A very old bridge over the Dean connects Meigle with Airly, 
in the county of Forfar. A well-built bridge has lately been erect- 
ed by subscription over the Isla, connecting this parish with Alyth. 
Bridges over the burn of Meigle, and over-drains, are kept in good 
repair, as are the fences. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the church is convenient 
for the people. Its distance from the extremities of the parish is 
from two to three miles. The church is in pretty good repair. Two 
bishops of Dunkeld, and two Presbyterian ministers of the seven- 
teenth century, are buried in the north aisle. The church affords 
accommodation for about 700 persons. Tenants, and householders 
have seats free, but, owing to the great inequality of the popula- 
tion on different properties, some seats are let. 

The manse was built in 1809-10. The glebe, exclusive of gar- 
den, house stances and roads, is about 5 acres of good soil, and 
worth L. 17 or L. 18 yearly. The stipend is 14 chalders meal 
and barley, vicarage worth about L. 3, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for com- 
munion elements. 

There are no chapels of ease, or other places of worship in 
the parish, except an Episcopalian chapel, whose minister is paid 
by his people. He has two other chapels. There are 23 Epis- 
copalians, and 38 Presbyterian Dissenters in the parish. 

Divine service in the parish church is generally well attended. 
The average number of communicants is from 390 to 400. There is 
no society for religious and charitable purposes, but charity inva- 



238 



PERTHSHIRE. 



rious ways is liberally exercised towards the indigent, and the 
wants of the poorer inhabitants are readily relieved. 

Education. — There is one parochial school and one unendowed. 
The parochial schoolmaster's salary, including L. 2, 2s. 9d., in 
lieu of a garden, amounts to L. 36, 7s. Id. ; as session-clerk he has 
also a salary of L. 2, 10s. ; register of baptisms and marriages, 
L. 5; school fees, L. 25; total L. 68, 17s. Id. He has good ac- 
commodation. The unendowed school produces yearly about 
L. 15 to the teacher; but he is paid for other things, as collecting 
the road-money, &amp;c. 

In the parochial school, the usual branches of education are 
taught, also Latin, Greek, French, geography and practical ma- 
thematics. In the other, the teacher is qualified in much the 
same manner, but has no advanced scholars. School fees for read- 
ing and writing are very moderate. The poor pay none. 

Every person above childhood, or eight years of age, can read, 
and there are few who cannot write. The people in general are alive 
to the benefits of education, and endeavour to send their children 
to school, part of the year. The distance from school is nowhere 
great. 

Poor. — The church collections average yearly about L. 36, 10s., 
which sum, together with interest of money saved by the session, 
L. 16, 17s. yearly and mortcloth-money, has hitherto supported, in 
part or wholly, from nine to fourteen paupers in ordinary times. 
According to circumstances, we give from 4s. to 10s. a month. 

There is no alms-house or workhouse in the parish, or in any 
of the towns near it. A house of this kind is much wanted, to 
which we could send silly or weakly paupers, paying board, &amp;c. for 
them. Few are averse to receive parochial relief. Some, how- 
ever, consider it degrading. 

Friendly Society. — The ploughmen have a friendly society here 
of about eight years standing, and it is found advantageous. We 
had a saving bank, but, from the low rate of interest for money, 

are giving it up. 

Inns, — There are five inns or taverns in the parish. Not more 
than two are necessary for travellers, &amp;c. 

Fuel. — The fuel used is chiefly coal from Dundee, the cost, in- 
cluding carriage, about Is. 5d. per cwt. Wood is also used as fuel. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since last Statistical Account was written, great progress has 
been made in the theory and practice of husbandry ; and in

Strathmore, landlords and tenants have concurred in advancing the 
art by all the known and approved methods. The latest improve- 
ment is the application of bones for manure, which was introdu- 
ced by a farmer here, and generally adopted. It is pretty well 
known in Scotland, that the farmers in Strathmore are amongst 
the most intelligent and enterprising of their profession. 

Great improvements have also been made in building gentle- 
men's seats, and tenants' houses, and the parish now presents a 
highly cultivated and pleasing aspect.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. WILLIAM HERDMAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of Rattray seems to have belonged alike 
to the parish, and to the principal family that dwelt in it, and pro- 
bably was transferred from the one to the other. It is said that 
there are records which bear the name of Rattray of Craighall 
and Rattray, as early as 1 066. No account is given of the etymo- 
logy of the name. 

Boundaries, Sfc. — Rattray is the westmost parish in Strathmore, 
the district adjoining in that quarter being the Stormont, It is 
bounded by the river Ericht, which runs along the west and south 
side, the whole extent of the parish, and separates it from Blairgow- 
rie. On the east, it is bounded by the parish of Bendochy, and 
farther north by the parish of Alyth. The breadth of the parish, 
from west to east, is about 2 miles; the length from north to 
south is 5 ; besides the detached portion of Easter Bleaton. 

Topographical Appearances,— The whole surface of the parish 
inclines by a very considerable declivity from north to south. The 
southern part, washed by Ericht, is flat; but the ground soon be- 
gins to rise towards the village, a short way behind which, perhaps 
not more than a quarter of a mile, these hills commence, which 
continue to increase in elevation and ruggedness, till they termi- 
nate in the Grampian mountains ; though at the distance of many 



240 



PERTHSHIRE. 



miles beyond the boundaries of this parish. The high grounds on 
the north break the cold winds from that direction, and render the 
climate more mild, and the country more sheltered in the lower 
parts. The soil being dry, and the air mild, the situation of Rat- 
tray is thought to be very healthy. The most prevailing winds, 
though soft, are from the west; the most stormy, and accompanied 
with most rain and snow, are from the east, coming from the sea. 
As in other places, there are occasional distempers and fevers in 
Rattray ; for every person must die ; but there are no epidemics 
peculiar to the climate. 

Hydrography. — The only river in the parish is the Ericht. It 
issues from some springs in the Grampians; and, taking a souther- 
ly direction, holds on through Glenshee and Persie, till it reach 
the Strone, where it receives the water of the Ardle, a considerable 
mountain stream from the north-west ; the Ericht and Ardle unit- 
ed proceed nearly in the same course as before, pass by Craighall 
and Blairgowrie, and round the southermost point of this parish ; 
about two miles beyond which, they fall into the Islay, and thence flow- 
ing to the west, they join the Tay at Meiklour, by which they are 
conducted to the ocean. In winter, and on all occasions of much 
rain, the Ericht swells into a flood ; and if this flood happens in 
autumn, like her more powerful neighbour the Islay, she carries off 
large quantities of grain from the low country. 

Mineralogy. — To the naturalist the mineralogy of this parish 
might afford matter of curiosity and entertainment. The rocks on 
the side of the Ericht above Craighall are of singular and formi- 
dable appearance. They rise to upwards of 200 feet above the bed 
of the river, and in front are almost as perpendicular as if cut 
with a chisel. No use has ever been made of them, and they re- 
main as they issued from the hand of nature, enormous masses of 
whinstone, and proofs of her gigantic power. As the access at top 
is hazardous, there is generally a strip of the surface planted, which 
is enclosed by a stone-wall, to prevent cattle from approaching it. 

The soil on the hill grounds is cold, thin, and moorish ; yet it 
is all let for corn and cattle farms, though the only grain raised is 
oats, as yielding the most profitable return. The soil in the lower 
part of the parish is dry, gravelly, and a good deal incumbered with 
loose stones. The produce of such ground must depend greatly on 
the season. In a dry summer, the crop is very light, and in such 
a year as 1826, it was almost nothing, either in corn or fodder. In 
a season of moderate rain, the crop- is very good, and the grain true 



RATTRAY. 



241 



and pure. The crops commonly raised are oats, barley, and wheat ; 
though the latter more sparingly than in former years, when the 
price and increase were more abundant. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men.— In the Civil History of the parish of Rattray, Mr 
Donald Cargill deserves distinguished notice. He was one of the mi- 
nisters who lived and suffered under the unhappy reign of Charles II. 
He was born about the year 1610; his father was proprietor of an 
estate called Hatton, in this parish, and he was the oldest son of 
the family. He was educated first at Aberdeen, and then at the 
University of St Andrews; and after obtaining a licence to preach, 
was called to be minister of the barony church in Glasgow. This 
situation, and his own zeal for religion, connected him with the 
covenanted clergy of that period, and involved him in all their 
troubles. After undergoing many hardships, and experiencing 
many escapes, which it is unnecessary to mention he was appre- 
hended in 1680, carried to Edinburgh along with some others, tried, 
and condemned by the Justiciary Court for high-treason, and the 
following sentence pronounced : « that he should be hanged at the 
Cross of Edinburgh, and his head placed on the Nether Bow." 
This sentence was immediately executed ; and such was the con- 
fidence and composure of the sufferer at the last, that when about 
to ascend the ladder, he said, « the Lord knows that I go on this 
ladder with less fear and perturbation of mind, than ever I entered 
the pulpit to preach " Such are the hopes that cheer the just  

Antiquities.— If large gray stones be entitled to the appellation of 
antiquities, or are any indication of the religious worship of our an- 
cestors, a few of these appear in a field, thence called Standing- 
Stanes, which are supposed to be the ruins of a Druidical temple. A 
more interesting object appears a little way to the south of that field. 
A large earthen mound rises in the low grounds, called the Hill of 
Rattray, on the eastern summit of which are the remains of a large 
building, named the Castle of Rattray, and which was anciently the 
residence of the family of that name. The mound is of an oblong 
form, something resembling the shape of an inverted ship; but the 
eastern corner of it is circular, as if sucked up by the action of 
a whirlpool, when the waters were retiring from the earth. In the 
perilous times, which were so frequent during the reign of our 
Scottish Kings, the family of Rattray removed from this hill to 
Craighall, as a place of security against the sudden incursions of 



enemies. 

PERTH. 



242 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Craighall is a very singular place. The house is seated on the 
top of a rock, about 214 feet almost perpendicular above the Erich t: 
A balcony on the outside of the drawing-room windows, secured by 
an iron railing, serves as a parade, whence the river, and rocks, and 
surrounding scenery may be viewed. Craighall is accessible only 
in front, which is from the south ; and on each side of the entrance, 
a little in advance of the house, are two round buildings, evidently 
intended for protection, with some openings for missile weapons, 
as if for the use of archers, a mode of defence very common infor- 
mer ages. The old house of Craighall, the date of which is not 
known, was greatly altered about five yeare ago, by the late Baron 
Clerk Rattray. Without enlarging the premises, he new-modelled 
the apartments within, and added turrets to the corners without, 
which serve considerably to ornament the building. 

Land-owners. — The principal proprietor in the parish is Robert 
Clerk Rattray, Esq. of Craighall, son of the late worthy Baron, 
who succeeded to the estate on the demise of his cousin, Miss Janet 
Rattray, in 1817. The present proprietor, with his family, reside 
at Craighall during the greater part of the year. The other he- 
ritors are, the Earl of Kinnoul ; John Rattray of Coral- Bank ; the 
Rev. George Whitson of Parkhill ; Colonel Chalmers of Glene- 
richt; Lord Wharncliffe; Miss M'Donald of Easter Bleaton; and 
Mr Crichton of Mains, — besides a number of feuars of inferior note. 
Rattray is comparatively a small parish, the whole valuation being 
L.2575 Scots. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are of consider- 
able antiquity. They commence about the Restoration in 1660, 
and, with a little interruption in the Revolution 1688, have been 
filled up and preserved with tolerable care. 

III. — Population. 

The population of Rattray must have undergone great altera- 
tion. In the time of Dr Webster it was reckoned 751 ; in the re- 
turn made to Sir John Sinclair it was stated at 500 : the number 
of the inhabitants at present is 1375, — a large increase in the space 
of forty years. This population resides chiefly in two villages, cal- 
led Old and New Rattray, the latter of which did not exist at the 
date of the last report. The new village is seated on both sides 
of the road to Blairgowrie, and extends almost to the Ericht, 
which divides the parishes. The ground for houses and gardens 
is fixed by the proprietors to persons from the country, and parti- 
cularly from the Highlands, who, finding it necessary to change their 



RATTRAY. 



243 



residence, seek a more sheltered situation. The rate of feuing is 
about Is. the fall, or L. 8 the acre, though some of it lately has 
risen much higher. The two villages are almost contiguous, and 
the climate and soil of both are warm, dry, and healthy. The in- 
crease of population is chiefly owing to the spinning-mills, which 
have been reared within the last twenty years, and which will re- 
quire particular attention. The average number of births for the 
last seven years is 32, of marriages 12; of deaths, though more 
various, the number is perhaps nearly the same. The population of 
Old Rattray, of all ages and sexes, is about 400 ; of New Rattray, 
300, — leaving 600 and upwards for the country part of the parish. 

The number of proprietors of L. 50 and upwards annually is 
seven; and the whole rental. about L. 2000. 

The inhabitants of the country are all engaged in agricultural 
operations ; those of the villages are employed in trades and ma- 
nufactures. The great business of the common people is weav- 
ing of a coarse fabric, the materials for which are sent from Dun- 
dee. The inhabitants in general are sober, industrious, and eco- 
nomical. In former times, smuggling in malt and whisky prevail- 
ed much in this neighbourhood, but has now almost disappeared, 
in consequence of the decisive measures adopted by Government. 
This is a happy change for the character, the circumstances, and 
the morals of the people. Poaching in game is much complained 
of by gentlemen at certain seasons of the year ; which shows the 
idle, pernicious, and despicable habits, of a few of the lower orders 
of the people.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— Rattray being comparatively a small parish, and 
not remarkable for soil, furnishes no great scope for agricultural 
operations. The farms in general are of moderate size ; and 
those in the higher grounds, intended both for pasture and til- 
lage, are seldom let by the acre, but by as much rent as the ten- 
ants imagine they will bear, according to the mode of husban- 
dry to which they are to be applied. The land about the village 
gives L. 3 per acre. The leases for small portions are for nine or 
eleven years; for farms, fifteen or nineteen years. On the estate 
ot braighall, there are considerable plantations of Scotch and larch 
hr which were much enlarged by the late Baron Clerk Rattray 
1 hey are scarcely in a state for felling, but thev are regularly thin-

ned, and the produce sold for fuel to the people in the neighbour- 
hood. Along the sides of the Ericht, the timber raised is copse- 
wood or small oak, which is cut down at a certain age, chiefly for 
the sake of the bark, and yields a very profitable return. 

There is a commonty in the higher part of the parish, of near- 
ly 300 acres, called the Broad Moss, which is become almost a 
waste, for want of being divided. The only use made of it is in 
individuals at pleasure casting turf for fuel, and the neighbouring 
tenants sending their cattle to brouse on it. Though called a 
moss, it is more properly a muir, being a high-lying barren sub- 
ject, but under proper management, might have become a planta- 
tion of some value. 

The farmers have their grounds laid out in such proportions, 
that, in addition to grain, they raise potatoes, turnips, and artifi- 
cial grasses. When potatoes bring good prices, besides their use 
for the benefit of the family, they are sent in large quantities to 
Perth and Dundee ; when the demand is low, they are consumed 
at home in feeding cattle. The turnips and grasses are solely for 
the support of the bestial on the farm. The occupiers of land rear 
or purchase annually as much stock as they can maintain, which 
they feed when two or three years old, and sell to butchers or 
dealers, who send a great proportion of them to the Glasgow mar- 
ket. The Strathmore and Angus breed, which have a mixture 
of the Teeswater, red and white, are much esteemed for their size 
and keeping ; and for some time past have been the principal ar- 
ticle that have put money into the hands of the farmer. The 
wages of farm -servants are from L. 10 to L. 12 a vear with their 
board; day-labourers in summer get Is. 6d. or Is. 8d. ; in winter 
Is. 2d. without victuals 

Fishings. — The principal fishing station in this parish is the 
Keith, where the waters of the Ericht rush over a rock, and fall 
into a pool below, whence the salmon are taken. The fishing is the 
property of Lord WharnclirTe ; and during the season, when there 
is plenty of water in the river, salmon of the size of from eight to 
twelve pounds are caught in abundance. I shall transcribe the 
account of this fishing given by my predecessor, as it is more mi- 
nute and exact than any which I can pretend to give. " There is, at 
a little distance from Rattray, a cascade or fall of water, about ten 
feet high, over a rugged rock, which forms a pool below, where sal- 
mon are caught. It goes by the name of the Keith fishing, and 
rents at L. 30 a year. The mode of fishing is curious. They 



RATTRAY. 



245 



make what they call a drumuck, resembling thin wrought mortar, 
which they throw into the pool to disturb the clearness of the wa- 
ters. The fishers stand on the point of the rock with long poles, 
and nets upon the ends of them, with which they rake the pool, 
and take up the fish." Besides this particular station, fishers and 
sportsmen, who occasionally visit the Ericht in summer, take trout 
and salmon by the rod, at various places along the river, as far 
as it skirts the parish of Rattray. 

Manufactures. — Under the name of manufactures may be com- 
Drehended spinning-mills, of which there are seven in the parish 
of Rattray. The river Ericht, affording abundance of water, and 
numerous falls for driving machinery, has induced persons in 
the neighbourhood and even some from towns, to feu ground, 
and erect these structures. The mills vary in size from six to 
twenty horse power. The work about which they are employed, 
is manufacturing flax and tow into yarn ; the former from one to 
three hanks, the latter from four to eight hanks per spindle. The 
number of persons necessary for these operations may be stated in 
round numbers at 250. They work all the six days of the week, 
commencing their labour at half an hour before six in the morn- 
ing, and, excepting an hour allowed for each diet, continuing till 
seven o'clock in the evening. Few are admitted to the mills be- 
fore twelve years of age, the wages of whom are 2s. per week ; and 
the average amount of all classes, young and old, beginners and 
experienced labourers, may be 6s. 6d. a week. I am not able to 
say how far the regulations in the late Factory Bill have been 
adopted, or what effects they have produced in this part of the 
country. 

It is evident, that, in a pecuniary view, these establishments are 
highly beneficial. They furnish the young with an income, and 
parents with the means of supporting their families, to an extent 
which could not otherwise be procured. But I am afraid that here 
their praises must terminate. Their effects on health must be 
deemed injurious, from the long confinement the labourers endure, 
and the thick atmosphere they are constrained to breathe. Their 
influence on morals cannot be favourable, unless a rigid superinten- 
dence be maintained by proprietors and guardians ; as we never 
fail to observe, that when large bodies of people are assembled, 
human passions ferment and disorders ensue, except strict vigilance 
be preserved. A very laudable attempt to correct or prevent these 
evils, was made by the Legislature in their late enactment. 



246 



PERTHSHIRE. 



V. — Parochial Economy. 
It has been already observed, that there are two villages in the 
parish, called Old and New Rattray, in which mostly the articles 
necessary for family use may be at all seasons found. Blairgowrie, 
a much more considerable village, is at hand, where there is a post- 
office, and shops of all kinds in abundance for food and clothing. 
Cupar- Angus is the next place of consequence, at the distance of 
five miles from Rattray, and to which there is a turnpike road from 
Blairgowrie. At Cupar- Angus, the turnpike roads break off to 
Perth and Dundee ; and through Cupar- Angus, the Defiance 
coach runs daily from Edinburgh to Aberdeen. Lately, a railway 
was formed across the Sidlaw hills, from Dundee to Newtyle, by 
which coals, lime, and manure are brought from town in waggons, 
and grain and potatoes are sent in return. On the railway, there 
are close coaches for passengers, which are much used as a 
cheap and expeditious mode of travelling. A bill is just now be- 
fore Parliament for extending the railway from Newtyle to Cupar- 
Angus, which is expected to be a great benefit to this district of 
Strathmore. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church of Rattray was built 
in 1820 and 1821, is a very commodious house, and in perfect 
order. It was made to contain 620 persons. In appropriating it, 
the first consideration was bestowed on the poor. A portion, which 
would accommodate twelve sitters, was allotted to them. A simi- 
lar portion was allowed to the elders, and for baptism room ; and 
the same to the minister's family ; after which, the area of the 
church was divided among the heritors, according to their respec- 
tive valuations. The heritors, after accommodating themselves 
and their tenants, let the surplus seats to the trade's people in the 
parish, who have no right of their own. These seats to the lower 
orders are exceedingly cheap, at an average scarcely amounting 
to Is. 6d. the sitter. The whole seats are occupied. The church is 
very conveniently situated for the parish in general, though there 
is one property, called Easter Bleaton, ten miles distant from it. 
This detached portion is cut off from the rest of the parish for 
five miles, by the intervening parishes of Bendochy and Alyth ; but 
the few inhabitants, there, are accommodated with public worship at 
the chapel of Persie, a preaching station in the higher part of 
the parish of Bendochy, not above two miles distant from Easter 
Bleaton. 

The manse of Rattray was built in 1813 and 1814. The glebe 

4 



RATTRAY. 



247 



contains 15 acres, the greater part of it outfield; and in whole it 
might let for L. 20. The living of Rattray is one of the small 
stipends, augmented by Government to L. 1 50 per annum. There 
is a dissenting meeting in the parish, formerly of the Antiburgher 
connection, but now belonging to the United Associate Synod. 
Their chapel will contain 340 sitters, but is partly unoccupied. 
The stipend arises from the seat-rents and collections, and is said 
to be from L. 80 to L. 100 a-year. Dissenters attend well on 
public worship ; and the members of the Established Church are 
not deficient in this praiseworthy conduct. The average number 
of communicants in the parish church may be 500 ; the collec- 
tions throughout the year L. 15. Since 1775, there has been an 
assessment on the parish for the support of the poor, which has 
had the effect of diminishing the collections, but could not now be 
easily dispensed with. The number of paupers on the list generally 
exceeds a dozen ; and instead of considering it degrading, every 
one is eager to prefer his claim as fast as he can. The average an- 
nual amount of assessments is L.45 : of church collections, L. 15. 

The number of families in the parish attending the chapels of 
Dissenters or Seceders is 65. 

Education, — With regard to education, it may be said that there 
are principally two schools for that important end; the parish 
school in Old Rattray, and a private one in New Rattray. The 
parochial teacher has the highest salary allowed by law of L. 34, 
besides the dues of baptisms and marriages, which must amount 
to some pounds more. His fees may amount to L. 15 per an- 
num. The private teacher depends entirely on the fruits of his 
industry. The numbers attending each school are nearly the 
same, — upwards of 40 : the wages for beginners are 2s. per quar- 
ter ; 2s. 6d. for reading and writing ; and 3s. for arithmetic and 
Latin. Both masters profess to teach Latin, arithmetic, writing, 
and English. I have reason to believe, that they are not defici- 
ent in attention and diligence. Besides these, there are schools 
on a lower scale kept by females, chiefly for young girls ; and some 
occasionally kept by males for the benefit of those in the remote 
parts of the parish. Perhaps, there are none of five years of age 
but have begun to learn to read ; and none farther advanced but are 
taught both to read and write. The blessing of education is brought 
within the reach of all classes in society. If they are poor, the 
kirk-session pay for them ; if they are in a better situation, they 
can easily furnish the expense from their own industry. They 



248 



PERTHSHIRE. 



need only show a willing mind, and the invaluable advantage will 
be attained. 

Fairs. — There are two fairs in Rattray, — the one on the last Fri- 
day of April, the other the last Friday of August. They are intend- 
ed chiefly for the sale of cattle. In all villages, ale-houses exist in 
abundance, and perhaps there are six or eight of them in the pa- 
rish of Rattray. Inns are necessary for the accommodation of the 
public ; but, by the idle and profligate, they are perverted to pur- 
poses of disorder and abuse. 

Fuel. — Coals, the best of all fuel, are rather expensive in this 
part of the country. They are brought either from Perth, or by 
the railway from Dundee to Newtyle, and between purchase and 
freight are necessarily dear. By the wise appointment of the 
Creator, however, every place possesses it own advantages. In the 
high grounds, within three or four miles, there are mosses where 
peats are dug, and dried, and brought home in summer, as a pre- 
paration against the approach of winter. There are also occasion- 
al sales of wood in the neighbouring plantations, where fuel is got 
at a reasonable rate. With a portion of each of these, coals, peat, 
and wood, every person endeavours to be provided. Those on 
the roll of poor are furnished with a certain allowance of coals at 
Christmas ; and all others lay up for themselves, as their wisdom 
or their wealth direct and enable them. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The only other object pertaining to this parish, which I shall 
mention as a matter of curiosity, is an iron bridge, which Colonel 
Chalmers of Glenericht, has thrown across the river, a little below 
his house. The bridge is supported by a stone pillar at each end, 
from which a direct span, not an arch, stretches across the whole 
breadth of the river. The bridge is of such wideness as to admit 
a passage for a carriage, with a foot tract on the side for travellers, 
the bottom or floor of both of which is covered with gravel to pre- 
vent alarm to man or beast. By this bridge, the Colonel has easy 
and elegant access to his property on both sides of the river, and 
also to the great road which runs from Braemar to Perth. The 
bridge was constructed by a Mr Justice in Dundee, and is well 
worthy of the notice of strangers.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH &amp; STIRLING. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER MAXTONE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Fowlis is a Gaelic name, and derives its origin, accor- 
ding to a local tradition, from the following circumstance, charac- 
teristic of the age and country : One of the Earls of Strathearn, 
desirous of having a church in the vicinity of his castle, stood on 
an eminence, on which he had a summer seat, and resolved to 
erect it where the sun first shone, which was on the spot where 
it now stands ; and which he denominated Fowgnolish, under the 
light. The name is limited to this spot, and to the half of the 
village ; the other half is Lacock. 

Extent, fyc. — The extent of the parish is 7 miles from east to 
west at its greatest breadth, and 10 from south to north. It is 
situated on the north side of Strathearn, west from Perth 8, and 
east from Crieff 2 miles ; and divided by two mountain ranges. 
The south range separates the lower part of the parish from 
Logiealmond, and is 3 miles in breadth, on which are large tracts 
of moss, and heath, and plantations, and only a few cottages and 
cultivated farms. The north range is of higher elevation than the 
south, divides Logiealmond from Strathbraan, and forms a part of 
the Grampian mountains, extending from the Atlantic to the Ger- 
man Ocean. 

Topographical Appearances.— -The surface of the parish is re- 
markably irregular. There is only one valley in it, which stretches 
along the banks of the Pow, the whole extent of its southern 
boundary. From this valley to the summit of the south moun- 
tain range, the position of the ground is greatly diversified, and 
divided into different names, including the Braes of Fowlis, the 
Braes of Dury, Gorthy, and Keillor ; all of which have an ele- 
vated southern exposure, and are interspersed with trees, and 
clumps, and stripes of copse, which have a fine imposing effect to 
the eye of the traveller, along the turnpike road, exhibiting rich

enclosures, enchanting slopes, and sinuous ravines, formed by 
streams descending from the mountains, when swollen by the rains, 
in noisy and impetuous torrents, to the plains below. 

In no part of the parish is the inequality of its surface so striking, 
as at Cultoquhey, its western boundary. Mounds composed of gra- 
vel are piled together there, in great numbers, and arranged in such a 
singular variety of grotesque sizes and figures, that they suggest the 
idea of a lusus natures. They appear as if they had been formed 
by the course of a river, probably the Shaggy, which is said to 
have run formerly in this direction. Some of them are covered 
with luxuriant wood ; and the village of Gilmerton is situated at 
their extremity on the west. 

A mile to the east of this, is the gate to Abercairney, which 
opens to an approach on the margin of a copious mountain stream, 
meandring in a deep murky ravine, densely crowded with trees 
and shrubs, which, in its serpentine course, is sometimes invisible, 
and heard murmuring around projections of rocks. This narrow 
shady avenue, which is a fine specimen of romantic scenery, leads 
to a magnificent park, embellished with the enchanting art of imi- 
tating nature, in which extensive lawns salute the eye, the antique 
alley, venerable oaks, clumps and trees scattered in a lavish style 
of sylvan beauty, whose dark shades serve as foils to set off the 
lovelier mantle of the verdant surface. No bold features of moun- 
tains, and rocks, and cascades, no wild misshapen forms, no gro- 
tesque shapes constitute the beauties of this landscape. Nature is 
here arrayed, in gentle attire, in the softer charms of beauty unit- 
ed with utility ; rich meadows, pleasing acclivities, gardens ena- 
melled with flowers, artificial islands and lakes, enlivened with 
swans and cygnets ; and every hortulane and rural decoration, es- 
sential to an elegant and commodious residence. 

To the north-east of Abercairney, on a rocky protuberance, is 
Laterbannochy, once the site of a mansion-house, the residence of 
a family of Murrays, ancestors of Lord Stormont ; from which 
there is a delightful view of the admirable scenery of Drummond 
Castle ; and all the intermediate objects are embraced, at once, by 
the eve, as in a fine landscape painting. This splendid prospect 
was probably the cause of fixing on this position for the house, as 
it is different from the site of the other ancient mansion-houses in 
the parish. They were generally erected on the brink of those 
insures and streams which are so numerous in the braes. Near 
one of them the manse stands, to the east of Laterbannochy, and

in the same elevation —having a southern exposure, and command- 
ing a view of Strathearn, Strathmore, and the Ochil and Lomond 
Hills, forming the grand and distant outline of this extensive pro- 
spect. 

At the distance of a mile to the east of the manse, once stood 
the castle of the Earl of Strathearn, on the east side of a den in 
which the burn of Dury runs. The site was peculiarly appropri- 
ate for this Celtic chief, the great proprietor and chief magistrate 
of the district. The House of Gorthy was situated to the south- 
east of this, on the side of another den of the same name with it- 
self. It is now demolished, but the lawn is still marked by vene- 
rable trees with which it was ornamented. Behind a division of 
the south mountain range, and towards the eastern extremity of 
the parish, is the estate of Keillor, in which there is a considerable 
proportion of fertile soil, well cultivated, and partially inclosed. 
Here stood an ancient castle, with a den on each side of it, which 
a rivulet has formed into a peninsula. 

To the north of the lands of Keillor is the Almond, a beauti- 
ful river, which intersects the parish for the course of two miles. 
On the verge of this river, in a small but sweet spot, Mr T. Mer- 
cer has a neat cottage, embossed in wood and hills, which tower 
above it. West from this at Buchanty, there is a small copse, which, 
as well as the picturesque scenery above and below the bridge, 
are much admired, and numbered among the attractions of the 
district. There the water in the river finds its noisy way, over 
fragments and clusters of stones and rocks, torn asunder and hol- 
lowed, and worn into a variety of forms, and chasms, and pools, 
which with trees hanging on its side, in a deep mass of shade, 
and the soft spray of the cascade, when tinged with the pris- 
matic rays of the sun, form a coup d'oeil, truly romantic. To the 
north-east of this, is the part of the parish in Logiealmond, in 
which there is a breadth of arable land, which rises with conside- 
rable acclivity to the northern mountain range. This range feeds 
numerous flocks of sheep, and gradually descends on the north side, 
to the termination of the parish, at the river Braan, famed for its 
scenery and cascades as it approaches the city of Dunkeld. In the 
same range, are the hills of Conachan, at the western extremity of 
the parish, which are pastured with sheep, and extend to Strona- 
veille in Wester Glenalmond. 

Hydrography. — The parish is abundantly supplied with water. 
Copious perennial springs issue from rocks, and are soft and cool

in their temperature. Loch Luag is situated at the western boun- 
dary of the parish, in a narrow glen, from which there is a sublime 
and diversified prospect of the bold romantic scenery of Monzie 
and Ochtertyre, and the stupendous amphitheatre of hills around 
Comrie, with the lofty Benvoirloch towering to the clouds. The 
Pow is a slow running river, and once covered a great part of the 
ground, in its vicinity, before a channel was dug for it, by authori- 
ty of an Act of Parliament, remarkable for being the last of the 
Scottish acts. It has its source in the mosses below Methven, and 
joins the Earn near Innerpeffray. The Almond rises occasionally 
to a great size, and pursues a rapid meandring course, until it emp- 
ties itself in the Tay, above Perth. It is joined by the Shellegan, 
a fine limpid stream, which runs through the arable fields of Lo- 
giealmond. There are many pleasing cascades in the numerous 
ravines, in which the streamlets from the hills flow, but none of 
them are of great magnitude. The one at Buchanty has attracted 
most notice, from its singular appearance and curious course. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The mountains and plains are gene- 
rally composed of rocks of granite, slate, and sandstone, of great 
thickness and extent ; and the direction and dip of the strata are 
to the north and east. The slates are found in the hills of Lo- 
giealmond. There is a species of limestone at Buchanty, and a 
mass of columnar trap, which runs from east to west. The soil on 
the banks of the Pow is alluvial, and has been transported and 
deposited there by the inundations of the river. There is a 
great variety of fertile soils in the parish, which rest chiefly on 
rock, and are gravelly, sandy, loamy, and clayey. Where they 
rest on rock, they are in many parts thin and dry, but fertile ; and 
where the substratum is clayey, they are wet, cold, and retentive. 
The minuter animals appear less frequently on them than on the 
loamy soil, where they receive more nutrition. 

Zoology. — Such of the wild quadrupeds and fowls as are natives 
of the north, and the migratory birds which frequent Scotland, are 
numerous in the parish. Goats were pastured on the hills of Lo- 
giealmond about fifty years ago ; but they are all now displaced 
by another species of stock. The Fife, the Aryshire, the Tees- 
water breed of cattle, and excellent horses of the Clydesdale breed, ' 
the Garron and the Cleveland Bay, are reared to great size and 
value. 

Botany. — There is a great collection of herbaceous and green- 



FOWLIS WESTER. 



253 



house plants in the gardens at Abercaimey. Pines, grapes, apri- 
cots, and nectarines, grow there to great perfection. Few trees 
grow on the north side of the parish ; but there are large planta- 
tions of forest trees on the south side of the Almond, to all of 
which the soil is congenial, except the Scotch fir, which is slow 
and stinted in its growth. At Abercaimey, there are two ashes of 
uncommon size and age. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events. — The village of Fowlis was once a place of 
considerable importance, where the Stewart of Strathearn held his 
court. This court is memorable for one decision, at which Sir 
Alexander Moray of Abercaimey, who had been charged with cul- 
pable homicide, pled in 1397 the privilege of the law of clan Mac- 
Duff; and being within the ninth degree of consanguinity to him 
he was acquitted, on paying twenty-four merks of silver. The 
Marquis of Montrose is said to have been riding through the Bog 
of Bannochy, when his horse stuck at a place which is still called 
Montrose's goat. He first erected his standard at the bridge of 
Buchanty, where he was joined by the Drummonds and Graemes, 
on his way from Athole, with Macdonald, before he fought the 
battle of Tibbermore. 

These reinforcements were chiefly from Menteith, and under 
the command of Lord Kilpont, eldest son of the Earl of Men- 
teith ;— they had been raised by order of the Committee of Estates 
at Edinburgh, and were marching to the general rendezvous at 
Perth. The advanced party of Montrose's army were startled, 
when, proceeding through Glenalmond, they came in sight of so 
large a body of men, posted in their front, upon the hill of Buch- 
anty. Graeme of Inchbrakie, who commanded this advanced par- 
ty, immediately dispatched intelligence of what he saw to Mon- 
trose, who, with all his characteristic expedition, brought up his 
main body to vanquish them, should they refuse to join him. At 
his approach, a negociation instantly commenced. The officers be- 
ing gentlemen of his own family, and Highlanders of a kindred 
clan, were easily induced to abandon their destination, and to join 
the royal standard. This unexpected accession to his force, which 
now mustered three thousand men, animated this enthusiastic 
leader, and he resolved to commence offensive operations, by at- 
tacking Perth next morning. 

Eminent Men.— Sir David Moray of Gorthy, son of Sir Robert 
Moray of Abercaimey, was Governor to Prince Henry. He ac- 



254 



PERTHSHIRE. 



quired reputation by the success with which he wrote in English 
verse, " The Tragical Death of Sophonisba ; Cselia, containing 
certain sonnets ; and a paraphrase of the 104th Psalm." John, his 
brother, a learned and pious man, was minister of Leith, and an 
intimate friend of Andrew Melville's. He was prosecuted and 
ordered into confinement by King James VI., for a sermon which 
he published, containing some free remarks on the conduct of the 
bishops. Andrew and George Moray of Abercairney, and Peter 
Maxtoneof Cultoquhey were slain in the fatal field of Flowden, 1513. 
A proprietor of the latter house has been long famed for a cele- 
brated litany, which he repeated every morning, at a well near his re- 
sidence. Anthony, of the same family, was, in the reign of Charles 
I., prebendary of Durham. 

Mr Drummond of Broich, was deposed from his office, as minis- 
ter of Fowlis, at the Revolution, because, as stated in the records 
of the kirk-session, he would not pray for King William and Queen 
Mary. — 'The late Dr Ritchie, Professor of Divinity in the Univer- 
sity of Edinburgh, an eminent scholar, and a learned theologian, 
was a native of the village of Fowlis. — The Reverend Dr Alison 
of St Paul's, Edinburgh, and the late Principal Taylor, of Glas- 
gow College, were educated at its parochial school, which was then 
a seminary of reputation. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, James Moray of 
Abercairney; Sir Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre ; Mercer of Gor- 
thy; Stewart of Logiealmond; Maxtone of Cultoquhey; Graeme of 
Inchbraco ; Lord Lynedoch ; Mrs Robertson Williamson of Law- 
ers ; and Captain M'Donald of Sunnysyde. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest entry in the parochial regis- 
ters is in 1674. They are voluminous, and regularly kept, with 
the exception of a few years after the Revolution. 

Antiquities. — In the village of Fowlis, there is an ancient Cal- 
vary cross, on one side of which is a representation of a wolf-chase, 
in bas relief, in which there are figures of men on horseback, and 
a blood-hound. The wolf appears grasping a head in his fierce 
jaws, and tradition says that, in the course of the chase, he ran 
through the town of Fowlis, and snatched off the head of a boy. 
In the same group of figures, are six men dressed in a peculiar 
grotesque style, and following an animal, supposed to be led to the 
sacrifice. The figures on the other side are much defaced, but 
there are gyves or chains on it, which fastened culprits, and ex- 
posed them to infamy, a species of punishment similar to the 
pillory. 



FOWLIS WESTEK.

On the margin of the Almond, at the bridge of Buehanty, St 
Methven, the local and tutelary saint of the parish, had a chapel, 
which is now demolished. At Cultoquhey, there is a small camp 
in which urns with ashes have been dug up, and which probably 
was connected with the great camp at Fendock. Tradition says, 
that Comhal Cult, the father of Fingal, fought here with the Ro- 
mans, and lost the battle. At the junction of the road from Fowlis 
with the turnpike, there is a large cairn, on which is a standing 
pillar, or the monumental stone of some hero or chieftain, who had 
fallen in a battle, which is said to have been fought here. Heaps of 
stones of this nature were formerly accumulated on battle fields, 
and so long as there was any memory of the dead, every passen- 
ger added a stone to the heap. Hence the Gaelic proverb, " I will 
add a stone to your cairn." 

The castle of the Earl of Strathearn is now a verdant mound. 
One of the most considerable families of the kingdom, whose ori- 
gin is now uncertain, formerly resided in it. Grim, Thane of 
Strathearn, was killed in 1010, at the battle of Mortlach, where 
Malcolm II. fought with the Danes. Walinus, a man of rank 
in England, is said to have received this dignity from Malcolm 
Canmore in 1068. Malise signalised himself as a brave and gal- 
lant man at the battle of the standard in 1138. In a council 
of war held in the Scottish camp, the evening before the battle, 
the King signified his intention, that the archers and men at arms 
should lead the van of the army. " Whence this confidence in 
these men, cased in mail, said the Celtic chief, Malise Earl of 
Strathearn, I wear none, yet will I advance farther to-morrow than 
those who are sheathed in steel. Earl, said Alan de Percy, you 
have said more than you dare perform." The King interposed to 
put an end to the dispute. Ferquhard, his son, with five other Earls, 
conspired to seize the person of Malcolm IV. at Perth, 1160, 
and assaulted the tower in which he sought refuge, but were 
repulsed. Gilbert, in 1200, founded the abbey of Inchaffray. Ro- 
bert was one of the guarantees, on the part of Alexander King of 
Scots, for ratifying the differences in 1237, between him and the 
King of England. Malise, when a peace was concluded between 
Alexander II. and Henry III., was, in 1244, one of the guarantees 
of the truce. Malise, his son, signed the famous letter to the Pope, 
and during the minority of David Bruce, opposed Edward Baliol 
with all his interests ; and when that prince prevailed, his earldom 
was forfeited, and given to Warren Earl of Surrey. His countess also, 



256 



PERTHSHIRE. 



in 1320, when a treasonable conspiracy was formed against King 
Robert the Bruce, through fear or remorse, betrayed the guilty se- 
cret, with which she was entrusted, and was condemned to per- 
petual imprisonment. Malise died without issue, by which the male 
line of the family became extinct ; but the daughters of the preced- 
ing Earls had been married to the progenitors of the ducal families 
of Hamilton, Athole, and Montrose; and to the noble families of 
Ruthven, Oliphant, and Bothwell, who got with them great estates. 
Sir John Moray of Drumsergard, lineal heir and representative of 
Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, his grandfather, the eldest sur- 
viving branch of Freskine de Moravia, was married to Mary, 
only sister of Malise, the last Earl, who got with her the lands 
of Abercairney. The earldom, which had been forfeited by Ba- 
liol, was resumed by King David, and conferred on their son, Sir 
Maurice Moray, heir of line, whom failing, to return to the 
Crown, in the same case, and as entire as possessed by Malise 
in the time of his forfeiture. Maurice was killed at the battle of 
Durham, in 1346, arid leaving no issue, the earldom returned to 
the Crown, according to the last grant. The family of Abercairney, 
continued by Alexander, the Earl's brother, are therefore the lineal 
heirs and representatives of the ancient Earls of Strathearn, as 
well as of the Lords of Bothwell. 

The only other heritor resident in the parish is Maxtone of 
Cultoquhey, whose property has been in the singular predicament, 
during all the time it has been possessed by his family, of being 
neither increased nor diminished. He has the same common an- 
cestor with the Maxwells, the one name being Maccuston, a Saxon, 
and the other Maccus-villa, a Norman termination, denoting the 
town and villa of Maccus, the son of Undyn, who had lands upon 
the Tweed, which acquired from him the appropriate name of 
Maxton and Maxwell. 

Fowlis appears to have been a favourite seat of the Druids. 
Several of their clachans have been demolished, but there are still 
four large Druidic stones, standing west from the village, one of 
which is a cromleach, or altar-stone, in which there is an artifi- 
cial cavity, where the blood and oil of the sacrifices flowed. On 
the summit of the hill, due north from the same place, there is a 
Druidic circle of stones, and a double concentric circle. This is 
believed to have been the temple of an arch Druid, which when 
erected was probably in the midst of a forest in which were the 
oak, and consecrated grove, the favourite objects of their super- 



POWLIS WESTER. 



257 



stition. The circle consists of sixteen stones, between which and 
the double circle there is a large stone incumbent, where the arch 
Druid stood, and addressed himself to those around him. The 
outer precinct of the concentric circle is 18 yards in circumfe- 
rence, in which are forty stones. Three yards north from it, there 
is a large standing stone, which is probably monumental of some 
illustrious dead, as they were then interred around those places, 
where they worshipped the Supreme Being. To the west of this 
temple, there is a SVun, which signifies in Gaelic a mount of 
peace, near which is a fairy hillock, where urns have been found, 
and which was believed to have been inhabited by an inferior kind 
of genii, called fairies. On the Si'uns, the Druids held assizes, 
when it was customary to kindle a large bonfire, called Samhin, or 
the fire of peace. On Hallow eve, a Druidical festival, these 
fires are still lighted up, in this district, and retain the same name. 

Modern Buildings.— The House of Abercairney is a superb 
modern edifice, in the form of an ancient cathedral, and in the 
Gothic style of architecture. Its exterior is much admired for its 
lightness, elegance, and symmetry ; but it is far surpassed by the 
exquisite enrichments of its interior finishing. The mansion-house 
of Cultoquhey has also been lately erected. It is a structure of 
beautiful and substantial workmanship, and graceful proportion, in 
the style of the Elizabethan age, from a design of Mr Smirke. 

IH. — Population. 
The population of the parish has of late fluctuated considerably. 
By Dr Webster's list it was rated

In 1770 it was 1100 

1794 . 1224

This fluctuation is owing to the erection of the village of Gilmer- 
ton, to the quoad sacra part of the parish being included in the 
census, and to the extent of modern farms.

Bent of Land, Sfc— The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 13s. 
per acre. The rate of grazing an ox or cow is L. 2, and 5s. per ewe 
or full-grown sheep pastured for the year. The rate of labour for 
the different kinds of farm-labourers and country artisans is Is. 6d. 
per day, in summer, and Is. 2d. in winter, and the rate of mason, 
carpenter, and other mechanical work is 2s. The sheep is of the 
black-faced Linton breed, and attention has been paid to their im- 
provement. 

The husbandry pursued is generally of an improved character. 
Many acres of waste land have been reclaimed, and due attention 
has been paid to draining ; though the Pow inundates the fertile 
valley, on its banks, and deteriorates its luxuriant crops. Were 
its channel enlarged, this would be prevented, the soil would be 
ameliorated, and the aqueous meteors which blight the crops would 
be less injurious. This great and obvious improvement has often 
been proposed, but no measures have hitherto been adopted to carry 
it into effect. 

The general duration of the leases is for nineteen years, and the 
farm-buildings are in a superior style. The greater part of the 
arable ground is enclosed with hedges and stone dikes, but many 
of them are insufficient fences, and the enclosures are defective m 
their subdivisions. Every branch of agriculture has advanced ge- 
nerally of late ; but the property of Sir Patrick Murray of Ochter- 
tyre has received the most elegant and substantial improvement, 
in respect of farm-building, fences, and planting. The chief ob- 
stacles to improvement arise from the distance from manure, and 
sea-ports, and the depression in the value of the produce of the 
soil, which represses the enterprise and industry of the tenant. 

Quarries.— On the lands of Abercairney and Cultoquhey, there 
are two excellent quarries of durable sandstone, which admits of a 
fine polish, and has a beautiful colour. From them both the 
mansion-houses on these estates have been recently built. Craig-

Fisheries. — The only fish taken in the parish is in the Almond. 
On the cascade at Buchanty, which is divided in its stream, by the 
projection of a rock, a basket is suspended, and the salmon and 
white trout, in attempting to overleap the cascade, which impedes 
their progress up the river, plunge into the basket, and are cap- 
tured.

Manufactures.— The principal manufacture in the parish is the 
weaving of cotton cloth, and the weavers are furnished with the raw 
material from Glasgow. The construction of sieves, a species of 
handicraft, is almost peculiar to this place. Several families have 
been for generations employed in'this trade, who carry them to the 
Perth and Fife markets, where they meet with a ready sale, at re- 
munerating prices. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The town and lands of Lacock adjoining to Fowlis, are a burgh 
of barony, with the privilege of a weekly market every Wednesday, 
and two yearly fairs; but none of these have been held of late 
Crieff, which is five miles distant, is the nearest market-town. 

Villages - There are two villages in the parish, Gilmerton and 
owhs ; The former is neat and well built, in a pleasant situation, 
tnrougn which the turnpike road passes from Perth to Crieff. The 
latter generally is in the state in which it has been for centuries, and 
in its exterior appearance is a monument of the building of olden 
times. The progress of improvement, however, has commenced. 
Several of the houses have been lately slated, and the inn has been 
rebuilt in a substantial and commodious manner, which, with the 
school-house, is an ornament to the village. 

The parish enjoys the means of communication in all directions 
by the excellent turnpike roads which have been formed. The

one to Perth, on which the royal mail travels, passes through it, 
the length of seven miles. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The situation of the parish church is con- 
venient for the population. It was repaired about thirty-five years 
ago, and affords accommodation for 800 sittings. The manse and 
offices were rebuilt in a neat and substantial manner in 1820. The 
extent of the glebe is seven acres, and its value is L. 20. The 
stipend is 1\ chalders of barley, and the same quantity of meal. 
325 families, and 800 persons of all ages attend the Established 
Church, and 16 families attend the chapels of Dissenters. The 
two resident heritors and their families attend the chapels of Epis- 
copalians. 323 persons are connected with the parish of Monzie, 
and 60 with the chapel at Aumulrie, quoad sacra. Divine wor- 
ship in the Established church is well attended, and the number of 
communicants is 600. 

Education.— There are four schools in the parish, in which all 
the usual branches of education are taught. Two of them are un- 
endowed. The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary, 
and the legal accommodation. The school fees average L. 25. 
The schoolmaster at Buchanty is provided with a school-house, 
and has L. 5 of salary paid from the bishop's rents. The expense 
of education is, for children, 8s. ; and for those of greater age and 
attainments, L. 1 per year. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 24, and the average sum allotted to each 
is 4s. per month. The amount of contribution for their relief last 
year was L. 70, the half of which arose from church collections, 
and the other half from the interest of L. 86 Sterling, and the vo- 
luntary assessment of the heritors. 

Fairs.— St Methvanmas market is held at Fowlis annually, on 
the 6th of November, and is a useful market for the sale of black- 
cattle, and hiring servants. This was anciently the festival of the 
parish, and the anniversary of the saint to whom the church was 
dedicated at its consecration, when the people constructed pavi- 
lions and booths to indulge in hospitality and mirth, which also 
became a commercial mart, and assumed the name oiferia or holy- 
day. Many of our most ancient fairs have a similar origin. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
The parish, since the date of the last Statistical Account, has 
made great improvements in rural economy. Waste ground has 
been planted and brought into cultivation. The roads are in a 



FOWLIS WESTER.

superior condition, and new ones have been constructed, which 
increase the facilities of internal communication. Farm-stead- 
ings were then covered with thatch, and indifferent in building and 
accommodation; but they are all now slated, well built, and adapt- 
ed for every necessary purpose. Wheat, potatoes, turnips, and ar- 
tificial grasses are cultivated in a much greater breadth. More 
manure is laid on the soil, and it is ameliorated by fences, cleaning 
and draining. Horses and harness, the different breeds of cattle 
and sheep, and all the implements of husbandry are much improv- 
ed. In short, such is the degree of agricultural science general- 
ly diffused, and the high state of the culture of the soil, that there 
is now little prospect of any great future improvement. No doubt 
more waste ground might be profitably planted and enclosed, and 
the present enclosures greatly improved. The immediate de- 
mands on the soil are so pressing, that less attention is paid to a 
permanent than a present advantage. By being too frequently in 
tillage, and operated upon by stimulating manures, it is in some 
parts in a state of exhaustion, and would require rest to consoli- 
date and invigorate its powers of vegetation. 

The cottage system is established in the parish, and has the 
effect of promoting the industry and independence of the labour- 
ing classes. It might, however, be extended. Had labourers and 
artisans a garden attached to their house, and as much ground at 
a moderate rent as would feed a cow, waste land would be culti- 
vated, and they would continue longer in a state of comfort and 
independence. Mr Jacob, who was employed some years ago by 
the British Government to inquire into the agricultural system 
of the continental nations, has laid before the public a detailed 
account of an establishment of this nature in Holland. Such agri- 
cultural settlements are deserving of attention. They would yield 
a due return to the landlord, at a moderate rent, afford profitable 
employment to the population, furnish them with many of the ne- 
cessaries of life, and lessen the tendency to pauperism, an increas- 
ing evil.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH &amp; STIRLING. 

THE REV. JOHN REID OMOND, MINISTER. 



t I.— Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Monzie is derived from the Gaelic, Moighidh, and 
signifies a level tract. 

Figure. — The parish, though extremely irregular in its outline, 
and not reducible to any known figure in mathematics, neverthe- 
less approaches more nearly to the fcrm of the parallelogram than 
any other, — being intersected throughout its entire length by the 
river Almond. 

Boundaries and Extent. — It is bounded on the north by Dull, 
Weem, and Kenmore ; on the east by Fowlis ; on the south by 
Crieff; and on the west by Monivaird and Comrie. It extends 
about 12 miles along the course of the Almond, and its greatest 
breadth is estimated at 7. 

Topographical Appearances. — Situated within the limits of the 
Grampians, it presents a wearisome succession of hills, seldom 
trodden by the foot of man ; but, to compensate for this mono- 
tony, it contains two valleys, Glenalmond and the Vale of Mon- 
zie — the only habitable parts of the parish, — both of which pos- 
sess no small degree of attraction to the admirers of natural beauty. 

Vale of Monzie. — The vale of Monzie commences at the south- 
ern boundary of the parish, and extends about five miles in a di- 
rection north-east, with a rise of several hundred feet, where it 
unites with Glenalmond, at nearly right angles. It is watered for 
about three miles by the Shaggie. The upper part of this small 
stream, — the lofty banks of which are covered with luxuriant copse- 
wood, — is rendered picturesque by three waterfalls, one of them 
55 feet in height. At that point where the wood terminates, the 
banks suddenly widen, giving place to a pretty extensive plain. 
Here stand the parish church, the hamlet, and at some distance 

 Drawn up by Mr John Laurie, Parochial Schoolmaster of Monzie.

MONZIE.

the stately mansion of Monzie, embosomed among trees of the largest 
growth, in " the full efflorescence and stateliness of their manhood." 
The whole is bounded on both sides by hills of considerable though 
unequal elevation, and in front by the Knock, rearing its perpen- 
dicular masses of pine into the middle air. Here also, including 
the neighbouring village of Gilmerton, with the numerous farm- 
houses upon the estates of Monzie and Cultoquhey, are congre- 
gated two-thirds of the whole population. To one stationed upon 
the Highland road, east from the church, the view is of great 
beauty. In the foreground are the luxuriant woods, the rich pas- 
tures, and the House of Monzie, beautifully harmonizing with and 
forming an appropriate centre point to the whole. Extending the 
line of vision out of this narrow valley westward, we have, in the 
middle distance, the dark rampart of the Comrie hills, and far be- 
yond and above these, the delighted eye descries and rests with 
rapture upon Benvorlich, Benmore, and Benledi, blending their 
lofty summits with the blue tints of heaven. Were it not a well- 
authenticated fact, that Dr Johnson regarded Scotland as a region 
destitute of trees, one might be tempted to conclude, that he had 
visited this spot, and received from it his first impression of the 
" Happy Valley," in Rasselas. 

Glenalmond. — Glenalmond, to the eastward of its junction with 
the Vale of Monzie, is an open cultivated country, but here the 
banks of the river suddenly assume the form and character of lofty 
hills ; their bases on the opposite sides of the glen approaching so 
near, as, in some places, barely to leave room for the bed of the 
river. They may be said to average from 1000 to 1200 feet in 
height. They are entirely destitute of trees, but here and there 
may be seen a stinted shrub, seeking a scanty subsistence among 
the rocks. One of the highest eminences on the east side of the 
glen is crowned with the ruins of a Celtic fort, and upon the top 
of a hill on the opposite side of the glen is a cairn. The river 
Almond here measures 70 feet in width. Its waters are transpa- 
rent, and run with considerable velocity over a bed of rock and 
gravel. Its general depth varies from a few inches to several feet. 
This romantic pass continues for upwards of two miles, and, on ac- 
count of its narrowness, is familiarly known by the name of the 
" Small Glen." A new road, leading to the Highlands, runs 
through it, formed upon the most approved principles of engineer- 
ing, and kept in a state of admirable repair. It is nearly upon the 
same line with the military road, formed by Government for the 



264 



PERTHSHIRE, 



improvement of the Highlands, after the suppression of the Rebel- 
lion in 1745. 

Clach-Ossian, or Ossian' s Stone. — Towards the upper extremity 
of the pass, and near the side of the river, is a large stone, eight feet 
in height, and nearly cubical in form, which is said to mark the grave 
of the Caledonian bard, Ossian. When General Wade formed the 
military road, already mentioned, the soldiers, induced either by cu- 
riosity or the hope of finding secreted treasure, removed this stone 
from its ancient bed. Their curiosity was indeed gratified, but 
that constituted their chief reward. They found below it four 
stones set on edge, forming a small chamber, 2 feet long, 1 broad, 
and 2 deep, containing bones and some pieces of coin. 

This was held decisive of its being a grave ; but the question, 
as to who might be the occupant of this " narrow house," the 
" four stones with their heads of moss' 1 — remains unsolved. An- 
other grave having been prepared at some distance, the bones were 
carried thither to the music of the bagpipe, and again consigned 
to the earth. 

Although laid open to the view about ninety years ago, two of the 
stones still retain their erect position, and the chamber is not more 
than half-filled with rubbish. Surveying this simple tomb, situat- 
ed amidst the wild seclusion of Glenalmond, the reader of Ossian 
naturally reverts to the lines of the bard, so truly descriptive of it : 
" Narrow is thy dwelling now  dark the place of thine abode  
with three steps I compass thy grave, O thou who wast so great 
before  four stones with their heads of moss are the only memorials 
of thee, a tree with scarce a leaf." Above the bridge of Newton, 
where the Small Glen terminates, the hills on each side recede, 
leaving a stripe of level ground on either side of this pastoral 
stream. This is known by the name of Western Glenalmond, 
and contains several interesting objects, which fall to be noticed 
under the head Antiquities. 

The Thief's Cave. — In one of the lateral glens, communicating 
with Western Glenalmond, is a cave, called the thief's cave, from 
its having been the retreat of a noted sheep-stealer, called Alas- 
tair Baine. It is of considerable dimensions, said to be capable 
of containing sixty men, and situated about midway up the 
face of a rock, called the eagle's rock. It might have afforded a 
more secure retreat, but for its total want of wood. Attracted bv 

 These particulars are communicated by Peter M'Ara, an old man of eighty- four, 
still alive, and a native of Glenalmond, who received them from an eye-witness.

the light of his fire in the night, his pursuers came upon him in 
the very act of roasting one of his fleecy victims, and for his crimes 
he underwent the last penalty of the law at Perth, having previ- 
ously, without the form of trial, suffered the loss of one of his ears 
for a similar offence committed at Glen Ledneck. 

Kirk of the Grove. — In the vicinity of the cave is a natural cu- 
riosity, known by the name of the " kirk of the grove," consisting 
of several large stones piled above one another. Not far from 
this, stands a solitary and aged pine, perhaps the last of an exten- 
sive forest ; but as the Caledonians are said to have frequently 
planted a fir tree near or upon the tomb of a warrior, it requires 
no great stretch of the imagination to suppose that this may point 
out the last resting place of an ancient hero : — " a tree stands alone 
on the hill, and marks the slumbering Connal." 

The small glen having attracted the notice of Mr Wordsworth, 
any apology for introducing the subjoined beautiful lines, from the 
pen of that distinguished poet, will, it is hoped, be deemed unne- 
cessary. 

In this still place, remote from men, 

Sleeps Ossian, in the Narrow Glen ; 

In this still place, where murmurs on 

But one meek streamlet, only one : 

He sang of battles, and the breath 

Of stormy war, and violent death ; 

And should, methinks, when all was past, 

Have rightfully been laid at last 

"Where rocks were rudely heaped and rent 

As by a spirit turbulent ; 

Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild, 

And every thing unreconciled ; 

In some complaining, dim retreat, 

For fear and melancholy meet ; 

13 Lit this is calm, there cannot be 

A more entire tranquillity. 

Does then the Bard sleep here indeed   

Or is it but a groundless creed  

What matters it  — I blame them not 

Whose fancy in this lonely spot 

Was moved ; and in such way expressed 

Their notion of its perfect rest. 

A Convent, even a hermit's Cell ' 

Would break the silence of this Dell : 

It is not quiet, is not ease ; 

But something deeper far than these : 

The separation that is here 

Is of the grave ; and of austere 

Yet happy feelings of the dead : 

And, therefore, was it rightly said 

That, Ossian, last of all his race  

Lies buried in this lonely place. 

 Temperature.— The temperature, as might be expected from 
the mountainous character of the district, is various ; that of Glen-

almond, on account of its elevation, is cold, and contrasts strik- 
ingly with the mild atmosphere enjoyed by the southern portion of 
the parish. 

Prognostics of the Weather. — Among the phenomena of the at- 
mosphere, that indicate a coming change in the state of the weather, 
must not be omitted, the sound of the waterfalls upon the Shag- 
gie, and the roar of the distant Turret. In the vicinity of rivers, 
there are times, especially in the stillness of evening twilight, when 
the music of the rushing waters, and the fitful sighing of the wind, 
break upon the ear with more than ordinary solemnity, arresting 
the attention of the listener as if the voice of a spirit spoke. At 
such times, if the sound sent forth by the water is clear and loud, 
stormy weather may be expected ; but should it seem to recede 
from the ear, until it is lost in the remote distance, fair weather 
will soon follow. The approach of a storm may also be learned 
from observing' the motions of the crows. When these are seen 
busily feeding, and hurrying over the surface of the ground, all in 
one direction, and in a compact body, a severe storm may be an- 
ticipated. 

JJ hirlwinds and Earthquakes. — The small glen having no la- 
teral communication or opening, resembles a funnel cut in the solid 
earth, presenting in its sinuosities various obstacles to a free trans- 
mission of the air ; it is therefore subject to contrary currents and 
eddies of the most violent character. Recent instances have oc- 
curred of travellers on horseback having been blown from the sad- 
dle, driven to seek shelter in holes or behind rocks, and there de- 
tained for hours, until the fury of the storm abated. 

Slight shocks of an earthquake, emanating from Comrie, seven 
miles distant as a central point, are frequently experienced in this 
parish ; but their severity has been greatly abated within these 
thirty years. It may not be uninteresting to mention, that a shock 
was felt at Comrie, on the 25th of August 1834, one of the days 
on which an eruption, attended by most disastrous consequences, 
took place at Mount Vesuvius in Italy. 

Longevity. — The climate seems to be favourable to longevity, 
there being many individuals above eighty years of age ; and one 
man died in 1825 at the advanced age of 103. 

Rivers. — The river Almond, which rises in the parish of Ken- 
more, traverses the parish of Monzie from east to west for a dis- 
tance of about twelve miles. After a course of eighteen miles, it 
falls into the Tay, two miles above Perth. The Shaggie, the Kel-

tie, and the Barvick, three small streams issuing from the hills, 
after a short and somewhat precipitous career, join the turret, and 
pour their united waters into the Earn, a little above Crieff. 

Waterfalls. — Like most Highland districts, this parish presents 
us with a due proportion of waterfalls. Besides the three upon 
the Shaggie already mentioned, and many others of smaller 
note, there is one upon the Keltie 90 feet in height; while the 
Bauvick, throughout nearly its whole extent, is one succession 
of cascades, the romantic effect of which is heightened by its lofty 
and steep banks of naked rock, overshadowed by a thick, though 
unequal covering of such wood as can contrive to extract nourish- 
ment from a scanty soil, or from the fissures of the craggy preci- 
pices. When the visitor approaches this romantic dell from the 
west, and his ear is assailed by the moaning of the winds mingled 
with the sound of the waters, as they leap from rock to rock, the 
melodious lines of Spenser are vividly recalled to his mind : 

" The water's fall with difference discreet 
Now soft, now loud, unto the wind did call ; 
The gentle, warbling wind low answered to all." 

Geology and Soil — Slate, sandstone, and limestone, are all 
found in this parish ; but the latter being of indifferent quality, 
and far from coal is not wrought. The prevailing soil is light, 
dry, and good. 

Zoology. — Among the various species of animals may be enu- 
merated the hare, the rabbit, the otter, the badger, the fox, the roe- 
deer, the squirrel, the weasel, the stoat, the marten and the wild 
cat : the common gray eagle, the falcon, the salmon-tailed glade, 
the common buzzard, the sparrowhawk, the merlin, thewood- 
cock, the pheasant, a great variety of the duck tribe, the partridge, 
the snipe, black game and grouse in great abundance. 

There is plenty of common trout in all the streams, and in the 
Almond are both sea-trout and salmon ; the former come up to 
spawn in the middle of July, and the latter in the end of October, 
and both return to the sea in the end of November and beginning 
of December. At Buchanty there is a fall upon the Almond, 
which effectually prevents the salmon and sea-trout from ascend- 
ing farther up the river, and many of those that endeavour to take 
this leap are caught by means of a basket or cruive, so placed as 
to intercept them in their fruitless attempt. 

Plantations. — There are several hundred acres of thriving plan-

tation in the parish, chiefly upon the estates of Monzie, Glenal- 
mond, Callander, and Cultoquhey. These consist principally of 
larch, Scotch fir, oak, ash, elm, and willow ; for the growth of all 
of which, the soil is well adapted. 

Extraordinary Larches. — In the garden of Monzie are five 
larches, remarkable for their age, growth, and symmetry. They 
are coeval with the celebrated larches of Dunkeld, having been 
brought along with them to this country from the same place, and 
are' now superior to them in beauty and size. The tallest mea- 
sures 102 feet in perpendicular height: another is 22 feet in cir- 
cumference at the ground, and at the distance of 2 feet from the 
ground, 16 feet, and it throws out branches to the extraordinary 
distance of 48 and 55 feet from the trunk. The late Duke of 
Athol, it would appear, evinced a more than ordinary degree of 
interest in the progress of these fine trees, — sending his gardener 
annually thither to observe their growth. When this functionary 
returned and made his wonted report, that the larches at Monzie 
were leaving those of Dunkeld behind in the race, his Grace would 
jocularly allege, that his servant had permitted General Campbell's 
good cheer to impair his powers of observation. 

II. — Civil History. 
There is no account of the parish, either printed or in manu- 
script, so far as is known, except that contained in Sir John Sinclair's 
national work. We shall, therefore, avail ourselves of the little 
information that can be gleaned from the session records, aided by 
tradition. 

Establishment of ' Presbyterianism. — The records of session com - 
mence 5th April 1691, and are dated at Logy, where there was 
and still is a chapel. The first fact they record is the ordination 
of nine elders for the parish of Monzie, by Mr William Reid, 
minister of Rattray, " according to the appointment of the pres- 
bytery of Perth thereanent." The next minute is dated at Mon- 
zie, 15th July 1691, and records the ordination of Mr William 
Chalmer, the first presbyterian minister of Monzie, — Mr Reid of 
Rattray again preaching and presiding. 

Traits of Ancient Manners, Witches, Sfc. — It affords a curious 
picture of the manners of the age, to be informed, that the parish- 
ioners were in the practice of assembling upon the Green of Monzie 
on the Sabbath mornings to play at foot-ball ; and that on these 
occasions, Mr Chalmer, who experienced great difficulty in indu- 



MONZIK. 



269 



cing his people to attend church, occasionally took part with them 
in this amusement;— by thus gaining their affections, he prevailed 
on them to accompany him to the house of prayer, and there listen 
to his instructions. 

Mr Bowie succeeded Mr Chalmer in 1711, and died in 1740. 
During his incumbency the Earl of Marr set up the standard of 
rebellion; and on the 12th of November 1715, was fought the 
battle of Sheriffmuir, within twenty miles of Monzie. In reference 
to this civil war we find the following entry in the session records : 

« Monzie, June 19th 1715.      The session being- 
informed that there is a rebellion about to be in the nation, and 
that Alexander Drummond  has joyned that partie, 
they can doe nothing in that affair at this time." 

For more than two hundred years antecedent to this period, the 
mania of burning for witchcraft had raged with violence all over 
Europe. History informs us, that about the year 1515, 500 
witches were executed at Geneva in the short space of three 
months; in the diocese of Como, 1000 in one year; in Germany 
alone, from the year 1484 to the suppression of persecution for 
witchcraft, 100,000. England, according to Barrington, put to 
death 30,000 ; and Scotland, with a narrower field and a smaller 
population, was nothing behind, — multitudes being burnt in every 
part of the kingdom. Need it excite wonder then, if in this san- 
guinary and appalling tragedy, — when " one-half of the population 
was either bewitching or bewitched,"- — the parish of Monzie should 
have immolated one solitary victim. Tradition informs us, that 
the name of the woman who was burned for this alleged crime was 
M'Nieven. The scene of her execution was the brow of a hill, 
commonly called the Knock, and the particular spot is still recog- 
nized by the name of M'Nieven's Craig. Whether or not she was 
convicted before the Court of Justiciary is now uncertain ; but as 
the privy-council was in the practice of granting commissions to 
resident gentlemen and ministers, to examine, and afterwards to 
try and execute witches all over Scotland, it is probable that this 
unfortunate creature was convicted before one of those local tri- 
bunals. The date of this transaction must be between 1711 and 
1722, when the last execution for witchcraft in Scotland took place 
at Dornoch. While at the stake, she is represented, like the sibyl 
of old, as pouring out predictions and denunciations : but these, in 
all probability, are much beholden to the inventive powers of others, 
and were they now detailed, could not afford gratification to any

rational mind. The unshaken belief of the people in witchcraft, 
and the atrocities of what, it is feared, was little better than a po- 
pular and lawless execution, must have powerfully operated upon 
their heated minds; for even to this day, when viewed at a dis- 
tance through time's dusky horizon, the " Witch of Monzie" pre- 
sents to the imagination a certain undefined magnitude, shedding 
a dim inglorious halo around this period of our parochial history.— 
Belonging to the old church of Monzie, taken down in 1830, was 
an instrument of punishment called the jougs. It was simply an 
iron collar, fastened to the outside of the wall, near one of the 
doors, by a chain. No person alive, it is believed, has seen this 
pillory put in requisition ; nor is it known at what period it was 
first adopted for the reformation of offenders; but there can be no 
doubt, that an age which could sanction burning for witchcraft, 
would see frequent occasion for this milder punishment. It is 
now regarded as a relic of a barbarous age, and has been affixed 
to the wall of the present church merely to gratify the curiosity of 
antiquaries. 

One glimpse more may be obtained into the condition of so- 
ciety at that period. Formerly there were extensive cattle markets 
held at Crieff, which have since been carried to Falkirk. These 
necessarily brought down from the north, crowds of Highlanders. 
They are described by people old enough to remember them, as 
barefooted and bareheaded, although many of them old men. Be- 
ing numerous, they used to enter the houses of the country people, 
take unceremonious possession of their firesides and beds, carry 
off the potatoes from their fields or gardens, and sometimes even 
the blankets, which had afforded them a temporary coverino- for 
the night. 

New Boundaries of the Parish.— Logiealmond and Innerpeffray 
formerly belonged to the parish of Monzie, although lying detach- 
ed from it, and at a great distance from the church. To obviate 
this inconvenience, and that all might be admitted to a participa- 
tion in church benefits, a decreet of the Court of Session was ob- 
tained in 1702, separating them from Monzie, and annexing the 
former to the parish of Moneydie, and the latter to Muthil ; by 
the same decreet, the lands of Callander, Coynachan, Dalmore, 
Newton, Crag-na-farer, Curriemuckloch, the three Fendochs' 
Dalick, the Downies, the Lethandies, Greenfield, and Mill Rodgie 
belonging to Crieff,— as also the lands of Cultoquhey, including 
iilmerton, Counachan, part of the Parkneuck, belonging to 



MONZIE. 



271 



Fowlis Wester, were taken from these parishes, and annexed to 
Monzie. This is found to be a more convenient arrangement, 
and is denominated Monzie parish quoad sacra ; while those lands 
within the old boundary are called the parish of Monzie quoad cz- 
vilia. The former build and repair the church : the latter build 
and repair the manse and school, and pay the minister's stipend 
and the schoolmaster's salary. 

Chief Land-owners.— The chief land-owners are, Alexander 
Campbell, Esq. of Monzie and Inverawe ; James M. Patton. 
Esq. of Glenalmond, Anthony Maxtone, Esq. of Cultoquhey ; 
James Moray, Esq. Abercairney; Mrs Williamson of Lawers; Tho- 
mas Patton, Esq. of Glenalmond ; and Sir Patrick Murray of 
Ochtertyre, Bart. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers are comprised m 
eight folio volumes. The minutes of the kirk-session commence 
in°1691, and are brought down to the present period ; but there 
is a chasm of five years between 1706 and 1711. The register of 
baptisms begins 24th November 1720, and is continued for six 
months. It is then discontined till 17th May 1724, during which 
year and the whole of 1725, there are only three entries. No 
names occur in 1726, and in 1727 the register recommences, and 
is continued down till 1836. The register of marriages or marriage 
contracts, or proclamations, commences in 1728, and is continued 
to the year 1831, without interruption. There is no register of 
deaths. In addition to the above records, there is a cash-book 
regularly kept for the funds appropriated to the poor. 

The following is a list of all the ministers of Monzie since the 
establishment of Presbyterian ism in 1691 : Mr Chalmer, Mr 
Bowie, Mr Monroe, Mr Lundie, Mr Walker, who had three as- 
sistants, viz., Messrs Davidson, M'Leish, and M'Aulie, Mr 
Bartie, Mr Erskine, Mr Taylor, Mr Cameron, Mr Omond. 

Antiquities. — This parish possesses some claim to the notice of 
the antiquary. Indeed there are few localities in Scotland more 
rich in Celtic and Roman remains than this and several of the 
adjoining parishes. Within the range of a few miles the travel- 
ler may visit the Roman camps at Ardoch, Comrie, and Stra- 
geth, — the first allowed to be the most entire specimen of Ro- 
man castrametation in Britain, — besides many small forts and frag- 
ments of military roads, some of the latter several miles in length. 

Druid Monuments and Subterranean Building. — But to return 
to the parish of Monzie. There are, first, its Druidic monuments.

consisting either of a single stone of large dimensions standing on 
end, or of a whole group arranged in the form of a circle. Spe- 
cimens of both may be seen in the park of Monzie. Adjoining 
these is a subterranean building of rude construction, having a few 
steps of a stone stair within it. The roof is gone, and the build- 
ing itself is but partially laid open to the view. When explored 
a few years ago, there were found in it a sword and a stone hatchet, 
both of which are now preserved in Monzie House. A large 
Druid stone, with rude carving upon it, lies on the side of the pub- 
lic road, between the villages of Monzie and Keppoch. This was 
one of a circle, which Mr Monroe, the then minister of the pa- 
rish, caused to be broken and dispersed ; the rest are now built 
into the stone wall which surrounds the glebe. At a place called 
" Clach-na-tiom-pan," in Wester Glenalmond, is an oblong cairn, 
measuring about 60 paces in length ; and immediately adjoining 
are several Druidic stones. The cairn appears, from openings that 
have been made in it, to have been divided into chambers for the 
reception of the dead. 

Ancient Chapels and Burying Grounds. — A little farther down 
the glen, at Tomenbowie, formerly stood a small chapel ; it is now 
in ruins, but the burying ground remains, and even yet occasion- 
ally affords within its narrow precincts a last home to the weary. 
Near the north-east corner of the parish once stood " Stuck Cha- 
pel," in which, tradition says, sixty men took the sacrament, on 
the evening before the battle of Luncarty, in 976, and having gone 
to the field only six returned. The cemetery still exists, but not 
a vestige of the chapel is to be seen. 

Forts.— On the top of Dunmore, overlooking the Small Glen 
and the Roman camp, are the ruins of a fort, believed to be Cel- 
tic. It consists of a stone wall, in some places double, surround- 
ing probably half a rood of ground. The stones upon the west ' 
side are partially vitrified ; and at Middle Lethendy is another of 
larger size. 

Camps.— A few hundred yards above the village of Monzie, up- 
on an eminence called « Knock Durroch" the Oaken Knoll, is 
a small entrenchment, supposed to be Roman. It is of an oval 
form, measuring 120 paces in length, and 80 at its greatest 
breadth. It is surrounded by a double trench, which at one place 
appears to the eye to be not less than 8 or 9 feet in depth. At 
Cultoquhey, the property of Anthony Maxtone, Esq. there is a 
.similar camp, but of much larger dimensions.

Fendoch Camp. — But the chief object of interest to the anti- 
quary is the camp at Fendoch, called in Gaelic Kaenfhandoch, 
i. e. Fendoch point. Its traditionary name is the Roman Camp, 
and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of tlfe appellation ; 
and that it is in reality the work of the Roman legions under 
Agricola, or one of his successors. It is situated upon a table-land, 
at the lower extremity of that remarkfble pass called the Small 
Glen, already described, and within view of the fort upon Dun- 
more. The River Almond, issuing from this defile, turns to the 
left, so as to form a right angle with its former course ; and with 
its steep banks constitutes a natural defence to the camp on the 
north side. The west is protected by a marsh ; the south by a 
small stream called the Burn of Fendoch ; and the east by a na- 
tural declivity. It may probably contain 45 acres of ground. It 
would appear that, at the period when the former Statistical 
Account was published, the trenches were entire, and in some 
places six feet deep ; but both rampart and trench are now fast 
disappearing under the operation of the plough. The rampart upon 
the north side, after running for a considerable distance in nearly 
a straight line upon the brow of the table-land, suddenly descends 
into the plain below, incloses a spring of excellent water, again 
climbs the bank, and pursues its rectilinear course. This is the 
only spring within the camp. Near the side of the river, there 
is a small elliptical inclosure, formed of turf and stone, measuring 
12 paces by 8. The moor on the east side of the camp bears 
marks of having once been the arena of conflicting armies, and was 
covered till lately, to the extent of several acres, with cairns ; and 
when these were removed to form a new road, some fragments of 
urns containing bones were found underneath. Several of these 
cairns measured 10, 13, or 14 paces in diameter. On the right 
hand side of the road leading to Buchanty, and at no great distance 
from the cairns, is a small eminence called " The Gallows Hill," 
and a few yards distant from it is a small enclosure of turf of 
nearly circular form. It is evident that the former, from its name, 
is a vestige of comparatively late antiquity. 

Ancient Relics. — An old man is still alive in the village of Mon- 
zie who recollects of having found, when engaged with some com- 
panions in a hunting excursion, in his younger days, several heads 
of spears, in the vicinity of the camp ; but they were disregarded 
as things of no value. There is a silver coin, evidently Roman, 
in the possession of Mr James Young, Crieff, which was found in 

PERTH. s 



274 PERTHSHIRE. 

this place. It is of the size of a sixpence, having on one side a 
head in high relief; and on the obverse three figures, the centre 
one an eagle; the other two, as well as an inscription on each side, 
are so much effaced as to be nearly illegible. 

In the month of August 1834, while a labourer of the name ot 
Donald Stewart, was employed in digging across the eastern ram- 
part of the camp, for the purpose of constructing a stone fence, he 
discovered at some distance below the surface, three pots or kettles, 
the largest of which broke In pieces while he was in the act of rais- 
ing it from the ground. The other two measured 81 inches m 
diameter, by 3 in depth, and 10 inches in diameter, by 4, » 
depth, respectively, and were composed of a series of concentric 
circles, fastened together with nails, the larger pot having a straight 
handle 21 inches in length. Along with these were deposited three 
heads of spears or javelins, 7 inches in length, two of these still 
having wood adhering to their sockets: a piece of flat iron or other 
metal, 18 inches in length, having a striking resemblance to a 
Roman sword preserved in the Museum of Antiquaries, Edinburgh, 
except that the latter measures 25 inches in length; but as the 
former appears to have been broken at one end, it must have been 
at one time longer : three pair of bits, two pair of shears, 11 inches 
loner, the blades alone measuring 4 inches : a sort of spoon, the 
handle of which measures 10 inches, including the diameter of the 
mouth ;— this corresponds exactly with the descriptions and repre- 
sentations given of the thuribulum found in Pompeii : a beautiful 
hinge of a yellowish metal, still covered with a slight coating of 
what appears to be silver, 4 inches in length, carved, and in excel- 
lent preservation : two implements resembling the wimble used by 
carpenters for boring ; a piece of flat iron about B feet long, bent 
in the form of a pair of sugar-tongs, the edges at one end bent 
inwards, so as almost to meet and form a socket, the other end be- 
inr broken off. Besides these, there were other articles, whose 
uses were not very apparent. Those, whose size would admit of 
it, were found carefully packed in the largest kettle, which, as al- 
ready stated, was broken, and a flat stone was placed over its mouth. 
The discovery of these relics establishes one important fact, 
namely, that cavalry lay in this encampment. 

The whole of the articles above described, except the hinge and 
one of the spears, have found a secure asylum in the custody of John 
Buchanan, Esq. Secretary to the' Western Bank, Glasgow, whose 
propertv they have become. 

While all traces of that power, which the mighty Roman cast 



MONZIE. 



275 



like a mantle over the world, are fast hastening to decay, it would 
be matter of lasting and extreme regret should all such interesting 
fragments not be collected and preserved with scrupulous and 
jealous care. To the imaginative mind it might seem like the ga- 
thering up of laurels which have fallen from the conqueror's brow, 
for here it was that a power mightier by far than that of Rome pro- 
claimed, " hitherto shalt thou come, but no farther." 

Besides the antiquities already enumerated, which may be term- 
ed native to the parish, the House of Monzie contains a splendid 
collection of paintings, ancient armour, and many articles of virtu. 
Some part of these are wrecks of the feudal times, which have sur- 
vived the period of their usefulness ; but here also may be seen re- 
mains of Roman and even Babylonian antiquity, brought together 
like converging rays of light, into one common focus, thus com- 
bining with the present, ages and countries the most remote, and 
shedding a lustre over the pages of their written history. 

Modern Buildings. — The chief modern buildings, besides the 
church, are the mansion-houses of Monzie and Cultoquhey. 

III. — Population. 

The first account taken of the population of this parish, so far 
as is known, was at the request of Dr Webster in 1755, when it 
amounted to 1192. Another account was taken in 1792, by the 
Rev. George Erskine, then minister of Monzie, which amounted 
to 1 136, exhibiting a diminution of 56, in a period of thirty-seven 
years, or about 1 \ in the year at an average. And by a third enu- 
meration in 1836, made expressly for this work, we find the popu- 
lation to be 940, being a decrease of 196 in forty- four years, or 
about 5 in the year at an average. 

The present population is distributed as follows : — 

Monzie village, .... 118— in 1792, 1 12 

Cuilt, ..... 25 
Keppoch, . . . . .13 

Estate of Monzie, exclusive of these three villages, . 134 

Gilmerton, ..... 232 

Estate of Cultoquhey, exclusive of Gilmerton, . 87 

Callander, . . . . . 62 

The other districts not included in the above enumeration, . 269 

940 

As the village of Gilmerton has sprung into existence within 
these few years, and Monzie has remained nearly stationary since 
1792, the decrease has taken place in the population distributed 
among the farms, and is to be accounted for by these being let out 
to fewer hands than formerly. 



•276 



PERTHSHIRE. 



The yearly average number of recorded births for the last seven 
years is 12i : and the number of illegitimate births during the 
iast three years appears from the session records to have been 10. 

Families of independent fortune, and Proprietors of land.— There 
are three families of independent fortune who reside within the pa- 
rish, and six proprietors of land above the yearly value of L. 50. 

Language spoken.— The Gaelic is spoken in western Glenal- 
mond, while the Scottish dialect, with a strong Highland accent, 
prevails in the rest of the parish. The fact, however, that few in- 
dividuals in the southern districts even understand the Gaelic, is 
evidence sufficient that that ancient tongue is fast falling into disuse. 

Games and amusements.— during winter, the national game of 
curling is a favourite out-of-door amusement. The practice of as- 
sembling in large numbers at weddings has been long upon the 
decline. Handsel Monday, old style, is spent in paying and re- 
ceiving visits, exchanging congratulations and feasting ; and where 
the requisites of music and a commodious apartment, or barn, are 
to be found, the young people conclude their festivities with a 
dance. Cards and draughts are also to be found among their 
amusements, and in summer the game of quoits is a favourite pas- 
time. 

Dress, Ordinary Food, c— The habits of the people in re- 
spect of dress may be considered as cleanly, to which the gene- 
ral introduction of cottons has materially contributed. The ap- 
pearance of the rural population on Sundays indicates a pleasing 
degree of self-respect and comfort. Like the majority of their 
countrymen, they are more solicitous about making a decent per- 
sonal appearance in public, than enjoying the luxuries of good eat- 
ing. Potatoes, pork, and the produce of the dairy, constitute a 
very considerable proportion of their ordinary food. Their bread 
is commonly of oat or barley meal, but the occasional use of tea 
and wheaten bread is becoming common. In estimating " whether 
the people on the whole enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the com- 
forts and advantages of society, and are contented with their situa- 
tion and circumstances," regard must be had to some standard of 
comparison. Those accustomed to the modes of living, and to the 
usages of manufacturing towns, would perhaps pronounce the people 
of this parish poor, and in want of the luxuries and even many of 
the necessaries of civilized life. And, although in this there might 
be no exaggeration, yet the people may be described as more con- 
tented with their situation, than those who thus affect to compas- 
sionate them. Not — it will be admitted — because poverty is of 

4 



M0NZ1E. 



277 



itself calculated to produce content, but simply because their wants 
are few, and their wealth does not exceed their ability to control 
it. As prosperity seldom sets in upon a rural population with so 
strong a current as it frequently does upon manufacturing districts, 
so the former are to a considerable extent without its concomitant 
improvidence and crime. Life flows on with a more equable cur- 
rent, and as there are not the same alternations of prosperity and 
depression, so is there less of misery and disappointment. 

Poaching.— Poaching in game or the salmon-fisheries does not 
prevail to a great extent, and smuggling, once so common in this 
parish, is now unknown. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— The number of acres in the parish, whether ara- 
ble or in pasture, cannot be ascertained ; and there is no land in 
a state of undivided common. 

Wood. — The trees indigenous to the soil are the hazel, birch, 
oak, alder, plane, fir, common and mountain ash ; and those plant- 
ed are chiefly the larch, Scotch fir, oak, ash, elm, plane, and wil- 
low. The management of plantations is well understood. 

Rent and Grazing.— The average rent of arable land per acre 
is from L. 1, 10s., to L. 2, but small pieces called pendicles some- 
times bring L. 3 per acre. Grazing an ox or cow costs from 
L. 2 to L. 3, or upon hill pasture from 16s. to L. 1, 10s. : a sheep 
or ewe, on low ground, from 9s. to 10s., or on hill pasture, from 
3s. to 4s. 

Rate of Wages. — A farm- servant, fit for all work, with bed and 
victuals, costs L. 12 per annum. A farm labourer engaged by 
the day, costs in summer Is. 6d, and in winter Is. 2d. or Is. 3d; 
a female servant with bed and victuals, costs L. 6 per annum ; a 
mason receives without victuals from 12s. to 14 per week ; a car- 
penter from 12s. to 1 3s. ; a thatcher with victuals Is. 6d per day. 

Live-stock. — The common breed of sheep are the Highland 
or black-faced, and great attention is paid to their improvement. 
The cattle are a cross breed between the Highland and Lowland, 
and a few Ayrshire cows are kept. 

Husbandry. — The character of the husbandry pursued may be 
termed good. A considerable quantity of land has been taken in, 
drained, trenched, and cleared of stones ; but the expense of lime, 
on account of the long carriage, being brought from Perth, a dis- 
tance of from fourteen to seventeen miles, is a great drawback 
to improvement. 



278 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Leases and Farm-Buildings. — The general duration of leases 
is fifteen years, and this is regarded by the farmer as a favourable 
period. Many of the farm steadings have been lately rebuilt upon 
an improved plan, but much in this respect remains to be done. 

Quarries. — There is a quarry of excellent freestone upon the 
estate of Cultoquhey, of a red colour, and great durability ; and 
upon the property of James M . Patton, Esq. of Glenalmond, 
there is another, besides two quarries of slate, all of superior 
quality. 

Amount of raw Produce. — The average gross amount of raw pro- 
duce raised in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, 
after making a suitable deduction for what may be consumed upon 
the farms, is as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, . L. 981 

Potatoes, . . 205 

Hay, . . ] 10 

Grass parks, . . 1000 

Sheep and wool, . . 3195 

Cattle, . . 513 

Dairy produce, . . 337 

L. 6341 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no market-town in the parish of Monzie ; but this de- 
ficiency is but little felt, as Crieff is only three miles distant, where 
there is a weekly market, besides eight fairs in the year. 

Villages. — The parish contains two villages, Monzie and Gil- 
merton, the former having a population of 118, and the latter of 
232 souls. Monzie is built upon the property of Mr Campbell, 
and the inhabitants are merely tenants ; while Gilmerton is feued 
off Mr Maxtone. 

Roads and Fences. — There are about eleven miles of excellent 
turnpike road, besides several miles of road maintained by statute 
labour. 

As a great proportion of the parish is pastoral, much of the land 
is unenclosed, but where fences are necessary, they are in general 
kept in good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the church, near the south- 
ern boundary of the parish, is convenient for the majority of the 
parishioners. It was built in 1830-31, and opened for public 
worship, by the Rev. Mr Cameron, on Sabbath, 24th July 1831. 
It is after a plan by Mr Stirling, architect, Dunblane, and is built 
to contain 512 persons. 

Manse, Glebe, and Stipend. — The manse was built in 1779. 

3 



MONZIE. 



270 



The glebe contains about 1 1 acres of superior land. The stipend 
is the minimum, the annual sum of L. 15, 16s. 8d., being contri- 
buted by the Exchequer. 

Number of Communicants, &amp;j'c— The number of male heads ot 
families in communion with the church amounts in the present year 
to 153 ; and the total number of communicants is about 450. 

Church Collections.— The average amount of church collections 
for the poor, and to defray incidental expenses, for the last five 
years, is L. 25, 8s. 2d. 

The number of Dissenting or Seceding families in the parish 

is 11. i i 

Education.— There are two schools in the parish, viz. the pa- 
rochial, and a private school at Gilmerton. The branches taught 
in the parish school are, reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, 
book-keeping, geography, Latin, Greek, and French. The school 
salary is the maximum ; the school fees average about L. 30, and 
the parochial schoolmaster has more than the legal accommodation. 
His other emoluments amount to L. 7, 13s. per annum. 

The expense of education per annum is asunder: reading, 10s.; 
reading and writing, 12s.; reading, writing, and arithmetic, 14s.; 
Latin, Greek, French, book-keeping, or geometry, L. 1. If En- 
glish grammar is taught with any of the above branches, 4s. addi- 
tional are charged. 

All are taught to read and most to write, and the people are 
generally alive to the benefits of education. 

There are several hamlets and farm-houses in Glenalmond, so 
distant from the parochial school as to derive little or no benefit from 
it. These are, first, Easter Lethendy, containing 8 persons; Green- 
field, 8 ; Wester Lethendy, 1 ; Mill Rodgie, 20 ; Meikle Downie, 
12; Little Downie, 18; Dalick, 35; Easter and Middle Fendoch, 
75 ; total 177. The distance of the nearest of these from the parish 
school is about three miles, and the children are sent to the school 
of Buchanty, situated in their immediate neighbourhood, but within 
the parish of Fowlis. To these must be added Newton, contain- 
ing 11 persons ; Curriemuckloch, 13; Dalmore, 10; Coynachan, 
5 ; Auchnafree, 20 ; total 59. The nearest to the parish school 
is Newton, distant about six miles. The children are sent for 
education to a school at Amulrie, distant from the nearest of 
them about one mile, and from others from five to seven miles. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons regularly 
receiving parochial aid is 7, at the rate of Is. per week, and five 
of these are either old or infirm females. Occasionally sums are 



280 



PERTHSHIRE. 



also distributed to others, who are not so destitute. The weekly 
collections made in the church, and the sums drawn for the use 
of the mortcloth ; and L. 12 of interest for a sum of money placed 
at the disposal of the kirk-session, for the benefit of the poor, — 
are, with the aid of private charity, found sufficient for their mainte- 
nance. The heritors, however, assess themselves annually in the 
sum of L. 21, 17s. for the support of a lunatic, in Murray's asylum, 
Perth, and two illegitimate children. There is, unquestionably, 
a reluctance on the part of the people to accept of parochial aid. 

Fair. — There was formerly a fair St Lawrence's held on the 
green of Monzie, on the 22d and 23d of August, for sheep and 
the ordinary articles of merchandise. The first day of the fair is 
still held at Monzie, for lambs, sheep, and cattle, but the second 
day of it has been transferred to Crieff, and is now reckoned one 
of its eight annual fairs. 

Alehouses. — There are three alehouses in the parish, — one in 
Monzie, and two in Gilmerton. 

Fuel. — The fuel is coal, peat, and wood. A ton of coal, brought 
from Bannockburn, a distance of twenty-five miles, costs L. 1. 
The same quantity from Dollar, distant twenty-four miles, costs 
15s. A cart load of peats upon the estate of Monzie, including 
cartage, is 3s., and the wood which is bought chiefly at sales is 
equally dear. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

That this parish has made equal advances in prosperity with 
other parts of the country, during the last forty years, we do not 
take upon us to assert ; but when we compare the present period 
with that in which the last Statistical Account was drawn up, we 
recognize a great improvement in its general condition. 

The present is distinguished beyond the former period by a 
more enlightened and judicious management of farming opera- 
tions, — an improved breed of cattle and sheep ; superior roads, a 
total abolition of smuggling, and, as a consequence, by a greater 
sobriety ; an improved style of living and dress ; and a more ge- 
neral diffusion of the blessings of education. 

The establishment of infant schools if one might hope for such 
where the population is so thinly scattered, with a library con- 
taining a judicious selection of books, calculated to instil sound 
principles and correct views on all subjects, would unquestionably 
go far to elevate and improve the moral and intellectual condition 
of the people.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH &amp; STIRLING. 

THE REV. THOMAS YOUNG, MINISTER. 



I._ToPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HlSTORY. 

Name.— Ga.sk, the name of the parish, is admitted to be a term 
of doubtful origin. Probably it is of Celtic derivation, and, ac- 
cording to the speculations of those acquainted with that language, 
may be regarded as compounded of two words, Ga or Gath, signi- 
fying a dart, and uisge water, thus Ga-uisge becomes Gask,— the 
signification being swift-running water; or it may be from Gu or 
Dhu-uisge, and will signify dark-running water,— an acceptation 
of the term which applies to the Earn passing along the south 
side of the parish. Others trace it to a Gaelic word signifying a 
hero or great man ; and others suppose it may have been applied 
to point out the residence of some distinguished individual render- 
ed famous in former times, when the numerous encampments in 
this parish and its vicinity were inhabited , 

Situation, Sfc. — It is nearly a square, each side of which is rather 
more than two English miles. A Roman causeway intersects the 
parish from east to west on the highest ground. The beautiful 
bank on the south side is divided into fertile fields, where the mo- 
dern system of agriculture has been, for the last twenty years, 
cultivated with success, the soil being partly clayey and partly 
loamy. 

The River Earn is the boundary on the south. On the bank 
extending to the north are extensive plantations, with corn-fields 
and pastures ; while a considerable part of this division of the pa- 
rish is bounded by a moss, which, notwithstanding the inroads made 
upon it by industrious farmers, still supplies the parishioners with 
peat for fuel. The Earn, which forms the boundary to the south, 
is a considerable river, though not navigable, the windings of which 
from the west to the east side of the parish are about three miles. 
It produces salmon, white and yellow trout, perch, flounders, pike, 
and eel. 



282 



PERTHSIIIRK. 



The parish produces wheat, barley, oats, pease, potatoes, 
turnips, sown and pasture grass. It supports itself with all kinds 
of grain, independent of considerable quantities which are sold, 
and there are more than 1200 acres of wood, consisting of larch, 
Scotch fir, oak, &amp;c. These woods abound with all sorts of game, 
such as hares, rabbits, pheasants, black-cock, partridges, wood- 
cock, snipes ; and roe-deer, foxes, otters, badgers, and wild-duck. 

Marl is found in different parts, with large beds of freestone and 
grey slate, which are quarried with little difficulty. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners, — James Blair Oliphant, Esq. of Gask, is the chief 
proprietor in the parish. His ancestors for many generations have 
resided on the property. His house is a large substantial building, 
erected in the beginning of the present century. In its vicinity are 
many large and beautiful old trees. A small portion of land to the 
east belongs to the Earl of Kinnoul, who, along with Mr Oliphant, 
is the only other heritor in the parish. 

Antiquities. — The Roman causeway, which extends through the 
parish, on the highest ground, is 20 feet broad, composed of rough 
stones, closely laid together. It points west to a Roman camp still 
distinguishable in the parish of Muthil, near the Chapel of Ease, 
at Ardoch, and east to another camp in the parish of Scone. By 
the side of this causeway, Roman stations are still visible, capable 
of containing from twelve to twenty men. They are enclosed by 
ditches, which are very distinct. Within Gask's policy, vestiges of 
two camps may still be traced, one on the south side, the other 
north of the Roman road or street, as it is called by the inhabitants. 
A few years ago, on one of these Roman stations, north of the 
causeway, a number of human bones were dug up, all entire, par- 
ticularly two skulls. The place from time immemorial has been' 
called the Witch Know, and the traditionary account is, that witches 
were burned there, and, as vestiges of coal- cinders are to be seen, 
the probability is that, some people were put to death on that emi- 
nence. In the same place was lately found a small urn, of coarse 
workmanship, which would contain about three English pints. It 
was about two feet and a half below the surface. 

Eminent Men. — Two individuals belonged to this parish, who 
have risen to high honours in the church, — the late Principal 
Taylor of Glasgow College, and Dr Stewart, minister of the parish 
of Newburgh, in Fife. More recently, a native of this parish, Mr 



GASK.

Laurence M'Donald, has been distinguished as a sculptor, particu- 
larly in making busts. ; 

Parochial Register. -The earliest date of the parochial register 
is the 10th of January 1669, and it ends 28th December 1679. 
Next volume commences 25th May 1703, and ends 20th July 
1744. Third volume begins 29th December 1756, and has been 
regularly kept since that time. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1811 was 433 
1821, 622 
1831, 428 

The decrease during the last ten years is owing to several te- 
nants being removed, in consequence of an enlargement of farms,— 
a want of employment for young men wlio go to large towns,— 
and the death of some aged' individuals whose houses are not now 
inhabited.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — All the land is cultivated except the 1200 acres 
under wood. Teeswater and Ayrshire cattle, Leicestershire sheep, 
with the common breed of horses, are reared throughout the pa- 
rish. The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 7s. per acre, and 
the length of leases generally nineteen years. Farm-steadings 
have of late been much improved. 

Prices. — As there is now but little encouragement for females to 
spin, many of them are employed in the labours of the field, and 
are paid 8d. per day. The wages of labourers in summer is Is. 
6d. per day, Is. 3d. in winter. Wrights, 2s. in summer, Is. 8d. in 
winter. Tailors, Is. 4d. with victuals. Masons, 2s. 2d. in sum- 
mer, Is. 8d. in winter. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets. — There is no market-town in the parish. Dunning and 
Methven are within four miles ; Auchterarder six ; and the large 



284 



PERTHSHIRE. 



market-town, Perth, only eight miles distant. Turnpike roads have 
been much improved ; but the roads which intersect the parish are 
far from being good. There is one village called Clathey, con- 
taining a population of 84 individuals. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is conveniently situated in the 
centre of the parish, somewhat more than a mile from the extre- 
mities. It was built in the year 1800, and is in good repair. It 
will accommodate nearly 400, — all free sittings. The manse was 
built in the same year, and, as the ground of the glebe is inferior to 
the former glebe, which was in the neighbourhood of Gask House, 
it is much larger, being nearly 20 acres. The stipend is L. 150 
per annum, of which L. 61, 17s. 8d. is paid by his Majesty's Ex- 
chequer. There is no chapel of any kind in the parish. There are, 
however, six families of Dissenters in the parish ; thirty-seven 
New Light Seceders. The rest of the inhabitants regularly at- 
tend the parish church, where divine service is uniformly perform- 
ed on the Lord's day, and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper 
dispensed twice in the year, the number of communicants being 
at present exactly 200. Collections made on particular occasions 
are seldom below L. 6, and seldom exceed L. ] 0 Sterling. 

Education. — There is no school but the parochial one in the 
parish. English reading, writing, arithmetic, and Latin are taught, 
at the following rate of fees; reading, 2s.; reading and writing, 2s. 
6d. ; arithmetic, 3s. ; Latin, 4s. per quarter. The people discover 
their regard for education, by generally sending their children to 
school, and as it is situated near the parish church, none are so 
far distant as to be unable to attend. The school may contain from 
60 to 70 scholars, and, the master, as to house and garden, has 
the legal accommodations, and the maximum salary, amounting to 
L. 34, 4s. 4±d. 

Library. — There is a parochial library, which was founded in 
1824. It is supported by the contributions of the subscribers, and 
at different times the Gask family has increased the number of 
books by valuable donations. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of individuals receiv- 
ing parochial aid is 6, and the average sum given is Is. 3d. week- 
ly, when they are able to go about and do something for their own 
support. Besides this weekly allowance, they are allowed supplies 
of coals and meal in winter. The poor in this parish are much 
indebted to the Gask family, who pay particular attention to their 
wants, and bestow liberal supplies. The amount of collections at

the church for last year was L. 17, 10s. 2d. The collections, with 
the interest of L. 280, under the management of the kirk-session, 
have hitherto supported the poor without any legal assessment. 

j nns  c —There are no inns or alehouses in the parish. 

Fuel— The fuel used is peat, coal, and wood. Peat costs about 
Is. per load ; coal 2d. per stone, and the price of wood sold by 
auction is regulated by the demand.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDEK, SYNOD OF PERTH &amp; STIRLING. 



J, Topography and Natural History. 

Figure, Boundaries, c— The parish of Auchterarder is 8 miles 
from south to north, and 3 miles from east to west. It inclines, in 
the form of a parallelogram, from the Ochil hills to the water of 
Earn, in a north-easterly direction. It is bounded by Blackford 
on the west ; Glendevon on the south ; Dunning on the east; and 
Trinity- Gask on the north. The greatest elevation is Craig- 
Rossie, one of the highest of the Ochils, which are 2359 feet above 
the level of the sea. To the west of this hill, the body of which 
runs north and south, there is a very striking chasm, commonly 
called the " Heuch of Coul." From the Ochils various rivulets 
come down, which meet in the Ruthven, a considerable stream, 
which nearly bisects the parish, and at the north-east extremity 
loses itself in the Earn. 

Climate. — The climate may be regarded as favourable. Crops 
are ripened earlier than in a more westerly direction, and not a 
week later than in the Lothians. The situation of the town is 
high, and more than ordinarily healthful. 

Geology. — Auchterarder rests upon a formation of old red sand- 
stone. In the lower part of the parish, this sandstone has an ar- 
gillaceous basis ; and is commonly called liver rock, thick in the 
post, and excellent for building. In the higher parts, it has a sili- 
ceous basis ; veins of mica slate traverse the rock, — rendering 
it very hard and frequently unworkable. Near the surface, in some

places, it becomes very micaceous, and schistose, in bands from one 
to four inches thick, furnishing fit material by its flatness for fences 
without lime. The strata seem generally to range 1 5° to the north- 
east, and to dip at an angle of 13°. 4'. Several trap dikes cross the 
parish, almost directly east and west Great isolated blocks seem 
to have been thrown up by some giant force, and lie piled upon 
each other. The direction of these masses is to every point in the 
compass, and dips with every inclination. The rock of sandstone 
at the side is highly indurated, very finely grained, bears evident 
marks of having been under the action of fire, and appears to have 
received, when in a state of fusion, much of the nature of the trap 
rock into its composition. Limestone is to be found in the upper 
part of the parish ; but it is not wrought on account of the distance 
from fuel. Attempts have been made to find coal, but without 
success. Agate, calcedony, and jasper, may be got in great 
abundance along the water-course at the base of the hill. 

Soil. — Boulders were of very frequent occurrence ; but, by the 
aid of gunpowder, and other means, they have been mostly forced 
to quit the field, and take their place in the fence. In the parish, 
there is a great variety of soil. The eastern part is sandy, the lower 
part inclines to clayey loam. The neighbourhood of the town ex- 
hibits a fine specimen of rich black loam. 

Zoology. — Roe-deer are frequently to be seen. A red deer may 
occasionally be observed crossing the parish, from the north, on its 
way, it is said, to enjoy the benefit of the salt water. The fox 
here finds a cover, and the otter a retreat. Wild ducks and some- 
times a wild goose, woodcock, and kingfisher, are the rarer spe- 
cies of our undomesticated animals. The horns of an " elk," 
found imbedded in the soil, render it probable that this species 
once existed in the parish. 

In the ponds at Damside, out of which marl was taken, leeches 
are to be found. During the greatest part of the year, they 
are never seen, and are supposed to lie buried in the slime ; but 
during the heat of summer, they come up in numbers to the margins 
of the different pools. They are of two kinds, — one which cannot 
possibly be got to draw blood ; another the genuine medical leech, 
Hirudo medicinalis. It is larger and more vigorous than those im- 
ported into this country, which may be accounted for, by its being 
taken directly from its native element, and not exhausted by con- 
finement and long carriage. This kind is preferred, by the people 
in the neighbourhood, to foreign leeches.

Botany.— It does not appear that there are many plants peculiar 
to this parish. Tussilago or colt's-foot is of frequent occurrence. 
Petasites or butter-bur grows in one place, larger than we have seen 
it in any other. Trefoil is plentiful in our meadows. The Orchis 
family seem to be natives of this parish. 

II. — Civil History. 
The earliest notice we have seen of Auchterarder is in a char- 
ter by Alexander II. in the year 1227, conveying the teinds of 
the King's revenue of the lands of Auchterarder to the Convent 
of Inchaffray. In 1328, King Robert Bruce granted a charter of 
the lands of Auchterarder to Sir William Montifix, Justiciar of 
Scotland, on the payment of a small sum, reserving the liberties of 
the burgh and burgesses, as they were in the reign of Alexander 
III. One of the daughters of Sir William, marrying Sir John 
Drummond, received as her fortune the barony of Auchterarder, 
which brought this property into the possession of the Drummond 
family, in which it continued until of late. In one of the books 
of Exchequer, entitled Liber Responsionum, 1576, there is this me- 
morandum : " Assignitto thebaillies of Octerardour the tent day 
of November, to compeir and mak comp, and to that effect bring 
with thame the copie of their last comp, with sic uther writtes as 
thai will use for making of thair seasance." This curious excerpt 
seems to countenance the opinion, that Auchterarder once enjoy- 
ed the privileges of a royal burgh. This is, however, rather a 
doubtful matter. On diligent search, it does not appear from the 
' Rolls of Parliament, that it was a royal burgh, when the act 1696, 
for the division of commons, was passed, in which was excepted the 
property of royal burghs, all there enumerated. 

Auchterarder was one of the Scottish towns ironically compared 
by George Buchanan with the fine English cities. Some English 
noblemen, boasting to King James of the properties of the English 
towns, the sarcastic Scot replied, that he knew a town in Scotland 
which had fifty draw-bridges, and which is afterwards described as 
a " country village between Stirling and Perth, called Auchterar- 
doch, where there is a large strand which runs through the middle 
of the town, and almost at every door there is a long stock or stone 
laid over the strand, whereupon they pass to their opposite neigh- 
bours, and when a flood comes they lift their wooden bridges in 
case they should be taken away, and these they call draw-bridges." 
— So goes the story. 

In the troublous times of 1715, Auchterarder appears to have 



288 



PERTHSHIRE. 



suffered severely, as shown by the subjoined interesting document, 
the original of which is to be found in the possession of the So- 
ciety of Antiquaries. 

It is almost needless to add, that the indemnification on that 
occasion proffered by the Pretender was never forthcoming ; whilst, 
on the other side, the reigning family did make compensation for 
the losses sustained by those who had neither personally nor by 
their friends been implicated in the rebellion. " Burning money," 
as it is called, was received by many. 

The family of Perth, to whom Auchterarder belonged, having 
forfeited their possessions, the Commission appointed to take 
charge of the annexed estates appears to have devoted much at- 
tention to Auchterarder. In 1778, a survey was made of the ba- 
rony by Mr Wigh, acting for the commissioners, and published by 
their authority. In this report, the inhabitants are described as 
" idle and poor, — farmers not thinking it necessary to thin their 
turnip while small, allowing them to grow until they be the size 
of large kail plants, and then it is thought a great loss to take 
them up, unless in small quantities, to give to the cow. A few 
tenants excepted, no family had oat-meal in their houses, nor 
could they get any. They eat nothing better than bear-meal and 

 ' BY THE KING, A DECLARATION. 

" James R. — Whereas it was absolutely necessary for our service and the public safe- 
ty, that the villages of Auchterarder and Blackford should be burnt and destroyed, to 
prevent the far greater inconveniences and hardships which must have ensued to our 
subjects, had our clemency and tenderness prevailed upon us to preserve these places. 
We were, therefore, at last, induced by the strongest motives, though with the greatest 
reluctancy and unwillingness, to give our orders for the effect above-mentioned, which 
we understand since have been put into execution. And in regard we came into 
this our ancient, kingdom with a sincere and first intention to ease and relieve all our 
subjects in general of the hardships and calamities which they have laboured under 
for these several years past; and being, therefore, most sensibly affected with the 
losses and sufferings of our good subjects, by the devastation of these villages, which 
justly moves our compassion and tenderness towards them ; and being, therefore, re- 
solved to make them suitable reparation for the damages they have sustained on this 
occasion, so as in the end they may be no losers thereby, It is therefore our will 
and pleasure, that all and sundry the persons concerned do immediately prepare esti- 
mates of their several losses and sufferings, and that they deliver the same in writ- 
ings to their several masters, so as we may order relief and reparation to be made to 
them for what losses and damages they have sustained in their houses, goods, furni- 
ture, and corns, or any other manner of way whatsoever. This we hope will be suf- 
ficient to convince them and all the world, of the tender regard we have for our sub- 
jects, and of the part we bear in all their sufferings. And we hereby charge and 
command the ministers of the several paroch churches of Auchterarder and Black- 
ford, publickly to read this our declaration to their several congregations, immediate- 
ly after divine service the two Sundays next after the date hereof, and copies hereof 
to be affixed on the church doors, so as all the people concerned may have due notice 

of this our intention towards them, and may, accordingly, reap the benefit thereof. 

Given at our Court at Scoon, this 26th day of January 1716, and in the fifteenth 
year of our reign, by his Majesty's command. — Signed Mar."

,, On this report, Lord Kaimes remarks, that he had twice visited 
Auchterarder, and made particular inquiries about it, and bears 
his testimony to the want of employment and distress of the people, 
and to the necessity of introducing manufactures, and establishing 
a weekly market. 

His Lordship speaks of one that sows clover, and mentions that a 
formal complaint had been entered before the sheriff against him by 
his neighbours, for causing them to herd after harvest, contrary to 
use and wont ; and engages, that, if this person should prevail on 
others to sow clover also, he should receive a reward from the 
Board. This Commission erected a granary to hold the unsold 
provisions of one market day until the next ; they gave houses, 
rent free, on condition of beginning and continuing the manufac- 
ture of linen. To this Commission we are disposed to ascribe the 
still rising state of Auchterarder. 

Plan of the Parish. — A plan or survey of Auchterarder, and 
some other parishes, was published in 1824, showing the length 
of the different roads, and their directions, and the names and 
localities of all the houses in the landward part of the parish. 

Parochial Records. — The records of the kirk-session have been 
kept with great accuracy. Those on baptisms, marriages, and 
burials, commence in 1661 ; those on discipline and poor's funds, 
in 1668. They amount to thirteen volumes, and the entries seem 
continuous. 

Land-owners. — Captain Hunter, Colonel Graeme, Earl of Cam- 
perdown, Patrick Brugh Smeaton, James Beveridge Duncan, John 
Malcolm, Peter Smitton, James Brugh, James Sheddan, John 
Mailer. 

Mansions. — Auchterarder House is the principal one in the pa- 
rish. It is an erection, in the Elizabethian style of architecture, 
built by Captain Hunter, who, a few years ago, purchased the 
estate of Auchterarder, and who is doing much to improve and 
beautify the place. 

Antiquities. — A little to the north of the town, there is a ruin re- 
ported to have been a hunting-seat of King Malcolm Canmore. 
As happens to many other pieces of antiquity, the romantic has been 
made to yield to the useful. A great part of this building has been 
torn down, to put up the offices of a neighbouring farm. The walls 
of the remaining corner display great strength of masonry ; they

are nine feet thick, and cemented so firmly that it is almost as dif- 
ficult to tear them asunder as to quarry the rock. Half a mile to the 
east of this, there are the remains of an old church, commonly cal- 
led Saint Mungo's, evidently an erection of Roman Catholic times. 
There is another ruin in the parish, the old church of Abruthven. 
This parish appears to have been united to Auchterarder, before 
the Reformation. The minister, however, of the united parishes 
continued to live in the manse of Abruthven, and often preached 
in that church. Here is the burial-place of the Dukes of Montrose. 
Their aisle is an elegant and chaste piece of architecture, surmount- 
ed by a well executed urn, which, seen from the public road, has a 
good effect. In this ducal mausoleum, raised upon pedestals, are 
five crimson-coloured coffins, decorated with plates and escutcheons. 
In the vault beneath, it is said there lies a long line of illustrious 
ancestors— men distinguished for arms and address, and for excel- 
lent endowments of body and mind.

Character of the Population. — The inhabitants of Auchterarder 
may be regarded as in circumstances of more than usual comfort 
The land is very much subdivided — many cultivating a great part 
of their own properties. Many have houses of their own, and keep 
a pig or perhaps a cow. On account of the distance from lime, 
most of the farmers in the neighbourhood are willing to let the 
people have as much land for potatoes, as they can supply with 
manure. By this means, the family with the whole establishment 
is supported year after year, with a principal article of food. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

Acres in rotation under the plough, 7176 
constantly waste or in pasture, 6571 

With the exception of about 150 acres on the banks of the 
Earn, and some rock and moss upon the hills, all might be culti- 
vated. Traces of the plough are perceptible in the highest parts ; 
but it has been thought more profitable to allow these uplands to 
remain permanently in pasture. 

Common. — There is a common of 228 acres, lying immediately 
to the west of the town. No one can tell how it came to be ap- 
propriated to its present use. From time immemorial, every one liv- 
ing in Auchterarder having a cow, has been in the habit of send- 
ing it to graze in the moor — quarrying stones, cutting turf, or appro- 
priating to himself out of the moor, whatever he thought proper, 
without leave asked or obtained from any. Sixty cows belonging to 
different persons in the town are annually sent to pasture ; and the 
houses are all built with stones taken free from the moor quarry. 
Attempts have been frequently made to effect the division of this 
common, — the proprietor of the barony of Auchterarder claiming 
a great part as his, — the portioners claiming their respective shares, 
—the feuars also insisting that they have a right of participation. 
The question has been repeatedly before the Court of Session. In 
the meantime, the moor is allowed to remain in its natural state, 
sending up a most luxuriant crop of furze and other indigenous 
productions. 

Wood.— 298 acres are planted, chiefly with larch and oak. No 
old wood is now standing in the parish, and little has been cut for 
sale, for many years. A tree is only felled when thinning is re- 
quired, or for some agricultural or domestic purpose. 

Rent of Land.— Average rent of arable land per acre, L. 1, 10s. 
Average rent of grazing a cow, L. 3.

Wages. — Agricultural labourers receive from Is. 6d. to 2s. a- 
day ; masons and carpenters and other mechanics, 14s. a-week. 

Live-stock. — The parish of Auchterarder, until of late, was very 
deficient in stock of cattle, and indifferent to the breed reared in it. 
A marked improvement in this respect is now visible. Cows of 
the Ayrshire breed for the dairy, and of the Teeswater for feed- 
ing, are universally sought. In the two hill farms which are in 
the parish, the description of stock raised is reckoned of a supe- 
rior kind. In the lower part, some attention has been given to the 
Leicester breed of sheep. 

Improvement of Land. — Draining has been carried to a great 
extent. Scarcely is there a field without its drain ; and in most 
places, draining might still be prosecuted with immense advantage. 
Captain Hunter may be mentioned as having by this means brought 
many patches of useless morass into a state of profitable tillage, 
or converted them into pleasure grounds. Much waste land has 
also recently been reclaimed, by embankments on the side of the 
Earn. These, however, are not always sufficient to guard off in- 
undations. It is said, that if a few cuts were made to render the 
course of the river less tortuous, the destruction of fields and of 
the labours of the husbandmen would often be averted. The 
farmers on the low lands complain bitterly of the numerous dam- 
dikes, which obstruct the natural course of the river. 

The farm-buildings, with few exceptions, are excellent, recent- 
ly erected and commodious. The enclosures are far from being 
good ; and in some parts, a fence of any description is never met 
with to impede the passage either of the wayfaring man, or the 
wandering quadruped. 

An agricultural Association has existed in the parish for upwards 
of twenty years It has an annual ploughing-match, when eight 
premiums are awarded. Considerable doubts are entertained con- 
cerning the advantages of this Society, and it is not kept up with 
very much spirit.

Manufactures.— The trade of Auchterarder consists mostly in 
the weaving of cotton, supplied from Glasgow. There are upwards 
of 500 looms in the parish. Malting is carried on to a considerable 
extent. There are four malt barns, in one of which 7644 bolls of 
malt are annually made. On the water of Ruthven, there are 
13 mills or manufactories on a small scale ; grain-mills 4 ; lint- 
seed oil-mills 2 ; flax-mills 2 ; a saw-mill; a paper-mill ; a fulling- 
mill ; a woollen manufactory of shawls and blankets and similar 
materials. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

In Auchterarder there is a weekly market, held on Saturday. 
It is the principal mart in the district ; and business to a conside- 
rable extent is done in grain. 

Fairs. There are 6 fairs annually held here, one on the last 

Tuesday of March ; one on the day after Amulree, which is on 
the first Tuesday and Wednesday of May ; one in each of the 
harvest months, the Friday before the Falkirk trysts, principally 
with the view of allowing the people in this district, who may wish to 
buy stock, an opportunity of the cattle passing to Falkirk ; and one 
on the 6th of December, when, besides cattle, the current ac- 
counts of the year for lime and other articles required in rural and 
domestic economy are usually settled. 

Means of Communication.— There is a daily post by the way of 
Crieff. The Perth and Glasgow coaches pass daily through the 
town. There are carriers who go every week to Glasgow, Edin- 
burgh, Perth, and Stirling. The turnpike road extends six miles 
in the parish. 

Villages. — The only village of note is Smithyhaugh, recently 
sprung up. It is distant two miles and a half to the east of Auch- 
terarder. It is pleasantly situated on the banks of the Ruthven ; 
its trade is chiefly weaving from Glasgow. The population of the 
district amounts to 638. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church stands in the mid- 
dle of the town of Auchterarder, which is on the north-west 
corner of the parish. It was rebuilt in the year 1784. In 1811, 
the front wall was removed out, the old roof supported by a 
cross beam, and 360 sittings added. The church now contains 



294 



PERTHSHIRE. 



930 sittings, and is in a state of good repair. There are two other 
places of worship in the parish,— one Relief, and one United Se- 
cession. The Relief can accommodate 583; sittings let, 433, unlet 
150. The Secession can accommodate 500; sittings let, 250, 
unlet, 250. Many who attend the dissenting meeting-houses come 
from other parishes. Of the inhabitants of Auchterarder, young 
and old, 593 belong to the Relief, of whom 342 have seats taken, 
and 315 are communicants. The attendance at the Secession meet- 
ing-houses is as follows : Auchterarder, 366, of whom 234 have 
sittings taken, and 226 are communicants; Dalreoch, 39, of 
whom 17 have seats rented, and 20 are communicants ; Kinkell, 
35, of whom 23 have seats rented, and 18 are communicants ; 
16 persons attend Dunning. There are 13 Episcopalians, who go 
to Muthil ; 8 Methodists, who go to Perth ; and 2 Roman Ca- 
tholics, who attend at Crieff.

The greater part of the seats in the parish church are occupied by 
proprietors or their tenants, by whose favour the people of the town 
obtain admission to a place in the house of God, — a very disagreeable 
mode of tenure, and often made an excuse for persons absenting 
themselves from public worship. No preference seems given to 
parishioners. Several pews and sittings are held by persons from 
other parishes. A petition was lately given in to the presbytery, 
numerously signed, complaining of the want of church accommo- 
dation, and praying to be directed how this might be obtained in 
connection with the national church. 

The stipend of the minister of Auchterarder is, meal, 5 chal- 
ders ; barley, 5 chalders ; money, L. 52 ; communion elements, 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. The extent of the glebe is 5 acres ; its value L. 20. 

The stipend of the Relief minister is L. 115; of the Secession, 
L. 100. They have both houses from their congregations. 

Benefactions. — The most interesting benefactor of late years in 
the parish was John Sheddan, Esq. of Lochie. This singular person 
deposited in the hands of the kirk-session, in the course of several 
years, L. 61 1. His beneficence was not confined to any one class of 



AUCHTERARDER. 



295 



persons, or mode of distribution, it extended itself to all who were 
recommended to his compassion, or whom he knew personally to 
be in indigent circumstances ; with his own hand, he is known to 
have distributed in various sums L. 850. Nor was Mr Sheddan's 
charity confined to the physical wants of the poor, — he aimed at a 
nobler object, — the instruction of the mind, and the salvation of 
the soul. That the education of the poor might not be neglect- 
ed, in the year 1811, he erected a school-house, and endowed it 
with adjacent land to the value of L. 1000 ; and that the heathen 
as well as his own countrymen might be sharers in his beneficence, 
he gave L. 200 to the Foreign and British Bible Society. Mr 
Sheddan died in 1831. 

Education. — There are seven schools in the parish, two of which 
are taught by females. There is a parish school, the teacher of 
which has the maximum salary, and the legal accommodation. 
His class fees amount to about L. 40 per annum ; his other 
emoluments, though multifarious, are but trifling in amount. 
There is the school built by John Sheddan, and endowed with the 
interest of L. 1000, on condition of teaching twelve poor children 
gratis. The school in Smithyhaugh was built by public subscrip- 
tion, is under the management of a committee of individuals resi- 
dent in the place, and held rent free by the teacher. The other 
schools are all on the private adventure of their respective teachers. 
The branches taught are, reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keep- 
ing, mathematics, geography, Latin, French, Greek. In those 
taught by females, there is also needle-work and music. The 
" school fees vary in the different schools ; in the parish school, per 
quarter, reading, 2s. 6d. ; writing, 3s. ; arithmetic, geography, and 
grammar, 3s. 6d. ; mathematics, book-keeping, Latin, and French, 
5s. There are at their education during some part of the year, 
587, of whom 307 are boys, and 280 girls ; of these, 40 are under 
five years of age ; 383 are learning writing, arithmetic, or the higher 
branches of education. We do not think there are any above six 
years of age who cannot read, and very few grown up who cannot 
write. We would say that the people are generally alive to the 
benefits of education. 

We have a mechanics' institute, in which lectures are deliver- 
ed to mechanics, during the winter months, on literary, and scien- 
tific, and moral subjects ; attendance 80 ; admittance for the season 
Is. 6d. 

Friendly Societies. — Friendly societies in this parish are fast 



29ti 



PERTHSHIRE. 



sinking into decay. Formerly there were five, with a great num- 
ber of members ; but, partly on account of the kirk-session refus- 
ing to aliment some of the members, and partly because persons 
in better circumstances reckoned it rather a degradation to take 
the funds, a disposition has generally prevailed to dissolve the so- 
cieties and divide the stock, and year after year has this been ef- 
fected. One only is now existent, the Weavers' Society, instituted 
in 1781. It has 161 members, and a capital of L. 450. A mo- 
tion has also been made for its dissolution. 

Poor Funds. — Parochial relief is afforded to 22 regular pau- 
pers : sixteen receive Is. weekly ; five, Is. 6d. ; one, 2s. ; ten of 
the regular paupers receive L. 1 yearly for rent ; five of them 10s. ; 
five, not regular paupers, receive yearly for their rent, L. I. Dis- 
tributed in occasional charities, L. 47, 14s. 8d. Total annual 
amount for the support of the parish, L. 131, 16s. 8d. This ex- 
penditure is met by collections at the church door, L. 59, lis. 3d. ; 
interest on mortified funds, L. 23 ; annual assessment, L. 50. 
This last mode of supporting the poor has been recently introdu- 
ced into this parish. 

Inns. — There are in the parish 23 public-houses; 21 in Auch- 
terarder, and 2 in Smithyhaugh, — in which spirits and ales are 
sold. The policy of the Justices, for some time, has been to di- 
minish the number of these, by withholding license, as much as 
possible, from persons wishing to begin business in this line, and 
withdrawing it from those who have been guilty of any gross misde- 
meanour. 

Fuel. — Coal is the principal fuel used. It is generally laid down 
at the door at the rate of 8d. per cwt. The Glendevon turnpike 
has greatly lowered the price of coal in Auchterarder. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the time of last report, Auchterarder has kept pace with 
the general improvement which has been going on in the kingdom. 
In the town, old foundations have been erased, and buildings of 
very superior appearance and comfort erected in their stead. In 
the country, a much better system of husbandry prevails, princi- 
pally by the increase of green crop, and the feeding of cattle of 
a superior breed. 

Water. — In former Accounts of Auchterarder, the want of water 
seems uniformly to have been stated as the greatest deficiency. 
This defect has been abundantly supplied. In 1832, mainly by 
the kind and scientific exertions of Captain Aytoun, a spring, nine 



BLACKFORD. 



297 



feet above the level of the town, has been made to pour in 72 gal- 
lons, every minute, of the most excellent water, which has been 
taken into many houses ; and baths have been fitted up in some,— 
the water supplying not only the necessaries but even the luxuries 
of life. 

Few things would tend more to improve the general appearance 
of the country than the planting of Craig Rossie. This hill pro- 
jects considerably from the other Ochils, and, covered with wood, it 
would present an object strikingly grand and picturesque. The 
erection of a church at Smithyhaugh or Abruthven would be most 
beneficial to that district, which seems naturally formed to have a 
distinct pastoral superintendence. The people themselves could 
not support a clergyman ; but we fondly anticipate that, at no 
distant date, something will be done to assist them in this. 

We cannot conclude this Account, without referring to the im- 
portant law-suit on the power of the veto with which Auchterarder 
has been long connected. In the future histories of our church, 
Auchterarder will be noticed as having first entered the lists, and 
fought the battle for all Scotland in defence of the laws of the 
church, and the rights of the people.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JOHN CLARK, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — If the name be not altogether English, it may, per- 
haps, be traced to the Gothic word fort, singifying not only a 
strait or firth, but also a road or passage. Some probability is given 
to this derivation by the circumstance of the parish being situated 
between the great vales of Strathallan and Strathearn, and conse- 
quently forming the line of communication between them. 

Situation, Extent, fyc. — It lies midway between Perth and Stir- 
ling, and is intersected by the great road between them. Its 
length from north to south is about 10 miles. It is bounded on the 
south by the water of Devon, and by the river of Earn on the 
north. Its breadth is about 5 miles ; it is bounded by the parish- 



298 



PERTHSHIRE. 



es of Auchterarder and Trinity- Gask on the east, and by those 
of Muthil and Dunblane on the west. 

Soil. — In such extent of surface, the soil is necessarily varied. 
The south part of the parish is traversed by the Ochil hills, and 
affords good pasture for sheep. The middle is formed by the ex- 
tensive moor of Tullibardine, which is covered with young planta- 
tions. The northern part consists of rich and well-cultivated lands. 

Climate. — The climate corresponds with the high elevation of the 
land above the level of the sea. The prevailing winds are those from 
the west. Rains in summer, and snow showers in winter, are more 
frequent than in the lower surrounding districts. The difference, 
however, is not so great as to cause any peculiarity in the produc- 
tions of the earth ; or in the kinds of animals to be found ; or in the 
constitution and health of the inhabitants. 

Rivers. — Beside the rivers Devon and Earn, at the south and 
north extremities of the parish, there are three others of inferior 
size, — the Madrany, which rises in the hilly part of the parish of 
Muthil, and falls into the Earn at Kingkell, — the Ruthven and 
the Allan, which both take their rise in Gleneagles. The first is 
but a small stream, and runs eastward through the parish of Auch- 
terarder till it falls into the Earn. For three miles of its course, 
it runs through Kincardine Glen, a place of great natural beauty, 
— its high banks being broken with small cascades, and all covered 
with fine copsewood of oak, hazel, and birch. The Allan too, is 
here but a small stream. It runs to the west, through the adjoin- 
ing parish of Dunblane, and falls into the Forth below Stirling Bridge. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The landed property in the parish principally 
belongs to James Moray, Esq. of Abercairney ; and to Lords 
Strathallan and Camperdown. What does not belong to them is 
the property of three other individuals. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish records extend back to 1738, 
and have been regularly kept since that period. 

Antiquities. — There are not many vestiges of antiquity to be 
found here. From the immediate vicinity, however, of the cele- 
brated Roman encampment at Ardoch, there are several traces 
of military works and adventures. There are three places where 
entrenchments are still so evident as to leave no doubt of their 
having been used as out-posts to the Ardoch station. And the 
situation of all the three is well chosen for local defence, for mu- 
tual communication, and for extensive survey. In different other 



BLACKFORD. 



299 



places, there are also many tumuli or cairns, showing the frequency 
of conflict between the natives and their Roman invaders. In some 
places, the strife must have been evidently great ; as the cairns 
stand close to one another, and are ranged in a semicircular form, 
showing how orderly the combatants stood, how closely they fought, 
and how closely they fell. Beside these, there are two other re- 
mains of ancient warfare. These are the ruins of Kincardine and 
of Ogilvy Castle. Their situation indicates that these castles 
had been reared for defence, and great strength of masonry was 
employed in their structure. 

There are also a few vestiges of antiquity of another descrip- 
tion. These are the ruins of two chapels, the one at Glen- 
eagles, and the other at Tullibardine. The date of the one 
is not ascertained ; the other was built in the fifteenth cen- 
tury. At Tullibardine also, may be seen a few thorn trees that 
may be viewed with a kind of antiquarian interest. They are thus 
referred to in Pittscotie's History : " James the Fourth was fond 
of ship- building, and built the Michael, the largest ship ever seen 
before. She was 240 feet long, 36 feet within the sides, which 
were 1 0 feet thick ; she was a year in building, and took up all 
the oak wood of Fife, except Falkland ; she had 300 mariners, 
and carried altogether about 1000 men. Her length and breadth 
is planted in hawthorn at Tullibardine by the wright that helped to 
make her." Only three of these trees now survive the ravages of 
time and the encroachments of the plough, so that, like every other 
human memorial, they have long ceased to answer the purpose 
which the planter intended. 

III. — Population. 
In the year 1811 the population amounted to 1666. In 1821, 
it amounted to 1892, and 1831 to about the same number. The 
number of females exceeds that of males by two. 674 of the in- 
habitants reside in the village, where they are employed as weavers, 
day-labourers, and mechanics. 

Number of families in the parish, - - - 3'.4 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 91 

in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 140 

IV. — Industry. 
Wages. — According to times and circumstances, the wages vary 
from Is. to 2s. a-day ; Is. 6d. may be taken as a fair average. Those 
inhabitants not resident in the village are scattered over a wide 
extent of country, and employed chiefly in agricultural pursuits. 
Within the last fifteen years, the industry and skill of the peo- 



300 PERTHSHIRE. 

pie, especially in agriculture, have rapidly improved. Much waste 
land has been cultivated, and what was formerly under cultivation 
is now managed in a more skilful manner. Manufactures have 
improved correspondingly in the same period, — especially a ma- 
nufactory of coarse woollen cloths, which contains a good deal of 
machinery, and gives employment to seventy or eighty individuals. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There are two markets held here yearly, but those held at the 
neighbouring town of Auchterarder render them of little import- 
ance. The roads, both public and private, are good, and inter- 
course between different places is easily maintained. The dif- 
ferent turnpike roads extend about twenty miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish is within the bounds of the 
presbytery of Auchterarder. The church is so situated as to ac - 
commodate the more populous part of the parish, but inconve- 
niently for the more distant quarters. It was built in the year 
1738, and was lately repaired. It contains seating for 500 per- 
sons, who pay no seat rent whatever. There is no other place of 
worship -of any description in the parish. 

The manse was built about eighty years ago, and was repaired 
within the last fifteen. The glebe consists of 24 acres of very 
light gravelly soil ; and the stipend, as lately modified, consists of 
12 chalders of meal, 2 chalders of barley, and L. 30 in money. 

School. — The schoolmaster has the highest legal salary, and good 
accommodation both in dwelling-house and school-house. The 
usual branches of education are taught, and taught so cheap as 
to render education attainable by all. The school fees vary from 
2s. to 4s. a quarter, according to the branches taught. There are 
three other schools in different parts of the parish, supported by 
those who attend. 

Poor and Poor's Funds. — The number of poor on the public 
funds seldom exceeds 10 or 12. To support these and other in- 
digent and industrious persons, who require occasional assistance, 
a sum varying from L. 80 to L. 100 is annually distributed. This 
money is collected at the church doors, and by contributions from 
the non-resident heritors. There is certainly less reluctance to be- 
come pensioners on this charitable fund, than there was shewn in 
former times, and there is an increasing indisposition on the part 
of natural relations to assist one another. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There have been many and great improvements in the parish, 



MUCKART 



301 



within the last twenty years. The chief of these has been the for- 
mation of roads, which has opened new channels for intercourse, 
and supplied new means and motives for improvement. With 
the improvement of the soil, the circumstances and habits of the 
people have also improved. They have become more industrious, 
more temperate, more alive to the comforts and conveniences of 
life, and more anxious to employ means by which these may be 
procured.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH &amp; STIRLING. 

THE REV. JAMES THOMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundary, c— The name of the parish has been writ- . 
ten in various ways. The most ancient way appears to have been 
Mucard, the more recent Muckhart, and the modern Muckart. 
It is obviously derived from the Gaelic words " Muc" a wild 
boar, and " gart," the head, or " ard" high ; alluding, as some 
suppose, to the shape of the hill terminating above the Yetts 
of Muckart, which, from one point of view in the parish, is suppos- 
ed to bear some resemblance to a boar's head ; or, according to 
others, to its being in ancient times infested by the wild boar. The 
shape of the parish is triangular. Its greatest length in a straight 
line, from east to west, is about 4£ miles, and its greatest breadth, 
from north to south, about 2 miles : altogether it may contain about 
6 square miles. The Devon forms its principal boundary, sepa- 
rating it, with the exception of one farm, from the parish of Fosso- 
way, on the south and east. On the north and west, it is separated 
respectively, by two small streams, from the parishes of Glendovan 
and Dollar. 

Topographical Appearances. — A branch of the Ochils, running 
east and west, lies along the northern boundary of the parish, and 
is terminated on the east by a conical shaped hill, called Sea Mab, 



302 PERTHSHIRE. 

which is about 1350 feet above the level of the sea. The whole 
noVe of the Ochils in the parish is covered with grass, mingled 
with a little heather, and forms excellent pasturage for sheep. 1 he 
course of the Devon, for some distance above the Rumbling Bridge, 
presents a remarkable appearance; a passage being apparently cut 
for it through the solid rock. In some parts of the fissure, on the 
lower portion of the rock, there are manifest traces of the action 
of running water ; but higher up, the rock is rough, bearing the ap- 
pearance, in many places, of having been rent asunder And as 
the level of the country at the Crook of Devon is such that, with a 
very little labour, the whole of the stream might be thrown into 
Lochleven, some who are fond of geological speculation have sup- 
posed that the fissure had been opened by some convulsive 
movement of the earth, and after the water had found a pas- 
sage through, it gradually deepened it by wmtery torrents, un- 
til it reached the present level. In this fissure occurs the na- 
tural curiosity usually termed the « Devil's Mill." The water, in 
falling the height of some feet into a cauldron, is generally sup- 
posed to strike against a loose block of stone, which occasions it 
to emit a sound bearing some resemblance to that of a common 
grinding mill. And from the circumstance of the sound being con- 
stantly heard, on Sabbath, as well as other days, it has acquired its 
present name. The whole appearance of the fissure is very re- 
markable, the water forcing its way a little above the mill through 
a crevice of considerable length, and scarcely six feet in breadth. 

Meteorology.— In the upper parts of the parish, from its eleva- 
tion above the level of the sea, the climate is considerably colder 
than in the lower parts adjoining to Dollar ; the difference of level 
being not much short of 400 feet. And as, in addition, the hills 
attract a great deal of moisture, the harvest in general is consider- 
ably later. The quantity of rain that falls at the Yetts must be very 
great, as the clouds may often be seen travelling along the face 
of the hill, and depositing their moisture, when, at the distance 
of half a mile from it, all is sunshine. And as these clouds in 
general draw to one point, Sea Mab, and thence proceed along 
the Ochils to Milnathort, or diverge to the Cleish Hills, on the 
opposite side of the vale, its neighbourhood gets a goodly share 
of almost every passing shower. Unfortunately there is no rain- 
gage to estimate the amount that falls, nor, as far as has been 
discovered, has any record been kept by any of the parishioners 

4 



MUCKART.

of the variations of the thermometer or barometer, or other at- 
mospherical phenomena. 

Hydrography. — The only stream of consequence in the parish 
is the Devon, which has rather a remarkable course. Rising toward 
the west of the N Ochils in the parish of Blackford, it flows at first 
in an eastern direction for nine or ten miles, then southerly for 
about five, when, after passing the Crook, it turns nearly due west, 
and after a further run of fourteen or fifteen miles, empties itself 
into the Forth above Alloa, about five or six miles from its source. 
Its depth varies very much, according to the season, and accord- 
ing to the inclination of its bed. In most places, it may be forded 
with safety, unless during a flood ; but at the same time, it con- 
tains a number of very deep pools, which it has cut out in its im- 
petuous course. It is rather rapid, so long as it skirts this parish ; 
but after leaving it, and especially when it reaches the carse grounds, 
it becomes very sluggish, and presents little that is attractive in its 
appearance. 

Being in many places confined in a narrow bed, and descend- 
ing from a high to a low level, the Devon, while it bounds the pa- 
rish, presents many falls, and much natural beauty. While pas- 
sing the fissure above the Rumbling Bridge,, to which allusion 
has already been made, the whole of its course for half a mile may 
be termed a succession of rapids. In some places, it may be seen 
bounding from rock to rock; storming at being confined within such 
narrow limits, and tumbling into some rounded basin to wind its 
way out to encounter some further turmoil. And at others, it may 
be seen through the overhanging wood, at a great depth below, 
indicating its existence by the whitened spray upon its surface. 
When viewed from the parapet of the Rumbling Bridge, the sce- 
nery beneath, on both sides, is such as is not often to be met with. 
Raised considerably more than 100 feet'above the level of the stream, 
the passenger beholds it confined within two vast walls of solid 
rock, forcing its darksome way to the comparative calm and quietude 
of the scene below. After leaving the Rumbling Bridge, the 
Devon, in its course for nearly a mile, is rather smooth. But 
then it presents a very uncommon appearance. It suddenly pre- 
cipitates itself, by a fall of 30 feet, into a cauldron from which, 
when the water is not flooded, there is apparently no outlet. The 
shape of the cauldron is circular, and the fall of water causes it to 
boil as if some vast furnace were highly heated beneath. From

this cauldron, by an unseen communication, it glides into a second ; 
from this second, in a similar manner, into a third ; and finally, in- 
to a fourth ; when at last, in one body, by a fall of 44 feet, it reach- 
es the open space below it. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rock that prevails in the upper 
part of the parish, is trap or whinstone. Near the banks of the De- 
von, at the Vicar's Bridge, there are some strata of ironstone, lime- 
stone, and sandstone or freestone ; and in the west end of the pa- 
rish, there is a bed of coal. The ironstone is wrought on the Fosso- 
way side of the Devon, and is esteemed a very rich ore. On the 
Muckart side, however, it is not wrought, owing to the want of a 
proper level to carry away the water. The limestone in the parish 
is occasionally wrought by the proprietors for their own use, but not 
for sale ; there being abundance of limestone in the neighbourhood. 
The coal occurs in the shape of a basin, fully half a mile in length, 
by as much in breadth. There are a number of seams, but only 
one is wrought ; from which, some thousand tons are taken annual- 
ly, and carried principally to the western part of Strathearn. In 
both the ironstone and limestone, a number of fossil remains oc- 
curs, principally shells. Some rather pretty specimens of rock 
crystal are occasionally found, in quarrying trap for road metal. 
In the upper part of the parish, a number of rolled blocks occurs, 
composed generally of trap, but occasionally of sandstone, of con- 
siderable magnitude, — although there is no sandstone rock in the 
neighbourhood, but what is at least 200 feet lower. The soil in 
the upper part of the parish is in general light and gravelly, con- 
joined occasionally with moss, and, if not resting upon rock, rest- 
ing upon sand or gravel. Farther west, the soil becomes more re- 
tentive ; and on the banks of the Devon, in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of Dollar, in the lower part of the parish, it approaches 
more nearly to sand. 

Zoology. — No rare animals occur in the parish, and the only cir- 
cumstance worth mentioning is the fact, that the same species as the 
Lochleven trout is in some solitary instances found in the Devon. 
Some have attempted to account for this, by the supposition, that 
some of the small tributaries of the Devon and other streams that 
flow into the loch, may, in very moist weather, be so connected in 
certain situations, that the small trout from the one may find their 
way into the other. Sometimes the trout in the Devon attain to a 
great size. One was caught lately, with the common fly, which 
measured 22 inches in length, and weighed about 7 pounds.

II. — Civil History. 
Accounts of the Parish.— The only ancient document of which 
the writer is aware, that gives any information relative to the 
parish, is Martin's History of the See of St Andrews, written in 
1683, and printed 1797; from which it appears that the greater 
part of the parish, styled in the Golden Charter of the See of St 
Andrews, Muckartshire, was given to the Archbishop by James 
III. ; that the house of Castleton was built by Archbishop Lam- 
berton in 1320 ; and that, in 1490, Archbishop William, striving to 
gain the Earl of Argyle to take part with him against the Archbi- 
shop of Glasgow, disponed and feued out to him the Lordship of 
Muckartshire, for a feu-duty of L. 101 Scots. In his possession the 
greater part of the parish remained for a considerable time. Part 
appears, from the date of the charters, to have been feued off in 
1500, and part in 1564; and now, the whole has fallen into the 
hands of different proprietors. In 1644, every house in the pa- 
rish, including the church, with the exception of one or two at 
the eastern extremity, was burned by the Marquis of Montrose, 
when he sacked and destroyed Castle Campbell, at that time be- 
longing to the Earl of Argyle. In remembrance of his barbarous 
inroad, the pass in Glendovan, by which he entered the parish, 
still bears the name of the Mandrose Yetts, obviously Montrose 
Yetts. 

Land-oivners. — The land-owners in the parish who have more 
than L. 100 Scots valuation are, Mr Haig of Blairhill ; Dr Paton 
of Middleton ; Miss Bruce of Castleton ; Mr Renny of Balilish ; 
and Dr M'Turk of Middlehall. The remaining heritors amount 
in number to 15. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial register from 1698 to 
1743, containing an account of sessional discipline, proclamations, 
and collections and distribution of the poor's fund, appears to have 
been remarkably well kept. From 1787 to the present day, there 
is also a full account of all sessional proceedings, but none from 
1743 to 1787. There is a separate register of baptisms from 1698 
to the present day, and another of proclamations from 1800. In 
addition to the above, there is a small volume of sessional proceed- 
ings from 1678 to 1695, very difficult to be deciphered. 

Antiquities. — The only antiquity in the parish, worth mention- 
ing is the remains of the old house at Castleton, built by Arch- 
bishop Lamberton, in 1320. It appears, from some foundation 
stones lately taken up, to have been a building of considerable size.

From the house down to a small stream flowing past it,there are the 
remains of a covered way, as if indicating, from the means em- 
ployed to reach the water in safety, that in these troublous times 
it was occasionally converted into a place of defence. All that 
now remains is apparently a small part of a turret or corner of the 
building. Several stone coffins have, from time to time, been found 
in different parts of the parish ; but there seems to have been 
nothing about them worthy of notice. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish, according to Dr Webster's account 

in 1755, was 535 
1 792, 526 
1801, 538 
1811, 540 
1821, 704 
1831, 617 
1833, 664 

The last census was taken by the present incumbent, and in- 
cluded 324 males and 340 females. 

From the above it will appear that there is a considerable de- 
crease in the population between 1821 and 1831. This may be 
accounted for from the circumstance, that, at the first of these pe- 
riods, very considerable improvements were going on at Blairhill 
and Balruddery, which required an additional number of labourers ; 
and, moreover, a distillery in the parish was then in active opera- 
tion, which has now been given up.

The people, upon the whole, appear to enjoy in a reasonable 
degree the comforts and advantages of society ; and the only great 
subject of regret is the number of public-houses which, for a po- 
pulation of 664, amount to 13, and exert an unfavourable influ- 
ence on the morals of some of the people.

Rent of Land. — Rent of arable ground per acre, L. 1 to L. 3, 
average, L. 1, 5s. Rent of grazing per ox or cow, L. 3 to L. 4 ; 
per ewe or sheep, 4s. to 6s. 

Rate of Wages. — Labourer's wages per day, Is. 6d. ; mason's 2s. 
to 2s. 3d. ; wright's, 2s. 

Husbandry. — Little attention was paid, until of late, in im- 
proving the breeds of cattle and sheep. The short-horn breed 
of cattle has, however, been introduced by one enterprising pro- 
prietor, along with the Leicester and Southdown sheep, and, 
from his success, others seem disposed, in some degree, to 
imitate his example. Various improvements in the land have 
been carried on with great spirit. Mr Haig of Blairhill has com- 
pletely changed the aspect of his part of the parish ; and there 
can be little doubt that his improvements have been as profitable 
as ornamental. The improvements on the property of the moor, 
belonging to Mr Mowbray, have excited general attention, from 
the rapidity with which they were carried on, and the remark- 
able success which has attended them. It appears that, with- 
in three years, he has built stone dikes of more than nine miles 
in length, lipped and pointed with lime ; planted upwards of 
700 chain of hedges, and laid about the same length of drains, as 
well as trenched upwards of 100 acres of ground with the spade. 
It is impossible, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the parish, 
to give any statement of the average gross amount of raw produce 
raised in it. From the high rent got for grass parks, the great 
object of the proprietors, in the upper part of the parish, is to lay 
down their ground for permanent pasture in the best condition. This 
induces them, from time to time, to lift some fields, when the grass 
has become deteriorated, and take a rotation of crops : which leads 
to such an uncertainty as to the gross amount of produce, as would 



308 



PERTHSHIRE. 



set all calculation at defiance. The total rental of the parish, 
however, as nearly as can be ascertained, may be about L. 4250. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — Alloa, which is about ten miles distant from 
the centre of the parish, is properly the market and post-town, al- 
though there is a penny-post to Dollar, which is about seven miles 
nearer. 

Means of Communication. — There may be about six miles of 
turnpike road in the parish, — one line stretching from Dollar to a 
bridge over the Devon, on the road to Milnathort ; and another 
from the Rumbling Bridge to about a mile up Glendovan. One 
coach from Glasgow to Perth passes through the parish daily, and 
another from Edinburgh to Crieff three times a week. The num- 
ber of bridges in the parish over the Devon is four, all in good 
repair. The first is on the road from the Yetts to Milnathort ; 
the second at Fossoway Church ; — the third is the Rumbling 
Bridge, on the new road from the south ; — and the fourth the 
Vicar's Bridge, on the old county road from the south, about 
two miles east from Dollar. At the Rumbling Bridge, before the 
present arch was built, there was one beneath it, at about 86 feet 
above the stream, which still is allowed to remain, and adds much 
to the effect of the scenery when viewed from below. It was very 
narrow, and had no parapet, which must have made it very dan- 
gerous at any time, and particularly at night. The Vicar's Bridge 
is supposed to derive its name from an event that took place at 
the commencement of the Reformation. It was there where the 
Vicar of Dollar, who had embraced the Protestant faith, met with 
an untimely end from the hands of his persecutors. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated to the north-east 
of the principal village called the Pool, very conveniently for the 
villagers, but not equally so for those residing in the west end 
of the parish. It appears to have been built since the Roman Ca- 
tholic times, as the font stone is used to form part of the front 
wall. The following dates are cut on stone in different parts of 
the building— 1620, 1699, 1715, 1789,— which, as far as can be 
ascertained, indicate that the church was rebuilt at the first of 
these periods ; got a thorough repair at the second, when the first 
active Presbyterian clergyman was settled after the Revolution ; 
was again repaired at the third ; and was partly rebuilt and re- 
paired at the last. At present, it is rather ruinous, and not suffi- 
cient for accommodating the population in connection with the Es- 



MUCKART. 



309 



tablished Church. The consequence is, that many of the young 
people remain at home, and others make it an excuse for irregu- 
lar attendance. The number of communicants at present is more 
than that of the regular seats in the church. 

The manse is newly built, at an estimate of L. 600, is very 
commodious, and does credit to the contractors. The glebe con- 
tains 10 acres 1 rood, and may be worth about L.20 per an- 
num. The stipend is L. 150, part of which is paid by the Exche- 
quer. There is one meeting-house in the parish, connected 
with the United Associate Synod. The present incumbent, it is 
understood, in addition to a manse and a valuable glebe of 13 
acres, has L. 100 per annum, paid partly from the seat rents, and 
partly by collections at the church doors. The number of fa- 
milies connected with the Establishment is 89, including 438 in- 
dividuals. The parishioners connected with the Secession church 
amount to 226. Their meeting-house contains sittings for about 
360, and of these there are about 285 let. Divine worship in the 
Established Church is generally well attended, and the number of 
communicants is about 200. The average yearly amount of col- 
lections at the church door is about L. 15. 

Education.— There are two schools in the parish, the one paro- 
chial and the other unendowed. In both, the same branches in 
general are taught, viz. English reading and grammar, writing, 
arithmetic, book-keeping, and Latin, conjoined occasionally with 
geography, algebra, and French. The salary of the parish school- 
master is L. 25, 6s. 8d. ; the amount of the fees may be L. 17 ; in- 
terest on some mortified money, L. 9. These may give as a total in- 
come L. 51, 6s. 8d. ; along with a house and garden. The school 
fees are lOd. a month for English reading, with 2d. additional 
for any of the other branches, such as writing, arithmetic, or Latin, 
The fees in the unendowed school are understood to be a trifle 
higher. With the exception of two fatuous persons, all in the pa- 
rish arrived at years of discretion, as far as can be ascertained, 
have been taught to read, and almost invariably they have at least 
got some lessons in writing, although many may have altogether 
neglected it in after life. 

Literature. — There is a library in the parish, for the united pa- 
rishes of Glendovan, Muckart, and Fossaway, containing a good 
selection of books. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
on the regular poor's roll is six, receiving each at the rate of 



PERTHSHIRE. 



L. 4, Os. 7d. yearly, along with a cart of coals. The poor's funds, 
arising f rom collections at the church doors, which may amount 
to L. 15, 5s. Id.; the use of the mortcloth, L. 1 ; interest on 
L. 240 mortified money, L. 8, 8s. ; and a voluntary assessment by 
the heritors, L. 12, lCs. 4d.; amount altogether to the sum of 
L. 37, 9s. 5d., which is expended in regular monthly allowance 
to the poor on the roll, in temporary supplies to others in needy 
circumstances, and in paying the salaries of session-clerk, beadle, 
&amp;c. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the drawing up of the last Report, a total change seems to 
have taken place upon the face of the parish. Then, it was diffi- 
cult of access; but now, by the opening of the new road from Stir- 
ling to Milnathort about the year 1810, and that from Dunferm- 
ine to Crieff in 1816, it has become a thoroughfare. Upwards 
of 10,000 tons of coal pass through it annually, and from 4000 
to 5000 carts of lime,— besides carriers' carts, and crowds of 
visitors to the falls, in all kinds of conveyances, in the summer 
and autumn months. Then, a considerable part of the higher 
district of the parish was covered with heather or peat-inoss, mak- 
ing the ague not an uncommon complaint ; now, in the same dis- 
trict, unless in some plantations, the heather is no longer visible, 
and the moss is' converted into a rich pasture meadow, and, instead 
of being, as it was then, bare and exposed to every wind that blows, 
this district is already clad with numerous beltings and clumps of 
trees, and in a few years will be as sheltered and ornamented as 
any parish in the neighbourhood. 

The circumstance, that the rental of the parish is now nearly 
four times the amount of what it was about the year 1792, al- 
though there is no great difference in the price of agricultural pro- 
duce, may show how busy the hand of man has been in the work 
of improvement. 

September 1835. 

The materials for the above report were collected in 1833; and the various state 
incuts made are to be understood as having a reference to that date.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH &amp; STIRLING. 

THE REV. JAMES WALKER, MINISTER. 



I._ Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— Tub author of the last Account of this parish says, 
that, « as the names of almost all places around are Gaelic, and ge- 
nerally descriptive of their local situation, this parish probably takes 
its name from an Erse word of somewhat a similar sound, which sig- 
nifies the north side of the Hill" We prefer to derive the name 
from the Gaelic word, Modail, compounded of Mod, signifying a 
court of justice, and Dai, a field, bounded by river and hill ; and 
accordingly, that part of the parish lying near to the village pre- 
sents something of a delightful field or valley, limited by river and 
hill. The name was formerly spelled Mothil, as appears from a 
brief history of the Culdees, selected by Keith, wherein it is said, 
that one Michael was parson of Mothil, and Macbeath was his 
chaplain. In the history of Scotland, Mote-hill and Moothill are 
often mentioned. On the eminences so named the Druids sate, 
and delivered their decrees and their addresses to the people. 
It is said by Skene, de Verb. Signific. « Quhen Malcolm the Se- 
cond gave all the lands to the barrones of the realm, he retained 
to himself Montem placid de Scona, the « mute hill of Scone,' 
where he might holdliis courts, and dajustice to his subjects, in 
deciding their pleas and controversies." Chalmers, in his Caledo- 
nia, observes, there was a Moothill in every district of North Bri- 
tain, during an age when justice was administered to a coarse peo- 
ple in the open air. In this parish accordingly, there is still a 
place in the village, called " the Ward," where the chief of the 
strath distributed justice to his vassals. From this, Muthill would 
appear to have been held in some esteem, and it is certain that, 
previous to the Reformation, it was the residence of the Dean of 
Dunblane, and afterwards the seat of the presbytery, which now 
meets in Auchterarder. 

Boundaries and Topographical Appearances— Muthill is one of 
the most extensive parishes in Strathearn. Upon a general calcu- 



312 



PERTHSIIIH E. 



lation, it may be said to contain about 80 square miles. Its figure 
is very irregular, extending downwards into the vales of the Allan 
and the Earn. It is bounded on the north-west by Comrie and 
Monivaird; on the north by Crieff; on the north-east by Madderty ; 
on the east by Trinity- Gask ; on the south-east by Blackford; 
and on the south-west by Dunblane. The village is three miles 
from Crieff, nineteen from Stirling, and about the same distance 
from Perth. 

As to the general appearance of this parish, it is sufficiently diver- 
sified, and will be judged so by the traveller in passing through it ; 
but if viewed at a distance from the east, all inequalities are lost 
sight of, except that of Torlum Hill, and the aspect which it then 
assumes is that of two inclined planes, ascending gradually from 
the north and south extremes to a transverse ridge of considera- 
ble elevation. The transverse ridge, however, is found to be double 
as we come near it, and between the ridges flows the river Machony. 
Theoneridgeor part next to Muthill village, extends in a circuitous 
direction onwards to the foot of Torlum, and is in a state of culti- 
vation ; the other, bleak and barren, known by the name of Corry- 
aur, extends from the Muir of Orchill westerly, until it terminates 
abruptly amongst other hills wild as itself. 

The south ridge may be considered the natural division of the 
parish, and has led us to speak of the Muthill side and the Ardoch 
side. Each of these sides has its attractions and its beauties ; the 
one has its Allan and its Knock rivers ; the other its Earn and Ma- 
chony ; each has its kirk and village, its woods and cultivated lands ; 
but yet we are inclined to think that the observing traveller must 
give a preference to the Muthill side. And that he may do so, we 
would place him on the eminence of the northern ridge, on his 
way from Ardoch by the military road. In this position he sees 
the parish church, a stately Gothic building, with its adjacent 
cleanly village, looking through the rows of shrubs and trees,— 
roads in several directions, half-shaded over with limes and chest- 
nuts,— large fields in the highest state of cultivation, and the wind- 
ing Earn moving slowly through them. But this is not all. On 
his left is Drummond Castle, full in view, whose shattered walls re- 
mind him of other days; and behind it is Torlum hill, 1400 feet 
above the level of the sea, unsurpassed for beauty, in its conical shape 
and its evergreen trees ; and then before him is lofty Benchoan, and 
Turret Glen, and the Knock with Crieff on its sloping side ; and 
on his right, the far extending prospect to the hills of Sidla,

Climate. — From what we have already noticed of this parish, 
there may be expected in different parts of it a difference of cli- 
mate. Accordingly, in comparing the south side with the north, 
it is found that snow lies two days longer on the former than on 
the latter ; and in accounting for this we would advert to the peculi- 
arity of the straths, whereof the districts alluded to form a part ; — 
Strathearn, lying deep and flat, is defended by its mountain sides 
from the violence of the storm, and the reflection of the sun's 
rays from the hills produce a great degree of warmth in it, — while 
through the opening of Strathallan, currents of wind, that issue 
from the glens, sweep along the vale, and render it less warm and 
fertile. The greater spaciousness of Strathern removes it also 
the farther from the chilness of the mountain air, or of haze at- 
tracted by the mountains ; for it is not un frequently seen, that, 
whilst on the banks of the Earn the sun is shining, showers of rain 
or showers of snow are falling upon the hills. The soil also of 
Muthill may be taken into consideration as of a drier nature than 
that of the other, because upon an opener bed, less retentive of the 
rain, and so of the cold, — for doubtless there is a relationship be- 
tween the soil and the atmosphere. Storms, however, frequent- 
ly visit both. Our colder winds come from the east and north- 
east, and the more violent from the south-west. 

The parish is, on the whole, healthy. Of the healthy aged we 
have many examples. 

Hydrography. — In former days, there were in this parish several 
springs or wells much esteemed for their virtues, real or imagined. 
One of these is at Straid, in the district of JBlair-in-roan, much 
frequented once, as effectual in curing the hooping-cough. 

In the same district, is St Patrick's Well, so named from a cha- 
pel once there, probably dedicated to that saint. Part of the foun- 
dations of the chapel is still to be seen, and close by these are a 
few houses lately built, which bear the name of the saint. We 
know not what connection St Patrick had with this sequestered 
spot ; but it is certain, that the inhabitants, until very lately, held 
his memory in so high veneration, that on his day neither the clap 
of the mill was heard, nor the plough seen to move in the furrow. 

 Not farther back than a few weeks ago, a family came from Edinburgh, a dis- 
tance nearly of sixty miles, to have the benefit of this well. As a piece of useful 
information, we may add, that the water must be drunk before the sun rises, or im- 
mediately after it sets ; and that out of a " quick cow's horn," or a horn taken 
from a live cow, which indispensable horn is in the keeping of an old woman who 
lives near by the well

A third well upon the side of the Machony was of still greater im- 
portance. It was called the well of Struthill, and by the credulous 
was much sought after, as its virtues were considered effectual in 
curing madness. Doubtless, its celebrity was altogether owing to 
the artifices of the avaricious religionists, who, it would appear, 
practised on the superstition of frequent visitors, to call forth their 
liberality in the shape of offerings cast into the well. That this ac- 
count is more than mere conjecture, appears from the fact, that the 
Popish chapel which stood near the well was ordered by the pres- 
bytery of Auchterarder, anno 1650, to be demolished, on account 
of the superstitions which were practised within it. But even this was 
not effectual to do away the celebrity of the well, or rather, we may 
say, was not effectual to lessen the avarice of those who kept it ; for 
in 1668 several persons testified before the presbytery of Stirling, 
that, having carried a woman thither, "they had stayed two nights at 
a house hard by the well; that the first night they did bind her twice 
to a stone at the well, but she came into the house to them, being 
loosed without any help : The second night they bound her over 
again to the same stone ; and she returned loose. And they de- 
clare also that she was very mad before that they took her to the 
well, but since that time, she is working, and sober in her wits." 
This well was still celebrated, and votive offerings were cast into 
it, in the year 1723 ; but such delusions have now happily passed 
away.  

Formerly, the only lake in the parish was the loch of Balloch, 
a natural collection of water at the foot of Torlum, not remarka- 
ble for beauty or expansion. But now we have several artificial 
lakes, one of which is worthy of notice. It is commonly styled the 
Pond of Drummond. This is an interesting sheet of water, and 
cannot but be admired by the visitor. On its north side, is a rocky 
eminence, about seventy feet above its level ; around it are well 
wooded banks; and on it, swans, geese, and ducks are at all 
times seen. Its length is nearly a mile, and its breadth about half 
the same. Where the loch is now, there was once a cultivated 
valley, which was portioned out by the King's Commissioners on 
the forfeited estates, as a reward to some of the bravest men who 
hazarded their lives in the Rebellion of 1745 ; and after all of them 
had died out, or were removed, Lady Perth desired it to be form- 
ed into its present state.

There are four rivers in the parish. The principal of these is 
the Earn, which Hows out of the loch of that name, and, running 
through Comrieand Monivaird, forms a line of separation between 
Crieff and Muthill on the north-east. Leaving Crieff, it passes be- 
tween this parish, and its quoad sacra part, named Innerpeffary ; 
and, keeping its devious course, for at least thirty-five miles through 
the vale to which it gives the name, falls then into the Tay. This 
river, although generally beautiful in its slowly flowing waters, yet 
at times, is truly terrific, when swollen by the mountain torrents. It 
is to be regretted that no bridge is over this river, at Innerpeffary, for 
oftent imes, by reason of its flooding, the people of that quarter can- 
not attend church. But we do not despair of this evil being re- 
medied, as, on each side of the river, the honourable proprietors 
of the land are both rich and liberal. Innerpeffary may here be no- 
ticed as a place of some interest. It has a large room with a library 
for the use of students in the neighbourhood, founded by David Lord 
Madderty ; and beside it, there is an old church, now the bury- 
ing-plaee of the Perth and Strathallan families, and also close by 
the river is the old castle of Lord Madderty, — all of which remind 
us of other days. — The Machony is another river which takes its 
rise from the confluence of rills as they descend from the heights 
of Blair-in-roan, and flowing along, is considerably increased be- 
fore discharging itself into the Earn, near the bridge of Kinkell. 
Though not remarkable in itself, it is somewhat so, in its name, for 
as it signifies in the Gaelic a fight or battle, so we are led by it to 
think of Blair-in-roan, which also signifies the spotted battle field, 
as the place where the Romans and Caledonians fought. On the 
other side of the parish are the Knaik and the Allan, the only other 
two rivers in it. The former, rising in Glenlich-horn, and passing 
by the steep banks which form the west boundary of Ardoch Camps, 
joins the latter, to form the south limit of the parish, and after that 
moves slowly on, and meets the Forth near to Stirling by the 
way of Dunblane. All these rivers are excellent for small trout, 
the Earn especially, for pike, sea-trouts or whitings, and large sal- 
mon. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Like other parts of the country, this 
has its variety of stone, — as grayish sandstone at Ardoch, reddish 
-andstone at Lucas, grayish sandstone at lower Concraig, and at 
upper Concraig black trap, or as some style it, black whin rock. 
The three first are used for building, the other is excellent for mak- 
ing roads. 



316 



PERTHSHIRE. 



The sandstone or freestone appears in strata dipping northwards 
at an angle of 70°, with till sand interposed between the strata. 

The trap rock, however, is the one which will be most interest- 
ing to the geologist, and that not so much in its nature as in its 
history. At short intervals, it rises in ridges, and is again broken 
down, and thus forming a range, stretches not only across the parish, 
but across the island, from sea to sea. Below the loch of Drum- 
mond, as also on the side of the loch, it rises about 50 feet, and 
in the former place is perpendicular in its front, and as smooth as 
if cut with a chisel or hammer. From these two great rocks, the 
places in the neighbourhood may have received the name of Con- 
craig. 

Several species of fossil remains have, at different periods, been 
found in our peat mosses and marl-pits, such as the heads of oxen 
of uncommon size, and horns of the elk and forest deer ; so that 
we have proof that certain species of animals, which once frequent- 
ed this part of the country, are now there extinct. 

Soil. — Along the sides of the Earn and the Allan, the haughs 
are for the most part a light loam, on beds of sand and gravel, 
which, with an admixture of lime and marl, produce very luxuriant 
crops. Between the middle or separation ridge of the parish, and 
the haugh ground, the soil may be considered to consist of three 
kinds ; one light, with a free bottom, which does not retain water ; 
this is next to the haugh ground, and is excellent for producing 
grass ; the next kind is a strong sandy soil, with a mixture of 
gravel, but with so much of a till bottom, and so cohesive in its 
nature, as not to admit the water to pass through it; and the other 
is so poor and moorish, as only to send up heath and whins. How- 
ever, almost to the hill top, from the banks of the rivers, the ground 
is found to be made productive by cleaning, by draining, and by 
manuring ; and so every year, we see a little field made out, farther 
up the hill. The low grounds especially are very productive when 
limed, and drained, and manured. Lime to warm and quicken the 
soil is much required ; but that advantage, as yet, is almost denied 
us, for we have no lime nearer than Loch Earn or Stirling, a dis- 
tance of about twenty miles. 

Zoology. — Few places abound more in game than this. Our 
heath-clad hills and rising grounds are everywhere filled with them. 
Yet they are not so abundant as they were once, by reason of im- 
provements and cultivation. Goats have entirely disappeared from 
this quarter, also the forest deer ; but there is a sufficiency of 



MUTHILL. 



317 



grouse, black-cock, woodcock, partridges, pheasants, plovers, wild 
ducks, wild geese, snipes, hares, &amp;c The principal sorts of ver- 
min are foxes, polecats, and badgers. 

The following account may give an idea of the quantity of game 
in this quarter. Killed on the Perth estate, anno 1835, hares, 
1521 ; grouse, 842 ; rabbits, 6268, &amp;c. The large park of Drum- 
mond Castle is still well-stocked with fallow deer, which adds much 
to the beauty of its pleasure grounds. The stag has now been 
driven up to Glenartney for his abode. 

Botany and Plantations.— Although we had nothing more under 
this head' to mention, than the garden of Drummond Castle, yet that 
should be enough to induce the botanist to visit our strath. It may 
be said to be in its style partly Dutch and partly French. The cas- 
tle stands upon an elevated rock, and on its south side is the far- 
famed flower garden, — famed for the manner in which it is laid out, 
for its locality, and its size. Scarcely a breath of wind can in- 
jure the most delicate flower in it; for on all sides it is protect- 
ed from the blast ; and every thing about it, as its lofty trees, its 
descending stairs, its little ponds, and its lovely walks, with va- 
ried flowers on every hand, render it truly enchanting. We at- 
tempt not to number the different kinds of heath, of roses, &amp;c. 
which are to be found in it ; but we notice one kind of plant, in its 
hot-house, which lately attracted much attention. It was the rare 
plant Aloe Americana. In 1832, June the 30th, it began to flower. 
Its temperature was the common heat of the hot-house, and it was 
nourished by frequent waterings. Its height was 23 feet, circum- 
ference 11 inches at the bottom, and 1 inch at the top ; branches 
29, and flowers on each branch 89, in all 2581 flowers. The 
flowering continued during the month of July, and when all fully 
blown, the plant died. 

What made this plant a matter of curiosity, was, the common be- 
lief, that it only flowers once in the hundred years, and then dies ; 
and on that account it was visited by most of the florists in Scot- 
land. 

Some rare plants are also found in the parish, such as the 
Pyrola rotundifolia, Stellaria holostea, Polygala vulgaris, Eupa- 
torium cannabinum, Anemone nemorosa, Scabiosa arvensis, Blech- 
num boreale, &amp;c. The plantations are to a considerable extent, and 
consist of fir, in its various kinds, larch, oak, birch, sweet chestnuts, 
and limes. The largest plantation in the parish is that around 
Torlum Hill, which is said to contain about 600 acres of Scotch

fir. But besides it, there are others on the Drummond estate, as 
also on the estates of Ardoch, Braco, Orchill, and Culdees, of 
pretty large size. In fact, the plantations of Strathearn are 
amongst its beauties, and contribute much to fertilize it. 

II. — Civil History. 
Accounts of the Parish.— The historical accounts of this parish 
are mostly of a traditionary nature ; and many of them not much 
to be depended upon. All that is written concerning this parish 
is to be found in the books of the Presbytery of Auchterarder, and 
in the parochial registers of the kirk-session, and heritors' book. 
In the kirk -session records, are contained lists of marriages, of 
births, and baptisms; an account of the distribution of the funds ; 
and of the meetings and doings of the kirk-session. The earliest 
date of these records is February -2, 1676; and from that time 
to 1692, incidents are noticed with great regularity. Afterwards, 
the register is lost, until 1704, when Hally, the first Presbyterian 
minister, took charge of them, and kept them very carefully, until 
1754. After Hally's time, they become irregular and confused, 
with the exception of the last few years. It is to be hoped, how- 
ever, that this part of our parochial economy will be more attend- 
ed to throughout the bounds of the presbytery than in times past, 
as it has lately fallen under the particular inspection of that reve- 
rend court. 

Eminent Persons. — As an individual eminent in the church, we 
cannot pass by the Reverend William Hally, minister of this pa- 
rish, so well known in the religious world, especially in connection 
with the revival at Cambuslang, &amp;c. 

It is well known that the year 1688 was the glorious time of 
freedom to the Church of Scotland, from the power and persecu- 
tion of Popery and Prelacy ; but it is also well known that in many 
parishes these churches held their sway for years, after that bles- 
sed revolution. Muthill was one of these. By law, the Episco- 

 Passing along the military road to Ardoch, and near the Mill of Steps, there are 
still to be seen the foundations of a blacksmith's house, who lived seventy years a«o 
and who had a beautiful daughter. This young woman could not endure the frowns 
of her stepmother, and with others embarked for America. On her way thither the 
ship was captured and carried into Morocco. And the tradition bears that the black- 
smith's daughter became the Empress of Morocco  . An old farmer, who died abcut 
eighteen months ago, told this tale to the writer, and said that he remembered her 
well, and that she often wrote to her friends at the Mill of Steps. It is farther re 
lated that she left two sons, who, about forty years ago, are said to have applied to 
the government of this country for aid to place them upon the throne of their de- 
ceased father, against an usurping kinsman, on the plea that they were of British de- 
scent. But the two young men are said to have been entrapped and cut off by some 
ambitious relative. J

palians were ejected ; and, from the history of that trying time, we 
find that the presbytery, jure devoluto, sought out for an able mi- 
nister to this parish, but, that it was not until the year 1704 that 
Hally was ordained by them. In this, the presbytery was fortu- 
nate in their choice, for no one could have filled the situation bet- 
ter than he. With a heart devoted to the work given him to do 
by his Lord and Master, he began, and continued, to labour 
amongst the people for about half a century ; and although many 
years have passed since his demise, Hally yet lives in the recollec- 
tions of the people, for his unblemished character and Christian 
boldness on the side of truth. At his settlement he had the greatest 
opposition to contend with. The Episcopalians, although ejected 
by law, still held out against his ordination, and their minister 
was resolved to possess the pulpit. " The opposition," says the 
presbytery record, " proceeded to the extent of a riot. Several 
individuals of the parish kept the doors of the kirk and kirk-yard, 
armed with swords and staves, which they made use of, in beat- 
ing and wounding several that had come there to hear the word." 

But the presbytery persevered in their duty, and went on with 
the ordination of Hally, in the church-yard ; and in that place he 
preached for many Sabbaths, oftentimes pelted with stones, by his 
wicked opponents. At last, through the kind interference of the 
Duke of Athol, and the firmness shown by the presbytery, and 
especially by Hally himself, the contest was given up, and the keys 
of the church were surrendered to him. This took place in March 
20, 1705. And then Hally entered that pulpit, which he filled in 
an eminent degree for forty-nine years and eleven months.  

Hally was succeeded by the two Mr Scotts, father and son,— the 
former minister twelve years,— the latter forty-two ; these again 
were succeeded by Mr Russell. They were all faithful servants 
of God, — and, as a proof of this, there has been no Secession 
church established here ; and we can say of the parish, at the pre- 
sent time, that there is not perhaps another, in Scotland, where 
the people are more attached to the Established Church. 

The Drummond Family.— Yew families in Scotland can trace 
a longer line of descent, or boast of nobler alliance, than the 
house of Drummond. f Its founder was Maurice, a Hungarian noble-

ing documents, which merit the attention of the antiquarian.

man, who was one of the attendants of Edgar Atheling, Prince of 
England, and his sisters, Margaret and Christian, when, in 1068, 
they took refuge in Scotland, to avoid the insidious designs of 
William the Conqueror; and who, upon Margaret's elevation to 
the Scottish throne, was, for his eminent services to the royal fu- 
gitives, rewarded with a grant of lands, and distinguished by the 
name of Drummond.  After a continued succession in the male 
line from Maurice the founder, through twenty-five generations, 
the estate of Perth and representation of the house of Drummond 
devolved upon the Honourable Clementina Sarah Drummond, the 
only survivor of her father, James Lord Perth. 

In 1807, this lady was married to the Honourable Peter Ro- 
bert Burrell, eldest son of Lord Gwydir, who succeeded his father 
as Baron Gwydir, 1820, and his mother as Baron Willoughby de 
Eresby, 1828; and thus the estate of Perth, and the representa- 
tion of the house of Drummond, belong now to the Right Ho- 
nourable Lord and Lady Willoughby de Eresby, who, with their 
family, are not more distinguished by their rank, than by their 
kindness and liberality to all around them. Their residence is 
Drummond Castle, when in this country, which merits some at- 
tention. It stands at the foot of Torlum, in the western part of 
the vale of Strathearn, and has a site of considerable elevation, 
rising gradually from the public road. It was built in 1490, by 
John first Lord Drummond, one every way distinguished both for 
his virtues and his illustrious deeds. Some writings of his, which 
reflect honour upon him, may be found in the genealogical account 
already referred to. 

The building now exhibits all the appearance of having suffered 
from the hand of time and from violence. Tradition says, that 
it was besieged, taken, and garrisoned by Cromwell's army ; and 
that, at the Revolution of 1689, it was demolished, with the ex- 
ception of some fragments, which are still standing. The south 
wing was fitted up for a library by the late Lord Perth, but is 
now an armoury. Respect is paid by the present family to the 
abode of their ancestors, for some repairs were made last summer 
upon the old walls, to preserve their ruins from further destruction. 

 An interpretation is given of this word by an ancestor of the family as follows : 
Drum signifies a height — onde, a wave ; hence the name Drummond was given to 
Maurice, to express how gallantly he conducted through the swelling waves the ship 
in which the royal fugitives had embarked for Hungary, when they were forced, by 
stress of weather, upon the Scottish coast, where they were received by Malcolm with 
royal munificence.

The modern castle is a little east from the old, on the same 
rock, and forms two sides of a square, and although not, at all, such 
a mansion as the family would have, were they residing constantly 
in this place, it is, however, comfortable as a summer residence during 
their visit, and is often the abode of the first nobility of the land. 

In the castle, there are a few paintings which interest the con- 
noisseur. Amongst these, we may notice the following : Charles I. 
with his Queen and children, Duchess of Ancaster, Lady Ann Gor- 
don, Lady Ann Drummond, Lady Sarah Bruce, Cardinal Howard, 
Lord and Lady Perth, James V., James VI., two of Queen Mary, 
one in her sorrowful, the other in her happier days, a full-length 
of Peregrine Beatie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby, 1555, George 
second Marquis of Huntly, the Duke of Perth, James fourth Earl 
of Perth, Lord High Chancellor of Scotland, 1684, the Chan- 
cellor's son, &amp;c. 

Other Families. — Other families of high respectability connect- 
ed with this parish, are those of the house of Ardoch, of Orchill, 
and Braco ; and Lord Viscount Strathallan, who lives at Strathal- 
lan Castle, Blackford parish, has also a part of his property in this 
parish. 

Eminent Men. — Few individuals connected with this parish have 
risen to any great distinction, in science or literature, if we except 
Dr Barclay, so famed for his skill in anatomy, and his writings 
thereon. His uncle, the Rev. John Barclay, founder of the sect 
styled the Bereans, may be noticed as born in this parish. 

Rental. — The valued rent of the parish in 1835 was L. 7784, 
9s. 4d. Scotch. Real rent in 1831, L. 14,937 Sterling. 

Camps at Ardoch. — All antiquaries who have written on the 
subject of Roman camps in Scotland, have alluded to those at 
Ardoch. These camps deserve this distinction, as the most entire 
in this country, nay, perhaps in Britain ; but we believe they would 
not have been half so much noticed, were it not for the mystery 
about them, as to whether they were the Castra Stativa of Agri- 
cola, when on this side of Bodotria, skirmishing with the Caledo- 
nian leader Galgacus, or the abode of some other Roman or fo- 
reign foe. 

It is not our intention, in noticing these camps, to dispute 
with the many great authorities, from Richard Cirencester, Hec- 
tor Boetius, &amp;c, down to a Lieutenant- Colonel Miller, who have 
published on this subject ; but we shall adhere to the life of Agri- 
cola, written by his son-in-law, as the only common source to 

PERTH. x

PE RTHSHIRE. 



which any historian can go for information, regarding the monu- 
ments, and transactions of that great commander, who came 
to subject the hardy tribes of Caledonia to the Roman sway. 
And certainly from that Life, we are as much entitled to fix upon 
Ardoch, and Its neighbourhood, as the scenes where Agricola 
abode and repulsed Galgacus, previous to the decisive battle apud 
Montem Grampium, as others are, to fix upon the neighbour- 
hood of Loeh Orr, in Fife, Blairgowrie, or Battle Dykes, north of 
Forfar, or Keithic, near Brechin. We consider the camps at Ar- 
doch and the other places of that nature, connected with them, 
to have been the abodes of the Romans, in the year 82, when they 
came to invade the inhospitable regions of the north. 

The whole space which was occupied by the Romans in their 
encampment, at Ardoch, consists of four departments, viz. the sta- 
tion, the procestrium, the great camp, and the less. The station 
is a permanent camp, situated upon an eminence close by the pub- 
lic road from Stirling to Crieff. The position was happily chosen 
for defence ; on all sides the camp was protected ; on the west, 
by a defence from the banks of the Knaik, rising fifty feet 
above the surface of the water, and having two fossae between it 
and the banks ; on the south, by a deep morass that rose a con- 
siderable way eastward, with its two fossae also ; and on the east 
and north, by deep intrenchments of five ditches, and six ram- 
parts parallel to the station ; all of which were very sufficient to 
guard those within, and to keep off besiegers. 

The area of the station within the intrenchments may still be 
seen, and is of an oblong form, 420 feet by 375, with its four sides 
nearly facing the cardinal points of the compass. The place of 
the Praetorium or general's quarter is a regular square of 60 feet 
in the side, in the rear or part farthest distant from the enemy ; 
but it is marked off rather irregularly, — for on inspection, it is 
not found to be exactly in the middle between the gates, nor paral- 
lel with those of the station. It is, however, elevated above the 
general level of the ground, and appears to have been inclosed by 
a stone wall. Within this, also, there are the foundations of a build- 
ing 30 feet by 27, which gives some probability to the conjecture, 
that there was a place of worship once there, which is still called 
the Chapel hill. 

 From one of the sides of the Praetorium it is said that there was a hole, which 
went downwards in a sloping direction for many fathoms, in which it was generally 
believed treasures as well as Roman antiquities might be found. In order to ascer- 
tain this, a man, who had been cone'emned by the baron court of a neighbouring 



MUTHILL. 



323 



Of the four gates which belonged to the Roman station, three 
only can now be distinguished, the fourth being scarcely traceable. 
Fronting the Praetorium is the Praetorian Gate, crossing the north 
lines in an oblique direction. Opposite to that gate, and behind 
the Praetorium where the Decuman gate should be, is a road lead- 
ing out of the camp, which may have been the Decuman ; and 
onwards to the right and left of the Praetorium, are to be seen the 
two, which were called principal gates, as being at the ends of 
the principal street which crossed the camp in front of the Prae- 
torium. Upon the Polybean system of castrametation, this fort 
would accommodate 1200 men. 

Immediately adjacent to the north side of the station, is the 
Procestrium or pro castrum for a camp, or an addition to the 
other, as probably used by Agricola for containing his men and 
baggage, when he thought of dividing his army into three parts, in 
order to watch the movements of Galgacus, and fight him from the 
neighbouring hills. This procestrium seems to have been strong- 
ly fortified, and a subsequent work to the other, for part of the 
area of the great camp was included in it ; but its intrenchments 
are levelled by the plough, while the corner of the former is yet 
visible. Its south gate is also to be seen, as connecting it 
with the station, and this again with the fragments of another gate 
on the north side. It was of an oblong shape, consisting of 1060 
feet by 900, and is capable of accommodating 4000 men. 

North-west of the procestrium is the great camp, — so styled 

Lord, upon obtaining a pardon, agreed to be let down by a rope. He, at first, brought 
up from a great depth, Roman spears, helmets, fragments of bridles, &amp;c. ; but on be- 
ing let down a second time was killed by foul air. A gentleman, who lived at the 
House of Ardoch, anno 1720, ordered the mouth of the hole to be covered with a 
mill stone, to prevent hares running into it when pursued by his dogs : but as there 
was earth to a considerable depth laid over the mill-stone, it cannot now be found, 
although diligent search has been made for it. Should it ever be discovered, it will 
probably lead to a tank which was formed by the Romans, in order to receive water 
filtered from the river Kuaik. Sir William Stirling, a former proprietor, inclosed 
the whole camp with a stone wall, so as to protect the interesting remains from injury 
by the ploughshare, or in any other way by the hand of man ; and we have little 
doubt that his successors will be equally careful, in all respects, of these Roman ves- 
tigia. 

Many stone coffins have been found at different times, in digging about the camps 
or near them ; and the skeletons contained in them have been of an uncommon size. 
About a mile west from the camps, a stone coffin was found, containing a skeleton 
seven feet long. A mile and a half distant in the muir of Orchill, another was found 
of the same length, in Cairn Woehil. These have generally been in cairns or heaps 
of stones, which may be accounted for, from a practice in former days of throwing 
a stone upon the respected dead, or upon any place remarkable, in passing by. So 
among the Highlanders there is still a saying, that if ore shall do a favour to another, 
a « stone shall be added to his cairn ;"_that is, his grave shall be remembered and 
respected.

from its size. Its mean length is 2800 feet, and its mean breadth 
1950 ; it would, therefore, according to the Pol bean system, hold 
about 26,000 men, and this was what induced General Roy to 
believe that it was in this camp that Agricola held his great army, 
previous to his dividing it into three bodies, in order to meet and 
conquer the Caledonians. 

The form of this camp is oblong, but not so regular as that 
of a parallelogram, — a fact which seems to prove that the Ro- 
mans did not stick close to mathematical nicety, where the nature 
of the ground did not well permit. The public road to the north, 
via Crieff, known of old, as the military road, enters by its south 
gate, and so has cut down one-half of the epaulment which cover- 
ed it; but the other half still remains rather entire. The north 
gate is a little east of the road, covered by a straight traverse, and 
another gate on the west is in the same way protected. On the 
east side, towards the north, there is a gate that has been defend- 
ed, not only by a square redoubt, within the lines, but also by a 
clavicle, — from which circumstance, it may be supposed that a 
weak legion was there quartered. 

On the west side of this great camp is a smaller one of an oblong 
shape. Its size is 1910 by 1340 feet, and it would afford accom- 
modation for 12,000 men. To the antiquary, this one is very in- 
teresting, especially in tracing the itinera of Agricola. It is evi- 
dently higher in position than the other camps — one-half of it lies 
within the other camp, which is adjacent to it — and the fact of its 
being left so very entire, would incline us to fix upon it, as the 
abode of the third part of the Roman army that remained with 
their leader, whilst the others were encamped at Strageath, and 
Dealgin Ross ; for the entireness of the camp proves that it was 
the last occupied, and that Agricola left it in great haste with his 
third division, to aid the 9th legion, who were then almost sub- 
dued, in the camp of Dealgin Ross, on the plains of Comrie. 

As to the fact of these being the camps of Agricola, we shall only 
refer to Tacitus. We take up the history of Agricola while at the 
isthmus between the estuaries of the Forth and the Clyde, and trace 
his steps onwards to the Grampians; and, from the plain reading of 
the Latin text, throughout the fourth year, it appears he was employ- 
ed there in erecting forts to secure the conquests which he had made 
on the other side. This was the case, unless we adopt the very 

improbable notion that the two rivers named Glota and Bodotria 

l 



MUTHILL. 



325 



were on the borders, or were the boundaries between Scotland 
and England, and that the Taus is the Solway, &amp;c. — which view 
would overturn all our conceptions of the Roman movements ; and 
would be making the Taus of Tacitus not that beautiful river 
which separates Fife from Angus and Perthshire ; the Glota not 
the Clyde ; and the Mons Grampius not that grand mountain range 
so well known to every Scotsman, but some little hil in the south. 

But the rivers Forth and Clyde answer too well to Tacitus' de- 
scription of Clota and Bodotria. " Nam Clota et Bodotria, di- 
versi maris aestibus per immensum revectae, angusto terrarum spa- 
tio diremuntur. Quod turn praesidiis firmabatur ; atque omnis 
propior sinus tenebatur, summotis velut in aliam insulam hostibus." 
This description cannot be applied to any other rivers between 
Anglesey and the Grampian Hills, but to the Forth and Clyde. 

This boundary, says Tacitus, would have been sufficient to li- 
mit the Roman conquests in Britain, had it been consistent with 
the bravery of their army or the glory of their name. But as it 
was not, then we read of their crossing the Frith of Clyde, some 
say at Dumbarton, the following year. With the new nations 
spoken of as lying to the west, or opposite the coast of Ireland, 
he had many successful encounters ; and having subdued them, he 
placed forts with a view to future operations, and afterwards pro- 
bably returned to the isthmus from which he went, there to winter 
and make ready for his Caledonian invasion in the spring. 

But, before leaving this part of the history, we would advert to 
a difficulty as to the third year's undertakings. — C{ Vastatis usque 
ad Taum aestuario nomen est nationibus." Agricola is said to 
have continued his devastations through the several nations to the 
mouth of the Tay. This being the case, it is evident he must 
have returned to the isthmus, where he erected his forts, for his 
undertaking in the fourth and fifth years were of course posterior to 
that in the third ; and in this view, we require not to correct the 
historian's words, as some have done, by saying, that by the Tay 
he meant the Solway Frith, or the Tweed, or the Tyne. In 
the fifth year, it is said that Agricola placed forces towards the 
west, on this side of the Clyde, which shewed that he was medi- 
tating an invasion against the Caledonians. That invasion he 
undertook in the summer of the following year ; but as to his route 
from the isthmus towards the camp in which the 9th legion was 
attacked in the night, and afterwards to the Grampian Hills, 



326 



PERTHSHIRE. 



where the decisive battle took place, we are left entirely to con- 
jecture. 

Next he encamps at Ardoch, eight miles and a -half from the 
former station, which agrees with the calculations of Ptolemy and 
Richard ; and, granting all this, the remaining part of Agricola's 
history, so far as the parish of Muthill is concerned, becomes 
plain. We have only, in accordance with others, to state, that 
Agricola being apprized that his enemy surpassed him in numbers, 
and in the knowledge of the country, and that they meant to at- 
tack him in divers bands, divided his army into three parts, and 
marched, to prevent their surrounding him. One part encamped 
at Dealgin Ross, the other at Strageath, and the other remained 
with Agricola, in the small oblong camp at Ardoch. 

On this hypothesis, it was the 9th legion which was assailed by 
the Caledonians, during night, and had their guards slain in the 
trenches of Dealgin Ross ; and this may have been owing to the 
information which the Caledonians might receive of the 9th le- 
gion, as being the weakest " ut maxime invalidam." During the 
time that they were engaged in the camp, Agricola heard from his 
spies, in what direction the great body of the Caledonian army lay, 
and as it seems to have been between him and the camp, so he 
hastened forward, and commanded the lightest of his foot and 
cavalry to charge them, whilst yet engaged in the rear, and the 
whole army presently after to give a mighty shout. This attack of 
Agricola and his men upon the rear-guard of the Caledonians 
must have been in a small glen, in the west end of this parish, 
two miles south of Dealgin Ross ; and so the design of the shout 
would be, that the Romans in the camps of Dealgin Ross might 
hear and know that those in the small camp of Ardoch had come 
to their assistance. This may be inferred from the Roman sol- 
diers regaining courage, and beating off their enemy to such a de- 
gree, that, had not the woods and marshes served for shelter to 
the fugitives, the war had been concluded by this victory. 

We therefore fix upon Blair-in-roan as the place of the de- 
cisive battle between Galgacus and Agricola at this time. Of this 
we have presumptive evidence, — the name itself, as signifying the 
spotted battle-field, — a small stream which runs through the glen, 
and is one of the sources of the Machony, named Tai-na-blair, sig- 
nifying the stream of the battle-field, — besides, the several upright 
stones in that quarter, still called by the country people the Ro- 
man stones, — and in addition to all this, the discovery a few years

The other camp or station of the Romans was at Strageath, up- 
on the banks of the Earn, near to Innerpeffary. Its original work 
appears to have been of small dimensions, and the intended ad- 
ditions to it, seem never to have been fully executed. All its en- 
trenchments are now levelled by the plough. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population amounted to 2902, 

17 70 . . . 2340, decrease 262

Thus in eighty-one years the population has increased 519, which 
has been chiefly owing to the improvement of land ; for in propor- 
tion as more of it is brought under crop, more hands are required. 
The increase has been both in the villages and in the country.

Character of the People, c— Of the inhabitants we may safely 
say, that they live comfortably and soberly, and at peace with one 
another. We have not the temptations of a populous city to con- 
tend with — neither have we the influx of strangers to captivate us 
with their novelties and oftentimes with their vices — neither have 
we any residenters wasting overgrown fortunes amongst us, and ex- 
citing the envy or dislike of their poorer fellow men. But we have 
a rural and simple-hearted people, remarkably kind to each other, 
and given to " rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with 
them that weep." 

IV. — Industry. 

Husbandly. — This parish consists of ten estates. About two- 
thirds of the whole belong to Drummond. 

Most of the heritors reside on their properties, and agricultu- 
ral improvements are promoted by them. This is very percep- 
tible in the draining of meadow and marshy ground, and in the 



328 



PERTHSHIRE. 



corn-fields rising higher and higher upon the acclivity of our hills ; 
also in the attention paid to the cropping of land, and the adop- 
tion of improved implements of husbandry. The order of crop- 
ping in general, is that of five divisions, viz. after lea, oats — next 
turnips and potatoes — next barley, with rye-grass and clover, — and 
then grass for hay or cutting, — and afterwards the lea. 

Wheat is seldom sown in this quarter, because less profitable 
than barley. Besides it is an uncertain crop, for by our long win- 
ters and continued frosts, there is a danger, some seasons, of its 
being altogether lost. Much attention is now paid to the grow- 
ing of turnips, by manuring with bone dust, &amp;c, which crop is 
found to be very profitable. 

Distilleries. — Connected with the agriculture of this parish is 
the distillation of whisky, which is much to be applauded in every- 
thing, except the object for which it is made. The three distilleries 
here are advantageous in the consumption of the grain, and the feed- 
ing of cattle, and the manuring of the ground, as also in employing 
many workmen; but when we think of the 100,000 gallons which 
they annually send forth as of so little benefit to the human consti- 
tution, but rather very productive of much evil both to the soul 
and body, we would pause before we commend them ; and say that 
we hope for better days— days when the public purse will not be 
filled by li Scotland's scaith." 

Produce. — The following table will show the gross amount and 
value of raw produce raised yearly, on an average price for the 
last ten years : — 

Arable land 11564 acres, Oats, 2312.8 7 bolls at 17s. L 137 615

V. — Parochial Economy. 

In this part of our statistics, the statements will be better un- 
derstood, by noticing Muthill and Ardoch separately, for the lat- 
ter is now a parish of itself quoad sacra. 

Market-Towns, fyc— The village of Muthill once had its mar- 
kets, but all these have been properly given up, owing to its near- 
ness to Crieff. The public road to the south passes through the 
village. At present, its population is about 1210, chiefly consist- 
ing of the labouring classes, and those connected with them. 



MUTH1LL.

About sixty of its inhabitants are employed in weaving cotton, 
which is sent to them from Glasgow. 

Few villages, we think, can be compared with Muthill, as to the 
beauty of its locality, its cleanliness, and the simple and artless 
manners of its people. All its poor are well supplied, and none of 
them are allowed to beg ; whilst, on the other hand, none of its 
inhabitants are so rich as to keep their hands from working. But 
what strikes the visitor of Muthill most, is, the amphitheatre of 
hills around it ; and then, its stately church, unequalled, it is 
said, by any country church in the land. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is well situated for the 
convenience of the major part of the people ; and, with the excep- 
tion of 50 in the district of Blair-in-roan, all have it in their power 
to attend, and do attend the church regularly. Those in Blair- 
in-roan attend at sacramental times, but in general go to Comne, 
because they are two or three miles nearer that place. 

The parish church is of a recent date. The old building was 
condemned in 1825, having stood four centuries. Spottiswood 
says, that " Bishop Ochiltree succeeded, a wealthy prelate, and 
well esteemed ; and so purchased to his see a great part of the 
forfeited lands of Strathearn, adorned the cathedral of Dun- 
blane, built the bridge of Knaik and Machant, with the church of 
Muthill ; and did in his time divers other good works." The 
ruins of this ancient fabric serve to suggest the thoughts of other 
days, and other men, who, although dead, yet live in dear recollec- 
tion. Beside the ruins, a monument, erected by the people, in me- 
mory of their late beloved pastor, Mr Russell, may be noticed; and 
another erected with some taste, beside the grave of Mr Erskine, 
son of an Episcopal clergyman, who lived and died here. 

The foundation stone of the new church was laid in March 
14th 1826, and the building was finished in August 1828; ex- 
pense of the whole, L. 6900 ; it is of the Gothic style, and is 
seated for 1600 people. The sittings are all free, and are divided 
amongst the heritors, in the proportion, in which they paid for the 
building of the church. 

The manse stands on the north side of the village, with the 
glebe around it. It was built in 1720, rebuilt, or nearly so, in 
1782, and since that time, it has been constantly receiving addi- 
tions and repairs, as every old house must do. 

The glebe, inclusive of the site of the manse, and of the gar- 
den, consists of 9 acres of excellent land, and the stipend is 1G 



330 



PERTHSHIRE. 



chalders of grain ; the one-half meal, and the other barley ; with 
the allowance of L. 10 for communion elements. 

"Besides the parish church, there is in the village a neat build- 
ing, where the Episcopalians of Strathearn assemble on the Sab- 
bath, and other days. 

The population of Muthill, exclusive of Ardoch district, is, 
'2472 ; and of these about 44 are Episcopalians, and 9 others, 
Dissenters. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor on 
the roll is 80 ; and the average sum given to each of them annual- 
ly is L. 2, or L. 160 in all. This sum is made up from the church 
collections, L. 52; from Ardoch collection, L. 3, 10s. ; and from a 
voluntary assessment, on the part of the heritors. And it would 
be ungrateful not to mention the meal-list of Lady Willoughby, 
on which there are commonly 60 poor persons, and who have also 
from the same Lady, their rents paid, and an allowance of fuel 
and clothing. 

Societies. — A Bible and Missionary Society has for some years 
been established, in this parish, and is supported by collections on 
Mondays after the dispensation of the sacrament, which is once 
in the four months, or three times in the year. The sum raised in 
this way, hitherto, has been about L. 26 per annum, which, with 
some other occasional contributions, prove that the people are some- 
what alive to the spiritual wants of their fellow men. And this 
Christian feeling, we would hope, is on the increase amongst us, 
for durinof the last half-year, we have collected L. 49 for the Ge- 
neral Assembly's four schemes. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank has been in operation for more 
than two years, and promises to do well. At present the amount 
of its funds is L. 270. 

Education. — On Muthill side there are eight schools, whereof 
the parish school is the most important, and by far the most nume- 
rously attended. The salary is the maximum, viz. L.34, 4s. 4d. 
which, together with a commodious house and garden, value L. 10, 
salaries of kirk-session and heritors' clerk, &amp;c. L. 12, 10s. and 
school fees, L. 16, 10s. make the situation of the schoolmaster 
somewhat comfortable, although not so much so as it should be. 
The number of scholars attending the parish school has of late 
years been about 100, but it is likely that the number will soon be 
increased, as at present a very spacious and elegant school-house 
is building, which will contain many more than the former, and be 



MUTH1LL. 



331 



much more comfortable and healthy. As to the success of the pa- 
rish school, we have only to remark, that frequently young men have 
gone from it to college, where they have been highly approved of 
both as to their scholarship and good behaviour. Three of the 
other schools are partly endowed by Lady Willoughby. The 
other four have no endowment, which is a matter of regret, as no 
teacher of abilities will accept of them, or if he do, his stay will 
be but short. The number of scholars instructed in all these, an- 
nually, as found at their examinations, has been about 400. We 
have also about 200 attending the Sabbath schools, a part of edu- 
cation truly important and useful. 

Libraries. — There is one supported by subscription in the vil- 
lage ; also in the reading-room furnished by the Right Honour- 
able Lord Willoughby de Eresby, besides a sufficient supply of 
Scotch and English newspapers, there is a collection of books 
on agricultural pursuits for the farmers; but the most valuable 
library in this quarter is that of Innerpeffary, for the use of minis- 
ters and students. It was left by Lord Madderty, with a small 
salary for the librarian, which, with the fees of a school that he 
teaches in one of the wings of the building, afford him a small 
living. In the library, there are many rare and excellent books, 
especially on divinity. 

Ardoch. — Statistics of Ardocli quoad sacra. — The perambu- 
lated bounds of the Chapel district now a parish quoad sacra 
extend into the parishes of Dunblane and Blackford, and are as fol- 
lows : To Glenlichhorn and Green Scores on the west; Muir- 
houses, Cameron hills, and Redford on the north ; Rahallach, 
Read and Butter Gask, on the east ; and Middle Cambuscheny 
and Toddleburn, on the south. 

The church was built in 1780, and styled by the constitution 
" the Chapel of Ease at Ardoch." A very thriving village is now 
rising up beside it, named Braco village, from the circumstance 
that it consists of feus on the estate of Braco. But we confess 
that we should have preferred the name Ardoch. 

Under the fostering and faithful care of the Reverend Messrs 
Simpson, Logan, Millar, Young, M'Farlane, and Laird, the 
members of the congregation have so increased, that there are 
as many communicants who attend the dispensation of the sa- 
crament, as there are seats, in the church. About a mile and a 
half south from the church of Ardoch, there is a handful of the 
United Secession, who have a meeting-house or church. A Mr

Patterson is their minister — number, young and old, 138 — sti-

nister, Mr Laird. 

Population — In Muthil parish, 949 Belonging to the Established Church, 1401

Original Seceders, 6 

1585 Relief, - - 6 

Bereans, 1 

For the care of these 1401 people, we regret to say, that 
the minister has only a bond from the managers of the church 
for L. 80, with a free house or manse and garden, and keep for a 
cow; and we regret, also, that the church cannot contain the 
people. 

The people have done much for their church and for their mi- 
nister ; but yet they require some aid to enlarge their church, 
and some endowment for the better support of their minister ; and 
we trust that both will soon be granted them. 

Besides a prosperous church, they have also a prosperous school. 
A hundred children are well instructed there, in the common 
branches of learning. The schoolmaster's income arises altogether 
from the school fees, which doubtless should be otherwise. An- 
other school, where a very few children are taught, is about a 
mile to the north of the village, and has attatched to it L. 2 a year 
of endowment, left by the Rev. William Hally, minister of Muthill. 
There are also two unendowed schools in the quarter of Dunblane. 

The church is conveniently placed for the district, and has at- 
tached to it a space of country of nearly seventy square miles. 
Number of sittings in the church 600 ; collections annually, L. 40. 
Average number of births, 78. 

Braco village is rapidly enlarging in its buildings, and in its 
population. At present it has 180 families, and a population of 384. 
For their moral improvement there is a well-selected library, kept 
up by subscription. There are also in it two cattle-markets during 
the year ; and it has also its four public-houses. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
During the last forty years, the population of the parish has 
increased from 2948 to 3421 : its schools have increased from three 
to ten ; and its cultivated fields have increased to double or treble 
their number. Of Presbyterian Dissenters, the number has been 
lessened from 160 to 9, and of Roman Catholics from 42 to 2. 
Other changes have not been so conducive to its well being and

comfort. We allude to the increase of public-houses, from 7 to 
20, throughout the parish ; and especially in the village, from 3 
to 11,— which during last year retailed 1583 gallons of whisky.

The changes in this parish have been so few, that the writer 
has little to add to the Report which he furnished to the former 
Statistical Account. 

Name. — The parish derives its name from the water of Devon, 
which runs through it in a narrow glen, in a direction nearly from 
west to east. 

It is situated in the middle of the Ochils, — and is 6 English 
miles in length, and rather more than 4 in breadth.

Parochial Registers. — These commence in the year 1700.

Lord Camperdown, J. S. Hepburn, Esq., Robert Haig, Esq. 
William Low, Esq., and Miss Jane Rutherford.

IV. — Industry. 
The farms are the same in extent, and managed in the same 
way, as reported in the former Account: the arable and pasture 
land remains the same. Of the arable land, seventeen acres have 
been, at considerable expense, prepared for being watered by the 
river Devon.

There lias .also been for some time past, at Burnfoot, in this pa- 
rish, a mill, on a small scale, for spinning wool. This year great ad- 
ditions are being made to it. The present erection is double the 
width of the former, and two stories are in the course of being ad- 
ded to it. It is situated in the midst of a wool country, and I 
hope the tenant will not be disappointed in his expectations. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Since my former Account a toll-road has been made through 
the Glen: It passes through the parish for three miles and a half. 
It was executed at great expense : the forming, metalling, cut- 
ting earth and rock, building bridges, and conduits, damages, &amp;c 
cost L. 5257, 16s.; but the advantages obtained have been very 
considerable. The farmers who formerly took from 7 to 8 cwt. sel- 
dom more, now take from 15 to 18 cwt. ; and carters, who load 
heavily, take from 20 to 25 and sometimes 30 cwt. The villagers, 
who are supplied from Blairengone and Dollar, burn their coal about 
5d. per cwt. cheaper than before the road was made, estimating 
summer and winter together ; and a much greater quantity of lime 
is now driven by the farmers. 

Ecclesiastical state. — There are four families in the parish who 
attend a Dissenting; meeting 1 at the Yetts of Muckart. Thev are 
descendants of those who separated from the church, when 
Messrs Wilson, Erskine, Moncreiff, and Fisher left it, and erect- 
ed themselves into a presbytery. All the rest belong to the Es - 
tablished Church. The stipend amounts to L. 150 Sterling. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in the parish. 
Salary the maximum. Amount of school-fees received, from 
L. 25 to L. 30. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is four; and the average sum allowed to each is Is. per week. 
The average amount of church collections for the poor is L. 7 
per annum : and there is no assessment.

THE REV. ALEXANDER H. GRAY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Trinity Gask, generally pronounced Tarnty, occupies a beau- 
tiful situation in Strathearn, extending principally on the north 
side of the river, about four miles east from Crieff, and two straight 
south from Auchterarder. 

Name.— The word Gask signifies, lam told, slope or brae, and 
this description is perfectly applicable to the parish, as the amount 
of level ground in it is comparatively very small. There is ano- 
ther place bearing the name of Cow or Coul £ e. behind Gask, 
in the parish ; and when Kinkell was joined, the united parishes 
got the name of Trinity- Gask, or the three united braes, which it 
still retains. 

Extent, Sj-c. — There are about 1 square miles of the parish 
extending westward on the south side of the Earn ; on the north, 
it is about 5 miles long by 3 broad,— giving a total of \Q\ square 
miles. 

Hydrography. — The only remarkable spring is the Trinity Well, 
a little south of the manse, of great renown in Popish days for the 
performing of miraculous cures, fortifying against plague, witch- 
craft, and such other evils. 1 have heard it said that a prohibi- 
tion of such practices is to be found in the records either of the 
parish or of the presbytery, but I have not hitherto been able to 
discover it. The right of bleaching at this well is one of the pri- 
vileges of the minister. The Earn is our principal river, flowing 
along the whole length of the parish, from west to east, in windings 
beautifully diversified. In many places, its sloping banks are rich- 
ly wooded by the hand both of nature and of art. 

Mineralogy.— The parish presents few features of interest to 
the mineralogist. At Colquhalzie, in the western extremity of the 
parish, the Earn flows through a deep ravine or chasm of red clav- 
stone rock of a soft quality, crumbling by the action of the sun 
and frost. To the westward, it becomes gradually intermixed with

micaceous particles, assumes a hard and durable quality, passing 
into red sandstone; quarries of which have been worked near 
Millearne, and at Lawhill, near the church. The trap dike, so 
conspicuous at Drummond Castle, traverses the county from west 
to east parallel with the northern boundary of the parish, occa- 
sionally rising into rugged ridges. Specimens of a heavy grayish 
stone, found at Denburn, on the property of Sir Thomas Moncrieff, 
were, I am told, sent some years ago to skilful mineralogists, who 
reported that they contained a small proportion of copper; but the 
distance from coal is so great that the return never could have 
compensated the outlay. The parish contains soil of every variety. 

Zoology.— We have many varieties of cattle. The short-horned 
breed, recently introduced by the patriotic exertions of the Viscount 
Strathallan, are rising rapidly in estimation, and very high prices are 
given for bulls and bull calves of that valuable stock. There are few 
sheep pastured. The Leicester kind seem the general favourites. The 
beneficial practice, however, of feeding off turnip with sheep, is ra- 
pidly extending, for which purpose the black-faced are most com- 
monly used. The fish found in the Earn are salmon, yellow and 
sea trout, pike and perch. The Earl of Kinnoul, the Viscount 
Strathallan, Sir Thomas Moncrieff, Mr Home Drummond, and 
Mr Hepburn, have a right to fishings, but the operations of the 
stake-nets on the Tay have for many years rendered the upper 
fishings of little value. m 

Plantations.— There are no very uncommon plants found in 
the parish. The extent of plantation is about 1000 acres, prin- 
cipally upon the properties of Mr Oliphant of Gask, Sir Thomas 
Moncrieff, Viscount Strathallan, Mr Graham Stirling, and Mr 
Hepburn. The oldest woods consist entirely of Scotch firs, the 
more recently planted of larch, spruce, and oak, all of which seem 
to agree well with the climate and soil. The largest hard-wood 
trees are found around Millearne House and Colquhalzie, but 
they are in no respect remarkable. 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers.— The Session records of the parish contain 
accounts of baptisms, fines, collections, distributions, and disci- 
pline. They commence in 1641. The most memorable facts 
mentioned are « on Sunday, the 5th of November 1643, the cove- 
nant was read, explicate, and public intimation made that all be 
present the next day to swear and subscribe it."—" On Sunday, 
the 12th November, this day all did swear and subscribe the co- 
venant." We have also an account of the first provision made by 



TRINITY-GASK.

the kirk-session for a parochial teacher, ordering his salary of 100 
merks yearly to be exacted of the parish. The rebellions in 1715 
and 1745'are not noticed in any manner. In 1774, there were no 
less than twenty-four table services ; now they seldom exceed five 
or six. 

The parochial registers are very full in some respects, and equal- 
ly scanty in others. From 1770 to 1834, they have been very cor- 
rectly and neatly kept, especially whilst under the charge of the 
late schoolmaster, Mr John Macintyre. 

Eminent Men. — lam not aware that any eminent characters 
have been connected with this parish, either by birth, residence, or 
burial. Dr Kemp, who afterwards became too notorious, was or- 
dained minister of this parish in 1770, and was translated to Edin- 
burgh. Dr David Ritchie, now of St Andrew's Church, Edin- 
burgh, was schoolmaster here for several years ; and my imme- 
diate predecessor Dr James Burgh, ordained in 1794, died 1834, 
from his great natural talents, learning, shrewdness, kindliness of 
heart and of demeanour, would certainly have made no inconside- 
rable appearance in the church, had he not, for many years pre- 
vious to his death, been incapacitated for much exertion by bodily 
weakness and infirm health. 

Land-owners. — The proprietors of the parish, arranged accord- 
ing to the rental of their properties, are, Sir Thomas Moncrieff, 
Bart. ; The Viscount Strathallan ; Thomas Graham Stirling, Esq. 
of Strowan ; J. G. Home Drummond, Esq. of Abbotsgrange ; 
J. Stewart Hepburn, Esq. of Colquhalzie ; The Earl of Kinnoull ; 
J. B. Oliphant, Esq. of Gask ; Anthony Murray, Esq. of Crieff; 
William Muckersey, Esq. 

Antiquities. — The only antiquities are the ruins of an old castle, 
at the eastern extremity of the parish, called " Gascon Hall," 
said to have been the place where Sir William Wallace encounter- 
ed the ghost of Faudon, as narrated by Blind Harry; but its appear- 
ance would not justify any such remote origin. No one can fur- 
nish any information regarding it; the idle traditions of the coun- 
try are every one more absurd and contradictory than another. It 
stands close upon the north side of the Earn ; but there are no in- 
scriptions nor monuments of any kind from which its origin and his- 
tory can be ascertained. The real Gascon Hall is said to have stood 
about a mile and a half north-east from this, amongst the pre- 
sent woods of Gask. There is also a peculiar-looking stone 
standing on the high ground, about a mile west, and north from this 

PERTH. v

ruin, called the " Borestone." It has borne an inscription, but age 
h as so completely obliterated the characters, that it is impossible to de- 
cypher a single word. The figures of animals, among which the boar, 
stag, and elephant predominate, may still be traced. Some maintain 
that it was a trysting-place for the hunting of the wild boar, others 
that it was an instrument of punishment, with which idea the stone 
corresponds. It is about b\ feet high, with two holes at the top, 
through which the arms of the delinquent might be thrust, and 
be kept there in a sort of pillory. There are many traditions 
and legends connected with this relic also, but they are too ab- 
surd to be committed to writing. There was a chapel in former 
times upon the present farm of Cow or Coul Gask. The place 
still bears the name of Chapel-hill ; but it was trenched over 
some time ago, and not a trace of it is now to be found. Dr Ross, 
the present tenant, who was born upon the form, has no recollec- 
tion of ever having seen crosses or any other curious relics. We 
have about four miles of the Roman road from the Stormont to the 
camp at Ardoch in this parish. Two of these are in a dreadful 
state of disrepair, — in winter indeed totally impassable. The other 
two, through the active liberality of Lord Strathallan, and other pro- 
prietors and tenants, have lately been very much improved, and in 
a short time will form part of an excellent road to Perth. Some 
coins have been found in the parish, but none, I believe, of any great 
antiquity. About six years ago, a tumulus, about 3 feet by 2, con- 
sisting of four large stones, and covered with a fifth, was discovered 
upon the property of Lord Kinnoull, containing a considerable quan- • 
tity of decayed human bones. It was supposed to be a relic of the 
Romans, but there was nothing from which this could be positive- 
ly determined. The remains of the skulls lying at the eastern end 
would indicate an origin prior to the introduction of Christianity. 
Around the sarcophagus, and mingled with the stones of the cairn 
which covered it, were ashes and burnt bones, as if animals or cap- 
tives had been sacrificed on the tomb of the chief. 

Modern Buildings.— The only modern building deserving par- 
ticular notice is the mansion of J. G. Home Drummond, Esq., 
built in the style of an embattled manor-house. It is in the late 
or Tudor Gothic style of Henry VII. and VIII. The carving 
in stone and wood is beautifully executed, and almost entirely by 
workmen in this and the neighbouring parishes. The grounds are 
also laid out with the greatest taste, and, aided by its commanding 
situation, Millearne House constitutes one of the chief attractions 



TR IN IT Y-G ASK.

of the surrounding neighbourhood. The gardens and hot-houses 
contain an extensive collection of exotic plants. 

III. — Population. 
There are old people in the parish who speak of the population 
of Trinity- Gask in their early days as having been double its pre- 
sent amount. 

In 1755, Dr Webster's report makes the population 913 
1 796, it was . . 795 

1831, . . .620 

1837, . .554 

This rapid decrease is caused by the converting of a number of 
small into one large farm, and the dislike which the tenants have 
to keeping up the cottages upon them, both from the expense which 
it occasions, and the annoyance and loss to which they are subject- 
ed, by their occupants persisting in keeping poultry, which support 
themselves at the farmer's expense, and greatly aid the poor people 
in paying their rents.

The only resident proprietors are, J. G. H. Drummond, Ksq. 
residing at Millearne House; and J. Stewart Hepburn, Esq. whose 
mansion of Colquhalzie is beautifully situated on the south side of 
the river. All the proprietors, with the exception of MrMuckersey, 
are possessed of lands yielding far more than L. 50 of yearly rent'. 

The number of unmarried men, bachelors and widowers, upwards of fifty years of 

age is . . . _ g 

unmarried women upwards of forty-five, - 14 

There are 86 families with an average of 4 children. There 
are only two houses at present building, and three uninhabited. 
There is only one insane person in the parish ; no blind, deaf, nor 
dumb. 

IV. — Industry. 

Trinity- Gask is entirely an agricultural parish. We have two 
or three weavers, as many masons and carpenters as are requir- 
ed for the work of the parish, two shoemakers, but no tailor. 

The number of arable acres is 4290. Perhaps 2000 more might 
be brought in, and they are now in the course of being so. The 
expense, however, is very great, from the amount of draining requir- 



340 



PERTHSHIRE 



ed. The number of acres under wood is nearly J 000. The trees 
are, Scotch firs, 'spruce, larch, and oak, with a few beeches here 
and there. The management of them is most skilfully conducted. 

Rent— The average rent of arable land in the parish may be 
rated at L. 1, 5s. per acre. It is impossible to hazard any opinion 
upon the rate of pasture; some of it is worth L. 2, 10s. and other 

parts again not worth Is. 

Considerable attention seems to be paid to the breed of cattle, 
and with great success. The character of the husbandry pursued 
upon the nrincipal farms justly stands decidedly high ; draining and 
embanking are carried on to a great extent; but irrigation, from 
the steep and unequal surface of the country, cannot be adopted. 
The leases in general are for fifteen, seventeen, or nineteen years, 
the last the most common. The farm-houses and steadings are in 
excellent order. All our landlords are actuated by a praiseworthy 
desire of seeing their tenants as comfortable and prosperous as pos- 
sible. The great obstacles in the way of improving the moorish 
lands are such as no capital nor industry could surmount with any 
prospect of a reasonable remuneration, arising as they do from the 
nature of the soil and climate. There are two quarries, both sup- 
plying stones for the building of farm-houses, steadings, dikes, &amp;c. 
They are of an inferior quality. The stone for Millearne House 
was brought from Dollerie, in the parish of Maderty. 

Produce. The average gross amount of raw produce, as nearly 

as I can calculate, may be, 

Grain of all kinds, . . U 7050 0 0 

Potatoes and turnips, . • 4700 0 0 

Hay and pasture, . • 2900 0 0 

Gardens of the cottagers, . 120 0 0 

L. 14770 0 0 

The only association in the parish is a society for the encourage- 
ment of good ploughing. It assuredly is productive of good, though 
sometimes giving rise to feelings of jealousy among the competi- 
tors, to say nothing of a little excess among the judges when de- 
ciding upon the rival claims. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no market-town nearer than Auchterarder, fully five 
miles south from the centre of the parish. There is certainly a 
boat bv which passengers cross the Earn, and save nearly a mile ; 
but except in very dry weather, the roads are so fearfully bad that 
the near way is sure to prove the most fatiguing and vexatious. 
Crieff is six miles west from the centre of the parish. Auchterar- 



TRINITY-GASK. 



341 



dor is the nearest post-town. We have, however, no regular com- 
munication with it, so that our letters sometimes reach us the very day 
of their arrival, and at others lie for five or six days. The country 
road from east to west extends for about four miles, and from north 
to south much the same. There are no public conveyances near 
us ; none, indeed, in the parish. The bridge of Dalreoch, in Gask 
parish, is the nearest point of the passage of the Perth and Glas- 
gow coaches, and it is fully three miles distant. Kinkell Bridge 
is the only one in the parish. It was built about 1793, by subscrip- 
tion, consists of four arches, and is kept is good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church stands a little to the east end of 
the parish. If situated more to the west and south, it would have been 
more convenient for the great majority of the people. The south 
end of the parish is worst accommodated. The people are within 
a mile and a-half of Auchterarder, and generally attend there, ex- 
cept during the dispensation of the Lord's supper at Trinity-Gask. 
It is about four miles from the western and two from the'castern 
extremities. It was built in 1770 to contain 350. The seats, 
however, are so crowded, that it is impossible either to sit or stand 
in them with comfort. It has not received any considerable repairs 
since, but the heritors have now agreed to make it decent in ap- 
pearance', and somewhat more comfortable— the cold during winter 
being excessive. The sittings are all attached to the farms ;°no mo- 
ney is ever paid for accommodation. The manse was built in 1772, 
greatly enlarged in 1820, and is now one of the largest in the coun- 
try. It is charged with twenty-one window lights. The glebe con- 
tains 141 acreSj am j ; s rentec | at present f or l 26, 10s., but is worth 
considerably more. In addition to this, the minister has from 
8 to 10 acres of wood, self-planted with Scotch firs. This was 
originally his peat-moss, but the seeds from the surrounding plan- 
tations having taken root, have converted it into a straggling forest, 
worth at present nearly L. 100. Were it drained and properly 
planted, it would certainly constitute no inconsiderable addition to 
the living. The garden and ground around the manse may amount 
to an acre. The minister has also the privilege of bleaching at a 
well north from the manse, and of a path for his horse to the ford 
of the Earn, when travelling that way to the Presbytery. 

The stipend consists of meal, 85 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, U lip- 
pies ; barley, 42 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 pecks, 3 lippies ; money, L. 41, 
13s. 4d. There has been no augmentation for the last forty years. 
We have, however, reason to believe that Trinity-Gask will ere 



342 PERTHSHIRE. 

long be put upon a level with the neighbouring parishes. There 
is one Dissenting chapel, in connection with the United Associate 
Synod, in this parish. The first was built almost immediately 
after the Secession took place, and the present about 1 /90. 1 he 
present minister Mr Forrester came with the understanding that 
he was to have L. 65 a-year ; but the very utmost the congrega- 
tion can accomplish for him is to pay the rent L. 39 of the farm 
upon which he resides, and to give L. 5 a-year, raised by two col- 
lections, to defray the sacramental expenses. The congregation, ga- 
thered from the surrounding parishes, consists, I am informed, ot 
about 100 hearers, and 84 members. The chapel is seated for 800, 
but might contain 1000, and in former days was crowded every 
Sabbath, people coming from distances of twelve and sixteen miles. 
The number of families in connection with the Established Church 
is 50, and the average number of persons attending the parish 
church about 150 ;— many of the church people, except at the 
sacrament, attending the Established Church nearest them ; 
those at the east end going to Gask,— at the west, to Muthill,— 
and at the south, to Auchterarder. The number of communi- 
cants, last two years, was 183. 

The number of families connected with dissenting chapels in 
Kinkell, Auchterarder, and Dunning is 36. 

The average amount of collections in the church is L. 18; pro- 
clamation of banns, 10s. 6d. ; mortcloth, fines, &amp;c. L. 1, lis. 6d. 

Education.— The parochial school is the only one in the parish ; 
and the branches of education taught are, reading, writing, arith- 
metic, elements of practical mathematics, English grammar, geo- 
graphy, and Latin. The present schoolmaster is also qualified to 
teach Greek and French ; but these are not demanded by the 
heritors. His salary amounts to L. 35, 9s. 4d. He is also 
precentor, and session-clerk, with a salary of L. 2, 10s., and 
his school fees will make his income fully L. 50 a-year. He 
has a good house and garden. I have not yet met with any of 
my parishioners betwixt six and fifteen who cannot read and 
write. There are 50 upwards of fifteen who cannot write, — none, 
I hope, who cannot read. The people are deeply sensible of the 
infinite importance of education, and are willing to make many 
sacrifices to secure it for their children. The great distance of 
the west and south ends of the parish must make it inconvenient 
for young children to attend the parish school at any season of the 
vear, and for all in those quarters during the winter. They there- 



TRINITY-UASK. 



343 



fore attend the schools of the neighbouring parishes in preference. 
Three additional schools, in the south, west, and east ends of the 
parish would certainly be a great convenience ; but there could 
not possibly be a sufficient number of children to fill them. 

Literature. — There is no library of any description in the parish 
as yet ; but there is every reason to hope that we shall be able to 
establish one in connection with the Sabbath school, to which the 
parents all seem anxious to afford every countenance and support. 

Poor's Funds. — The average number of paupers is 8; monthly 
allowance, 4s. When they have no relatives willing or able to take 
care of them, the house rent is also paid, generally L. 1, 10s. a 
year. We at present have 5 paupers, and only one house rent 
to pay. The collections amount to about L. 18 a year. The heri- 
tors for some time past have annually given a voluntary contribution 
of L. 50. In addition to this, we have the interest of a capital sum 
of L. 80. Allowances of coals are very general. This is assuredly 
a very heavy charge for so small a population, but there is an in- 
sane pauper, boarded at the rate of L. 15 a year, and his clothes ; 
one illegitimate child at L. 4, 16s. and his clothes; and till very 
lately another at L. 9. There is now good ground for believing 
that the heritors may be spared nearly one-third. The people do, 
generally speaking, feel a reluctance to apply to " the box ;" and 
one woman six weeks ago voluntarily gave up her allowance, her 
health having so much improved that she was able to work for her- 
self. 

Inns. — We have one public-house, the toll-house at Kinkell 
bridge, which, perhaps, could not be dispensed with. 

Fuel. — The want of fuel is perhaps the very greatest drawback 
upon the comfort of Trinity- Gask. Dollar, at the distance of 
twenty miles, is the nearest coal-hill. Tillicoultry, of which the 
coals are of a superior quality, is four miles farther, so that when 
driving and other expenses are paid they cost 2£d. a stone, — a 
present 2d. 

Subscriptions are being raised just now in this and all the neigh- 
bouring parishes, to sink a shaft at Tullibardine, in the parish of 
Blackford, on the property of the Viscount Strathallan, with the 
confident hope of finding coal. The subscription is advancing 
with great spirit, and, should the attempt prove successful, it will 
prove the greatest of blessings to all the neighbourhood. 

Peats cannot be got nearer than Methven moss, a distance of 
seven miles from the centre of the parish, and they cost 4s. 6d.

a load. Wood is consumed in considerable quantities,— principally 
the useless branches of the firs used for country purposes. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 

From the last Statistical Account of this parish, we are warrant- 
ed to infer, that much has been done to advance the style of agri- 
culture pursued, to reclaim lands, and improve them by draining, 
embanking, fee. The lands close upon the north side of the Earn 
are now never, I believe, flooded by the river, though often kept 
for a considerable period under water by the rain and melting- 
snow from the higher grounds. There is now a considerable 
quantity of bone dust and lime used. More of both would be em- 
ployed, were not the distance from Perth thirteen miles so great. 
Should any railway ever come near us, it will be a great en- 
couragement to attempt reclaiming many parts of the moor lands 
which now lie hopelessly waste. Every great farm has a thrash- 
ing-mill attached to it, and there are grinding mills, driven by 
water, at an easy distance from every part of the parish. 

The principal road through the parish is very good, and now 
100 stones of coal are not considered an unreasonable load, even 
for so long and continuous a journey. It would add greatly to the 
beauty of the parish, were more hard-wood trees planted along 
the hedge-rows, and the fences of every description kept in better 
repair.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name — The name is compounded of the words, baile-chul-tir, 
signifying the town or territory at the back of the country. 

Extent, 8fc. — The parish is about 18 miles in length, and between 
6 and 7 miles in breadth, and comprises many straths, glens, and 
vallevs, and a vast number of hills and lofty rocks. It seems pro- 
per to mention some of these. — Strathyre, signifying in Gaelic 
the warm strath ; Glenbuckie, signifying the glen where roebucks

abounded in ancient times ; Edinchip, the hill in the shape of a shoe- 
maker's last ; Lochearnhead, where there is a small country village 
with a good inn, having every requisite accommodation for travel- 
lers ; Edinample, from the words, eadan, face, and teampuil, tem- 
ple, and importing that a place of worship had been on the face 
of the hill at a very remote period : here stands an ancient castle 
belonging to the family of Breadalbane ; it is surrounded with lofty 
plane-trees ; and there is a grand waterfall close to it, which at- 
tracts the attention of travellers : Glenogle, signifying the terrific 
glen, is a narrow pass leading from Lochearnhead to Glendo- 
chard in Breadalbane ; it is surrounded on both sides of the road 
by stupendous hills full of rocks and scarnachs, the haunts of foxes 
and ravenous birds. 

Boundaries. — The parish is bounded on the south by the pa- 
rish of Callander; on the east by the parish of Comrie; and on the 
north and west by the parish of Killin. 

Topographical Appearances. — The country on both sides of the 
river and lakes is environed by a ridge of hills, some of which are 
of considerable height, and rise almost perpendicular from the 
strath. A few of them may be mentioned 

Binean, signifying the mountain qfbirds 3 is nearly as high as 
Benmore, which is immediately adjoining : Stobchon, the hill of 
the dogs : Beinchroin, the mountain ichere the deer used to roar : 
Craigruigh Hill, the King's rock, where, it is said, King Robert 
Bruce concealed himself after he had lost the battle of Dalrey, and 
before that of Bannockburn was fought ; on the south side of this 
stupendous hill are numerous rocks, cavities, and scarnachs ; and to 
a traveller below, it appears indeed wild and romantic : Sithean a 
chath, an eminence at the western extremity of the parish : Fioghan 
situated on the north of the Kirkton Glen, and halfway between 
Balquhidder and Glendochard. Above the manse is a stupen- 
dous rock, much admired by all travellers, and seen at a great dis- 
tance. .It is the resort of hawks, wild pigeons, and martins. 

About forty or fifty years ago the face of the hills was gene- 
rally covered with heather, which has now almost disappeared. 

Hydrography. — There are a vast number of springs, chiefly pe- 
rennial, in the parish. The lakes are, Loch-voil, Loch-doine, half 
of Lochlubnaig, and a part of Lochearn. Loch-voil or phuil sig- 
nifies the muddy lake : Loch doine, the deep water and Loch -lub- 
7iaig, the winding lake. The only river of note in the place is Bal- 
vag, signifying the smooth running roater. It takes its rise at Loch-

mil, and runs smoothly in a serpentine direction to the south-east, 
about five miles through the strath, and discharges itself into Loch- 
lubnaig. Calair, a lesser river than Balvag, flows from Glenbuckie, 
and rages furiously in time of flood, from which circumstance the 
name is derived. 

Geology. — The rocks in this parish are mica-slate, clay-slate, 
quartz rock, primitive greenstone, and porphyry. Veins of galena 
or lead glance traversing the mica-slate occur in several parts, but 
none of these appear to have been worked for the ore they contain. 

Woods. — There are several woods in the parish, consisting 
chiefly of oak, coppice, birch, ash, alder, and mountain-ash. There 
are likewise several young plantations of Scotch, larch, and spruce 
firs, which are thriving well. There are some plane-trees of con- 
siderable size, and also oaks. The soil seems to be well adapted 
for growing all kinds of wood usually planted in the country, such 
as firs, oak, plane-tree, &amp;c. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — In a field somewhat to the south-east of the manse, 
there is a stone resembling an obelisk, about five feet high. The 
people call it Puidrac : but the nature and origin of it, the writer 
has not ascertained. 

About a mile to the eastward of the manse, a desperate battle 
was fought between the M'Larens and the Leneys, some suppose 
in the time of the Alexanders. The M'Larens from time imme- 
morial were inhabitants of Balquhidder, and the Leneys resided 
near Callander. The natives mention every circumstance relating 
to this conflict with great exactness. 

Eminent Men. — The late Sir John MacGregor Murray, of Mac- 
Gregor, Bart, was buried in'the family vault, aboutamileto the east- 
ward of the manse ; he was a distinguished Gaelic scholar, and zea- 
lous and unwearied in his exertions to collect and preserve the ancient 
poetry of the Highland bards. He held the rank of colonel in 
the army, and raised a regiment of infantry, called the Clan Al- 
pins, for the service of his country, which was commanded by his 
brother, Colonel Alexander MacGregor Murray, who was also bu- 
ried in the mausoleum belonging to the family. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Marquis of 
Breadalbane; Sir Evan J. Murray MacGregor of MacGregor, Bart.; 
Alexander Buchanan, Esq. of Arnprior ; Earl of Moray; and 
John Lorn Stewart, Esq. of Glenbuckie. 

arochial Registers. — There is a register of baptisms and mar-

riages kept in the parish, the earliest date of which is November 
1696 : it is regularly kept. 

Mansion- Houses. — There are two mansion-houses, Edinample 
Castle, and Glenbuckie House, the former built some centuries 
back, and the latter about ten years ago. 

III. — Population. 

The greatest number of souls in the parish, so far back as can 
be traced, was 1592 ; by last census, the population was 1049. 
The yearly average of births for the last seven years is 24, and 
that of marriages 9. 

There are 9 proprietors of land, whose rentals all exceed L. 50 
yearly. 

Gaelic is the language generally spoken, but it has been ra- 
ther losing ground within the last forty years. 

Number of families in the parish, .... . 218 

chiefly employed in agriculture, . . 113 

in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, . 30 

IV. — Industry. 

Apiculture. — The number of acres which are occasionally under 
tillage, has not been ascertained. The arable land and hill pas- 
ture are generally let together, excepting some small lots, consist- 
ing of a few acres arable land and meadow, which may be rented 
at the average of L. 1 per acre. 

Live-Stock. — The common breeds of sheep and cattle are the 
black-faced sheep and West Highland cattle, and considerable at- 
tention is paid to improve them, by introducing sheep and cattle from 
other stocks. As a proof of the attention which is paid to the im- 
provement of sheep stock in this parish, it may be stated that they 
generally bring the highest prices at the Falkirk Tryst. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toivn. — There is no market-town in the parish, and the 
nearest market-town is Callander, distant from the Clachan about 
twelve miles. 

Villages. — There are two small villages in the parish, one in 
Strathyre, and the other at Lochearnhead, both on the turnpike 
road that leads from Stirling to Fortwilliam. 

Means of Communication. — The length of the turnpike road 
through the parish is eleven miles. There is a post-office at 
Lochearnhead. There are two bridges on the river Balvag, and 
in full repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situate about the centre of 
the parish, conveniently, at that time, for the population. In the 



348 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Braes district, to the west of the church, where there were 50 te- 
nants, with a cottar perhaps under every tenant, there are at pre- 
sent only 3 tenants and 1 cottar; so that now the greater part of 
the population is in the Lochearnhead, or the north-east district, 
and in Strathyre the south-east district. The church was built in 
the year 1631, and has been repaired several times since ; it may 
contain about 600, and the seats are all free. The manse was 
built in the year 1774, and was repaired about twelve years ago. 
There are no Dissenters in the parish. Divine service is generally 
well attended in the summer season. 

Education. — There are three schools in the parish. In the 
parochial school are taught, Latin, writing, arithmetic, reading, 
English and Gaelic. In Strathyre district, there is a school sup- 
ported by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Know - 
ledge, in which are taught English, writing, arithmetic, and Gae- 
lic. There is another school, established at Lochearnhead, and 
supported by the General Assembly's Committee ; the branches 
of education taught in it are Latin, writing, arithmetic, English, 
and Gaelic. In all these schools, strict attention is paid to the 
morals of the youth, and to their religious instruction. The pa- 
rochial schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, and the school fees 
may amount to L. 10 a year. He has not a garden, but has the 
fiars price of 2 bolls oat-meal in lieu thereof. There are none in 
the parish between six and fifteen years of age who are not taught 
to read, and the people in general are alive to the benefits of edu- 
cation.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. P. ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History . 
Name. — Callander is generally supposed to be derived from 

the Gaelic names Calladh, signifying a ferry, and sraid, the way 
leading to the ferry, by which is meant the ferry across the river 
Teath, a little below the place where the present bridge stands. 

Extent, fyc. — From east to west, the parish extends about 18 
miles. In many places, it is very narrow, varying from one to six 
miles. A range of the Grampian mountains bounds the parish on 
the north and north-west. 

Topographical Appearances. — The most conspicuous mountain 
is Benledi, contracted for Beinn-le-Dia, the hill of God. This 
name was probably given to the mountain by the Druids, who had 
a temple on the summit of it, where the inhabitants in the vicinity 
assembled for devotion once a-year, and it is said that this meeting- 
continued three days. The height of Benledi is 2863 feet above 
the level of the sea. The view from the summit is very fine. To 
the east is seen the Frith of Forth as far as the eye can reach ; to- 
wards the south, the Frith of Clyde and the hills of Arran ; and to 
the north and west is a splendid view of the Grampians, one rising 
higher than another. Benledi stands about two miles west of Cal- 
lander, and adds much to the beauty and grandeur of the surround- 
ing scenery. The next mountain to be noticed, is Stuic-a-chroin, 
which in the east is seen between BenlediandBenvorlich,and makes 
a respectable appearance among the Grampians; it is 3171 feet 
above the level of the sea. Uamhmhor, from the Gaelic words, 
aamh signifying a cave, and mor or mhor great, may be mentioned 
also among our higher hills. Tradition says, that in the cave of this 
pile banditti took up their residence, and plundered the neighbour- 
hood, until in self-defence the tenants were obliged to rise in arms 
and extirpate them. Such practices were very common in the High- 
lands, in those feudal times when the law was set at defiance. We 



350 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ought not to omit mentioning a very picturesque hill, which rises 
above the village of Callander, and which, by having been planted 
a few years ago by Lord Willoughby de Eresby, contributes much 
to the beauty of the village. The principal valley in this parish is 
that in which the village is situated, bounded on the west by Ben- 
ledi : on the north, by the romantic Crag of Callander and hills of 
Leney, through which the river Teath meanders with its richly 
wooded banks. The valley may be about 40 feet above the level 
of the sea. 

Climate, Sfc. — The temperature of the atmosphere is consider- 
ed mild, from the shelter afforded by the surrounding hills. In 
winter the thermometer commonly stands about 35° ; for a few days, 
last winter, it stood at 24° ; in the spring months it commonly stands 
at 40° ; in summer at 75° ; and in autumn, it varies considerably. 
The prevailing wind is from the north-west. But during April and 
May, the periodical east wind blows, and being generally attended 
with drought, it is conducive at this season to the operations of the 
farmer. The climate is reckoned healthy ; and the prevalent dis- 
eases are those chiefly induced by changes of temperature. 

From the position of the parish, its appearance partakes of all 
the variety of the Highland scenery. The valleys become gradu- 
ally more narrow, and in many places are almost shut in by lofty 
ridges. The rivers find a difficult passage, and are often formed 
into basins and lakes. Upon two sides of Benledi, viz. the north 
and south, lie two different sheets of water, the former called Loch 
Lubnaig, and the latter Loch Venachoir, each about four miles in 
length, and both equidistant from Callander about two miles. Pur- 
suing these valleys and lakes still farther on to the westward, we 
find each of them connected with two lochs ; those to the north- 
west, called Loch Veoil, and Loch Doin, lie in the parish of Bal- 
quhidder, while the two lakes to the south-west belong to this pa- 
rish. They are connected with each other by a considerable river ; 
and that which we approach after passing Loch Venachoir, the 
Lake of the Fair Valley, is called Loch Achray, or the Lake of 
the Field of Devotion. The scenery here is most picturesque. 
Advancing a little further, you enter the Trosachs, and have a 
view of Loch Catharine. 

Loch Catharine, fyc. — This is the largest and'most interesting of the 
lochs; itis nearly ten miles in length, terminating at Glengyle, which 
is also the extreme point of the parish. This lake and mountain 

scenery is so celebrated, as to render any description of it hereun-

CALLANDER.

necessary. It was for the first time brought to public notice in the 
Statistical Account of theparish written by the minister in 1791, and 
since then by Sir Walter Scott's beautiful poem,, the " Lady of the 
Lake." The tourist ought to approach it from the eastward, whence 
he is introduced to it, as it were, step by step. He ought to walk 
as far as the Wooded Island, about two miles from the inn, where 
it is presumed he has secured a couple of men to row his boat. 
Opposite to the island, he will direct the men to wait him with 
the boat at a well known peninsular promontory, from which 
he will pass to the island, — where Lord Willoughby has erect- 
ed a hut corresponding exactly to the description of the rustic 
bower, given in the first Canto of the Lady of the Lake. He will 
then row to a bluff rock, called the Drumbeg, upon the north shore, 
and follow the pathway to the top of it ; after which, he will cross the 
lake to what was formerly called Coir-nan~uriskin, or the goblin's 
cave, but which is now dismantled of its shading wood; and then 
return to the boat-house, visiting by the way a lovely little bay, 
from which the river takes its departure. 

Rivers. — The river which flows out of Loch Venachoir on the 
south side of Benledi, called in Gaelic, Eas-gobhain, the waterfall 
or cataract of the Smith, and that which comes from Loch Lub- 
naigon the north side, called also in Gaelic, Garbh-uisge, the rough 
or rugged river, together with a variety of mountain streams which 
flow into them, — unite about half a mile above the bridge of Callan- 
der, and form the river which is called the Teath or warm river, 
probably from the circumstance of its having mountains on each 
side, and its banks fringed with wood. Standing upon the bridge 
of Callander, you have one of the finest views that can well be ima- 
gined. Upon the north, is the village with the church in its centre, 
immediately behind which, is the bold projecting Crag of Callan- 
der. In the north-west, you see the Pass of Leney, covered with the 
wood natural to the country. Immediately in front, is the majestic 
Benledi, and the river Teath sweeping along through a rich and 
extensive meadow, — while on the south stand hills of various alti- 
tudes. The scene is truly grand, particularly in time of hay- 
making, when the people are scattered over the meadow, and when 
many human voices are heard chanting some national air. Besides 
the river Teath, which runs through the centre of the vale, there 
is another river of considerable size, at the eastern boundary of the 
parish, which rises at the base of Stuic-a-chroin, and after run- 
ning several miles among the hills, and receiving additional strength 



.;- 



PEllTHSH IKE. 



from tributary streams, makes its way through a uiost romantic 
glen between Brackland and Auchinlaich. This spot is much re- 
sorted to, from the notice taken of it by tourists; and for the ac- 
commodation of the public, a secure bridge has been thrown across 
the chasm. Upon a small scale, nothing can exceed the wild 
grandeur of the scene, and nobody can pass the bridge of Brack- 
land without some feeling of apprehension. This and the pass 
of Leney are the only approximation to waterfalls in the parish. 
At this bridge, the river takes the name of Keltie, and after skirt- 
ing the Lawn of Cambusmore, falls into the Teath in front of that 
mansion, about a mile and a half below Callander. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Lime abounds in this parish, a 
quarry of which is regularly wrought, and supplies not only the 
farmers in the neighbourhood, but many farmers in the stewartry 
of Monteath, who prefer this lime to that which is to be had at the 
shore of Stirling. The limestone is of a very beautiful colour and 
superior quality. The ground of it is a deep blue, intersected with 
streaks of pure white. The farmers have learned the advantage of 
using it, by the superior crops produced by this stimulus when ju- 
diciously applied to the land. Some of them make a compost of 
lime, earth, and manure, which produces excellent crops. The 
direction of the strata is commonly from north-east to south-west. 
There are also slate-quarries wrought in the parish ; one on the 
farm of Aney, the property of Mr Stirling of Keir ; another at the 
base of Benledi, the property of Mr Urquhart of Kerinoch ; and 
a few years ago, a slate quarry was wrought on the farm of Lanrick, 
the property of General Sir George Murray. The slate, parti- 
cularly when the quarry has been wrought for some time, is of a 
blue colour and very durable. The plum-pudclingstone abounds 
in this neighbourhood, and commonly runs parallel with the lime- 
stone and slate, but at some distance from both. It is the chief 
material used for building. There is also a chain of gray free- 
stone, which lies across the parish, in the same direction of south- 
west and north-east, which is very hard and durable, and answers 
well for building and covering drains. The soil is of a light 
gravelly nature, but has been greatly improved of late by draining. 
The example held out by the proprietors in this respect has been 
successfully followed by their tenantry, and the assistance given 
by opening drains, &amp;c. is a great encouragement to an industrious 
tenant to go on improving his farm. 

Zoology.— We have here the Highland pony and the draught 



CALLANDKH. 



353 



horse ; the breed of liorses has been very much improved of late, 
both in this and in the neighbouring parishes,— as has also the breed 
of black-cattle. This improvement is owing in a great measure 
to the encouragement given by the Highland and Agricultural 
Society of Scotland, not only in establishing general exhibitions of 
stock of all kinds, but in distributing premiums for the best, and 
also by district shows, one of which has been held for several years 
past in this parish. The breed of sheep upon our hills is of the 
black-faced kind, while the Cheviot and the Leicester are fed 
upon the low grounds. Roes are to be found in the woods. Lord 
Willoughby has a forest of reel-deer at Glenartney, near the con- 
fines of this parish, which are sometimes seen traversing this 
neighbourhood, particularly in winter. Hares, rabbits, and foxes 
are numerous; the latter often commit sad depredations among 
the sheep and game. Wild cats, badgers, &amp;c. are also found. 
Such places as the Glen of Brackland and the Trosachs afford 
shelter and security to these destructive animals. We have here 
the grouse, black-cock, the ptarmigan, the partridge, the phea- 
sant, the snipe, and plover. Wild ducks and other water-fowl 
abound, and not unfrequently the eagle is seen soaring in the 
heavens, or perched on the pinnacle of a rock in the Trosachs. 

Our lakes, and rivers, and mountain streams, abound in trout, sal- 
mon, pike, eel, perch, char, and other small fish. 

Botany.— The oak, the ash, alder, Scotch fir, birch, plane 
holly, hazel, and the willow, grow spontaneously. The oak is valu- 
able, and is cut commonly every sixteen or twenty years, and 
the bark sold to the tanners. The proprietors pay great attention 
to their oak woods, and some of them are beautifying the ap- 
pearance of the country by rich and extensive plantations of 
Scotch fir, larch, spruce, plane, elm, beech, lime, chestnuts, pop- 
lar, and other trees. There are some trees which have grown to a 
good size, mostly of hard wood, and some Scotch fir. On the glebe 
are still remaining full grown trees, planted by the Earl of Cal- 
lander about the year 1596; and a venerable hawthorn in front 
of the manse, with its branches curiously entwined, is still in full 
vigour. The most common shrubs which grow upon the higher 
grounds are broom, whins and, heath of the usual kinds. Of the 
heath, the Highlanders in former times made a dve, first by boil- 
ing woollen cloth with alum, and then with the tops of heath, which 
produced an orange-colour. It has been used too in tanning leather. 
Juniper grows in all soils and situations, and of different sizes. The 

PERTH. r,

berries are three years in ripening, and upon the same bush they 
may be seen in their different stages. The juniper is esteemed a 
good antiscorbutic.  

The grasses to be met with are the ryegrass, red, white, crow- 
foot clover, scirpus or rush grass, eriophorum or cotton-grass, alo 
pecurus or fox-tail; with rib-grass, water-cress, thyme, mint, cow 
parsnep, chickweed, and wood sorrel. There abound here also 
digitalis, solanum or nightshade, hemlock, nettle, thistle, dande- 
lion, mugwort, mallow, Alices or ferns. These last are much used 
in the Highlands for thatching houses, and endure for many years. 
When used for thatch, the fern is pulled out of the earth by the 
root,  It is also used for making manure, and when cut green and 
properly dried, both horses and cows eat it. 

II. — Civil History. 
Village.— The village of Callander is built upon feus held of the 
family of Perth. To each feu is attached an acre or two of land, for 
which the feuar pays about L. 1, 1 Os. per acre, or from that to L. 3, ac- 
cording to the quality of the soil. The houses are built substantially 
with stone and lime, and covered with slate. The street is wide, and 
regularly cleaned and repaired. There is an abundant supply of 
excellent water in different parts of the village, conducted in leaden 
pipes, the original expense of which was defrayed by Lady Wil- 
loughby, who has done much to add to the neatness of the village 
and the comfort of its inhabitants. Through Callander passes the 
principal road to the Western Highlands by Lochearnhead, Tyn- 
drum, and Black-mount ; and from this place, there are several 
other roads branching out in different directions. 

Antiquities.— About a mile west of -Callander, there are the re- 
mains of a fortification on the top of a bill, called Dun bo chais- 
til, the hill of the castle. This must have been a place of 
considerable strength; the face of the hill is perpendicular, 
rising to the height of about 300 feet, and quite inaccessible on 
the south. The gateway and three tiers of ditches and mounds 
are distinct upon the top. The mounds are strengthened with 
large stones, and within was a sunk well, which has been filled 
upas cattle were liable to fall into it. From the summit of this 
hill, there is an extensive prospect, particularly to the east ; the 

 1 have heard it said, that when the plague was in Scotland and had reached 
C dlander, the people to the westward at Bridge of Turk, where this plant abounds, 
were in the habit, two or three times every day, of setting fire to a quantity of jumper. 
Whether this prevented contagion or not, I know not, but the plague did not reach 
them. 



CALLANDER. 



355 



approach of an enemy might be seen many miles off, and the 
people of the country would thereby have time to arm themselves 
and take shelter in this stronghold. In the plain of Bochastle, 
and in the immediate vicinity of this fortification, is an artifi- 
cial bank of earth and stone, which perhaps was erected for the 
purpose of reducing this fort; but we have no authentic record 
on this subject. In Loch Catherine is an island, which the inhabi- 
tants in Strathgartney used for the like purpose. When aware of 
the approach of an enemy, the most valuable possessions, with the 
women and children, were immediately conveyed to it. Then the 
men armed themselves and took possession of the passes and de- 
files of the Trosachs, to prevent the advance of the enemy. 
Dr Robertson, late minister of the parish, in a sketch of the 
scenery of Callander and the Trosachs, gives the following ac- 
count : — " In one of the defiles of this bye-road, the men of the 
country at that time hung upon the rear of the invading enemy, 
and shot one of Cromwell's men, whose grave marks the scene of 
action, and gives name to the pass Bealach an duine, the pass 
or defile of the man. In revenge of this insult, the soldiers re- 
solved to plunder the island, and, with this intention, one of the 
party swam in to fetch the boat to his comrades, who stood on the 
shore in full view of all that was to pass — but, just as the soldier 
had got to the nearest point of the island, one of the women 
severed his head from his body. The hostile party seeing this 
disaster, made the best of their way out of their perilous situation." 

There are still seen at the manse, the remains of the Castle 
of Callander, which, with the adjoining lands belonged to the 
Earl of Callander. It consisted of a square strong building of 
considerable height. The property was forfeited in the reign 
of James I. or II. of Scotland, and passed to Livingstone, who 
was created Earl of Callander and Linlithgow. This person pro- 
bably repaired the castle, after his accession to the earldom, as a 
stone is still preserved in the walls of the manse, bearing his 
initials and those of his lady, A. L. E. H. 1596. We find the re- 
mains of another fortification on the farm of Achinlaich, the pro- 
perty of Mr Buchanan of Arnprior. The hill is planted, and the 
ditch and mound on the top have been thus preserved, and are 
still very distinct. It was probably used for the like purposes as 
that on the Dun of Bochastle. There is a beautiful circular 
mount adjoining the church-yard of Callander called Tom-ma- 
Chessaiff, the hill of St Kessaig, who was the tutelar saint 



356

of this place. A market is still held here, annually, in the 
month of March, which goes by the name of Feill-ma-Ches- 
saiy, i. e. the festival of St Kessaig. There is a similar tu- 
mulus, about half a mile west, at a place called Little Leney, 
where was a chapel of old, and which is still used as a burying- 
place. There is only one turnpike road in the parish leading 
from Callander to the West Highlands. The other roads in the 
parish are kept in repair, by money raised from the tenants, who 
are assessed according to their rents and the extent of their farms, 
and also from such others as are able to pay. The money thus col- 
lected is laid out by commissioners in repairing roads and bridges. 
There is a new line of road in progress from Kippen to Callan- 
der by Thornhill, which, when completed, will be of essential bene- 
fit to this place, as it will open up to us a direct communication 
with the farmers in the Frews, who have been in the habit of 
supplying this place with hay, &amp;c.

Several individuals of independent fortune reside within the 
bounds of the parish; and during summer and autumn, families 
come here from large towns, and take lodgings for a few months. 
There are eleven heritors, only two of whom are resident. Cap- 
lain Houston Stewart lately purchased the property of Gart, upon 
which he has erected a splendid and commodious mansion-house, 
and is now engaged in laying out the grounds, in improving the 
soil, and in beautifying the place, which lies along the north banks 
of the Teath. Both the English and Gaelic languages are spoken 
in the parish, and divine worship on Sabbath is performed in both. 
The name of almost every farm and hill is derived from the 
Gaelic. The Highland dress is not so generally worn as it was 
forty years ago. 

The people are in general well-informed, intelligent, sober in 

their habits, kind and affectionate in their dispositions, and upon 

the whole, moral, religious, and well disposed.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The pasturage of this parish is adapted for the 
rearing- of black cattle and sheep. The attention of the tenants is 
therefore turned to this object, and many of them cultivate no more 
of their low grounds than what will serve to raise meal and pota- 
toes, for the consumption of the family. There are, however, farms 
in the parish which are entirely arable, and these are in general 
well managed. A regular rotation in cropping is attended to, and 
green crops are becoming common. The farmer finds the advantage 
of this, not only as the means of pulverizing and ameliorating the 
soil, but as of essential benefit in rearing young stock, which en- 
ables him to pay his rent when the price of grain is low as at pre- 
sent. A considerable quantity of waste land has been improved 
and brought into cultivation within the last twenty years, and the 
draining of wet and spouty land has rapidly increased, in some in- 
stances at the expense of the landlord, and in others at that of the 
tenant himself 

Leases. — The general duration of the leases of arable farms 
is from thirteen to nineteen years ; and of sheep farms, from nine 
to thirteen. The style of farm-houses has been much improved of 
late ; many of them are comfortable and covered with slate. Were 
the farms more subdivided with sufficient inclosures, the industri- 
ous tenant would be more encouraged in going on with his im- 
provements. Oats are sown about the 22d of March. Potatoes 
planted about the end of April. Barley and turnips are sown in 
the middle of May. Very little flax is now raised in this parish- 
The kinds of oats sown are the Flemish, the Cupar-grange, the 
Hopetoun, and the Blainslie. The straw of the Cupar-grange is 
reckoned the best for feeding cattle, but the others are earlier and 
more productive, particularly the Flemish. The smooth barley is 
preferred to the rough bearded sort, and fetches a better price in 
the market. The barley sells at 19s. 3d. per imperial boll ; the 
oats and oat meal at 14s. 6d. the boll of 140 lbs. avoirdupois im- 
perial weight. 

The valued rent of the parish is L. 3278, 10s.

Means of Communication. — The village of Callander has its ad- 
vantages. There is here a daily post; a coach that runs to and 
returns from, Stirling every lawful day in summer, and twice a-week 
in winter. Post-chaises and cars are to be had for hire, and there 
are regular carriers to Edinburgh, Stirling, and Glasgow.

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated in the centre of the 
village, and is a neat building, with a spire and bell. It was built 
about the year 1 773, and seated to contain 800. The seats are 
divided among the different heritors, according to their valued rents, 
and by them portioned out among their tenants. The manse was 
built in the same year. An addition was given to the present in- 
cumbent in 1810 ; and the former manse repaired at the same time 
It is a comfortable, convenient house, delightfully situated on the 
banks of the Teath. The glebe contains about 11 acres of very good 
land. There are no free teinds in the parish. The present stipend, 
as fixed by a scheme of locality in 1817, is 97 bolls, 1 peck, 1 lip- 
py of meal, 48 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 lippies barley, and L. 72, 14s. 2d. 
of money. Divine service in the church is generally well attend- 
ed ; but the extent of the parish renders it necessary that it should 
be performed at other stations as well as in the parish church. 
Hence it is customary for the minister to preach occasionally at 
Bridge of Turk, about six miles from this— and also upon the side 
of Loch Catharine, at a greater distance. The number of com- 
municants may be about 700. Number of Episcopalians, 2 ; Se- 
ceders, 4 ; Independents about 16 ; Roman Catholics, 6. The 
people are attached to the Church of Scotland. The average 
amount of collections at the church is in summer L. 1, 10s., and 
in winter L. 1, which collections are distributed among the poor 
of the parish. 

Education.— There are a parochial school, and two others upon 
the establishment of the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christ- 
ian Knowledge.— In the parochial school, the following branches 
are taught: Latin, Greek, mathematics, arithmetic, book-keeping, 
mensuration, English, Gaelic, and writing. In the school at Bridge 
of Turk, there are taught, Latin, English, Gaelic, arithmetic, writing; 
and the other school is for sewing, reading, writing, arithmetic, and 
English grammar. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is the 
maximum, and the school fees may average from L. 30 to L.40 per 
annum. The salary paid by the Society to the teacher at Bridge of 
Turk is L. 15; the school fees may be about L. 1, 1 0s. The teacher 
of the sewing and reading school has a salary of L. 6. Much praise 
is due to the excellent Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge ; but for it, thousands in the Highlands would have been de- 
prived of the means of instruction. The people are alive to the 
benefits of education. All in this parish have the means of instruc- 
tion, and all from six years and upwards can read. A very visible

change in the conduct, morals, &amp;c. of the people has taken place, 
since the facilities of education were increased. 

Libraries. — There are three libraries in the parish supported 
by subscription, consisting of Histories, Travels, Religious publi- 
cations, &amp;c, and the books are lent out upon paying a small sum 
quarterly or yearly. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The regular poor upon the roll 
amount to about 45. The funds from which they are alimented, 
are the collections in the church, with the interest of L. 200, 
amounting in all to between L. 70 and L. 80. These funds are ma- 

n 

naged by the kirk-session. On emergencies, the heritors make 
a voluntary contribution to assist the kirk-session funds. Much 
is done privately in this way by the family of Perth, who not 
only give money, but a regular supply of meal, clothing and 
coals, to a number of poor. Besides this, there are several opulent 
resident individuals who are very liberal in their donations, and 
when applied to in any cases of peculiar distress, cheerfully con- 
tribute to alleviate the sufferings of the indigent. 

Fairs. — There are several fairs held in the parish, one in the 
month of May for black-cattle, sheep and horses. This fair is call- 
ed Cockhill, from its being held upon a hill of that name. The 
stance for the market is given free by Mr Hunter, the proprietor 
of the lands. Another very considerable market is held in March, 
called Fcill ma Chessaig. There are also two or three smaller fairs 
for the sale of lambs, hiring of reapers, and the transaction of country 
business.  

 Inns. — Callander forms a regular stage on the road from Stirling 
to the West Highlands. Owing to this, as well as to the Trosachs 
being in the parish, it is much frequented by travellers, for whose 
accommodation a large inn was built some years ago, to which 
an addition has been made this year, There are other inns in the 
village, and one on the banks of Loch Achray, near Loch Catharine. 

Fuel. — Owing to the improvement in the roads, coal is much 
more generally used as fuel, than it was twenty years ago; and al- 
though it is carried from Bannockburn, a distance of eighteen miles, 
it is found to be cheaper than the making and carrying of turf or 
peat. The latter, however, is still much used, and found about a 
mile from Callander. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There is a marked improvement in the state of this parish since 
the former Statistical Account was written, particularly in husbandry. 



360 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Rich crops of oats, barley, turnips, and potatoes, may be seen grow- 
ing upon places, which, a few years ago, were covered with barren 
heath, or so swampy that the cattle could not get access to the 
few tufts of grass that might appear here and there. Still there 
remains much to be done, a great deal of land is to be seen lying- 
waste, and in a state of nature, which at a little expense might be 
brought into cultivation, and abundantly repay all trouble and 
outlay. 

The attention paid by graziers to the breed of cattle has great- 
ly promoted improvement in this respect, and several farms in the 
parish are noted for the excellence of stock, both of black cattle 
and sheep. Great attention is paid to the smearing of sheep in 
the beginning of winter, and selecting proper places in the low 
country for the wintering of the hogs, so that both the carcase of 
the animal, and quality of the wool are benefited thereby. The 
wool is sent to Bannockburn, Glasgow, and Liverpool, and bought 
by the carpet-manufacturers. Although much has been done by 
some of the proprietors in the way of planting, there is still a great 
deal of waste land unfit for tillage, which, if planted, would both 
beautify the face of the country, and enhance the value of proper- 
ty. Considerable improvement has taken place within these few 
years in the management of the police of the country ; yet there 
are many crimes allowed to pass with impunity. Would it not 
tend much to diminish crime if there were fewer licenses granted 
for selling spirits, and more attention paid to the character of the 
persons to w hom licenses are given

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JAMES TRAQUAIR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, fyc. — Rhynd, a term which, we are informed, signifies in 
the Gaelic language, a point, is a small parish situated at the con- 
fluence of the Tay and Earn. It is 4 miles in length, and about 
1 mile in breadth, resembling, in some respects, an acute-angled 
triangle. It is bounded on the west, by the parishes of Dunbar- 
ney and Perth ; on the north and east, by the parishes of Kinfauns 
and St Madoes, from which it is separated by the Tay ; and on 
the south, by the parish of Abernethy, from which it is separated 
by the Earn. 

As might have been supposed from its situation, the land on the 
south-east part of the parish, and near the confluence of the rivers, 
is extremely flat and level, consisting chiefly of clay, intermixed, oc- 
casionally, with black loam of the finest quality. In the north-west 
part of the parish, and behind MoncriefF-hill, it is considerably 
elevated, and slopes gradually towards the Tay, and is rather of a 
sharp or gravelly nature, but calculated, when properly cultivated, 
to repay abundantly the labours of the husbandman. 

From the low and flat situation of the greater part of the parish, 
the air is somewhat moist and hazy, but not unhealthy. It is 
rather, as we know from experience, the reverse. The wind, which 
blows from the west, sometimes with great violence, and the immense 
currents of fresh water, which are continually flowing along the 
two sides of it, tend to purify the atmosphere, and to purge it from 
the noxious qualities with which it might be apt to be impregnated. 
—Individual's of every rank and condition of life, often attain, here, 
an extreme old age, eighty or ninety years being no uncommon 
or extraordinary occurrence. To this parish, accordingly, we are 
informed, the inhabitants of Perth, in the days of old, resorted in 
great numbers, when the plague was raging, in that ill-fated city, 
and spreading, in all directions, its baleful and destructive influence'. 



362 



PERTHSHIRE. 



In the course of the last year, also, it may not be improper to ob- 
serve, only two funerals of the parishioners entered the church-yard, 
— a sufficient proof of the salubrity of the clime, and of its congeni- 
ality to the human constitution. 

Topographical Appearances. — This parish, as might have been 
supposed from its situation, is possessed of considerable local 
beauty. The shelving banks of its rivers, adorned in many places, 
with stately trees, or with shrubs and bushes, — the meandering of 
its mighty waters, often in serpentine mazes, along its flats and 
haughs — the movement of vessels of various descriptions, up and 
down their channels, at every flux and reflux of the tide, supply- 
ing the wants, and administering to the comforts of the inhabitants, 
who live in the neighbourhood, are calculated to delight the eye, 
and to charm the imagination. 

II.— Civil History. 
Land-owners. — There is no resident proprietor in the parish. 

The Earl of Wemyss and March, the principal heritor, resides at 

Gosford House, in the county of Haddington, and Mr Macgill of 

Kembach, the other heritor, resides at Kembach House, in the 

county of Fife. 

Antiquities. — This parish appears to have been well known in for- 
mer times. It was among its woods and winding streams, we are in- 
formed, that Wallace, occasionally, was wont to skulk from the ma- 
lice of his enemies, while he was endeavouring to avenge the injuries 
of his country, and to deliver his countrymen from a foreign yoke. 
The nunnery of Elcho, the ruins of which are still visible, de- 
monstrates the skill and judgment of the priesthood in the dark 
ages, as well as the power and influence of which they were pos- 
sessed, who always selected, as might have been anticipated, the 
most eligible situations for erecting those edifices, where literary 
leisure, as well as piety and peace, might take up their abode, but 
which, from the folly and weakness of mankind, were often pervert- 
ed to other and very different purposes. 

The Castle of Elcho, situated on the banks of the Tay, at pre- 
sent also in a ruinous condition, must at one period have been a 
place of some notoriety. Its walls are of considerable strength and 
thickness, and built of very hard and durable materials. The 
battlement, on its summit, to which there is access by several 
winding stairs, which are still in good preservation, affords a varied 
and extensive prospect up and down the river in all directions. 
The present noble proprietor has, lately, much indeed to his ho-

nour, covered it with a new roof, in order to preserve from the 
further injuries of the weather, the residence of many of his illus- 
trious ancestors. 

III. — Population. 

The resident inhabitants of the parish are the cottagers, who 
live in small huts or cottages, scattered up and down, and the fish- 
ers, who are employed in the Tay and Earn, and who are also 
occasionally employed by the farmers to assist them in their agri- 
cultural operations ; together with two or three tradesmen, whose 
labours are continually required. 

There is no public-house of any kind in the parish — a circum- 
stance which the inhabitants have little reason to regret. 

The parish was at one period much more populous than it is at 
present. At the period of the former Statistical Account, it amount- 
ed to 495 ; it is now, only 400. This diminution was occasioned 
by throwing into one large farm, a considerable number of small 
parcels of land, which were occupied by separate and distinct tenants, 
and who, of consequence, were compelled to leave the place, and 
remove to other situations, where they could find employment. Of 
the present population, 88 belong to the Secession, and the re- 
mainder adhere to the Established Church.

IV. — Industry. 

The parish is almost wholly an agricultural parish. The cul- 
tivation of the land is the great object which engages attention. 
The soil, which, in many places, is chiefly alluvial, is of the richest 
quality, and calculated to produce the most abundant crops. The 
deep and navigable rivers, by which, on two sides, it is bounded, 
afford to its inhabitants every facility for exporting their surplus 
produce, as well as for importing those articles of which they may 
stand in need, and which are the produce of other lands, or of 
manufacturing industry. 

The farms in this parish, which are at present only six in num- 
ber, seem of a proper magnitude or dimension for conducting, on 
a large scale, agricultural operations. They vary from 190 to 
400 acres and upwards. They are furnished with suitable stead- 
ings, and with dwelling-houses for the tenants, adapted to their 
circumstances and condition in life, and to the rank and station 
which they may be supposed to occupy in society. 

Though there is no resident heritor or proprietor in the parish. 



364 



PERTHSHIRE. 



as was before observed, the want, as far as agriculture is concern- 
ed, is not greatly felt. The tenants are, in general, men of skill 
and capital, as well as of activity and industry, and are, devotedly, 
attached to their profession, — the most important, without doubt, 
that can occupy the attention of mankind. They farm on the most 
approved methods. Their leases are of various duration, varying 
according to circumstances. Those, for example, on the lands of 
the Earl of Wemyss and March, are commonly of nineteen years 
continuance, with few or no restrictions, except towards their con- 
clusion ; while those, on the contrary, on the lands of Mr Macgill 
have been of fourteen, fifteen, and even in one instance, of thirty- 
eight years continuance, or a double nineteen, — at the expiration 
of which, it may not be improper to observe, the rental of the lands 
was nearly quintupled, through the attention and industry of the 
tenant, and the altered state of the country. 

The staple article of their produce is wheat, which the farmers 
raise in considerable quantities, as well as barley, oats, beans, &amp;c. 
of the finest quality. Potatoes have, also, of late years been raised 
in considerable quantities for the London market, and by the price 
which they have procured, in that great emporium, have not un- 
frequently, tended to compensate, in some measure, the evils of a 
bad or deficient harvest. 

Before the cultivation of potatoes, on the present large and ex- 
tensive scale, it was not an unusual practice to lay down in fallow 
a certain proportion of the land, in the general course of rotation. 
The raising, however, of this valuable article for the London mar- 
ket has, in many cases, superseded or rendered this practice unne- 
cessary, as the at'tention, labour, and care, which are necessary for 
its production, tend thoroughly to clean the ground, and to pre- 
pare it for a succession of cuhniferous crops. If, therefore, this 
useful esculent, the native of a foreign clime, should, in the course 
of time, happen to die out, — a circumstance which is not impossi- 
ble, the want would be greatly felt, not only by the country at 
large, to whom it affords an abundant supply of wholesome pro- 
vision, but also by the husbandman, to whose exhausted fields it 
affords a seasonable and refreshing change. 

On the flats and levels, where the water might be apt to stagnate, 
draining is practised in this parish, with the happiest success. The 
tenants seem to be fully aware of the necessity of keeping the 
ground dry, if they expect to receive a suitable recompense for 
their labours. 



RHYND. 



365 



The most prudent and judicious means have, of late, been em- 
ployed by the Earl of Wemyss and March, for extending the 
boundaries of the parish, as well as increasing the value of his own 
already valuable domains. A small island in the Tay, contiguous 
to his Lordship's farm of Easter Rhynd, was with much labour, 
joined to the mainland, by a narrow road. Reeds and osiers were 
planted along its margin, in order to consolidate the fresh mould, 
and to detain the mud and the other " debris" which might be left 
at every high tide. At length, when the earth was sufficiently con- 
solidated, and a sufficient accumulation had been made, by carrying 
out the embankment, upwards of sixty acres of the finest land have 
been procured, which require no manure, and will require none 
for a considerable time to come, and which produce, more espe- 
cially in dry seasons, the most abundant and luxuriant crops. 

By joining to the mainland another island contiguous to his 
Lordship's farm of Balhepburn, and by adopting a similar mode 
of procedure, a process, which is at present, going forward, it is be- 
lieved, that upwards of 200 acres of land of a similar quality will 
be obtained, in a short period ; besides deepening the channel of the 
river, and rendering it more adapted for the purposes of navi- 
gation, — an important circumstance in this large and extensive 
county. 

The noble proprietor of these lands may, therefore, in some re- 
spects, be considered as a benefactor to his country. If the indi- 
vidual, who causes two stalks of corn to grow where only one grew 
before, be regarded as a patriot or a friend to his species, in what 
light, ought that individual to be regarded, who causes the richest 
fields to arise where none were before, or where were only fens 
and morasses sending forth noxious exhalations, and who is the 
means of producing provisions for many of his brethren of man- 
kind. 

From these and many other circumstances which might be men- 
tioned, the rental of the parish has of late years very considerably 
increased. At the period of the former Statistical Account, it was 
L. 1600. It now amounts to upwards of L. 6000, varying, how- 
ever, according to the county fiars, by which a large proportion of 
the rent of the farms is paid. The salmon fisheries also, which at 
the above-mentioned period, were let for L. 300, are now let for 
L. 600. 

The number of acres, at present, under cultivation, is about 1700. 
There are 100 acres in plantation, and 50 acres behind Moncrieff

hill, belonging to the estate of Kembach, in a state of nature, over- 
grown with furze and broom, but which seem well adapted for 
larches, or the several species of hard wood, and which, in the course 
of time, would abundantly repay the expense of their cultivation, 
besides beautifying and adorning the country, already, in many 
places, too bare and naked. 

There is no village of any kind in the parish, nor any turnpike, 
and the roads through it, which are kept in good repair, are sup- 
ported by the statute labour. 

The tenants, chiefly, employ upon their farms, unmarried ser- 
vants, who live together in a small house termed a " bothy" one of 
which is attached to each farm, — a circumstance, not perhaps, the 
most favourable for their morals, as they are thereby, in some 
measure removed from the inspection and superintendence of their 
masters. They are often extremely migratory, removing frequent- 
ly at the expiration of the year, according as humour or caprice 
may dictate, and, like birds of passage, taking their departure to 
other lands. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated at the south-east 
corner of the parish, most inconveniently for the great body of the 
parishioners. It is extremely narrow, and appears, from some in- 
scriptions upon the walls, to have been built more than two hun- 
dred years ago. The floor, which is composed of clay, is about 
two feet below the level of the church-yard without, and is, of con- 
sequence, extremely damp and uncomfortable. The timber of the 
windows is so much corroded by the injuries of time, as in some 
places, to be almost reduced to dust, and in other places, has li- 
terary fallen from the glass. A plan for a new church has, how- 
ever, been drawn, and which, it is hoped, will soon be built in a 
more eligible situation. 

The manse is a modern edifice, having been built about twenty 
years ago. The glebe consists of 6 Scotch acres or thereby, and 
the stipend amounts to 15 chalders of victual, nearly one-half oat- 
meal, and the other half barley, payable by the highest county 
fiars, and L. 100 Scots for communion elements. The Earl of 
Wemyss and March is patron. 

There are in the parish 20 Dissenting or Seceding families. 

Education. — The school is situated much more conveniently, 
being in the middle of the parish, and is attended by nearly 70 
scholars, who are instructed in the various branches of education 

3 



ERIIOL. 



367 



usually taught, such as English reading, English grammar, geogra- 
phy, arithmetic, Latin, &amp;c. on the most approved methods. The 
schoolmaster has the highest salary allowed by law, and a house 
and garden of such value as to entitle him to a vote in the county. 
He is allowed L. 5 annually as clerk of session, and for collecting 
and distributing the poor's money, and may realize about L. 25 per 
annum from the school fees. 

The people of the parish seem to be feelingly alive to the bene- 
fits of education. There is none of them but can read and write, 
and go through the simple rules of arithmetic. The children are 
sent to school at a very early period, and the fees are made low 
for their accommodation. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor upon the list 
is commonly about 8, who receive each at an average 2s. per week, 
and 10s. per annum for coals, and L. 1 per annum for house rent. 
There are others, however, who occasionally receive small dona- 
tions to assist them in exigencies, and to prevent them from be- 
coming regular paupers. As the collection at the chuch is extremely 
inconsiderable, as well as the other funds, an assessment is laid 
upon the parish according to law, to make up the sum that may 
be required. The amount of church collections for the poor is 
about L. 5 per annum ; from assessment, L. 35. The poor have 
also the benefit of the interest of L. 150 lodged in the hands of 
the kirk-session.

THE REV. JAMES GRIERSON, MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The most ancient form in which the name of this pa- 
rish appears in the records, is Arroll, although at a very early pe- 
riod we also find it written Err oil. These two different forms of its 
orthography continued to be used indiscriminately, till the end of the 
seventeenth century. The name is now written Errol, and is pro- 
bably derived from the Gaelic word Ear-iul, which signifies 
Eastern landmark,— designation which the place might very na-

turally receive from persons entering this part of Scotland, by sail- 
ing up the estuary of the Tay. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The parish is an irregular four-sided 
figure, somewhat approaching that of a trapezoid, — its longest side 
being that which coincides with the bank of the Tay on the south, 
and its narrowest extremity being that toward the southwest. The 
length of its southern boundary is rather more than 6 miles, but 
its average length does not exceed 5 \ miles. Its breadth at the 
eastern extremity is about 3\ miles, while toward the western ex- 
tremity it is not more than 2 miles. Its entire extent may be 
estimated nearly at 15 square miles, so that it contains about 
8600 imperial acres. It is bounded on the south by the Tay ; 
on the west by the parish of St Madoes ; on the north-west by 
Kinfauns ; on the north by Kilspindie and Kinnaird ; and on the 
east by Inchture. The parish of Errol thus occupies the most cen- 
tral situation of the Carse of Gowrie, being at the one extremity 
only 7 miles distant from the city of Perth, and at the other, lit- 
tle more than 9 miles from the town of Dundee ; while, in its 
breadth, it extends from the Tay, to within half a mile of the foot 
of those hills which form the northern boundary of the Carse. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general surface of the pa- 
rish is low and flat. With the exception of two beautiful emi- 
nences, which swell up from the bosom of the surrounding plain, 
the whole eastern half of the parish is almost an entire level, be- 
ing scarcely anywhere more than 26 feet above the high-water- 
mark of the river. The western half, however, though less fer- 
tile, is more diversified. The village of Errol, which is situate at 
little more than half a mile of direct distance from the river, and 
therefore much nearer to the southern than the northern boundary, 
is, in regard to the length of the parish, almost exactly in the 
middle. At the distance of about a quarter of a mile to the east 
of the village, there commences the largest of those eminences 
which diversify the western division of the parish. To the west 
of the village, this ridge assumes considerable breadth, receding 
also a good deal farther from the river, and continues onward, with 
occasional irregularities, but on the whole diminishing in elevation 
to the western extremity, and prolonged through the small pa- 
rish of St Madoes. Not quite a mile to the north of this princi- 
pal ridge, and nearly opposite the middle of its course, is another 
rido-e, of rather more than three quarters of a mile in length, and

which, though connected at its eastern extremity with the for- 
mer, runs afterwards in a parallel direction. About half a mile 
north of this second ridge, is a third, which is parallel to both, but 
shorter in its extent, and much inferior in its elevation. The only 
other eminence in the parish is about a mile to the north of the 
village of Errol, quite insulated in its position, not much exceed- 
ing a mile in circumference, and, like the last of the three parallel 
ridges, probably not more than 30 or 35 feet above the general 
level of the district. As to the height of the principal ridge al- 
ready described, the centre of the public street at the cross of the 
village, is, by recent measurement, 116 feet above the low water 
mark of the river, and the platform of the sun-dial to the south of 
the mansion-house of Errol Park is 132 feet above the same level. 
About a mile farther west than this point, and on the estate of 
Murie, the ridge is apparently some feet higher ; but even there 
it cannot exceed 140 or 145 feet. 

The river Tay forms the southern boundary of the parish 
through the whole of its extent. The bank is very flat, seldom 
more than 20 feet, even above the high-water mark. 

Meteorology. — The general temperature of the atmosphere in 
this district is milder than usual in the same latitude. This is 
what might naturally be anticipated, from the slight elevation of 
the surface above the level of the sea ; from its being sheltered 
on the north by a range of hills, none of which rise so high as to 
be within the region of much cold ; and from the absence, gene- 
rally, of those violent currents of wind which are often felt in deep 
contracted valleys. 

The mean height of the thermometer, as ascertained by daily 
observations, taken at a quarter past nine o'clock a. m., and con- 
tinued for seven years, is 48.497, and the mean height for the 
same period, by observations taken at half-past eight o'clock p. m., 
is 46.889. The mean daily temperature for the year, taken from 
the average of seven years, is 48.198. The mean temperature 
for the separate months of the year, taking the same average, will 
be seen from the following tabular view.

between one and two degrees higher than the mean daily tempera- 
ture for the respective months. 

The average of the greatest heights which the thermometer has 
reached for seven years, is 76°; and that of the lowest to which it 
has sunk is 19°. 

As to the pressure of the atmosphere, it may be stated, that the 
average height of the barometer, at a quarter past nine o'clock a. m. 
for seven years, is 29.648, and at half-past eight o'clock p. m., 
29.657. With one exception, the average of any one month, during 
these years, has not varied from this more than a few decimals ; 
but there have been some rare instances in which the instrument 
has been as high as 30.40, 30.50, and even 30.56, and others in 
which it has been as low as 28.44, 28.38, and even 28.10. 

As to the prevailing winds of this district, it is enough to men- 
tion, that, on an average of seven years, there are found to have 
been 172 days on which the wind has been from the south and 
south-west; 138 on which it has been from the east and south- 
east ; 89 on which it has been from the west and north-west ; and 
23 on which it has been from the east and north-east. The most 
frequent rains, however, are from the east, owing, no doubt, to the 
proximity of the German Ocean in that direction, the accumula- 
tion of vapour from which is one of the surest prognostics of rain. 

The climate is mild, and, on the whole, rather dry than moist. 
On an average of twelve years, the number of fair clays in the 
3 ear is found to be 211, and the number of days on which there 
has been rain or snow is 154. The average quantity of rain which 
falls within the year, is 26 inches. In ordinary years, harvest 
commences by the middle of August, and is quite general in the 
third week of that month. The climate on the whole is salubri- 



ous. 



It is proper to add, that less snow falls on the Carse than on the 
surrounding districts, and that what does fall on it sooner disap- 
pears. 

Hydrography.— The Tay is the only river or frith which is 
connected with this parish — forming, as has been already stated, 
its southern boundary. Along the whole of this line, the Tay may 
be considered as a frith rather than a river, since it has at this 
part of its course acquired an average breadth of little less than 
two miles. The ordinary increase of depth, at the time of stream 
tides, is about 13 or 14 feet, but, under particular circumstances, 
it sometimes amounts to fully 17 feet. 



KilBOtu 371 

Although the parish is not intersected by any river, there are 
three or four large drains, which, under the name of pows, serve 
to convey through the district the streams which are formed in 
the neighbouring hills on the north, together with all the surface 
water which is collected by the smaller drains and ditches by which 
the different properties and farms are subdivided. These pows 
take their origin in the north and north-west parts of the parish, 
and pursue a winding, irregular course, the general direction of 
which is toward the south and south-east, till they empty them- 
selves into the flat shores of the estuary, — their mouths forming 
the small harbours by which the commerce of the district is car- 
ried on. The course of these streams appears to have been de- 
termined chiefly by natural causes, corresponding generally with 
that which the water, seeking its own outlet, would have followed. 
In their shape and dimensions, however, they are artificial. They 
are on an average between 10 and 15 feet wide at the top, and 
between 6 and 8 feet at the bottom. The depth may vary be- 
tween 6 and 10 feet. Except after heavy rains or sudden thaws, 
they seldom contain more than 2| or 3 feet deep of water ; but, 
even in the height of summer, they are never in all places entirely 
dry. 

Springs. — The only springs that exist seem to have been form- 
ed by digging wells for this purpose. Most, of them are perennial, 
but not a few are intermittent. The temperature of one of the 
most steady and copious of them, is 40° in winter, and 48° in sum- 
mer. The water of the perennial ones is generally hard, and of 
a clear colour. Some of the wells have been sunk to the depth 
of 30, 40, and even 60 feet, without falling in with any solid 
rock. The one which has been sunk to the depth of 60 feet af- 
forded no water till that depth was reached ; when, apparently on 
the principle of Artesian wells, the fluid began to ascend, and con- 
tinued ascending till it became stationary, as it still is at little 
more than ten feet from the surface. 

Topographical Appearances.— The general aspect of the parish 
is rich and beautiful, the flatter portions of the soil making up in 
richness and fertility for what they want of the picturesque. There 
is scarcely a rood of waste land to be seen in any part of the parish, 
although in some places the soil is thin and sandy, or inclined to till 
With the exception of the limited portion which is under wood, and 
of the grounds which are laid out in pasture around the mansions of 
the principal proprietors, the whole is under cultivation. The east 



372 



PERTHSHIRE. 



naif of the parish consists almost entirely of the richest carse land ; 
and the chief beauty which it presents to the eye is the wide extent 
of those fields in which all varieties of crops ar reared in the great- 
est luxuriance. The fields are not inclosed or divided by hedges, 
though, in some instances, intersected by rows of trees, and diver- 
sified, at intervals, by extensive and flourishing orchards. 

The aspect of the country to the west of the village of Errol, 
with the exception of the broad fields of rich alluvial soil that 
stretch along the banks of the Tay, differs widely from that of the 
fields which lie to the east. Though inferior in fertility, the for- 
mer is both the most elevated and the most diversified part of the 
parish. It not only presents a greater variety of scenery in itself, . 
but commands a most beautiful prospect toward the upper extre- 
mity of the carse and the surrounding landscape. This prospect 
stretches, on the one hand, to the Lomond-hills in Fifeshire, and 
the opening of the delightful valley of Strathearn; and, on the 
other, to the bold and romantic scenery of those rocky promon- 
tories, and wooded steeps which form the north-western barrier of 
this part of the valley of the Tay ; while, more directly in front, 
are seen the high grounds which rise in pastoral beauty from the 
very deepest part of that valley. Beyond these, is seen the loftier 
summit of the hill of Moncrieff, which divides the Earn and the 
Tay immediately above their juncture, and which, from the wide 
panorama which it commands over what is the richest, and also 
what is the wildest and the sublimest region of our native land, 
may be allowed to possess some claims to the proud title which its 
admirers have bestowed on it, in calling it the glory of Scotland. 
Such are the objects which present themselves in the more im- 
mediate neighbourhood of the position to which we have referred, 
on the open high ground about a mile to the west of Errol; and 
beyond these, the prospect terminates in the sky, except when, in 
favourable states of the atmosphere, the spectator obtains a glimpse 
of the blue mountain tops of the western highlands of Perthshire. 

Turning towards the village of Errol itself, the beauty of its si- 
tuation cannot fail to arrest the attention. However irregular in 
its structure, yet, situate on the crown and sloping sides of an 
eminence which is surmounted by the lofty and umbrageous oaks, 
that adorn the contiguous grounds and avenues of Errol Park, and 
commanding a view of the richest and the most spacious of Scot- 
tish plains, which is bordered on the one side by a long range of 
beautiful hills, called the Braes of the Carse, over which is seen

the round summit of the celebrated Dunsinnan, and on the other, 
by the most copious and majestic of Scottish rivers, — this vil- 
lage, while itself a conspicuous object, is the centre of a rural am- 
phitheatre, which cannot easily be surpassed, either in the large- 
ness of its dimensions, or the gracefulness of its ornaments. The 
hills now mentioned, besides being finely diversified in their out- 
line, are cultivated almost to their summits ; and whether their 
inequalities are thrown into light and shade by the slanting rays 
of the evening sun, while they are clothed in the fresh verdure of 
spring, or whether, under the effulgence of the mid-day beams, 
they reflect the golden tints of approaching autumn, they exhibit 
• a scene of peculiar splendour and beauty ; — the intermediate val- 
ley, with its many thousands of acres of luxuriant vegetation, skirt- 
ed and studded with the country seats of its proprietors ; the still 
broader expanse of the Tay, which washes its southern border, 
and forms the magnificent channel by which its varied and exube- 
rant productions are exported in those vessels which are daily to 
be seen dividing its sparkling waves ; the distant sea-port of Dun- 
dee, distinguished alike for its manufactures and its commerce ; 
and, more distant still, the ancient and isolated bulwark which 
guards the contracted outlet by which this majestic river empties 
itself at last into the German Ocean. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There are only two localities with- 
in the parish, where access has been obtained to the solid strata 
of rocks. The one is at Murie, about a mile to the west of the 
village of Errol, and the other at Clashbennie, about two miles and 
three quarters west from that village. The general direction of the 
strata is in both places nearly the same,— {he prevailing dip being 
to the south-east, the uppermost strata at an angle of 15° or 16°, 
and the undermost at an angle varying from 20° to 25°. The 
uppermost strata are those of a coarse limestone quarry at Murie, 
which has long been disused, and which, owing to the small per 
centage of lime which the rock contains, seems not to have been 
used at any time, except as affording a tough and durable stone for 
building. The solid strata at this place have not been pene- 
trated to a greater depth than about 15 feet; but, from comparing 
them with the outgoings of the sandstone strata on which they 
evidently rest, it appears that their whole depth cannot be less 
than 30 feet. The sandstone here mentioned is of a yellowish 
white colour, pretty fine in the grain but not very hard. . It does 
not appear to have ever been regularly quarried, and there is a

l'ERTHSHIU 12. 



present no means of ascertaining exactly the depth or extent of 
the bed, though, judging by circumstances, both must be consi- 
derable. 

Dipping underneath this sandstone, but with what interposed 
strata has not yet been ascertained, lies at the distance of fully a 
mile and a half to the south-west, the sandstone which is found in 
Clashbennie quarry, on the property of John Lee Allen, Esq. of 
Errol. This quarry was opened more than twenty years ago, and 
the excavation is now pretty extensive. The strata have in some 
places been quarried to the depth of 25 or 30 feet. The colour 
of the rock in the upper strata was of a dark red, while the tex- 
ture was coarse without being particularly hard. The lower strata, 
however, have been of a bluish-red, or somewhat pinky colour, 
and of a very hard compact structure, from the great additional 
quantity of silicious matter which the rock contains. Between the 
strata, is commonly found interposed a thin layer of red clay. Then- 
angle of inclination, as already mentioned, varies from 20° to 25°. 
No dike or fissure has yet been found crossing the strata, but on 
the south side of the quarry, as deep down as the working has yet 
been carried in that direction, several pieces of trap have been 
found, in contact with which the sandstone is considerably altered 
and indurated. As there has been a fall of the superincumbent 
earth near that spot, the exact situation of the strata cannot at 
present be ascertained, but appearances would lead to the conclu- 
sion, that they are a good deal deranged from beneath, and pene- 
trated by a vein of trap. All these characters seem to justify the 
opinion which has generally been entertained as to this quarry, that 
the strata belong to the old red sandstone formation. In various 
places of this quarry, and occasionally, from the time when it was 
first opened, there have been found many fossil organic remains 
and impressions. These, in general, have been of small sea-shells, 
and seldom very entire. In many instances, the impressions seem- 
ed to be those of scales of a striated appearance, and shining with 
a glossy white enamel. One or two impressions of small fish had 
also been met with, but no specimens of any great or general in- 
terest, till the summer of last year 1836, when the workmen fell 
in with a portion of a stratum, about 20 feet down in the solid 
rock, which contained a distinct and nearly entire impression of a 
fish, 27-| inches in length, and 13 inches in breadth. That 
impression, or rather model of the fish, was contained on the under 
side of the stratum, and, when lifted, left its print, as it were on 



EH HO L. 



the indurated layer or coating of clay which adhered to the stra- 
tum beneath. This under specimen was unfortunately broken up, 
instead of being preserved, as a sort of counterpart to the other. 
The specimen containing the fish itself was soon heard of, and 
purchased by the Rev. Mr Noble, of St Madoes, to whose resi- 
dence the quarry of Clashbennie is almost contiguous. A full size 
drawing of it was soon obtained and sent to the Secretary of the 
British Association, at Bristol, which assembled in the end of Au- 
gust 1 836, and was exhibited at one of the meetings, where it ex- 
cited much interest. The specimen itself was afterwards convey- 
ed to London for the inspection of the English geologists, by 
. whom it is understood that a more exact drawing and description 
have been transmitted to the distinguished Professor Agassiz of 
Neuchatel, with a view to his determining the genus and spe- 
cies of this fossil fish. The opinion of that celebrated naturalist 
is not yet made known, and till such opinion be furnished, it would 
ill become an ordinary observer to say much on the subject. 

We shall attempt, however, to convey to the reader some idea 
of the general appearance of this sigular creature, although it is 
difficult to do so by the help of words alone. It will be observed, 
from the dimensions already -stated, that its breadth is nearly equal 
to half its length, its head being small in proportion to the body. 
In these respects, the figure bears some resemblance to that of a 
tortoise, — a resemblance which is rendered the more striking by 
something like the rudiments of pectoral fins, and two striated fins, 
one on each side of the tail, pointing outwards and downwards. 
Besides these peculiarities, the body of the fish is irregularly co- 
vered with broad circular scales fully an inch, and some of them 
nearly an inch and a half in diameter, the surface of which is 
somewhat ribbed or grooved, and the substance of which seems to 
consist of a white enamel, such as is often found in smaller speci- 
mens. As far as can be recollected of these scales, they do not 
precisely correspond with the description of any one of the four 
orders into which M. Agassiz divides the class of fishes. 

Singular as it may appear, when we think of the scaly cove ring- 
now described, the general impression, after attentively examining 
this fossil animal is, that it is the abdominal or under part of the 
fish which is presented to the eye of the spectator. The medial 
line, it is true, can be traced for nearly the whole length of the 
body, and the slight depression which runs along that line, with the 
parallel rounding or elevation on each side of it, would half incline 



376 



PERTHSHIRE. 



one, at first, to think that it is the dorsal surface which is exhibited 
to view ; but when the head is examined, with the arch of the 
under jaw seen distinctly within the parallel margin of the upper, 
no doubt can remain in regard to the aspect presented. From the 
whole of the statement now given, it need scarcely be added, that 
the position in which the fish was imbedded in the solid rock was 
that in which it was wont to move in its 'native liquid element. 

After the purposes of science have been served by the thorough 
examination of this fossil relic, we are happy to think that it may 
be deposited for inspection in a public museum not far from the 
locality from which It was taken, a higher interest being thus im- 
parted by each to the other. 

Some months after the discovery of the specimen now describ- 
ed, a considerable number of small specimens were found, with 
scaly markings similar to the former. Nothing, however, like the 
impression of an entire animal was met with, except that of a small 
fish, whose general outline bore some resemblance to the order 
Pleuronectes, of which the flounder is a familiar species. Among 
other specimens, was one containing what seems to be the petrifac- 
tion of the eye of a small fish within its cartilaginous orbit. Be- 
sides all these, there were found about the same time, but not quite 
so deeply situated in the quarry, a large assemblage of specimens, 
each of which has some resemblance to the tapering extremity of 
an ordinary sized haddock, after the tail fin has been cut off. Some 
"of them, however, are a great deal narrower, and others a great 
deal broader, but always tapering towards a point, though the broad 
ones are sometimes curved laterally, so as to present a figure some- 
what resembling the falcated extremity of a heavy hedging-bill. The 
substance of them is the dark-red sandstone of the quarry, but they 
have a sort of glazing of red clayey matter, on which are left the 
impressions of diamond-shaped or triangular scales or plates, which 
have partly overlapped each other, and which present a surface 
somewhat like that of a fossil palm. These singular remains were 
all found intermingled in the'same spot, as near each other as though 
they had belonged to one individual animal, but each so like the 
caudal extremity of a fish, as rather to intimate that they had be- 
longed to different individuals. Whether they belonged to one or 
more, no trace has yet been found of any other part of the animal 
structure with which they were connected. 

No ores worth mentioning have yet been found in any of the 
rocks already described. There are, however, traces of oxide of 



K RROL. 



377 



iron in the white sandstone, but no nodules of ironstone in any of 
the few specimens which the writer has had an opportunity of 
examining. It may here be proper to remark, that this white sand- 
stone bears a strong affinity to the white blotches in the more super- 
ficial, or new red sandstone, found at the distance of fully five miles 
in the adjoining parish of Inchture. These blotches are generally 
circular, but sometimes oval, and sometimes oblong ; and they ap- 
pear alike frequently, whether by a vertical or a horizontal section 
of the strata. The circular ones are always found to result from 
little spherical masses, of which they are the section ; and it is pro- 
bably from a section of these, compressed while in a soft state, 
that the other figures of the blotches have been produced. These 
white sandstone balls are much more compact and hard than the 
red sandstone around them ; and, in the very centre of them, there 
is commonly found a small nucleus of iron ore, seldom larger than 
a pea. 

Almost the only simple minerals which have been met with in 
the rocks mentioned in this account are calc-spar, quartz, and cal- 
cedony. 

The alluvial deposit which immediately covers the solid rocks 
in the particular localities already referred to, is a mixture of gra- 
vel and red clay. With regard, however, to the alluvial deposits 
of the parish in general, it may be stated, first, with respect to the 
more elevaled parts, that, so far as can be ascertained by the sink- 
ing of wells, some of them 30, 40, and one of them even 60 feet 
in depth, the only substance met with, after passing through the 
till or gravel, which is immediately under the soil, is an indurated 
clay or rock-marl, as the inhabitants have called it, which becomes 
very friable after continued exposure to the air. After getting a 
few feet below the surface, this was the only material which was 
found in digging even the deepest of these wells, with the excep- 
tion of three pretty large boulder-stones, which were met with at 
different depths. In the immediate neighbourhood of the lime- 
stone quarry at Murie, there was, upwards of sixty years ago, a 
marl pit, which, however, was never wrought to any great extent, 
and which has long since been covered with a young plantation. 

But, secondly, as to the deposits in the other or carse districts of 
the parish, at least in the lower or eastern division, it may be 
stated that, soon after passing through the soil, we come to a pale 
blue clay, which continues for -20 or 30 feet, then to a bed of peat, 
varying from 3 to 18 inches in thickness ; and then to quicksand, 



PliHTH-SHlllE. 



or sometimes to rolled gravel. The writer is not aware that anv ani- 
mal remains have been found in these deposits, with the exception 
of" those sea shells which are met with in great abundance, not in 
the clay, but in the silt, or thin earthy deposit, which is 15 or 16 
feet below the present surface, and not more than 5 or 6 feet above 
the ordinary high-water mark. These shells have not been found 
higher up the Tay than opposite the village of Errol ; but in the 
lower parts of the parish they are found, not only in the banks of 
the river, but considerably inland, toward the very centre, indeed, 
of the Carse. Several different species have been discovered, all 
having their counterparts in the living representatives which now 
inhabit the contiguous shores. Their existence in such a situation 
does not prove, perhaps, that the bed of the river was at one time 
as high as they now are, — for they may have been carried into their 
present locality by some extraordinary inundation, — but it' does 
prove that since they were there deposited, the surface of the dis- 
trict has been greatly elevated by alluvial deposition. Connected 
with the peat, various trees, chiefly of oak, have been found im- 
bedded and in good preservation. The writer has conversed with a 
man who told him that he recollects distinctly of hearing his fa- 
ther state that, at a period about forty years ago, the latter was en- 
gaged in digging in a piece of very low ground on the estate of 
Megginch, not many feet beneath the surface, when he and his 
fellow labourer found a small anchor, the figure of which was tole- 
rably preserved, but which mouldered down or went to pieces when 
lifted. 

Such a circumstance as that now mentioned has sometimes been 
adduced in support of the opinion, that the bed of the Tay was at 
one period on the north, as it is now on the south side of the 
Carse. Any one, however, who carefully examines the whole of 
the particular localities, will perceive that to such an opinion there 
are insuperable objections. But there is proof in abundance, if 
not that the whole district must, at one time, have been an immense 
lake or extended estuary, at least, that the greater part of it must 
have been under water. The principal elevations in the Carse 
have been distinguished for time immemorial, by names which im- 
ply that they had at first been islands. During this state of things, 
boats must, of course, have been required for the convenience of 
the inhabitants, a circumstance which might account for such a dis- 
covery as that to which we have now adverted. The gradual man- 
ner, too, in which these circular islands were enlarged, by the gra-

dual subsidence and. draining of the water, may partly account for 
the curvilinear form of the ridges, which has been so universally 
and inviolably maintained in the agriculture of the Carse lands, 
and which no one has hitherto attempted to alter, by casting the 
finest and richest of the lori£ cultivated soil which was accumu- 
lated on the crown of the ridges, into an opposite position, without 
ultimately incurring the serious evil of a greatly diminished rate of 
production. 

The various soils appear to have been transported. On the 
elevated parts of the parish, the prevailing soil is a black earth, in 
some places of great depth, but in others very shallow. The sub- 
soil in these elevated situations is generally till or clay, but some- 
times it is gravelly or sandy ; the soil, in the one case, being natu- 
rally wet, and in the other dry. In the low lands, the soil is clayey, 
confaining, in some situations, a considerable intermixture of sand, 
and being in all greatly modified and improved by long-continued 
cultivation, and the constant addition of decayed vegetable and ani- 
mal productions. 

Tbe only plants which need be noticed as particularly attached 
to the soil, are the Ar undo phragmites, now Phragmites communis, 
or common reed ; Scirpus lacusiris, or tall bullrush ; and the Scir- 
pus triqueter, or triangular club-rush. The first of these is to be 
found in all the moist localities of the Low Carse, and it was many 
years ago regularly planted on the low shores of the Tay, to check 
the encroachments which the tides were then constantly making on 
the banks. 

Zoology. — This parish contains no particular quadrupeds, but is 
rich in birds. The following are the rarest species : starling, rose- 
coloured ouzel, snow bunting, lesser redpole, goldfinch, hoopoe, 
kingfisher, turtle dove, quail, and wild swan. The more ample 
list furnished by H. M. Drummond, Esq. we regret our limited 
space prevents us inserting. We may here notice, that after 
the long intense heat of the summer 1826, the wheat, crops 
were, for four successive years, but especially for the years 
1828, 1829, and 1830, very grievously injured by the depreda- 
tions of the wheat-fly, myriads of which deposited their eggs in 
the soft pulpy ears of the grain just before it came into flower, 
and which were no sooner hatched into maggots than they began 
to devour it. During those three years, it has been computed 
that, at an average, not less than a third or fourth of the wheat 
crop was rendered useless, and that, in the whole district of the

Carse of Gowrie, including the Braes, a pecuniary loss was thus 
sustained of not less than L. 96,000. 

Botany. — There are few rare plants found in this parish. The 
onlv ones worth mentioning: have been communicated to the writer 
by Mr Gorrie, Annat Garden. They are the following : Pyrota 
rotund if alia, or round-leaved winter-green ; Dianthus Armeria, 
or Deptford pink ; Ranunculus hirsutus, or pale hairy Crowfoot ; 
and Bidens tripartita, or trifid bur-marigold. 

There are no forests in the parish, and few plantations. Of 
the latter, the chief are those which were planted upwards of 
fifty years ago for the farther protection of the banks of the 
river against the action of the tide, — those which have been em- 
ployed for shelter and ornament around the pleasure-grounds of 
the principal proprietors, — and those which have been found to 
be the fittest occupants of some of the poorer parts of the soil. 
In the first of these situations, nothing but hard-wood has been 
employed ; in the second, there is a large proportion of larch, 
which, however, does appear to agree with the dampness of the 
soil ; and in the third, it has been found expedient to admit a ma- 
jority of Scotch firs. The species of tree to which the strong 
soils of the Carse are best adapted, is decidedly the oak. Of this, 
some very noble specimens are to be seen, both in Errol Park 
and in some of the other properties. There is one, a little to the 
east of the park-wall at Megginch, which measures 13 feet in cir- 
cumference, at the height of about 3 feet from the ground. At 
Murie, there is a very aged Lammas pear-tree, which has a cir- 
cumference of 12 feet, at the height of 4| feet from the surface. 
Above that, it had divided itself into three main branches or arms, 
one of which has been torn off, at a distant date, by the violence 
of some tempest. The tallest pear-trees, however, in the parish 
are to be found at Seaside, and on the contiguous property of Bog- 
mill. In the orchard at the latter place, there is one which can- 
not be less than 50 feet high, and another which, though not so 
lofty, is the oldest fruit tree in the Carse, its age being thought 
to be not less than 300 years. At the former place, there is ano- 
ther pear-tree, which presents a very singular appearance. It also 
is of great antiquity. The height of the trunk, before it divides 
into two principal branches, is fully 15 feet. At 51 feet from the 
ground, the diameter of the trunk is not less than 3 feet 6 inches, 
and at twice that height it is still nearly 3 feet in diameter. But 
the interior of the trunk is so completely decayed, that a person of 

4 



Ell 110 L.

ordinary stature may walk through it, almost without stooping. The 
two main branches seem prolonged down to the ground, touching 
each other, and adhering only above the middle of the stem, and 
thus forming a kind of St Andrew's cross, consisting, at the lower 
extremities, of little less than the rigid bark. This venerable re- 
presentative of past ages still continues to bear fruit. To these 
notices, it may be added, that there are at Megginch Castle a few 
holly trees, one of which is at the base 5 feet in circumference, 
while another has shot up as straight as the mast of a ship, to the 
height of fully 50 feet. There is, at the same place, a very large 
walnut tree, and an aged thorn, the trunk of which is 6 feet in 
circumference. 

II. — Civil History. 
The earliest accounts of the parish of Errol are derived from 
popular tradition. 

Family of Hay. — Referring to the tradition respecting the family 
of Hay, noticed in the Account of Redgorton in this work, p. 175, 
we have to observe, that whatever value be attached to this tradition, 
the oldest charter belonging jto the estate of Errol, and constitut- 
ing it a barony, was granted in the time of William the Lion, who 
reigned from 1166 to 1214. It farther appears, that in 1255, 
Gilbert de Hay of Errol disposed to his brother William, the 
property of Leys,— a property lying within the parish, and pre- 
viously forming the eastern portion of his own. This property of 
Leys is the only one in the parish which continues to the present 
day in the possession of the lineal descendant of the original pro- 
prietor. It is reported that the second and third sons of the 
grandson of the said William Hay of Leys became the first pro- 
prietors of two of the oldest estates in the neighbourhood. The 
eldest branch of the Hay family was created Earl of Errol in 
1452, in the time of James II. The estate and the earldom con- 
tinued united till the days of Charles I., when the noble posses- 
sor, after having lived in great splendour, was obliged to sell the 
estate in 1634. This eldest branch of the family ended in a fe- 
male, who, in 1720, was married to the Earl of Kilmarnock. 

The writer is not aware of any written accounts of the parish, 
either ancient or modern, except the brief description which is to 
be found in the former Statistical Account of Scotland. He has 
had an opportunity, however, of consulting the fifth and sixth vo- 
lumes of an ancient geographical work in folio, written in Lathi, 
and published at Amsterdam in 1662, in the latter of which a

pretty full account is given of the geography of Scotland, and, 
among other districts, of the Carse of Gowrie. These volumes 
are enriched by a series of provincial maps, which are very minute 
and very curious, and show with what tenacity even the most ob- 
scure hamlets retain the same names from generation to genera- 
tion. It unfortunately happens, that the map for this district has 
been abstracted, but several of the localities jn the outskirts can 
be traced in the maps of the adjoining districts. The volumes in 
question are in the possession of Vice-Admiral Drummond of 
Meggineh. 

The lowest parts of the parish, and that which, as being often 
flooded and the last in being drained, was called the Myres, were, 
in 1742, by order of the Court of Session, divided among the 
principal proprietors. They amounted in all to some hundreds 
of acres. 

Remarkable Occurrences. — The most memorable and important 
occurrence within the memory of man, was the formation, about 
forty-six years ago, of the great turnpike road through the carse, 
between Perth and Dundee, with the branches connecting it with 
the principal harbours on this side of the Tay, such as the Pow 
of Errol, now Port- Allen, and Polgavie. 

Another occurrence worthy of notice is connected with the state 
of the river, during the intense, frost which prevailed in the month 
of January 1814. So completely was the Tay, at that time, 
blocked up, with an accumulation of ice, that, although the dis- 
tance between Port- Allen and Newburgh is fully two miles, the 
passage was made by several persons on foot, and so near the time 
when the storm broke up, that some who crossed the river in this 
manner returned, next tide, or at least next day, by the passage- 
boat  

Eminent men. — Of distinguished individuals connected with this 
parish, we may mention the Right Honourable the Earl of North- 
esk, who resided in it as proprietor of the estate of Errol, at least 
from the year 1697 till 1714. We may also mention the Rev. 
John Strang, D. D., who w as minister from 1614 to 1626, when 
he was translated to be Principal of the University of Glasgow ; 
and in particular the Rev. Lauchlan Macintosh, of Dalmunzie, 
who was minister of this parish from 1724 till 1744. After the

death of the Rev. Samuel Nainie, in the month of December 
1720, the heritors and kirk-session, although the act of Queen 
Anne, restoring patronage, had been in operation since 1712, 
proceeded, agreeably to the usage under the previous act of Wil- 
liam and Mary, 1690, to make choice of and call a minister to the 
vacant charge, — the patron not interfering in the matter. Several 
individuals were proposed, and some of them called, but various 
difficulties arose in the church courts, to their settlement. At last, 
in April 1722, an unanimous call was addressed to Mr Macintosh, 
fcbsen minister at Dunning. The presbytery of Auchterarder re- 
fused to loose him from his existing charge. A new series of at- 
tempts were then made by the heritors, elders, and people of Er- 
rol, to obtain a minister, but still without success, latterly because 
no individual could be found who commanded a decided majority 
in his favour. In these circumstances, a second unanimous call 
was addressed to Mr Macintosh in November 1724 ; and the con- 
sent of his presbytery having then been obtained, he was, to the 
great delight of the parish, admitted to his new charge by the 
presbytery of Perth, jure devoluto, February 17, 1725. 

This eminent man was one of the three ministers who were 
sent by the Commission of the General Assembly, 1734, "toad- 
dress the King and Parliament, for obtaining relief from the gre- 
vience of patronage." In 1736, he was chosen moderator of the 
General Assembly ; and, in 1743, he was urged by many mini- 
sters again to become a candidate for that distinguished office ; 
but declined it. The same year, while attending to his duties in 
that venerable court, he was seized with an epidemic, then raging 
in Edinburgh, from the effects of which he never recovered. He 
died on the 13th of May 1744. 

The only other person to be mentioned in this place is John 
Barclay, A. M. f a native of the parish of Muthill, but who, in 1760, 
became assistant to the Rev. James Jobson, minister of Errol, 
and in this capacity resided in it for some time. This individual 
afterwards became famous as the founder of the sect of the Bereans. 

Land-owners.— The chief of the present land-owners of the pa- 
rish are :— John Lee Allen, Esq. of Errol; Lieutenant- Colonel 
Allen, of Inchmartin; the Right Honourable Lord Kinnaird ; 
Miss Spence Yeaman, of Murie ; David Balfour Hay, Esq. of 
Leys; Vice- Admiral Drummond, of Megginch ; Laurence Crai- 
gie, Esq. of Glendoick ; Charles Hunter, Esq. of Glencarse and 
Seaside; James Matthew, Esq. of Waterybutts; Society of Ship-

masters of Dundee ; Henry Black Stewart, Esq. of Balnakeilly ; 
and .John Gardiner, Esq. of Carse-Grange. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers commence m the 
times of the Reformation. Including the session records, and the 
accounts connected with the management of the poor, all of which 
are generally imbodied in different parts of the same volume, 
they extend to thirteen volumes, coming down to the year 1837 
inclusive. The first entry in the register of baptisms is dated 
December 27, 1553. Till within the last three years, there is no 
separate register of deaths or burials, except from 1783 to 1789. 
In the session records, there is a blank between the years 1654 
and 1666 ; and from the year 1788 to 1819, there are only a few 
detached minutes, but no regular record. 

The early records of the kirk-session contain many curious en- 
tries. We hope to be indulged in extracting a few lines from 
them, at a period of great interest to the church and the nation— 
that of the glorious Revolution. 

 Sabbath— Sept. 8th 1689.— No sermon because the troopers 
came into ye toun with sound of trumpet and dissipat the people ; 
and the Minr. was informed yt they would offer violence to him." 

The minister here referred to was Dr John Nicolson, who was 
soon after deprived, because, as appears from the minute of heri- 
tors and elders, when proceeding January 1691 to nominate and 
call a successor, he would not submit to the new Government, nor 
conform to the ecclesiastical constitution which had then been 
established. An honourable testimony, however, was borne to his 
faithfulness in the discharge of his ministerial duties. It is dated 
November 1, 1689, and is expressed in the following quaint but 

affecting terms : — 

« The session this day with ane voice declared, yt the doctor 
had been very painful and faithful in ye exercise of all the points 
and parts of ye ministerial function among yem."  

Antiquities — There are few antiquities in the parish. Similar to 
the large stone, at the village of Hawkstane, just within the bound- 
ary of the parish of St Madoes, are two others in this parish, both in 

• To this account of the parochial records may be appended a list of all who have 
been ministers of the parish since the Reformation. This list, the accuracy of which 
has beea fully verified, was made out in the year 1822 by Mr Scott, preacher, who 
was at that time contemplating a general index of this kind for every parish in Scot- 
land The dates refer to the year of admission : 15—, Alexander Dunmuir.

elevated and conspicuous situations; the one in the west, near 
Clashbennie, and the other in the north-east, near Inchmartin. 
They are both quite solitary, and without any mark of art; so large 
as not to have been easily conveyed to their present situation by 
human contrivance ; and yet in such a position as to lead to the 
inference, that they were intended to be monumental — intended to 
mark a place of importance, or to perpetuate the remembrance of 
some memorable event. 

In the public burying-ground, there is one small monument 
sculptured over with emblematical representations, many of them 
taken from scripture, but so decayed and effaced, that neither 
name nor date can be found. It contains in a scroll the creed in 
Latin, and, in the same language, a translation of Rev. ii. 10. In 
the wall around the burying-ground, is seen the rude figure of a 
warrior in chain -armour, hewn in white sandstone. The arms are 
bent up on the breast, the palms of the hands having originally- 
been made to meet, in the attitude of adoration. The figure has 
evidently been meant to be in a supine position, but when built 
into the modern wall, chiefly, it would seem, for the purpose of 
preservation, it has been stuck into it in a vertical position ; and 
as, for the sake of stability, it has been sunk in the ground, nearly 
up to the knees, the appearance which it thus exhibits is exceed- 
ingly grotesque. Two of the ministers of the parish, Mr Omey 
and Mr Bell, have been buried, each under a stone sarcophagus. 
Of these humble monuments, the first is adorned with variouse- 
pulchral emblems, and both of them are covered with inscriptions. 
Mr Bell had formerly been minister of the parish of Dron, in 
which parish he left, under the charge of the Presbytery of Perth, 
a few acres of land, the rental of which is devoted to the mainte- 
nance of a student of divinity in St Mary's College at St Andrews. 
He died in 1665, and on the south side of the cover of the sarco ' 
phagus, under a scroll containing these words,— Mors patet, hora 
lateU — there is a brief historical record of his ministry. 

About three miles and a half from the village of Errol, there are 

 On the north side, we have an inscription which affords a curious specimen of 
that grave quamtness of expression which is so characteristic of the taste oS 
" Death crackt this Bell, yet doth his pleasant chimino- ' a 

Remain with tliose who are their lamps a-trimming 

In spite of death, his word some  praise still sounds

Hie top of the cover contains other two lines of the same description _

at Westown, the ruins of a small Gothic church, of plain but very 
excellent workmanship, which, in one of the ancient charters of 
the estate, is called the church of the Blessed Virgin of Inchmartm. 
The ministers of Errol used to preach in it, half the day, once m 
every fortnight; but after the parish church was enlarged and the 
roads were improved, this practice was discontinued. It is not 
above fifty years, however, since the building was dismantled, nor 
nearly so long since interments have taken place in the burying- 
ground around it. Its situation is one of the most beautiful and 
picturesque that is to be seen in the whole district. The oldest 
entire building now in the parish is Megginch Castle. It bears 
the following inscription :— " Petrus Hay, mdijkium extruxit, 
A. D. 1575." 

Within the park at Murie there is an artificial mound, of a cir- 
cular form, 40 yards in diameter at the base, and about 30 feet 
diameter at the top; the height from the base being about 20 feet. 
The platform at the top is surrounded by a low turf wall, with a 
walk outside of it, and the whole is enclosed with a turf wall at the 
base, in the form of an equilateral triangle. This mound is called 
the Law-knoll. Its sides are planted with trees, and it stands at 
the head of an old avenue of lofty oaks, which leads in a straight 
line towards a place, at the distance of two miles, which is now 
called Galloioflat, but which tradition reports to have been the 
Galloic-knoll— under the idea that the one knoll was the place 
where the law was administered, and the other where it was exe- 
cuted on criminals. The Law-knoll is, in respect of height, with- 
in a few feet of the highest position in the parish. 

Modern Buildings.— The only modern building worth mentioning 
is the parish church, which was erected in 1831. The former one 
had stood only sixty-five years, and had all the appearance of being 
as substantial as it was capacious. When greatly crowded, however, 
in the evening of the communion Sabbath, June 1830, a panic 
arose as to the safety of the gallery, which had nearly been attended 
with fatal consequences. This led to an inspection of the building, 
from which it appeared that, though there was no weakness in the 
gallery itself but what might have been easily remedied, the roof 
and the walls could no longer be depended on. The new church 
is a very chaste and perfect specimen of the plain Saxon architec- 
• ture, after a plan furnished by James Gillespie Graham, Esq. 
It is in the form of a cross, intersecting a square, and has a hand- 
some square tower with pinnacles at the angles, which rise to the 



ERROL. 387 

height of 93 feet above the base of the building. The interior 
arrangements are peculiarly convenient and beautiful. It is seated 
for 1448 persons. The whole expense of the building was con- 
siderably upwards of L. 5000. 

III. — Population. 
The only way by which an estimate can be formed of the an- 
cient state of the population of the parish is that of consulting the 
baptismal register. It.appears that, even so far back as 1578, the 
number of baptisms which were registered was 59 : that in 1632 
the number was 72 ; and that in 1728, nearly a century later, it 
was no higher. Judging from a comparison of the baptismal re- 
gisters, the population of the whole parish even in 1632, must have 
been upwards of 2000; and it is known that, in point of fact, it was 
in 1743 not less than 2229. The population of the landward por- 
tion does not, at the present day, amount to more than about 1720, 
and, as the population of the village is supposed to have been near- 
ly doubled within the last hundred years, that of the former can 
scarcely, if at all, have increased. The increase in the village has 
been owing chiefly to the improvement of manufactures. Where 
any diminution has taken place in the landward part of the parish, 
it seems to have been occasioned by the uniting of two or more 
small farms into one.

Where so large a proportion of the inhabitants is employed in 
and dependent on manufactures, by the frequent and often violent 
fluctuations of which they are necessarily affected, a great deal ol 
distress is occasionally experienced. Still, however, the people 
are, in general, contented with their situation and circumstances. 

In their intellectual character, they are shrewd and deliberate, 
rather than acute. Where they have enjoyed the advantages of 
early and careful cultivation, the natural strength of their intelle 
tual powers becomes sufficiently conspicuous. In respect of moral 
character, the people, as a body, may justly be said to be decent, 
industrious, and orderly. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— The whole number of imperial acres which the 
parish contains, as nearly as can be estimated from the actual mea- 
surement of each property, is 8626, all of which are either culti- 
vated or occasionally in tillage, with the exception of those portions 
which are under wood. 

The whole amount under wood, including hedgerows, does not 
much exceed 200 acres. Very few, if any, of the trees are indige- 
nous. They are confined entirely to the poorer soils, or to the 
grounds around the residences of the principal proprietors. Ex- 
cept in two or three localities, none of those which have been plant- 
ed for economical purposes have advanced so far as to be cut foi 
timber. The young wood seems to be under good management, 
every attention being paid to its periodical thinning and pruning. 

Jl e nt. The average rent of arable land in the parish does not 

at present exceed L 3, 3s. or L. 3, 5s. per Scotch acre, which, at 
the former of these rates, is just L. 2, 10s. per imperial acre. The 
land is still generally let by the Scotch acre, and the rent now com- 
monly agreed upon for the best soil, is four bushels of wheat, six 
bushels of barley, and six bushels of oats, converted into money at 
the annual fiars prices of the county. In some instances, it is sti- 
pulated that the maximum price paid for all these three kinds and 
quantities united, shall not exceed L. 3, 17s. whatever the fiars 
prices may happen to be,— in other words, that the fiars shall regu-

late the rent, only when the price of the three quantities does not 
exceed that sum. There are no grazings in the parish except in 
the parks or enclosed grounds of three or four of the principal 
proprietors. When these are let, it is always per Scotch acre, the 
ordinary rent being L. 3, L. 3, 10s. or L. 4. Very fine pasture 
sometimes brings L. 4, 10s. per acre. 

Produce. — The principal articles of raw produce may be stated 
at the following prices, taking the average of the last seven years. 

Wheat per quarter, - L. 2 J 1 4 

Barley, - - 1 8 A 

Oats, - - . I 0 11{ 

Pease, - - - 1 7 7f 

Oatmeal per half sack, of 140 lbs. avoirdupois, 16s. 5|d. ; po- 
tatoes, 10s. per boll, of 32 stones Dutch, equal to 40 imperial 
stones or 5 cwt., which is at the rate of 2s. per cwt. 

The average price of new hay is about 8d. or 9d. per stone. 

The ordinary price of provisions is regulated by the markets of 
Perth and Dundee. 

Very little round timber, fit for mechanical purposes, is cut in the 
parish. What little there is, sells for Is. per cubic foot. Building 
stones for rubble-work can be purchased at the quarry of Clash- 
bennie, at the rate of Is. per ton ; and stones for hewn- work at the 
rate of 6d. per linear or 9d. per cubic foot, Stones for draining are 
got for 6d. per ton. Quicklime can be delivered at the shore of 
Port- Allen, at from 3s. to 3s. Gd. per boll, of 52 stones Dutch, or 
8 cwts. imperial weight. 

fVaycs, Sj-c. — The average rate of mason-work, in the erection of 
f;irm-houses, not including materials, is from L. 2 to L. 3 per rood. 
In building farm-offices the rate is from L. 1, 15s. to L. 2. The 
average rate of carpenter-work in roofing such buildings, with 
foreign timber, materials included, is from 4s. lOd. to 5s. per 
square yard. When home timber is employed, the rate is about 

per yard. Flooring, including joists, when of foreign timber, is 
about 5s. Gd. per yard ; and when of home timber, it is about 4s. 

Live-Stock. — Very few sheep are reared in the parish. Of cattle, 
no more are reared or kept than are required to consume the 
grass, straw, and turnips which are raised on the farms, and neces- 
sary for turning these productions to proper account. Much atten- 
tion is paid to the quality of the horses which are reared for agri- 
cultural work. 

Husbandry.— The general character of the husbandry pursued 
in the parish, seems to be skilful and judicious. About two-thirds

of the soil consist of clay, and the other third consists of what is 
called black land, being in general a fine vegetable mould. Of the 
former, Jive-sevenths annually are kept under a grain crop, and of 
the latter, seven-tivelfths, according to the following method of ro- 
tation : In the clay, the rotations, generally speaking, are these 
seven : fallow, wheat, beans and pease, wheat, barley, grass, and 
oats, or, in some rare instances, wheat. In the black land, they 
are these six : potatoes, wheat, turnips and pease, barley, grass, 
and oats or wheat. From the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient 
crop of grass so often as once in six or seven years, some farmers 
have introduced a rotation of sevens, even in the black land, and of 
eights in the clay ; while others seem to think that, adhering to the 
ordinary rotations, in regard to the other crops, it would be better, 
where circumstances admit, to divide the land so that this import- 
ant production should not be required from the same soil, more 
than once in every alternate course of rotation. 

The drilling of grains has seldom been attempted in this parish. 
At the time of the former Statistical Report, indeed, and for se- 
veral years afterwards, the drilling of beans, with the usual inter- 
mixture of pease, was a common practice, and some recent at- 
tempts have been made to revive it in the district. These, how- 
ever, have been without success, from the prevailing opinion, that 
the increase of crop would not afford sufficient remuneration for 
the increase of labour and expense. One plough is required for 
about every thirty Scotch acres that a farm may contain. Not- 
withstanding the curvilinear direction of the ridges, no more beau- 
tiful specimens can anywhere be seen than in this district, of equal 
and regular ploughing. 

The rate of production on the best soils is very high. Fallow 
wheat has often made a return of 16 bolls per Scotch acre, and 
even considerably more. Oats, also, in fine soil, and under fa- 
vourable circumstances, have sometimes yielded 1G bolls. Barley 
has yielded 13 bolls ; and pease and beans have occasionally pro- 
duced 14 or 15 bolls. All these, however, are much above the 
average. Taking in all kinds of grain and all kinds of soil, the 
average rate of production is thought to be only between 7 and 
8 bolls per Scotch acre. Hay is sometimes so abundant a crop, 
that even the first cutting yields between 300 and 400 stones per 
acre ; but even 300 is reckoned a good crop, and considerably 
above the average. 

 The Perthshire wheat boll is equal to 3 bushels, 3 pecks, 1 .9442 gallons, impe- 
rial measure ; and the boll for other grain is equal to 5 bushels, 3 pecks, 0.6009 gal- 
lons. The Scotch is to the imperial acre as 126 to 100.

Within the last ten or twelve years, many hundreds of acres have 
been drained so thoroughly that a drain has been laid in- every al- 
ternate, and sometimes in every furrow. The drains are all of the 
narrow wedge shape. 

The general duration of leases is for nineteen years. 

The state of farm-buildings has of late years been very greatly 
and very generally improved. 

Embankments. — But the principal improvement connected with 
agriculture, which has recently been made in this parish, is one 
by which the largest proprietor, John Lee Allen, Esq. has, by an 
extensive embankment, succeeded in recovering from the river Tay 
and adding to his estate, about a hundred imperial acres of deep, 
rich soil. Till about forty-five years ago, the river continued to 
make, every year, very serious encroachments on the land, — en- 
croachments which were aided by the injudicious practice which 
then prevailed, of letting all the furrows discharge the surface 
water over the abrupt earthy banks, instead of collecting it into 
transverse drains, and directing it obliquely into the lower part of 
the shores. So serious were the inroads which the river had made 
on the land on this side, that the farm-house and offices on the 
farm of Daleally had, at two different periods been moved back- 
wards to a more inland situation, the present one being still with- 
in 60 yards of the bank. Nay, so serious were these inroads, that 
they began to affect the value of the property so circumstanced. 
A contiguous estate of about 300 acres was sold partly from the 
idea of its insecurity, and, at all events, for a sum greatly below 
its actual value. 

Soon after this transaction, however, not only was greater care 
employed in conducting the surface water from the furrows, but 
the banks were sloped down and planted, — fenced at the top by a 
hedge, and protected, by a retaining stone wall at the bottom, 
against the direct action of high tides. Besides all these expe- 
dients, projecting dikes, at convenient distances, were built from 
the bank towards the stream, for the purpose of retaining the co- 
pious sediment which was daily deposited on the lower side of them 
by the retiring waters. And, lastly, a broad belting of reeds was 
planted all along the shores, which, besides serving the important 
objects of breaking, in some degree, the action of the tides in 
summer, contributed at all times, by their strong and interwoven 
roots, to give stability to the soil in which they grew; while the 
amount of decayed vegetable matter, annually accruing from the 



392 



PERTHSHIRE. 



refuse of their stems, when they were cut for economical purposes, 
was gradually adding to the elevation of the surface. 

These reeds, it may be mentioned, were originally planted by 
dibbling at the expense of L. 12 per Scotch acre. The average 
produce per acre has been about 500 bundles, each of 36 or 37 
inches circumference. The expense of cutting, binding, and car- 
rying them out, lias been from 3s. 6d. to 4s. per 100 bundles, the 
rope-yarn being furnished by the proprietor. The average price 
at which those of the best quality have been sold for thatch is 
L. 1, 5s. per hundred bundles; and the price of those of inferior 
quality, now chiefly used in covering drains, is about 15s. per 100. 
The average number of both qualities yearly raised in the parish, 
before the recent embankment was made, was not less than 40,000 
bundles. 

The first two reaches of the embankment, both of them to the 
west of Port- Allen, when taken together, extend to fully a mile in 
length. The average breadth of the space enclosed is about 200 
yards. They were begun and nearly finished in 1836 ; but in the 
course of the winter, and before the work was quite completed, a 
high tide broke in at two or three places, and did considerable da- 
mage, which was not thoroughly repaired till the spring of the 
present year. The width of the embankment at the bottom, is 40 
feet, and the height 11 feet. It is 2 feet broad at the top, the 
general level of which is about 3 feet above the highest tides. 
The slope of the embankment is thus at the rate of nearly 4 feet 
in width for each foot in height. The outside of it, however, to 
the height of about 4 feet, is only a little inclined from the per- 
pendicular, that part of it consisting of a strong dry-stone wall. 
Above this height, the slope of the outside is the same as that of 
inside, and is protected, moreover, by a rude causeway of stones 
on the surface. In both divisions of the embankment, which was 
constructed in 1836, the whole earthy material was taken from the 
contiguous soil itself, of the area which it was the object of the 
undertaking to recover. This was a great sacrifice. For about 
30 yards immediately within the embankment, the soil has been 
excavated to a depth of 2 or 3 feet, so that what remains beneath, 
must, for the present, be in a great measure unproductive. The 
whole area enclosed, however, is about 70 imperial acres, and it 
is already bearing a crop of oats, which, in spite of the reeds that 
have still sprung up in the midst of it, has been sold at the ave- 
rage rate of between L. 8 and L. 9 per Scotch acre. 

In the course of the present year 1837, another embankment 



ICRROL. 



393 



has been constructed along the shore to the east of Port- Allen, 
which extends considerably more than a quarter of a mile in length, 
and encloses a space which is fully wider than that on the west. 
The general plan and proportions of the work are the same as in 
that already described ; but the state of the ground has, in the 
latter case, been more favourable, and the rich soil immediately 
within the embankment has been greatly saved, by cutting down 
the steep clayey banks of the former boundary, and employing the 
material thus procured in forming the foundation of the new. 
When this part of the undertaking is finished, Mr Allen will have 
recovered about one hundred imperial acres ; and this is only the 
commencement of a process which by degrees may be carried to a 
much greater extent. The rest of the shores do not yet appear 
to be quite ready for embanking, but when this shall be the case, 
and supposing just the same breadth to be enclosed along the 
whole, the amount would not be less than another hundred acres. 
To facilitate such a result, a strong projecting stone dike has been 
put out between one side of his property and that of Murie, which 
intersects it on the west,- and another between it and that of Sea- 
side on the east. These walls are about three feet above the or- 
dinary high-water mark ; and the latter extends in, towards the 
channel of the river, not less than 600 yards. At the same time, 
smaller intermediate dikes have been built for the same purpose ; 
and the embankments already executed will afford further facili- 
ties for prosecuting the same plan, and will prepare the way for 
the erection of others, by which they themselves may be enclos- 
ed and superseded, or rather levelled for the enriching of the new- 
ly acquired territory. Not many years can elapse, when all the 
three properties contiguous to the river must in this way receive an 
extensive and most valuable increase. 

Quarries. — The only quarry now wrought in the parish, is the 
sandstone quarry at Clashbennie, in the mode of working which 
there is nothing peculiar. The quantity of rock annually quar- 
ried and disposed of is between 4000 and 5000 tons. 

Fishings.— -The only fishings are the salmon and the smelt, or 
sparling fishings. They belong exclusively to three proprietors, 
only one of whom attempts a fishing of the latter kind. The ave- 
rage annual rent of the principal salmon fishing is about L. 100 ; 
that of the second, about L. 20 ; and that of the third, little more 
than L. 10. The rent of the sparling fishing is also about L. 10. 

Gross Amount of Raw Produce.— The average gross amount of 



394 



PERTHSHIRE. 



raw produce annually raised in the parish, as nearly as can be as- 
certained, may be stated under the following heads : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man, or the 

domestic animals, . . •  45,600 

potatoes and turnips cultivated in the fields, • 6500 

hay almost all cultivated, . • 9300 

gardens and orchards, . . • 1260 

fisheries in the Tay, . • • 560 

annual thinning of plantations and occasional felling of wood, 50 

a sandstone juarry, .... 200 

reeds, .  • 470 

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, £ 63,940 

The valued rent of the parish is L. 16,982, 3s. 4d. Scots. The 
real rent in the year 1829 was L. 26,000 Sterling, including rents 
of houses and feus ; but, at the present time, it scarcely amounts 
to L 24,000. 

Manufactures. — The principal branch of manufacture carried 
on in the parish, is that of different kinds of linen cloth. The 
only other one, indeed, is the manufacture of a species of soft 
coarse canvas, made from a sort of secondary hemp, and intend- 
ed for bags or coverings in the package of goods. In these manu- 
factures, there are upwards of 300 persons employed as weavers, 
exclusive of those who are employed in spinning and winding. Of 
these 300, more than one-third are women. 

Living in a country village, or in rural situations throughout the 
parish, the operatives do not seem to suffer any injury to their 
health, from their employment. Nor is there any evidence that 
they have been injured in their morals. 

Navigation. — Besides the daily passageboat between Port- Allen 
and Newburgh, which is fitted also for the transmission of lime, 
timber, iron, farm-produce, and other commodities, there is but 
one vessel which belongs to the port now mentioned, the only one 
in this parish. That vessel is chiefly employed in the importation 
of lime and coals, and in the exportation of grain and potatoes. 
Various other vessels, however, are occasionally employed in carry- 
ing on the trade of this port. The quantity of lime annually im- 
ported into the parish, though not all at Port- Allen, is not less 
than 5000 bolls. The boll consists, as already stated, of 52 stones 
Dutch. 

The quantity of coals annually imported at the same place, is 
about 700 tons of Scotch, and 300 tons of English. 

The harbour dues are at the rate of Id. per ton on articles in 
general, and d. per boll of lime. These dues were, till lately, 
levied by the proprietor, on whose property the harbour is situated ; 



tillltOL. 



395 



but they have recently been claimed by the city of Perth. The 
proprietor, however, has the acknowledged right of the ferry to 
Nevvburgh, and lets it along with a house for the boatman, at the 
annual rent of about L. 20. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Perth, which is at 
the distance of ten miles. The principal intercourse, however, is 
with Dundee, from the extensive manufactures of which, almost all 
those which are carried on in this parish are derived. 

Besides the village of Errol itself, there are three others Carse- 
Grange, Westown, and Lee-town. Of these, the last mentioned is 
the largest, although even this does not contain a population much 
above 100 individuals. Chapelhill and Glendoick are hamlets 
rather than villages. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office at Flatfield, 
which is on the public road, almost immediately below the village 
of Errol, and at the distance of about a mile and three quarters. 
Besides this, there has for many years been a receiving-house in 
the village, between which place and the office, a runner goes every 
morning ; and since the month of October last, the postmaster him- 
self has been in the practice of receiving and delivering letters in 
the village. 

The length of turnpike roads in the parish is about nine miles. 
There are besides the mail, two public coaches which travel on 
the great turnpike road. 

The only harbour yet capable of being made use of, is that of 
Poi t- Allen. Its present is rather a dilapidated state. The em- 
bankment, however, which is now going on will, among other be- 
nefits, serve to deepen the channel, and facilitate the entrance of 
vessels into the harbour, till such time as steps are taken for com- 
pleting the new pier and harbour, about three-quarters of a mile 
farther down the river, and so much nearer the village of Errol. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is on 
a gently rising ground, at the north-east end of the village of Er- 
rol. There is no place which could have been more convenient 
for the greater part of the population, with the exception of that 
on which the former church was erected, but which could not 
have afforded a sufficient area for the new, without an interfer- 
ence with the repositories of the dead in the surrounding b'ury- 
ing-ground, which it was most desirable to avoid. Its distance from 
the extremities of the parish does not exceed three and a quarter, 



396 



PERTHSHIRE. 



or three and a half miles, except at one place, where the distance is 
between four and five miles ; but where there are not more than 
five or s ix families. It was built in 1831, and is in the best possible 
repair. The only benefactions on record do not exceed L. 600, 
the interest of which is devoted to assist in the support of the poor. 
There is nothing particularly interesting, connected with the his- 
tory of these charitable bequests. The number of persons, for 
whom the church affords accommodation, is 1448. 

All the sittings are possessed by the occupants, free of seat rent. 
With the exception of those which are allocated to the poor, and 
of a certain proportion of the communion table seats, which has 
been assigned for the promiscuous occupancy of those parishioners 
who neither possess nor are connected with any farm or pendicle, 
they are all apportioned to particular individuals ; but no heritor 
derives any emolument from any of the sittings ; neither do the 
heritors as a body. ■ 

The manse was built in 1798, and repaired in 1820. 

The extent of the glebe, including the ground occupied by the 
manse, offices, and garden, is 4 acres, 2 roods, 11 falls, Scotch 
measure; but not less than 2£ roods have been lost in the con- 
si ruction of a road to the manse, and by the establishment of a right 
of servitude over another part of the glebe. The annual value of 
the glebe and garden may be between L. 15 and L. 20. 

The amount of the stipend, not including L. 8, 6s. 8d. allowed 
for communion elements, is 9 chalders of barley, and 9 chalders 
of oatmeal, at the highest fiars prices of the county. The average 
value of these quantities of barley and meal, for the last ten years, 
has not exceeded L. 273, Is. 8d. 

There are three Dissenting chapels in the parish. Two of them 
belong to the United Secession Church, and the other belongs to 
the Relief Church. Their ministers are paid out of the seat rents, 
and in as far as these are inadequate to make the stipulated sums, 
the deficiency is supplied by contributions among the members. In 
the case of the oldest of the three, the sum to which the minister 
is entitled, is L. 130, exclusive of a free house and garden. In the 
case of both the others, the stipend is now only L. 80, with the 
ordinary addition of a free house and garden. These statements 
are made on the authority of information which the writer believes 
to be authentic, though not official. 

 1 Chalcler of bai ley is equal to 11 qrs. 5 bush. 0 pk. 1.G150 gal. imperial mea- 
sure ; one chalder of oatmeal is exactly equal to 1C0 stones.

There are four or live Episcopal families in the parish, but 
there is no Episcopal chapel. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 
467 ; and the number of persons of all ages belonging to it is 2025. 
The Episcopalians generally attend the parish church. The num- 
ber of families attending the chapels of the Dissenters is, as near- 
ly as can at present be ascertained, 218; and the number of per- 
sons of all ages belonging to them is 906, exclusive of the very 
few who are not known to belong to any denomination. Divine 
service, both in the Established Church and in the Dissenting 
chapels, is generally well attended. The whole number of commu- 
nicants belonging to the Established Church, is 996. The ave - 
rage number of those who actually communicate every year is, in 
the month of June, 815 ; and in the month of November, nearly 
700. 

Societies. — Of societies for religious purposes, there is, in con- 
nection with the Established Church, a parochial association, the 
object of which is not only to lend its annual assistance to the N 
Perthshire Bible Society, but also to promote the four schemes of 
the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The contribu- 
tions of the parochial association have consisted partly of collec- 
tions made in its behalf at church. The average yearly amount of 
these contributions has been nearly L. 20. The average amount 
of church collections for charitable purposes, exclusive of the ordi- 
nary collections for the poor, has been about L. 12. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish, exclu- 
sive of Sabbath schools, is five. Among these, there is only one 
parochial school. Two of the others are partly endowed, the one 
by the proprietor who built it on his property, and the other by a 
society or body of subscribers. The endowment, however, in both 
cases, consists only in the teacher's enjoying the privilege of a free 
house and garden, as well as the school-house. The fourth school 
is altogether unendowed. The fifth is a small school-house in 
which very young children are taught mere reading, and the girls 
the additional art of knitting, by an elderly widow. The branches 
which the parochial schoolmaster is appointed to teach, are, Eng- 
lish reading and grammar, writing, arithmetic, geography, practi- 
cal mathematics, book-keeping, French, Latin, and Greek. In 
the two schools partly endowed, the same branches are appointed 
to be taught as in the parochial school, with the exception of 
languages ; and most of these are what the masters, though not re- 



398 



PERTHSHIRE. 



quired, are sufficiently qualified to teach. The parochial school, 
for some years past, has been conducted entirely by an assistant and 
successor to the schoolmaster. The latter individual enjoys, as a 
retiring salary, the legal salary, which is the maximum, together 
with an addition, secured to him by the heritors, sufficient to make 
up to him a complete annuity of L. 40 Sterling. The assistant, 
so long as he continues in this capacity, enjoys from the heritors 
a separate and independent salary of L. 25, besides the school- 
house, which contains the legal accommodation, the schoolmaster's 
house, and the legal quantity of garden ground,  all rent free. He 
is also entitled to the whole of the school-fees. Having, moreover, 
been appointed session-clerk, he derives from this office an addi- 
tional income of not less, on an average, than L. 15 a-year. 

In the case of the other schools, the fees form the whole of the 
teacher's income, with the exception of the privileges already men- 
tioned. 

The amount of the school fees in the parochial school may, at 
an average, be about L. 45 per annum. The amount in the largest 
of the other schools, may be about L. 27 ; in the next, about L. 18; 
and in the two smallest, it cannot be more than L. 6 or L. 8. In 
all the schools, however, there are many instances in which the 
teacher finds it difficult to realize the payment of the sums which 
are due. 

Even in the parish school, the other branches, such as French 
and Latin, have very seldom been required by any of the scholars. 

At the time of the presbyterial examination of the schools in 
March 1837, the proportion of those attending them was 9 \ out 
of every 100 of the population. 

With the exception of one district, there is no part of the parish 
so distant from some one or other of the schools as to prevent the 
attendance of children. The centre of the district in question is three 
miles distant from the nearest school within the parish, although it is 
not more than half that distance from the school of the adjoining 
parish. The district contains a population of about 200 indivi- 
duals. One or two of the schools would require to be enlarged ; 
but the only additional school'which might be required would be 
in this district ; but the school fees would be quite inadequate, as 
the experiment has already proved, to support a teacher. 

In the year 1820, there were six Sabbath evening schools form-

ed in the parisn m connexion with the Established Church. 
Owing chiefly to the death of some of the teachers, and the diffi- 
culty, in some localities, of finding others to occupy their places, 
these institutions are now reduced in number to three or four. At 
present, however, there is the prospect of having them restored to 
their former number and efficiency. There is also a Sabbath 
school in connexion with each of the dissenting congregations. 

Literature. — Besides a small public subscription library, which 
was instituted in the village of Errol in the year 1824, there is a 
pretty large and valuable library connected with the Sabbath 
schools of the Established Church. It was begun in the year 
1820, and now contains 378 volumes, — a portion of which is made 
to itinerate every year among the different local schools. In two 
at least of the Dissenting congregations, there is belonging to each 
a similar institution, though not of the same extent. From all 
these sources collectively, the inhabitants of this parish must enjoy 
the privilege of having access to the perusal of not less than 1200 
volumes of useful and instructive books. This privilege, acquired 
chiefly through the repeated contributions of the people them- 
selves, appears to have been justly prized, and, in ordinary times, 
diligently improved, especially by the young, for whom, indeed, it 
was principally intended. 

Friendly Societies. — There is only one such institution in the 
parish, called " The Friendly Society of Errol." The sole ob- 
jects of this society are, 1. To afford to its members, after they 
have been in connexion with it for eighteen months, and paid all 
the sums that are due to it, a weekly allowance, when under sick- 
ness or infirmity, of not less than 6d., and not more than 4s. per 
week, according to the number of shares for which they have be- 
come contributors; and, 2. To afford an allowance for funeral 
expenses, not less than L, 1 , and not greater than L. 4, according 
to the number of shares which they have taken in this department 
of the funds, and to which they have regularly contributed from 
the time of their entrance. The society was instituted in the 
month of February 1811, and remodelled in the year 1829 ac- 
cording to the data afforded in the Report of the Committee of 
the Highland Society of Scotland. The present number of its 
members is only 39. The nature of its regulations is such as is 
calculated to promote industry, and to cherish a spirit of inde- 
pendence among its members ; but, considering the population of 
the neighbourhood, it would appear that there are few who have 



400

felt inclined, or, if inclined, who have been enabled to avail them- 
selves of its obvious advantages. 

. Savings Dank. — There is also one of these institutions in the pa- 
rish. It is called " The Errol Parish Savings Bank," and was esta- 
blished in the year 1815. The sums invested yearly, as compared 
with the sums withdrawn, will be seen by an inspection of the fol- 
lowing tabular statement from the year 1817 to the year 1831, both 
included.

The largest sum total of deposits in the bank in any one year 
was L. 346, 9s. 6d. ; and the greatest number of depositors at 
any one time has not exceeded 47. In the year 1832, a panic 
arose as to the investment of the money belonging to savings banks 
in the national funds, — in consequence of which, though not un- 
connected with other causes, more than one-half of all belonging 
to the Errol Bank was withdrawn. In the year ending June 1, 
1836, the institution began very slightly to revive, so that L. 18, 
10s. of new deposits were received ; and in the year ending in 
June 1837, a farther increase has been received of L. 16, 2s. 6d. 
— only L. 4, during the whole of these two years, 'having been 
withdrawn. The number of depositors is at present 16. They 
generally belong to the class of operatives, though there are a few 
farm labourers and servants. The existing regulations of the bank 
do not admit of any individual increasing the amount of his depo- 
sits beyond the sum of L. 10. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
for the last twenty-five years who have been receiving parochial 
aid, is 68. Of these 42 have been regular poor, and 26 occa- 
sional. At one time, in the course of that period, 1821, the 
whole who received parochial aid were so numerous as 90. At 
present, they do not exceed 56, including two lunatics in asylums, 

4 N 



ERKOL.

and four attendants, who receive nothing but in the form of wages. 
The average of the last eight years, 1829-1836, during which 
there has been a compulsory assessment, has been 5 1 regular, and 
21 occasional ; in all 72. Of the regular poor, 33 have belong- 
ed to the Established Church, and the remaining 17| to the Dis- 
senters ; while of the occasional poor, 12 have belonged to the 
Established Church, and 8 to the Dissenters. 

Taking the average of the same period, — the last eight years, 
— the total sum annually expended on the poor, regular and occa- 
sional included, has, in round numbers, been exactly L. 369 ; so 
that the average sum annually allotted to each of the above 72 is 
exactly L. 5, 2s. 6d. And as all the poor in the same circum- 
stances receive the same rate of allowance, the share of the above 
L. 369, annually received by those 46 who have belonged to the 
Establishment, has been, in round numbers, L. 235 ; while that an- 
nually received by those 26 who have belonged to the Dissent- 
ers has been L. 134, which is considerably more than one-third 
of the whole. 

The proportion of poor to the whole population, during the last 
eight years, has been exactly as 1 to 41 ; at present, notwithstand- 
ing the legal assessment, the proportion is not greater than 1 to 



52i 



During the last eight years, the average amount of annual con- 
tributions for the relief of the poor has been, as already stated, 
L. 369. Of this sum, the proportion arising from church collec- 
tions has been L. 54 ; from the interest of bequests, L. 20, 15s. ; 
from the hire of mortcloths and the parish hearse, L. 4 ; and from 
a general compulsory assessment, L. 290, 5s. This is not the 
whole sum raised by assessment, but only the sum actually expend- 
ed on the poor. The expenses of levying the money from the he- 
ritors and inhabitants, together with the business charges of a law 
agent, have amounted annually to some L. 20 or L. 30 additional. 

Of the assessment thus actually required for the poor, the pro- 
portion exigible from those inhabitants who do not attend the 
Established Church, has at no time exceeded one fifteenth of the 
whole. At present, it is not much more than one twenty-eighth ; 
andtiie sum actually exacted does not much exceed the half of this, 
or one-fifty-sixth, although to the collections for the poor they con- 
tribute no proportion whatever. 

Before the year 1828, the assessment for the poor was of a vo- 
luntary kind, although according to a scale of equalization, which 
had the general concurrence of the parties interested. Since that

date, no other mode of procuring funds has been resorted to be- 
sides those which have been sufficiently referred to in the preced- 
ing statement, As to the operation of the assessment, it must be 
confessed that, although it certainly has diminished the yearly 
amount of the ordinary collections by more than one-fourth, it has 
not hitherto been allowed to increase the number of the poor, nor 
otherwise, upon the whole, enlarge the expense of maintaining 
them. It has, however, been attended with a great deal of trouble 
and vexation. An assessment on means and substance, with all 
the delicacy that can be used, is of so inquisitorial a nature, that 
it is sure, in many instances, to give offence ; and then men's 
means and substance are so constantly varying, that the assess- 
ment lists have yearly to undergo a corresponding alteration, else 
complaints and heart-burnings, if not litigations, are the almost in- 
evitable consequences. With all the liberal and conciliatory pro- 
ceedings which have been employed, it cannot yet be said that the 
system in this parish has been working smoothly; and several 
among the heritors themselves are of opinion, that, in so far as con- 
cerns their share of the assessment as a body, it would be more ex- 
pedient to abandon the principles both of the real rent and of means 
and substance, and revert entirely to the principle of the valued 
rent ; while, with respect to that share which may be required from 
the tenants and other inhabitants, they would either leave these 
individuals to furnish it, on any principle on which themselves 
should aoree, or require them to adjust the matter in private with 
their respective landlords. Some such plan as this would not 
only save much trouble and expense, but it might even yet be the 
means of ultimately superseding a general assessment altogether, 
by stimulating and enlarging the more wholesome form of contri- 
butions by collections at church. 

Fairs. There were at one time two markets held in this parish, 

the one in the month of July, and the other in October. The 
latter has long been discontinued. The July market, though 
o-enerally attended by an immense assemblage of people from the 
whole surrounding country, is almost exclusively a hiring market. 

Inns and Ale-houses. — In the village of Errol there are eleven 
houses for the sale of ale and spirits, not more than three of which 
can be called inns. In the landward part of the parish there are 
three or four inns, besides two additional ale-houses. With one 
exception, there could not conveniently be fewer of these houses 
in the country districts than there are. With respect to the vil- 

4- 



ERUOL.

lage, however, there does not seem to be, in general, any necessity 
for a public-house to every hundred of the population. 

Fuel. — Almost the only kind of fuel which is in general use in 
the parish is coal. The Scotch is procured from the collieries on 
the Forth, and the English generally from Newcastle. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The first, though not very striking, difference between the pre- 
sent state of the parish and that which existed at the time of the 
last Statistical Account, is to be found in the increase of the po- 
pulation from 2685 to 2942, — the increase being entirely confined 
to the village of Errol. Since that time, too, the rent of land, though 
not nearly so high as it was twenty years ago, has risen from L. J, 
5s. and L. 2 to more than L. 3 per acre. The gross rental, in- 
deed, is nearly tripled, having increased from L. 8000 to nearly 
L. 24,000, — this last sum including the grounds not in lease, but 
retained in private possession by the proprietors. Of course, there 
has been a corresponding increase in the rate of wages, — those of 
farm-servants, for instance, having risen from L. 7, 7s. and L. 9, 
9s. to L. 12 and L. 15. Another difference has taken place in 
the general change of the rotation of crops from a period of six to 
a period of seven years. A great and striking improvement has 
taken place in some of the houses in the village of Errol, and es- 
pecially in the style and completeness of most farm-buildings 
throughout the parish. A more striking difference than any of 
these, and one which is likely to be most important in its conse- 
quences, is that by which a large extent of soil is in the course of 
being recovered from the Tay, where the utmost that was at- 
tempted about forty years ago, was to guard against its encroach- 
ments. One of the greatest improvements of all, however, and 
one which has, in a special manner, contributed to most of the 
others, is the increased facilities of communication, not only by the 
great turnpike road which passes through the parish, and which is 
almost at all times in a state of most admirable repair, but also by 
the multiplication and improved condition of the cross-roads. 

In the ecclesiastical state of the parish, an important change 
took place in the years 1796 and 1797, by the separation of a 
large body of parishioners from the Established Church, in con- 
sequence of an unpopular settlement. Of that body the greater 
part was formed into a congregation connected with the Relief 
denomination, although some individuals were added to the small 
congregation of Antiburghers, which had existed in Errol from an 



PERTHSHIRE. 



early period of the Secession, and still more to the Burghers. 
In some respects, this event may have been of advantage to 
the religious interests of the people, inasmuch as it would have 
been impossible for a single minister, however faithful and active, 
to have exercised any thing like an efficient pastoral superintend- 
ence over nearly 3000 persons, when almost two-thirds of them 
were dispersed over a large territorial extent. It is to be lament- 
ed, however, as having perpetuated and increased divisions in the 
Christian community. While those who have now, we regret to 
say, taken to themselves the name of Dissenters, have incurred 
the expense of supporting three ministers to labour among not 
many more than 900 individuals, each of these three, instead of 
having a geographical district assigned to him, and being placed 
in the midst of the undivided population committed to his charge, 
has to encounter the disadvantage of visiting the scattered sections 
of his little flock over the whole bounds of the parish, — nay, has 
even to penetrate into other parishes in the discharge of his duty 
towards those individuals, however few in number, who, in these 
distant localities, are connected with his congregation, and over 
whom it can rarely happen that an elder can be placed. To 
impartial men, these have appeared, and will appear, to be se- 
rious disadvantages. Had not the unhappy separation taken place 
to which reference has now been made, thoughts must by this time 
have been entertained of creating a second charge, by an eccle- 
siastical subdivision of the parish ; and it is no reflection on any 
of the existing labourers, to say, be they ever so zealous and able, 
that two such labourers, with a manageable population of 1200 or 
1500 each, within well-defined and moderate limits, would have 
done the work more effectually, more conveniently to themselves, 
and more economically to the people, than it can be done under 
present circumstances by all the four, and that, too, while far 
greater harmony and unanimity would have prevailed. 

The only other important difference which appears between the 
present and the former state of the parish, is one which relates to 
the number and support of the poor. In 1791, the number of the 
regular poor was 36 ; at present, it is 52, and for the average of 
the last eight years has been 51. The sum annually paid to the 
regular poor alone, at the former period, was L. 70 ; at present, 
not including the board of patients in lunatic asylums, it is L. 212, 
showing a greatly increased rate of allowance, occasioned partly,

but not entirely, by the increased rate of provisions. At the for- 
mer period, the annual amount of the collections at church, even 
when there were comparatively few Dissenters in the parish, was 
L. 40 ; at present, when they are 900 in number, and when an 
assessment, in one form or another, has existed for years, the col- 
lections amount annually to L. 54.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. R. S. WALKER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The ancient name of the parish seems 
to have been somewhat different from the present, as appears from 
a grant of the lands and barony of " Longforgund" or " Lonfor- 
gaund," by King Robert Bruce, in the year 1315, to Sir Andrew 
Gray of Broxmouth. The epithet long, which is quite appropriate 
to the village, and by no means unsuitable to the parish itself, is 
prefixed probably to distinguish it from two other parishes, — For- 
gan, in Fife, nearly opposite to Dundee, and Forgandenny, in 
Strathearn, another district of Perthshire. Forgan or Forgund, in 
the absence of a better or more certain derivation, has been alleg- 
ed to signify foreground, — a term, in fact, by which the parish is 
not unfitly described. The whole of it, excepting one farm, lies to 
the south of the Sidlaws, and, with a slight interruption, sweeps 
gradually downwards from that range of hills to the river Tay, by 
which it is bounded. 

The greatest length of the parish, from north-west to south- 
east, is about 9 miles. But it varies so much in breadth from 4 
miles to 1£, as to contain only about 14 square miles, or 8992 
imperial acres. It forms the eastern extremity of the Carse of 
Gowrie. It is surrounded on three sides, the west, north, and east, 
by the parishes of Inchture, Abernyte, Kettins, Lundie and Foulis, 
and Liff and Benvie ; while for its southern limit it has the Tay, 
along which it extends for four or five miles. 

Topographical Appearances and Soil.— This parish presents great 



406 



PERTHSHIRE. 



inequalities of soil as well as of surface. From the bold and rocky 
point of Kingoody, a beautiful and gently sloping bank commences, 
and stretches in a north-westerly direction, diverging farther and 
farther from the river, as it advances, till it ends somewhat abrupt- 
ly at the Snabs of Drimmie ; from which a fine view of the Carse of 
Gowrie is obtained. The low grounds lying to the south of it and 
interposed between it and the river, are as flat almost as a bowl- 
ing-green, and the heaviest crops of grain are raised upon them. 
They consist entirely of clay, and while they bring a high rent to 
the proprietors, are cultivated by the tenantry in a style of great 
excellence. The lands forming this bank are composed chiefly 
of a deep black loam, and yield a most abundant return, not only 
of wheat, barley, and oats, like the lower grounds, but also of po- 
tatoes and turnips, for which the others are very indifferently cal- 
culated. In a few spots, the soil is of a reddish colour, being a 
kind of clay mixed up with gravel, and usually termed mortar ; but 
it is also remarkably productive. The village of Longforgan is si- 
tuated on the ridge, at the height of 120 or 130 feet above the 
Tay ; of which, with the whole intermediate country to the east, 
and particularly to the south and south-west, it commands an un- 
interrupted prospect. A little to the north of it, the ground, which 
now falls off in point of quality, sinks into a hollow, from which 
it continues to ascend rapidly till it terminates in the hill of Dron, 
667 feet high. In a north-westerly direction, and at a consider- 
ably greater distance, it rises more gradually into the hills of 
Ballo and Lochton, which constitute branches of the Sidlaws, 
and are respectively 992 and 1172 feet above the level of the 
sea. The soil in the upper parts of the parish is inferior in value 
to that in the Carse, while the climate is later by ten days or a 
fortnight. In most of the farms there, however, it is dry and well 
adapted to the turnip husbandry, which is successfully prosecuted. 
But in two or three of them it differs materially, and, resting on a 
cold retentive bottom, is wet and spongy. 

Climate. — The climate generally is very salubrious, nor are 
there any distempers peculiar to the district. In spring and the 
early part of summer, cold easterly winds prevail, and then the at- 
mosphere is less genial and kindly. But the intermittent fevers, 
which were so common some fifty or sixty years ago, have entirely 
disappeared, owing in a great measure to the lands being now 
much more thoroughly drained and kept in a higher state of culti- 
vation. When any epidemic visits the neighbourhood, it is perhaps

felt more severely in a village on the margin of the river than in 
any other quarter of the parish ; and there, too, complaints of the 
chest, and glandular diseases among children, are of more frequent 
occurrence. 

Hydrography. — The Carse of Gowrie has never been prover- 
bial for either the quantity or the quality of its water. But the 
village of Longforgan, the second in it in respect of population, 
cannot be considered as ill provided with this first necessary of life. 
There are two excellent springs, one at either end of it, furnishing 
an abundant supply to its inhabitants, even in the driest seasons, be- 
sides a pump and several draw-wells ; the whole of them, however, it 
may be remarked as somewhat curious, are to the south of the public 
road; for though water has been repeatedly sought for on the north 
side of the road, and deep excavations made with this view, all the 
attempts to procure it there have hitherto been unsuccessful. The 
streams that run through the parish are inconsiderable, though 
they impel the .machinery of three corn-mills, one lint-mill, and 
some saw-mills. Its whole southern boundary, however, is wash- 
ed by the Tay ; but, in consequence of the height of the sand or 
mud banks, and the great breadth with which they stretch into the 
river, Kingoody, at its eastern extremity, is accessible, even at stream- 
tides, to no vessels drawing more than ten feet water ; while those 
drawing above six and a-half have difficulty in reaching Monorgan. 
There is a bay here, formed by two projecting points, at the distance 
of several miles from each other; and it is understood that a large 
extent of valuable ground might be gradually gained from the bed 
of the river, were proper measures adopted, and a combined and 
vigorous effort for the purpose made by the contiguous proprietors 
of the Carse ; while at the same time, the channel, which is close 
upon the opposite or Fife side, would be very materially improved, by 
having an immense body of water directed into it, which at present 
shapes its course to the northward, and is comparatively useless, 
in as far, at least, as the advantages of navigation are concerned. 
Whether such an effort will ever be put forth, remains to be seen. 
Many believe it to be quite practicable. In two of the adjoining 
parishes, considerable portions of soil have been already recover- 
ed from the Tay, and are now under crop. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The. chief land-owners are, George Paterson, 
Esq. of Castle Huntly ; and the Right Hon. Lord Kinnaird, to 
whom nearly eight-ninths of the whole valued rent belong. 



408 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Mansion- Houses. — Drimniie House, which became the residence 
of the family of Kinnaird, after the Castle of Moncur was destroy- 
ed by fire, in the beginning of the last century, stood in this pa- 
rish. It was pulled down, however, a few years ago, and not a trace 
of it is now visible. Rossie Priory, the present magnificent seat of 
his Lordship, more than supplies its place ; but the site having 
been removed about half a mile to the northward, it is just within 
the bounds of the neighbouring parish of Inchture, in the Account 
of which it will of course be adverted to. 

There are only two other mansion-houses in the parish — Mylne- 
field and Lochton. 

Parochial Registers. — There is a register of baptisms, com- 
mencing in 1635; and one of marriages in 1633, in five volumes, 
two of which are in good condition, the other three being some- 
what torn, and the writing in many places not very legible. The 
records of the kirk-session begin in 1654, and consist of eight vo- 
lumes, some of which are in a very indifferent state of preserva- 
tion. But, in so far as a judgment can be formed, they all appear 
to have been pretty regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — At Dron, on the high ground above the village, 
there are still to be seen the ruins of a chapel, which belonged to 
the Abbey of Cupar- Angus, erected in 1164 by Malcolm IV., the 
grandson and successor of David I., for a community of Cistercian 
monks. Its north and south walls have long since fallen down or 
been demolished, and only the gables remain, and these in rather 
a dilapidated state. In the west one, there is a large window, ter- 
minating in a beautiful pointed arch, which springs from a pilaster 
on either side. It is situated in a dell, through which a rivulet 
flows ; and at the foot of the rocky eminence on which it stands, 
there is a fountain of the purest and most limpid water, on which 
the severest drought makes scarcely any impression, and which 
would doubtless be rendered available in the days of Roman Ca- 
tholic superstition. Though it is now very old, a nearly direct 
road from it to the Abbey still remains open. 

In 1826, a silver coin of Robert II. or perhaps Robert III., not 
so much defaced or impaired as might be expected, was found by 
a farm-servant while employed in pulling turnips, and is now in the 
custody of his master. The legend round the head, " Robertus 
Dei gratia Scottorum Rex," can be read with little difficulty. The 
inscription on the reverse is not so easily deciphered. It is with-

out date, — the practice of recording the date on the coinage of 
Scotland not having been introduced till a subsequent reign. . 

The objects of antiquity mentioned in the last Statistical Ac- 
count, need not again be enumerated or described. But any ac- 
count of this parish, which did not embrace a particular notice of 
Castle Huntly, by far the most remarkable building in it, would 
be unsatisfactory and incomplete. It is the seat of George Pater- 
son, Esq. and there are few nobler specimens of an old baronial 
residence to be met with in Scotland. The time of its erection is 
not known with certainty, but there can be no doubt that it must 
have been very soon after the middle of the fifteenth century. 
It has thus already resisted the storms of nearly 400 years ; and 
the strength of its foundation, and the massiness and almost impe- 
netrable solidity of its walls, seem to justify the belief, that, if it is 
not overthrown by some convulsion of nature, it may stand firm for 
several hundred years more. It was built by the second Lord 
Gray of Foulis, who had very extensive possessions in the Carse 
of Gowrie ; and the tradition is, that he named it after his lady, a 
daughter of the Earl of Huntly. The castle, with the fine estate 
belonging to it, was sold to the Earl of Strathmore in 1615; but 
it did not become Castle Lyon till 1672, when, in virtue of a char- 
ter obtained from Charles II., the barony of Longforgan was erect- 
ed into a lordship, to be called the Lordship of Lyon, a name 
which it retained till 1777, when it was purchased by the late Mr 
Paterson, the father of the present proprietor, who, having married 
a daughter of John Lord Gray, the descendant of the founder, 
very naturally restored its first name of Castle Huntly. Large ad- 
ditions, in remarkably good keeping with the original edifice, were 
made to it by that gentleman, which had the effect, not only of 
improving its appearance, but also of greatly increasing its accom- 
modation. Its situation is a striking one, on a rock rising almost 
perpendicularly out of the surrounding plain, and scarcely acces- 
sible, except on the north-east side, from which quarter the ap- 
proach to it is conducted. It is built of Kingoody stone, which, 
notwithstanding the long period that has elapsed, can hardly be 
said to have sustained injury, or to exhibit the smallest symptoms 
of decay. Its walls are not less than 10 feet thick, while they are 
as compact and as firmly cemented as the basis that supports them . 
and the height of the round tower above the ground is 116 feet 
The view from the top is much and deservedly admired. There 
are many views certainly in other parts of Scotland, of which the

character is grander or more picturesque, and there are points 
from which the eye may wander over a much wider tract of hill 
and dale, and of mountain and wild ; but there are few spots of 
such moderate elevation, from which you can look down on a richer 
and more beautiful scene than from the battlements of Castle 
Huntly. The prospect, with which no stranger can fail to be de- 
lighted, comprises the whole of the Carse of Gowrie, studded as 
it is with gentlemen's seats, and waving with the most luxuriant 
crops of grain, — the river Tay, from Newburgh to within a few 
miles of its confluence with the German Ocean, — the opposite 
coast of Fife, where the east and west Lomonds in particular are 
very prominent objects, — part of Strathearn, with the Ochils and 
other loftier mountains in the distance, — the braes of the Carse, 
as they are called, cultivated to their very summits, and over them 
the higher range of the Sidlaws, by which it is separated from 
Strath more. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population amounted to 1285 
1795, ■ - - 1526 

1801, - - - 1569 

1811, - - - 1809 

1821, - - - 1544 
1831, - - - 1638 

The population of 1811 exceeded that of 1801 by 240; and 
the population of 1821 came short of that of 1811 by 265. The 
difference is to be accounted for chiefly by the great demand for 
stones from Kingoody, prior to 1811, which induced a number of 
labourers to settle there, so that the village contained 53 families. 
That demand afterwards fell off, and, in consequence, the decrease 
of inhabitants in Kingoody alone amounted in 1821 to not less 
than 134. The population in the country parts of the parish has, 
upon the whole, rather diminished since that period ; but this di- 
minution is more than balanced by an additional village which has 
been recently erected on the estate of Mylnefield, and in which 
nearly 40 families now reside, the majority of them finding em- 
ployment at a bleachfield, which was established a few years ago 
in their immediate neighbourhood, though not within the bounds 
of this parish. 

The population is thus distributed :

The average of baptisms does not exactly, but yet very nearly, 
represent the average of births, because, though by far the greater 
number of births are entered in the baptismal register, yet all of 
them are not. Neither does the record of burials entirely corre- 
spond with the number of deaths, though the difference must be 
trifling. Persons belonging to this parish are occasionally interred 
elsewhere. But the funerals, too, of those resident in neighbour- 
ing parishes are brought to the burying ground of this, so that the 
one may not unfairly be set off against the other. 

The average number of persons under 15 years of age is 585 

betwixt 15 and 30, 47G

Land-owners. — There are eight land-owners, viz. George 
Paterson of Castle Huntly ; Lord Kinnaird ; James Mylne of 
Mylnefield ; Patrick Kinnear of Lochton ; Lord Douglas Gordon 
Hallyburton of North Ballo; Captain Trotter of South Ballo; 
William Drummond of Newton ; and Mrs Kiell of East Newton. 
Of these only two are at present resident. The properties are very 
various in point of extent, but the smallest of them exceeds the 
yearly value of L. 50. 

The number, so far as it can be ascertained, of unmarried men, 
bachelors and widowers, upwards of fifty years of age, is 28 ; and 
of unmarried women upwards of forty-five, 24. 

There are 378 families, including bothies, in the'parish, of whom 
117 are chiefly employed in agriculture; 100 in trade, manufac- 
tures, and handicraft; and 161 not comprised in the two preced- 
ing classes. There is 1 insane person in confinement ; 2 fatuous ; 
and 4 deaf and dumb, 3 of whom belong to one family. 

Character, Manners, c. of the People.— The people, generally- 
speaking, may be described as industrious in their several callings, 
as neat and cleanly in their houses and personal habits, and as en- 
joying a reasonable portion of the comforts and advantages of so- 
ciety. A sensible improvement in point of dress has taken place, 
partly arising, no doubt, from the comparatively low price at which 
most of the articles of wearing apparel are now to be procured. 
Many are accustomed to feed and kill at least one pig in the

course of the year, besides frequently using other sorts of butcher 
meat. All have their crop of potatoes and their provision of oat- 
meal, which are considered as necessaries of life. A good deal of 
vvheaten bread, too, is consumed ; and tea, with its appendages, 
once or even twice a-day, is by no means uncommon. The farm- 
servants, who, from the large scale on which agricultural operations 
are here conducted, form no small body, live almost entirely on 
oatmeal and milk, which they receive as a part of their wages. A 
laudable attention to their moral and religious duties, and an ex- 
emplary conduct in their social and domestic relations, are often 
to be met with among the labouring classes; but, as might be ex- 
pected, there are unhappily not a few melancholy instances to the 
contrary. 

We have none of those public works, with which an injurious 
influence is very generally and justly associated; but bothies, or de- 
tached houses, in which the unmarried farm-servants sleep and 
prepare their victuals, and of which there is a very considerable 
number in this parish, though convenient and beneficial perhaps 
in some respects, have not certainly contributed to the formation 
of pious and virtuous habits. It is among those who occupy them 
that the greatest ignorance is most commonly to be found, and 
that cases of immorality do most frequently occur. Could some 
alteration of the system be introduced, which would better provide 
for the worldly comfort of the young men themselves, and be at the 
same time more conducive to their intellectual and spiritual im- 
provement, it would be extremely desirable. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy.— This parish, in common with 
the district to which it belongs, is essentially, and, it may be said, 
eminently agricultural ; and the following statement, in standard 
imperial acres, will indicate the uses to which the land in it is ap- 
propriated : 

Cultivated, - . 7200 

Hill pasture and on river side, 189 
Under wood, . _ 1603 

The soft wood, the whole, or almost the whole, of which has 
been planted, and of which there is a great deal, especially in the 
upper part of the parish, which it both beautifies and shelters, is 
the Scots fir, with a mixture of larches, though not nearly in the 
same proportion. The hard and ornamental timber, of which there 
are many different kinds, grows most luxuriantly about Castle 
Huntly, Longforgan, Drimmie, and Mylnefield. It consists of oak, 



LONG FORGAN. 



413 



ash, elm, plane, lime, beech, Spanish chestnut, &amp;c. &amp;c. Much of 
this wood is old, and some of it of large dimensions. 

From the variety of soil and climate by which the parish is di- 
versified, the average rent per acre of arable land in it cannot be 
ascertained or stated with any degree of exactness. 

Rate of Wages, Sfc— The wages of labourers, in winter, are from 
8s. to 9s. ; and in summer, from 10s. to 1 Is. per week. Females are 
allowed 9d. a-day for hoeing, and Is. when employed in taking up 
potatoes. Unmarried farm-servants have from L. 13 to L. 14, with 
6 bolls of oatmeal annually, and a pint of new, or three chopins 
English quarts of skimmed, milk daily. Their master, besides, 
provides them with fuel and bedding, the whole amounting to up- 
wards of L.26 a year. Foremen, or grieves, as they are called, 
receive from L. 5 to L. 8 more, according to their qualifications, 
and the extent of the charge with which they are entrusted ; and 
those competent to build stacks, &amp;c. get L. 1 or L. 1, 10s. in ad- 
dition. The yearly wages of married servants are about L. 12, 
with a house and garden, the same quantity of milk and meal, and 
the coals which they may wish to lay in brought home to them. 
But few now have cows kept for their use.— Smiths generally con- 
tract for farm-work by the year ; but what they receive depends a 
good deal on the nature of the soil and other circumstances. A 
cart-wright, when he is occupied ten hours a-day, has 2s. with 
breakfast and dinner. A coup-cart will cost from L. 1 1 to L. 12 ; 
a corn-cart, L.4, 4s.; a wooden plough, L. 2, 15s. ; a harrow, 12s.; 
an iron plough, L. 3, 10s.; and an iron harrow, 18s. These are 
the average prices ; but of course they fluctuate a little, according 
to the weight of iron required, and the expense of it at the time. 

There is no such thing here as shearing or cutting down corns 
at so much per day, or at a certain sum for the whole crop, what- 
ever may be the duration of the harvest. These practices, either 
one or other of which was formerly adopted, are now completely 
relinquished. The whole work is executed by what is termed 
threaving. A threave of wheat is 2 stooks shocks of 14 sheaves 
each, the girth of the sheaf, when properly bound, being 33 inches. 
A threave of oats, barley, or beans, is 2 stooks of 12 sheaves each, 
the sheaf being 30 inches in circumference. The usual allowance 
for the former is 4d., while 3d. is paid for the latter. The ex- 
pense of cutting down a Scots acre in this manner, amounts on 
an average to somewhat more than 12s. But persons of all ages 
obtain full employment ; and while the young and the old are re- 



414 



PERTHSHIRE. 



numerated in proportion to what they can accomplish, the vigo- 
rous and expert shearer earns his 2s. 6d. or even 3s. a-day. The 
work is as well and more expeditiously done, and the difference in 
point of saving is very inconsiderable. 

Husbandry. — In the low or Carse district of the parish, consist- 
ing as it does of strong stiff clay, and perfectly flat, one rotation is 
invariably observed, viz. 1st, fallow ; Id, wheat ; 3c, pease and 
beans ; 4th, wheat ; 5th, barley ; 6th, grass for cutting only ; and, 
7th, oats. Grass is found by experience to answer much better 
after the two white crops of wheat and barley than after fallow 
wheat, the great bulk of the straw in the latter case generally hav- 
ing the effect of smothering and destroying it When the season 
admits, pease and beans are always succeeded by wheat ; and oc- 
casionally too, wheat, instead of oats, follows grass, though this has of 
late been almost entirely discontinued. Wheat is an object of great 
importance here ; but the sowing of it in the clay grounds is rather 
precarious, depending as it does so much upon the weather, and in 
ordinary circumstances must be concluded in the first week of Octo- 
ber. Potatoes and turnips are rarely cultivated in the Carse, the soil 
being too stiff and tenacious for them. The second cutting of grass 
is often remarkably good ; but, for some time past, it has fallen off, 
owing, there is little doubt, to the too frequent repetition of that crop. 
In the brae or dry land adjoining the clay, which is in general excel- 
lent, some of it even superior to the other, and all of it more easily 
managed, and in the upper district of the parish, where the soil is 
various and the climate not so favourable, there is no very uniform 
system pursued. Potatoes and turnips, however, are regularly 
raised, and the ground pastured for two or even three years in the 
course of the rotation. The home farm of Castle Huntly is all 
laid down in grass, which, from its richness, lets at L. 5 per acre. 
Lime was formerly imported in large quantities from England, but 
having apparently lost its stimulating and quickening effects, there 
is not now nearly the same demand for it. Dung is brought from 
Dundee, by those whose farms are adapted for the green crop hus- 
bandry ; and bones are used in the higher grounds of the parish 
for turnips, which are partly eat off with sheep. Rape dust was 
tried, but with no great success ; and oil-cake in feeding is begin- 
ning to be employed, principally with the view of improving the 
manure. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle are in general a cross of the short- 
horned breed. Gowrie, who gained the first premium for that de-

scription of bulls, given by the Highland Society at Perth in 1829, 
was bred at Monorgan, in this parish. The Carse part of it is not 
favourable for raising stock of any kind ; but a good many cattle 
and some sheep are reared in the upper division of it. A few 
horses also are bred, but the chief supply of them is obtained from 
other quarters. 

Draining, fyc. — Furrow-draining was introduced into the Carse 
about eleven years ago. It has been carried here to a considerable 
extent, not only with stones, which are better for the purpose when 
they can be procured, but also with tile, and no doubt can be en- 
tertained of its advantages. Owing, however, to the perfect flat- 
ness of the country, drains do not answer their end so well in time 
of high floods, when the water is necessarily obstructed in its course 
towards the leading drain into which it is received. Cross or trans- 
verse draining has been long and successfully practised in the high- 
er grounds of the parish, and bogs and patches of wet land have been 
effectually dried, and rendered as valuable as the fields that sur- 
round them. 

Leases are generally for nineteen years. The extension of them 
to twenty-one years, so as to embrace three full rotations, would seem 
to be desirable. Some of the farm-steadings have been lately re- 
built, and others of them much enlarged and improved, and the 
dwelling-houses belonging to them, while they are commodious 
and comfortable in their interior arrangements, are remarkably 
neat and pleasing in their outward appearance. 

The fields in the upper part of the parish are subdivided chiefly 
by stone dikes which are kept in a proper state of repair. A num- 
ber of hedges, however, has been very recently planted. There are 
no enclosures in the lower part excepting those about Castle Hunt- 
ly and Mylnefield. The clay lands and those immediately adjoin- 
ing them, are under a regular system of cropping, and when a few 
acres are occasionally pastured, they are surrounded with wooden 
railings, which can be conveniently shifted from one spot to an- 
other. 

The prosperity of the agricultural interest is essentially connected 
with that of the country at large, and in no way is a landlord more 
likely to enhance the value of his property, than by giving every 
support, and holding out every encouragement, to an enterprising 
and respectable tenantry. 

Quarries. — The Kingoody quarries, which belong to Mr Mylne 
of Mylnefield, are in this parish, and close upon the banks of the 



410 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Tay. Tliey have already been wrought for several hundred years, 
and the stone -which they produce is considered as equal to any in 
Scotland. It is of a bluish colour, very hard, and difficult of be- 
ing chiseled, but extremely durable, susceptible of the finest po- 
lish, and scarcely affected by exposure, however long, to the in- 
fluence of the weather. Castle Huntly, as is mentioned under an- 
other head, was built of it in the fifteenth century, and also the 
old and massy tower of Dundee, which was erected towards the 
end of the twelfth, and which is still in a wonderful state of pre- 
servation. A good deal of it is required to meet the wants of the 
surrounding country, but the chief demand for it of late years has 
been from Aberdeen, Perth, and Dundee, where, independently 
of what has been needed for more ordinary purposes, docks have 
been constructing, and other harbour improvements in operation. 
The company who rent the quarries give employment in them to 
between fifty and sixty men, at the average wages to good workers 
of about 14s. per week. They have three boats, one of fifty, and 
two of thirty tons each. The former carries stones to Aberdeen, 
and other towns on the coast, while the voyages of the latter are 
confined within the precincts of the river. In some places, there 
is a depth of rock of not less than 70 feet, and blocks of stone for 
cylinders and engine seats are furnished, 12 feet long, 8 broad, 
and I thick, and of the enormous weight of 10 tons and upwards. 

There is another excellent freestone quarry on a farm in the 
higher part of the parish, the property of Lord Kinnaird, from 
which Rossie Priory was built. Its colour is whiter than that of 
the Kingoody stone. It admits of an equally fine polish, and 
were the situation a more favourable one, it might be wrought to 
great advantage. 

Fisheries. — The landholders of this parish, whose estates are 
adjacent to the Tay, at least some of them, have rights to the con- 
tiguous fishings on it, secured to them by charter. These were 
prosecuted with great success by means of stake-nets from about 
1802 till 1812, when they were finally interdicted. On the reced- 
ing of the tide, which leaves nearly a mile of sand between its 
north bank, and the deep stream of the river, hundreds of salmon 
were occasionally found enclosed within the nets which were erect- 
ed when the fishing season commenced, and taken down when it 
closed. The loss to the proprietors has of course been consider- 
able, and the want of the advantage enjoyed in an ample supply 
of salmon has been felt in the neighbourhood. 

Produce. — In ascertaining the gross amount of raw produce

raised in the parish, it is obvious that any estimate we can form 
will be only an approximation to the truth. But the following view 
of it, from the principles on which the calculation has been made, 
is perhaps as correct a one as can be exhibited.

Manufactures. — The goods manufactured in the parish consist 
principally of Hessian sheeting, and brown tow sheeting and sack- 
ing, intended to meet the demand of the home market, as well as 
for exportation to America. Some plain linen and tweeled sheet- 
ings are also made for family use, though not by any means to a 
large extent. The value of the whole may amount to L. 310 per 
week. In these different branches, about 150 weavers are em- 
ployed, of whom 70 are men, and 80 women, the wages of the 
former averaging 10s., and those of the latter 9s. each, per week. 
Perhaps 50 women and young persons are engaged in winding and 
otherwise preparing the yarns for the loom, whose weekly earnings 
may be nearly 3s. each. 

The " Carse of Gowrie Agricultural Society," which was insti- 
tuted in 1820, to promote improvements in agriculture, and en- 
courage the breeding and rearing of stock, held its regular meet- 
ings in spring and autumn at Longforgan. It no longer exists, 
however, as a separate establishment, having lately been incorpo- 
rated with the " Perthshire Agricultural Association," formed for 
similar purposes. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town and Villages. — There is no market-town in the 
parish, but its inhabitants are favourably situated in that respect, 
from their vicinity to Dundee about three miles distant from its 
eastern extremity, where there is an admirable supply of both 
butcher-meat and fish in its season, where all the necessaries and 
comforts of life can be obtained on the most reasonable terms, and 

PERTH. d d 



418 



PERTHSHIRE. 



where farm produce of every kind can be disposed of to the great- 
estadvantage. There are three villages in it: Longforgan, the whole 
of which belongs to George Paterson, Esq. of Castle Huntly : 
Kingoody, entirely the property of James Mylne, Esq.; and Balbun- 
noch, including the range of houses, recently erected on the estate 
of Mylnefield. 

The means of communication with other places enjoyed by the 
parish are diversified and ample. It has the benefit of a post 
every day in the week, the office, however, being at Inchture. 
The great road to Aberdeen by the coast runs through it, and 
from this two roads branch off, one leading to the Kingoody quarries, 
and westward through a lower part of the Carse, till it rejoins the 
turnpike at the sixth milestone from Perth, and the other leading over 
the Sidlaws to Cupar- Angus and into Strathmore. There are three 
coaches, and occasionally four one of them the mail which pass 
and repass daily, and, connected as they are with the movements 
of other public carriages which start from Perth and Dundee, af- 
ford constant opportunities of intercourse with all parts of the coun- 
try. There are very few bridges in the parish, and these over in- 
considerable streams, but they are all in good condition, and an- 
swer the purpose for which they were originally built. At 
Kingoody there is a sort of harbour, which was constructed by Mr 
Mylne, for receiving and sheltering the boats employed in convey- 
ing stones to various quarters, not only in Scotland, but also in 
England. Lime from Sunderland is frequently landed at it for 
the use of the neighbouring proprietors and farmers. Grain too is 
shipped from it on their account, and of late years large quantities 
of potatoes for the London market. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which is a very commodious 
and comfortable one, was erected in 1795, and is at present, with 
a few trifling exceptions, in a state of complete repair. It is too large, 
however, containing more than 1000 sittings, nor is there any proba- 
bility of the ample accommodation which it affords being speedily 
required. But it could not be better situated for the great bulk 
of the population, though about 25 families in the north-western 
quarter of the parish are at the .rather inconvenient distance of 
from three to five miles from it. Some of the communion tables are 
let annually at very low rates for the benefit of the poor, and a few 
other seats also are let by those of the tenantry, who, from the ex- 
tent of their farms, have more church room than is necessary for 
their servants and cottagers. But all the other sittings are free, 



LONGFORGAN. 



419 



in so far at least as nothing whatever is paid for them by their 
possessors, though not free in the sense of being open to any who 
may choose to occupy them. 

The manse was built for the present incumbent in 1823 and 
1824. It is an excellent house, commanding a delightful prospect, 
and embracing every accommodation for a family. The glebe 
consists of between 4 and 5 acres of good ground, and its yearly value 
may be stated at L. 14 or L. 15. The stipend was augmented 
in 1824 to 18 chalders of grain, in the following proportions, viz. 
138£ bolls of barley, 138£ bolls of meal, and 11 bolls of wheat, 
all payable by the highest fiars of the county, together with L. 2, 
being an old allowance for a grass glebe, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for fur- 
nishing communion elements. The whole has amounted on an 
average of the thirteen years that have elapsed since the decreet 
of modification, to about L. 308 a-year. 

There are 310 families belonging to the Established Church, 
which is the only place of worship in the parish, and which is ge- 
nerally well attended : and 1 1 connected in whole or in part with 
the different dissenting bodies ; besides three Episcopalians, and 
2 Roman Catholics. The number of communicants is upwards of 
600. The church collections for religious and charitable objects 
have this season yielded L. 22, exclusive of L. 13, 4s. for the des- 
titute inhabitants of the Highlands. The average of them for the 
last five years is about L. 15. 

Education. — There are six schools in the parish, viz. the paro- 
chial and five others, which are conducted by persons two of them 
females entirely on their own adventure. Three of these are in- 
tended for children only, and nothing but a mere knowledge of 
English in its plainest style is professed to be communicated. In 
the other three, the branches of instruction usually taught are, 
English reading and grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, 
and occasionally Latin and the elements of mathematical science. 
The quarterly payments for English are from 2s. to 3s., and 4s. 
when writing and arithmetic are added ; the charge for Latin is 
5s. The parochial teacher enjoys the maximum salary of L. 34, 
4s. 4d. and his fees may amount to L. 30 more. A good dwel- 
ling-house and a most excellent school-room have been very re 
cently built for him, and though his garden is not of the extent re- 
quired by law, the deficiency is supplied by an adequate allowance 
in money. The emoluments of the private teachers are very va- 
rious; L. 5, L. 10, and as high as L.34 annually. There are also 



420 



PERTHSHIRE. 



three Sabbath schools, which have been very serviceable in diffus- 
ing among the youth an acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures, 
and of which the good effects would be still more apparent, were 
the attendance upon them less fluctuating than it frequently is. The 
value of education is appreciated, and the people in general are so 
alive to its benefits, and so anxious to procure it for their families, that 
there are very few above six years of age who cannot read, though 
numbers read imperfectly- The distance of some parts of the pa- 
rish is so considerable, as almost to preclude the attendance of 
children residing there, upon the parochial school. But no great 
practical inconvenience is experienced on that account, as the 
school of an adjoining parish is in the immediate neighbourhood. 

A library, which consists of about 180 volumes, chiefly religious 
and moral, was formed in 1823. The readers were never very nu- 
merous, and it is to be regretted that they are not at present on 
the increase. 

In 1824, a Savings' Bank was opened, and the hope was en- 
tertained that it might have been useful to many, and that the 
advantages which it held out would have been recognized and 
embraced by those for whom it was intended. The situation is 
not perhaps the most favourable for such an establishment. But, 
at all events, the expectations of its projectors have been very in- 
adequately fulfilled. The accounts have never exceeded thirty- 
eight, nor has the sum lodged amounted at any time to more than 
L. 90. There are now only eight individuals connected with it, 
and the money bearing interest is L. 36, lis. 

Poor.— The number of persons at present on the roll is 20, 
some of them having families. The provision made for them 
varies of course according to the age or the necessities of the indivi- 
dual, and other circumstances, rendering their cases more or less 
urgent, but 4s., 5s., and 6s. are the general monthly allowances. 
There is an insane person too, confined in the Dundee Lunatic Asy- 
lum, at the yearly expense of about L. 16. The funds for sup- 
porting them, and for defraying other necessary charges, arise from 
the ordinary collections at the church, from dues for the use of the 
hearse and mortcloth, and for the proclamation of bans, and 
from the interest received on L. 230 of money. When these 
are found inadequate, the difference is made up by a voluntary 
contribution from the heritors, proportioned, however, to their se- 
veral valued rents in the parish, and averaging L. 30 for the last 
seven years. Annual amount of collections for the poor, L. 49,

clamation of bans, L. 1, 5s. 7d. ; of seat- rents, L. 2, 6s. ; of in- 
terest of money, L. 9, 4s. ; contributed by heritors, L. 30 ; total, 
L. 98, 9s. 

Instances are frequently to be met with of persons submitting 
to considerable hardships rather than be at all dependent on the 
charity of the public But I rather think that this very honour- 
able feeling is somewhat impaired, and that the disinclination to 
apply for parochial relief is neither so strong, nor so universal as 
it formerly was. 

Fairs. — Two fairs have been held in Longforgan since 1663, 
on the first Wednesday of June, and the first Wednesday of Oc- 
tober, O. S. Besides these there is a third, known as the tryst, 
which was established by the late Mr Paterson of Castle Huntly, 
in 1807, and which is kept on the last Monday of April. These 
fairs are chiefly for the sale of cattle, and a good deal of such bu- 
siness is done. The June fair used to be greatly frequented for 
the hire of farm-servants, but it is not now so much resorted to for 
this purpose. It is alleged, and with reason, that there is an im- 
propriety in contracting new engagements five months before the 
conclusion of those still existing, and that the certainty of their 
removal from their present situations at the somewhat distant term 
of Martinmas, is not unlikely to have an unfavourable influence on 
the minds of servants, to give birth to habits of carelessness, and 
perhaps to create a feeling of indifference to the interests of their 
masters. 

Inns, fyc. — There are four licensed public-houses in the parish, 
besides the toll-house, forming the boundary between the counties 
of Perth and Angus. They are amply sufficient for the accommo- 
dation of the community ; and no friend to the well-being and good 
order of the neighbourhood, would wish to see their number in- 
creased. 

Fuel. — The fuel principally consumed here is English coal, 
brought from the harbour of Dundee, or when commissioned by 
families, as it very frequently is, landed either at Kingoody, in this 
parish, or at Powgavie, in the adjoining one of Inchture. The 
price varies according to its quality, and the expense of convey- 
ance from 4s. to 5s. 9d. per boll of 6 cwt. or 42 stones. Coal from 
the south coast of Fife, averaging about 6s. a boll, is also used, 
though not to the same extent, and there is a considerable demand 
for fire-wood, which is procured from the primings of trees, and

from the saw-mills, several of which have been erected within these 
few years. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
When the last Statistical Account was written, the agriculture 
of this parish and of the surrounding district was probably farther 
advanced than in most parts of Scotland, and it may not perhaps 
since that time have made the same relative progress as has been 
noticed in other places. Still, however, a vast improvement has 
been effected during the forty years that have elapsed, especially 
in the upper division of the parish, which exhibits a very different 
appearance from what it formerly presented. The potato and 
turnip husbandry was then just beginning to be introduced. But 
now it is skilfully prosecuted, and these valuable crops are raised 
in abundance on all those farms which are' adapted for the culti- 
vation of them. 

Prior to 1790, the roads in the Carse were exceedingly bad, so 
that, unless in very favourable circumstances, the idea of bringing 
lime or manure from any distance was not to be entertained. Soon 
after that the new line of turnpike from Perth to Dundee with its 
different branches was opened, in which a great change to the 
better has lately taken place, while the improvement which the 
statute labour roads have undergone is too obvious not to be re- 
marked. 

In 1796, fifteen thrashing-mills were built or building in this 
parish alone. Now there are not fewer than thirty-two, all driven 
by horses, excepting five or six on the higher grounds, which are 
moved by water. There is only one instance as yet in the Carse 
of Gowrie of the application of steam power to the thrashing-mill, 
but it is understood to have fully justified the expectations which 
were formed from it.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. THOMA'S NELSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Auchtergaven is stated in the former Account to be 
a word of Celtic original, and to be thus written in that language, 
Uachdarghamb-thir,—a. term said to signify the upper part of the 
winter land. No reason is assigned for this derivation, and none 
is obvious. The name, however, is doubtless of Celtic origin 2 
and I have received these accounts of its etymology, 1. That it 
comes from Uaehdar, the top, and Gabhainn, a young bullock, 
a yearling. By the union of these two words Auchtergaven 
is formed, and literally signifies the Hill of the young Cattle — a 
name which may have been suggested by the circumstance of the 
elevated ground occupied by the church having been a common 
on which the parishioners had the right of grazing their young 
slock : or the name may have taken its rise from a cattle market 
held in that locality ; and indeed a market, chiefly for cattle, is 
still held annually near the same place, in the month of November. 
2. The name by another derivation is said to be compounded of 
Uaehdar, and cun, dogs ; so that Auchtergaven signifies the Hill of 
Dogs ; and the reason of the designation is said to have been this : 
When the Kings of Scotland had their court at Scone or St John- 
ston, this was the place where the dogs were uncoupled, when the 
King and his attendants took the diversion of the chase. A dis- 
trict of the parish, at this day famous for its game, bears the name 
of Kinglands. The first part of the name, Uaehdar, top or 
height, is accurately descriptive of the situation of the church, 
which stands proudly upon the acclivity of an eminence, and is a 
conspicuous object from the greater part of the parish. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish, from Stanley on its east- 
ern to Corrody on its western extremity, is fully 10 miles in 
length ; and from Marlhaugh, on its southern, to the top of Birnam- 
hill on its northern extremity, it is upwards of 6 miles in breadth. 



424 



PERTHSHIRE. 



This breadth, however, diminishes at Newmill on the south to a 
mile and a half ; while at Safe-landing, towards the east, it does 
not exceed two furlongs ; and at Stanley, it again opens out to a 
mile in breadth. Its mean breadth is fully 3 miles, and its 
surface 30 square miles, or 19,200 imperial acres. It is bound- 
ed on the north by the parish of Little Dunkeld ; on the east, by 
the parish of Kinclaven and the river Tay ; on the south, by the 
parishes of Redgorton and Moneydie ; and on the west, by the 
brook Shochie, which separates it from Mullion, a detached part 
of the parish of Redgorton. But within these boundaries, insert- 
ed like a wedge, lies a portion of the parish of Methven, named 
Tullybeagles. This district is fully 4 miles long, and at its 
thick end more than a mile and a half broad. 

General Aspect. — The surface within this outline, as viewed on 
the map of Perthshire, has some resemblance to a balloon, of 
which Stanley may be regarded as the attached car. The north 
and north-west sides of the parish include a part of the lower range 
of the Grampian Mountains. The most elevated points of this range 
within the parish are, Birnam-hill, Craig- Obney, Craig- Gibbon, 
Tullybelton-hill, and Corrody-hill. Birnam-hill, by trigonome- 
trical measurement, has been ascertained to be 1300 feet above 
the level of the sea; and the other hills are not much inferior in 
height. Although, at some points a bare steep rock is exhibited, 
these hills are not much broken into rugged and abrupt precipices, 
but have a gradually sloping acclivity. As the parish thus extends 
from the banks of the river Tay to the summit of the mountains 
already described, and as it is traversed by several streams which 
issue from them, it is scarcely necessary to add, that its general 
aspect is much diversified. Except on the banks of the streams, 
very little of the arable land can be called level ; on the contrary, it 
is distributed into sloping ridges and swelling knolls. And hence 
many of the names of the farms, indicative of their elevated situation, 
begin or end with Ard, Drum, Hill, as Ardonochie, Drumquliar, 
Berry-hill. The banks of the Tay, where that noble stream bounds 
the parish, are high, bold, and rocky. Draining, planting, and the 
improved methods of cultivation have deprived the Stare Dam, 
where this parish joins that of Little Dunkeld on the road from 
Perth to Dunkeld, of its indescribable eeriness complained of by 
Morrison, as quoted by Sir Walter Scott in his " Fair Maid of 
Perth." The dam is now removed to a situation invisible from 
the road ; and when the young wood has had a few years more

arowth, this place will form no contrast to what the same author 
justly calls at a furlong's distance from it, " one of the loveliest 
and richest scenes of Scotland— the north-west opening of Strath- 
more." At no distant period, however, this was a cold and dismal 
place. And as Morrison adds, " The mfserable patches of sick- 
ly corn which have with vast labour and cost been obtained, look 
still more melancholy than the solitary tarn which the barren earth 
seems to have drunk up. The whole aspect of the place fitted it 
for being the scene of the trial and punishment of one of the most 
notorious bands of thieves and outlaws that ever laid the low country 
under contribution. Ruthven, the sheriff, is said to have held his 
court on a rising ground to the north, still called the Court-hill ; 
and there were lately, or there still may be, at the east end of 
Roch-an-roy wood, some oaks on which the Highlanders were 
hung, and which long went under the name of the " Hanged- 
men's-trees." Some of these trees still remain in the parish of 
Little Dunkeld ; but the reproach of the Stare Dam has passed 
away, and must henceforth be spoken of in the past tense. 

Meteorology and Climate. — The annual range of the barometer 
at the manse, which occupies a rather low situation, is from 
28| to 30 inches. On the 13th of October last, when the 
moon was eclipsed, it rose to 36 inches 6-10ths. It is generally 
high while the wind is in the east. As indicated by a rain-gage 
kept by the Rev. Mr Mather, the minister of Stanley, the depth 
of rain in the following years was, in 1833, 28.7 inches; 1834, 
29.1 inches; 1835, 26.54 inches; 1836, 34.30 inches; 1837, 
from 1 st January to 30th September, 22.30 inches. The heaviest 
rains as well as the highest winds are from the south-west. The 
east wind is generally here, as elsewhere, attended with cloudy 
weather ; but it does not cause here the disagreeable sensation 
which is experienced on the east coast. The hills on the north- 
west attract the clouds, in consequence of which a great deal more 
rain falls on them than on the lower districts of the parish. On 
the 13th day of October 1831, an uncommon fall of rain on the 
hills caused a higher flood than had happened in the memory of 
the oldest person in the parish. All the flat land had the appear- 
ance of lakes ; and much damage was done to roads and bridges, 
as well, as to potato fields. The snow storm which fell on the 
28th of October 1836 covered a great deal of standing corn, as 
well as almost all the potatoes, so that the harvest was not finished till 
after the new year ; yet comparatively little damage was sustain- 



420 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ed. Fogs and hoar frosts are common in the valleys throughout 
the year, and often prove very detrimental to the potato crop, and 
severely try the lungs of asthmatic patients. But, on the whole, the 
atmosphere is of an agreeable temperature, being both mild and 
salubrious. Even the highest winds and the coldest weather are 
bracing and healthful. The district is subject to no prevalent dis- 
tempers, and many of the inhabitants attain to an extreme old age. 
Within these few years several individuals have died at the age of 
from ninety to a hundred years. There is now living in the pa- 
rish a woman in the enjoyment of good health, aged ninety-five ; 
and there are in it several stout and healthy octogenarians, both 
male and female. The southern and eastern districts of the pa- 
rish are from a fortnight to three weeks earlier than those at the 
foot of the hills, but in these lower districts the harvest is as early 
as in the Lothians. 

Hydrography.— Numerous and copious springs of pure and ex- 
cellent water are distributed over the whole parish ; and by sink- 
ing wells through the alluvial gravel, abundance of good water is 
found everywhere from ten to twenty feet below the surface. Su- 
perstition formerly invested St Bryde's, and Chapel Well, and 
perhaps some others, with a .sacred character, and made them 
places of resort for pious purposes. Several small streams flow 
from the hills, and traverse the lower districts of the parish. Such 
of them as have obtained names, and give a character to the face 
of the country, are the Corral burn, which has its source in a 
spring at the foot of the Obney hills, and after forming a marsh 
below the Stare Dam — now nearly drained — passes through the 
village of Bankfoot, and flows southward till it meets the Garry 
at a short distance below the Church; — the Aldinny, which also 
rises at the foot of the Obney hills, and joins the Corral in the 
meadows of Airlywight ;— the Garry, which flows from boggy 
ground at the head of Glen Garr— a pass through the hills to 
Strathbran— runs by the manse, receives the Corral, augmented 
by the Aldinny, and unites with the Ordie at Loak ;— the Wyn- 
nie, which has its source in marshy land in the barony of Tully- 
beagles, and joins the Ordie near the mill of Balmacollie the 
Ordie, which rises in a small lake in the hill of Tullybelton, tra- 
verses the heart of the parish, receives in its course all the streams 
which have now been noticed, imposes its name upon the largest 
district in the parish, namely, Strathord, and at last unites with the

Shochie at Luncarty, in the parish of Redgorton. The Shochie 
rises in Glen Shee, and forms the western boundary of this parish 
for more than five miles, when afterwards it enters that of Money- 
die at Argith, and being joined by the Ordie, as already stat- 
ed, carries all the waters which flow through this parish into the 
Tay. This also is claimed as one of the streams of this parish, 
as it bounds it for nearly two miles at Stanley. The beds of all 
these streams are rough with rolled stones, many of them of con- 
siderable size — fragments both of the primary and secondary rocks. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The hills are composed chiefly of 
clay slate and graywacke. The direction of the strata is south- 
west, and they dip to the north at an acute angle. Masses of 
quartz are found in these rocks. In the lower part of the parish, 
the alluvial deposits rest on the old red sandstone. A very re- 
markable whin-dike traverses the parish from east to west. It 
crosses the Tay near Stanley, forming the famous Lin of Camp- 
sie. At a short distance from the church it is quarried, and used 
as metal for the highway — a purpose for which it is well adapted. 
Here it is forty-five feet across, with regular sides, and associated 
with the old red sandstone, which is indurated at the place of its 
junction with the trap rock. This dike is said to traverse the 
whole extent of the island from east to west. The alluvial de- 
posits which lie over these rocks are, gravel, loam, clay, sand, 
marl, and peat moss. This gravel forms the subsoil of the greater 
part of the parish ; it is often of great depth, as is ascertained by the 
digging of wells, the levelling of roads, and the clearing away of 
the superincumbent matter of stone quarries. When exposed by 
these operations, large rolled stones are found imbedded in it. It 
as well as the other alluvial matters have a reddish hue, occasioned 
doubtless by the presence of iron. Slight traces of bog-iron ore are 
observable in different parts of the parish. I have never heard of 
any organic remains either of animals or plants having been found 
in this alluvial gravel ; but fossil wood of different kinds occurs in 
the peat mosses. 

Soil. — The soils of the parish are various ; but they may be ge- 
nerally characterized as consisting of a sandy loam, mixed with 
small stones. The decomposed debris of the clay-slate rocks forms 
a strong deep soil, along the foot of the hills. Large boulders 
were not uncommon in the cultivated fields, but as they interrupt- 
ed the course of the plough, many of them have been removed of 
late years. They are,however, still met with in many fields. The 



428 



PERTHSHIRE. 



surface of the upper part of the parish is peculiarly tenacious of 
moisture, so that in soft weather during winter every foot-mark is 
filled with water, while the lower districts are comparatively light 
and dry. 

Quarries. — Roof slates were quarried at no distant date at Ob- 
ney and Tullybeagles ; and are still quarried at Glen Shee. 
These quarries would be more constantly wrought than they are, 
were there an easy access to them by means of good roads. The 
slates obtained are of two kinds, blue and grey. The latter kind 
is said to be the more durable, and it harmonizes well with the 
lead with which, when used for roofing, it is associated. The old 
red sandstone found in the parish forms good building materials, 
and quarries of it have been opened for that end at Stanley, Cor- 
ral, Westerton of Kinglands, Hilton, Auchtergaven, and above all 
at Speedy-hill. From this latter quarry, the stones employed in 
the new Castle of Dunkeld were obtained. The sandstone rock 
here has a greenish colour, is close grained, and takes a fine po- 
lish. The clay used for making the brick for this edifice— the 
progress of which was interrupted by the lamented death of the 
late Duke of Atholl in 1831 — was found at Marlhaugh, where this 
parish joins that of Redgorton. At present, almost none of these 
building materials are carried out of the parish, except from the 
slate quarry at Glen Shee. 

Zoology. — This parish has been long celebrated for the abund- 
ance, the variety, and the excellence of its game. The red-deer 
pays it occasional visits. A few roe-deer make it their home, and 
early in spring mornings may be seen grazing with their fawns. 
Hares are very plentiful, and of excellent quality; and rabbits 
of late have become greatly too abundant, and injurious to the 
crops. Among the feathered tribes used for game, the pheasant 
claims the first place ; and the grouse, the partridge, the woodcock, 
the wild duck, the snipe, and the wood-pigeon, follow in their 
order. These have many enemies; among which are the fox, lurk- 
ing in the woods or among the rocks ; the polecat, the martin-cat, 
the stoat, and the weasel, frequenting stone dikes, crevices of rocks, 
old walls, and roots of hedges. Among the birds of prey are the ring- 
tailed-hawk, the sparrow-hawk, the fork-tailed-gled, the buzzard, 
not common, the magpie, and the jay-pie. The dotterel, the plo- 
ver, the lapwing, the curlew, the grey owl, and the fieldfare fre- 
quent the moors. The heron haunts a small beautiful lake, sur- 
rounded with wood, at the foot of Birnam hill. In stormy wea-

ther during spring, sea-mews visit this part of the country. Jack- 
daws and crows are abundant ; and so are also many sorts of sing- 
ing-birds, as the lark, the linnet, the blackbird, the thrush, the ro- 
bin. The house- sparrow, the finch, the wagtail, and other small 
birds, are common. In summer, the swallow, the land-rail, the 
cuckoo, and other birds of passage, pay their annual visit. The 
parish has also its full share of insects and reptiles ; and some of 
the dragon-flies are large and beautiful. 

Botany. — These plants are found on the hills: 

Polygala vulgaris, milkwort Pinguicula vulgaris, butterwort. This 

Galium saxatile plant has some appearance of the P. 

Gnaphaliumtlioicum, mountain cudweed Lusitanica, which has not been found 

Gymnadenia conopsea, fragrant gym- on this side of the island,

Viola canina, dog's violet pratense 

Pedicularis palustris Orchis latifolia 

Hieracium alpinum, Alpine hawkweed Lycopodium alpinum. 

Pyrola minor 

The three species of heath, natives of Britain, namely, Calluna 
vulgaris Erica tetralix, and E. cinerea, are found intermixed in 
the hills and moors. All the plants common in most parts of Scot- 
land are also abundant here. And were the banks of the streams, 
the recesses of the woods, the moors, and the marshes, carefully 
examined, there is no doubt but a rich botanical harvest would be 
gathered. All the common sorts of wood grow in the parish, as 
the oak, the ash, the mountain-ash, the elm, the beech, the labur- 
num, larch, spruce, Scotch fir, and other kinds of trees. The 
large plantations consist chiefly of larch and Scotch fir. At Stan- 
ley House, there are two very large and fine yew trees, and in the 
lawn and along the banks of the Tay a great number of beeches, 
of a large size and beautiful shape. Within six yards of the east 
corner of the manse is a weeping birch, which, by reason of its broad 
flat top, and long pendant tendrils, excites the admiration of all 
by whom it is beheld. 

II. — Civil History. 
Violence of Former Times. — Myln, in his Lives of the Bishops of 
Dunkeld, tells us, that, while James Bruss held that see between 
1441 and 1447, his nephew, Andrew Forrester of Torwood, who 
rented the lands of Little Dunkeld, had an encounter with Robert 
Reoch Makdonoquhy to the east of the Church of Auchtergaven, 
where he was so severely wounded in the head that he died in con-

sequence. He was a great scourge to the Church, and in particular 
had plundered the lands of Little Dunkeld. We are informed by the 
same author, that Bishop Brown recovered the estate of Makkersy, 
now called Taymount, in the parish of Kinclaven, from Sir James 
Crichton of Strathord, in the parish of Auchtergaven, who had 
taken possession of it by violence. On this account, Sir James 
laid snares for the Bishop, and did him all the harm in his power. 
He waylaid and set upon him near the Bridge of Erne with only 
twelve men, as the other was on his way to Court with a retinue 
of forty people. The Bishop and the clergy in his train restrain- 
ed their servants, otherwise Sir James and his people would have 
been cut to pieces. They parted, however, without exchanging 
blows ; and, to convince the world that the intentions of Sir James 
were bad, the Bishop returned to Dunkeld without proceeding to 
Court. From that time, Sir James was very hard upon the Bi- 
shop's tenants of Pittendynie and Kinvaid, in the parish of Money- 
die. These facts show us the insecurity of peace, life, and pro- 
perty in these times of violence. 

The Family of Nairne.— When the rebellion of 1715, headed 
by the Earl of Mar, became public, all suspected persons were 
summoned by Government to surrender themselves, and give se- 
curity for their fidelity as the law directed ; and in the lists of 
these persons we find both Lord Nairne, and his son, the Master 
of Nairne, whose property lay chiefly in this parish. His Lord- 
ship, who was brother of the Earl of Atholl, and had married the 
heiress of Nairne, commanded the fourth of the six Scottish regi- 
ments of foot which were at the battle of Preston. And he is 
thus characterized by a contemporary author : " This nobleman 
was much esteemed in his country, where he made himself popular 
by the opposition he made to the Union, as well as by his other 
great qualities. He was reputed a man of courage, having former- 
ly served in the navy, where it is said he gave proofs of his va- 
lour." The representative of this family embarked also in the 
rebellion of 1745-6, and joined the Prince at Perth. He surviv- 
ed the disasters of that insurrection, and followed the Chevalier to 
France, and thence to Rome, and shared in his friendship and for- 
tunes till the death of the latter. The title of Nairne, which was 
forfeited in 1746, was revived in 1824. The lineal descendant 
of the family returned to this country before the conclusion of the 
last century, and resided in a plain and private way in Perth, 

 Campbell's Life of John Duke of Argyle, p. 209.

where his tall and venerable appearance, with his cocked hat and 
high gilt-headed cane, is still fresh in the recollection of the in- 
habitants of that city. He was buried in the family burying-place 
at Auchtergaven. William Lord Nairne, in whose person the title 
was revived in 1824, was succeeded by his only son, William, born 
in 1808, and died unmarried in 1837, an event by which the title 
has become extinct in the male line. The principal residence of 
this ancient family was situated at Loak, in this parish ; and the 
House of Nairne is still spoken of as one of the finest seats of the 
Scottish nobility. After the forfeited property was purchased by 
the Duke of Atholl, this residence was demolished ; and the only 
vestige of it which now remains is part of the orchard, with a green 
mound planted, which terminated one of the avenues ; but there 
are persons still alive, who, amid the levellings of the plough and 
harrow, can point out the various localities, the favourite walks of 
the " last Lady Mary," her sylvan bower, the clear pebble well, of 
which the stream still flows, the old thorn tree, and the bowling 
green in which Lord Nairne marshalled his clan before they march- 
ed to join the Prince at Perth. The exploits of the Lord Nairne 
who embarked in the rebellion of 1745 have been celebrated in 
verse.f 

While Lord Nairne and other noble chiefs were feasted in the 
Castle of Strathallan, Callum Dhu, a formidable bandit, who had 
for some time haunted Methven wood, was talked of. When the 
castle clock rang the hour of ten, the company broke up ; and 
Lord Strathallan urged Lord Nairne not to return home that night, 
as he might encounter the robber, his dreary way lying through 
the wood and across the stream where he had his cave. Attend- 
ed, however, only by his servant Clarke, he mounted, and hasted 
homeward. He met the robber, and after a desperate duel, he slew 
him, and carried home his head as a trophy of his victory. He had 
received a wound on his shoulder, which his servant wrapped with 
a bandage to restrain the flowing of his master's blood. 

The Old House of Nairne having been consumed by fire, a 
new mansion was erected at great expense, nor was it completely 

• " By the death of John Lord Nairne, which lately took place at Brussels, Ba- 
roness Keith becomes heiress to his barony. Being a female title Lady Keith hav- 
ing no sons, it will descend to her daughters, and the family will assume the name 
and arms of Nairne." — Perth Courier for 11th January 1838.

manners and customs of the natives of Nairn, or Stratherde, in Perthshire, in the

finished at the Rebellion of 1745. Sixty masons were employed 
three years jn building it ; and were, every Saturday evening dur- 
ing all that time, treated at his Lordship's expense, in a public- 
house at Loak, each with a large oat cake, a salt herring, and a 
pint of ale, equal to four English pints. Many who saw the founda- 
tion of this house laid, lived to see it taken down to the ground. 
It was sold, and the materials carried off ; and it is said that the 
clock and weathercock on the spire of the hospital at Perth were 
originally on the house of Nairne. 

Robert Nicoll — This was a young man of great promise cut off 
in the bloom of life. He was born in this parish in 1814, where 
his grandfather, father, and mother, and other relations still reside. 
He was educated at the parochial school under the present teacher ; 
and his first outset in life was in a grocer's shop in Perth. But 
the bent of his mind being toward literature, he opened a circulat- 
ing library in Dundee, and distinguished himself as a political 
writer of the liberal school, and as the author of a volume of poems, 
chiefly in the Scottish dialect, and descriptive of Scottish man- 
ners. The title of one of his songs is " The Fouk o' Oucher- 
gaen." When seized with his last illness, he had the management 
of a newspaper in Leeds, which in a short time he brought into 
extensive circulation. He died at Newhaven, near Edinburgh, 
in December 1837. His poetry shows observation, pathos, and 
right feeling. 

Land-owners. — In a list of lands and baronies in the seisin of 
James Master of Gowrie, dated 11th April 1584, communicated to 
" the Literary and Antiquarian Society of Perth," we find the fol- 
lowing places in this parish mentioned, Adanachy — Ardonochy, — 
Harehaugh — Hardhaugh — a third part of the lands of Arlewhat ; 
— Airly wight — the town and lands of Cultrony ; the lands of Drum-

John Nairne, Sir William Stewart, the Laird of Grandtully, the 
Laird of Tullybelton and over Blelock, the Earl of Tullybairdine ; 
Lady Grandtully, elder, for Airly wight and Cultrainie, possessed by 
her; John Burt of Little Tullybelton, William Wallace of Prieston, 
the Earl of Athol, and the Earl of Dunfermline, for feu duties. —

Drummond Stewart, Bart, of Grandtully ; James Wylie, Esq. of 
Airlywight ; Robert Robertson, Esq. of Tullybelton ; and the poor 
of the parish of Cockslands, under the management of the kirk- 
session. The lands of Tullybeagles belong to Lady Keith. The 
Duchess of Atholl has her locality lands in this parish. 

Parish Registers.]- — The first entry in the parish register is 
dated 7th December 1740. Since that time the cash collected 
at the church for the poor, the dates of marriages and baptisms, 
and the minutes of the kirk-session, as well as the money distri- 
buted to the poor, have been regularly kept ; and are contained 
in four folio volumes : the fourth having been provided lately for 
keeping a roll of male heads of families communicants, in compli- 
ance with the regulations for carrying into effect the recent act of 
the General Assembly on Calls. 

Antiquities. — In the vicinity of the Stare Dam, at Meikle Ob- 
ney, in the farm of Middle Blelock, and at some other places of 
the parish, are found instances of those large rude blocks of stone 
set on end, so common in Scotland, and of which the original de- 
sign is so imperfectly known. To the north of Balwharn, in the 
lands of Tullybeagles, were found, a few years ago, at the ruins of 
an old chapel, some old coins, and presented, it is said, to the Li- 
terary and Antiquarian Society of Perth. On the south march of 
Berryhill farm, in the same lands of Tullybeagles, there is the 
site of another chapel, where there was a burying- place, where hu- 
man bones have been recently dug up ; and, till of late, the people 
in the neighbourhood used, on the first Sabbath of May, to drink 
out of the Holy Well there. This sacred place is on the banks of 
the Ordie. On the banks of the Tay, near Stanley, are the remains 
of an old castle or round tower, called Inchbervis, and by some, 
Inverbervie, of which nothing now is known, except a tradition that 
it was at one time a religious house in connection with the Abbey 

 Sir John died in May last in Paris ; his remains were brought to Dundee by 
steam, and were interred in the family burying ground at Murthly on the 6th of June 
1038. The tenantry, to the number of 400, were at the funeral. He is succeeded 
by his brother William, who is at present in North America. 

f The parish registers must have got into disorder during a vacancy : for on the 
k 23d February 1741, not many weeks after the present register commences, is the fol- 
lowing minute. " Session constituted by Mr M'Lagan, minister of Little Dunkeld. 
In regard there has been for some time no register of sessional deeds in this parish, 
nor any clerk's fee, the session this day enact, that for the future one be kept, and 
that the sum of twelve pounds Scots be paid yearly to their clerk for that purpose. 
They also appoint their present clerk to buy a book at their expense, for entering 
their records." The clerk at this time was Mr Kemp, schoolmaster of the parish, 
afterwards minister of the parish of Gask, and father of the late Dr Kemp, one of the 
ministers of the Tolbooth Church, Edinburgh.

of Dunfermline ; and to this abbey, it is said, the proprietors of 
Stanley grounds are still liable in the yearly tribute of a grilse. 
At Strathhead, in Tullybeagles, is a shooting lodge ; and on the 
top of Craig- Gibbon, in the same property, is an obelisk, both built ' 
by Colonel Mercer, grandfather of the present Lady Keith. The 
lodge is now inhabited by a shepherd ; and the obelisk was built, 
that Colonel Mercer might distinguish his own hill in the range to 
which it belongs from his house at Meikleour, twelve miles distant 
from it, in the parish of Caputh. There is the site of a mound 
or a cairn at the Westertown of Kinglands, but its foundation has 
not yet been examined. 

Modern Buildings. — Stanley House can scarcely be called a 
modern building with propriety, for it was once a seat of the fa- 
mily of Nairne, and is an old house, evidently built at sundry times. 
But it has recently undergone a thorough repair, and received 
some additions, and is doubtless one of the most comfortable and 
delightful modern residences in this parish, or in any other. By 
whatever name the lands on which this house is situated may have 
been called at a remote period, it does not appear, from any do- 
cument or tradition known concerning it, that the place was nam- 
ed Stanley till some years after 1683, when Margaret, Lady 
Nairne, succeeded her father Robert, the first Lord. This lady 
was married to Lord William Murray, fourth son of the Marquis 
of Atholl by Lady Amelia Sophia Stanley, daughter of James Stan- 
ley, Earl of Derby. Tradition says, that after the union of the 
families of Atholl and Nairne, the mansion-house and grounds re- 
ceived the name of Stanley, in honour of the Marchioness of 
Atholl, that being her family name ; and, as the place is always 
spoken of as having been the dowager-house or residence of those 
members of the family not in immediate possession of the family 
honours, it is very probable that the above Lady Amelia, the 
Marchioness, came to reside in it at the death of her lord in 1703, 
when the name may have been first applied. This house is de- 
lightfully situated on the margin of the river Tay, amid magnifi- 
cent and beautiful scenery, and surrounded with beech and other 
trees of the most stately growth, evidently of a great age. Airly- 
wight House, the residence of James Wylie, Esq. of that ilk, is a 
large well-built edifice, erected within the last thirty years. It is 
situated on a rising ground, about a quarter of a mile from the 
public road between Perth and Dunkeld, from which it is a con- 
spicuous object. The House of Tullybelton is the only other man- 



AUCHTERUAVEN.

sion-house in the parish deserving of particular notice. Since the 
death of the proprietor, immediately preceding the present, in 1834, 
it has remained uninhabited, except by a gardener and his family. 
The parish church, two dissenting meeting-houses, the extensive 
cotton-mills at Stanley, and five corn-mills, are the principal pub- 
lic buildings in the parish. With the exception of the Stanley 
cotton-mills, which are chiefly constructed of brick, all these edi- 
fices are built of sandstone found in the parish, and covered with 
slates, also found in the parish, or in that of Little Dunkeld. Home- 
grown fir has been also extensively used in some of these buildings. 
Thus the parish contains an ample store of most kinds of building 
materials, for the clay out of which bricks are made is also found 
in it. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1755, from Dr Webster's return, was - 1677 

In 1795, according to the last Statistical Account, it was - 1784 

In 1811, there were 1188 males, 1369 females, Total, 2557 

1821, - - 1164 - 1314 - - 2478 

1831, - 1599 - 1818 - - 3417 

No reason is assigned in the old Statistical Account for the in- 
crease of 107, which, according to the preceding statement, occur- 
red between the years 1755 and 1795. In the census of 1811, the 
population of Tullybeagles was included,— a fact which sufficiently 
accounts for the excess of the census of that year above that of 
1821. Indeed, the wonder is, that the decrease of 1821 was not 
much greater than the figures indicate, namely, 79, for the popu- 
lation of Tullybeagles is now upwards of 200 ; and in the period 
between 1811 and 1821, the parish was not only in a state of transi- 
tion from small to large farms, but the Stanley cotton-mills remained 
idle from 1814 till 1823. The great increase of nearly a thousand, 
which took place between 1821 and 1831, arose from the operation 
of two very obvious causes,— the activity and extension of the Stan- 
ley cotton-mills, and the erection of two entirely new villages on 
the property of James Wylie, Esq. of Airlywight. In the two last 
census, the population of Tullybeagles was included in that of the 
parish of Methven, to which, indeed, the district belongs quoad om~ 
nia; at least there is no record of its having been annexed to this 
parish quoad sacra; although, for the convenience of the inhabi- 
tants, it has always in reality been so, as both minister and people 
act on the principle that it is so annexed. A considerable number 
of individuals, both male and female, has of late years emigrated 
from the parish, but not to the sensible diminution of the popula

tion, as the place of those who have left it is more than supplied 
by new settlers. A great increase has taken place since the tak- 
ing of the last census in 1831, so that at present the population 
exceeds 4000, and about 2600 live in villages ; that of Stanley 
alone is 1455. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years, - 56 
of deaths for the last five years, - 48 
of marriages for the last seven years, 28 

During the last three years, there have been in Stanley 9 ille- 
gitimate births; and 5 in the other districts of the parish. 

No register of deaths was kept in the parish till the beginning 
of 1833, when one was begun by the present minister. The only 
families of independent fortune residing in the parish are those of 
James Wylie, Esq. of Airly wight ; and of George Buchanan, Esq. 
of Stanley. There is nothing peculiar in the strength, size, com- 
plexion, or any other of the personal qualities of the people. Many 
of them are the descendants of those who inhabited the same places 
in the parish several generations ago ; and the intermarriages which 
have taken place among them have formed them into an extend- 
ed community of blood-relations. The most prevalent surnames 
are Paton, Crichton, Duff, Chalmers, and Dow; and, on the 
whole, the inhabitants of the landward part of the parish afford 
very favourable specimens of the Scottish peasantry. There are 
at present three insane, four fatuous, and two blind persons in it. 
There are four families in the western districts which claim both 
the English and the Gaelic as their native language. As they say 
themselves, they speak the former when they go to the south, and the 
latter when they go to the north. Many native Highlanders have, 
within the last twenty years, taken up their residence in the pa- 
rish, and, of course, speak their native language when they meet 
together. The Scottish dialect, however, is the universal lan- 
guage spoken, and equally well by all. Old Handsel Monday is 
kept as a holiday by young and old of the working-classes, when 
they put on their best attire, and visit their friends and neighbours. 
In general, the people are shrewd, sober, industrious, moral, and 
relio-ious. Smuggling is now unknown, and poaching, though some- 
times practised, is far from being common. Theft is a rare vice. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— It has been already stated that this parish, in its 
full extent of hill and dale, woodland and pasture, moor and 

 The discipline of Stanley is quite distinct from that of Auchtergaven. 



AUCI1TERGAVEN.

moss, covers an area of upwards of 19,000 imperial acres, of 
which 

about G000 are unable, 

796 are under wood, 

— ItiOO are in pasture, roads, ditches, &amp;c. 

and the remainder, amounting to considerably more than the half 
of the whole, is hill and moorland, fit only to be employed as 
sheep-walks, and pasture for black-cattle. There is no part of 
the parish in the state of undivided common. Each proprietor 
knows the bounds of his own property, although there is a claim 
preferred by the Laird of Airlywight, on behalf of his tenants, to 
cast turf on the ground, once a peat-moss, to which they had a 
right. But this claim is not sanctioned by the Duke of Atholl. 
Subjudice lis est. Much of the land stated as pasture is capable 
of cultivation, and much formerly in that condition has been re- 
claimed of late years. Upwards of 100 acres of green pasture 
land have been added to the arable portion of the Obney estate, be- 
longing to Sir William D. Stewart, since the commencement of the 
present leases, seven years ago. Nearly as large a portion has 
been added to the arable land in the barony of Tullybeagles. 
And valuable improvements — draining, fencing, and encroach- 
ments of the corn-fields upon the moors, are in progress throughout 
the parish. 

Woods. — Larch, Scotch fir, and a small quantity of oak, are the 
kinds of wood planted on the Strathord property, belonging to the 
Duke of Atholl. The plantations are from twenty to forty years 
of age, and all thriving well. A considerable portion of the wood 
in the barony of Obney is oak and other hard-wood trees. It is 
only seven years old, and occupies a part of the Birnam Forest. 
The wood is well distributed throughout the parish in clumps and 
belts, and gives it a rich and sheltered appearance. More than 
one-half of the Airlywight estate is surrounded by a broad belt of 
Scotch fir and larch. The woods are regularly thinned, and used 
for fences, and the wood-work of tenants' houses. 

Rural Economy — Rent. — The average rent of land in the parish 
may be stated at L. 1, 5s. per acre. Some farms, however, are let 
as high as L. 2, 10s. per acre. Grass parks, let annually by public 
roup in spring, bring about 10s. an acre more than land in lease. 
A milk cow is grazed at the rate of L. 3 ; an ox L. 2, 10s. { and 
a ewe 10s. per annum. 

Wages. — The general rate of wages for a labourer, per day 



438 



PERTHSHIRE. 



in summer, is 2s. and in winter, Is. 6d. If engaged for any 
length of time, from 9s. to 10s. a week is a common rate. 
Slate quarriers get higher wages, as their work exposes them 
to risk. A woman's wages for weeding and hoeing are 9d., in 
some cases only 8d. A good ploughman capable of taking the 
management of a pair of horses gets from L. 12 to L. 14 a-year, 
with six bolls and a half of oat meal and a Scots pint of new milk 
a-day. When from home the greater part of the day with carts, 
they have each sixpence additional. Women-servants get from 
L. 5 to L. 7, with bed and board a-year. Reaping in harvest is 
generally done by the th reave ; and 3d. are given for oats and 
barley, and 4d. for wheat per threave, exclusive of binding and 
stooking. A wright gets from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per day, as does also 
a mason. A tailor when he goes out to work charges Is. 3d. per 
day with victuals. A blacksmith gets L. 3 for keeping a team of 
two horses in shoes, and for keeping the carts, ploughs, and harrows, 
used by them in order. A cart costs from L. 7 to L. 10; an 
iron plough, — no other sort used now, — from L. 3 to L. 4 ; a drill 
harrow costs L. 1, 10s. There are 140 ploughs in the parish. 

Live-Stock. — The draught horses are generally large and power- 
ful, and a considerable number of them is bred in the parish. 

Number of draught horses, - 400 

milk cows, - 750 

young cattle, • 1 400 

sheep, - 4000 

The breed of cattle has been greatly improved of late years, by 
being crossed with the Ayrshire and the short horn breeds. Some 
of the farmers have the pure Ayrshire ; and some of them have 
introduced a few of the Angus-shire with advantage. The black- 
faced Scotch sheep is the only breed kept on the hills. A small 
number of the Leicester breed is kept by several of the farmers 
on the lower grounds. 

Husbandry. — The most improved and skilful methods of hus- 
bandry are practised throughout the parish. The five hand 
shift is now generally in use, as it has been found by experience 
a great improvement to have the land in the course of five-years, 
two of them in grass, one for hay, and the other for pasture. 
Wheat is raised in the lower districts of the parish, but oats and 
barley are the most prevalent grain crops. One-fifth part of the 
farm is always under turnips and potatoes, and the application of 
bone manure to the former is now much practised. On the large 
farms, the half of the turnip crop is eaten on the ground by sheep ; 



AUCHTERGAVEN. 



439 



and most of the potatoes are shipped at Perth for the London 
market. What has been said about the failure of this valuable 
crop, in the Statistical Account of Redgorton, is equally applica- 
ble to this parish. It is, however, worthy of notice, that there 
was no failure — scarcely a blank to be seen — in the year 1837, 
which perhaps was owing to the uncommon degree of cold, which 
prevailed in the spring of that year, having retarded the springing 
of the seed till it was planted. Trenching, draining, fencing, and 
the removal of boulder stones, with the application of lime and 
manure, are the chief modes of improvement. And these have 
been going on progressively for the last forty years, and have com- 
pletely changed the face of the country. All the proprietors have 
more or less encouragedtheir tenants to proceed with these opera- 
tions, and both have reaped the benefits resulting from them. 

Leases are generally granted for nineteen years ; and this is con- 
sidered a term of sufficient length for remunerating an enterprising 
farmer. Most of the farmers are comfortably lodged in well-built, 
and well-finished houses of two storeys, with suitable courts of of- 
fices. The land is subdivided into fields with thorn hedges, and 
strong wooden pailings put down for temporary purposes ; these 
are formed with upright posts and cross rails. Flakes are used in 
pasturing with sheep, and in eating off turnips. The wood for 
these enclosures in the Duke of AtholPs estates is prepared in the 
plantations, where it is cut by the woodmen, and driven by the 
tenants to its destination on the farms, and there put up by the 
woodmen. A saw-mill is now being erected at Loak for that 
purpose. 

Quarries. — Stones for all kinds of mason-work are obtained at 
Westerton of Kinglands, Speedyhill, Auchtergaven, Carrol, New- 
bigging, and Stanley. The quarries at the three last mentioned 
places are wrought at present ; and there is no doubt but good 
building materials would easily be found throughout the parish, 
wherever they might be wanted, as well as an inexhaustible store 
of roofing slates in the Grampian mountains within its bounds. 
The only slate quarry, however, which is wrought at present, is 
that of Glenshee, near the western extremity of the parish. 

Fisheries. — The only fishery in the parish is one at Stanley for 
salmon. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish may be guessed at from the following statement :

The Stanley Company are obliged to pay L. 75 per annum to 
the Duke of Atholl for the fishings on their grounds ; but now let 
them for L. 28 per annum. A rent of L. 80 a year is obtained 
for the game of the parish. 

Manufactures. — Under the head of manufactures, the first place 
is due to Stanley cotton-mills. They are situated between the 
village and the house of the same name on the margin of the river 
Tay ; and consist of spinning and weaving mills, propelled by 
seven water wheels, equal to 200 horse power, and affording em- 
ployment to 1000 people. These works were first built by George 
Dempster and Co. in 1785, and continued in their possession till 
1800, when they were bought by James Craig and others, who 
carried them on till 1814, when the works stopped till 1823, when 
they were bought by the present company, by whom, at vast ex- 
pense, they have been brought to their present state of magnifi- 
cence and efficiency. There has recently been some change in 
the copartnery of the works ; and I believe the present firm is 
" Buchanan and Sons." The fall of water is 16 feet, and the supply 
being from the Tay, never fails, though sometimes it is in such super- 
abundance as to stop the works. The lade or water course is car- 
ried across a hill 150 feet high, by means of a mine 800 feet long, 8 
feet high, and 10 feet wide, arched and paved throughout. Pre- 
vious, however, to the construction of this subterranean channel, two 
others were formed through the same hill at different times, — the 
earlier by John Lord Nairne in 1 729, for the purpose of driving 
a corn-mill; and the latter by Dempster and Co. in 1785, when 
the works were first erected. The circumstance of a mine of such 
extent having been formed at the period referred to, shows the pub- 
lic and enterprising spirit of the nobleman under whose auspices, 
and at whose expense it was undertaken and executed. It is told 
of his Lordship that he superintended the transporting of the first 
millstones across the Tay, at the Norlane boat, the only ferry on 
the river in the parish; and in those days, there being neither car- 



AUCHTERGAVEN. 



riages nor roads suited for the conveyance of such weighty masses, 
they were rolled on their edges from the quarry to their destina- 
tion, with a round beam or " wand," through the centre, having 
a number of men supporting at each end, and horses dragging in 
front. 

Not long ago there were four distilleries in the parish. At pre- 
sent there are only two in a state of activity. Malt is made at one 
other place besides at the distilleries. There are, as has been al- 
ready stated, five corn-mills in the parish. There are also two 
lint-mills in it. Many obtain employment by weaving for the ma- 
nufacturers of Blairgowrie, Dundee, Arbroath, and Newburgh. 
White linens and dowlas are the stuffs chiefly sent here to agents 
to be given out to the weavers, male and female. There are two 
manufacturers in the village of Bankfoot, who employ a number of 
weavers ; and two others in the parish of Little Dunkeld, who 
give work to ten individuals resident in it, in weaving linen, sheet- 
ine\ and shirting- for the home market. There are about 300 of 
the inhabitants of the parish employed in the different branches of 
the weaving craft, many of whom are young women ; many of them 
also are labourers, masons, wrights in summer, and almost all of 
them turn out to the shearing in harvest. 

The following table will afford an idea of the division of labour, 
and the different branches of industry carried on in the parish, ex- 
clusive of those already described : — Tailors 8, who employ 18; 
shoemakers, 26, who employ 40; masons, 8, who employ 14; 
wrights, 14, who employ 20; blacksmiths, 7, who employ 12; 
surgeons, 5; coopers, 3; quarriers, 12; fishers, 10; seedsmen, 3; 
slaters, 3; woodmen, 5; gardeners, 4; shopkeepers, 15; tinplate- 
smith, 1 ; .watchmaker, 1 ; turner, 1 ; sawyers, 6 ; bakers, 3. 

Work is carried on six days in the week, from six o'clock in the 
morning till the same hour in the evening, with the intermission 
of two hours for meals. Work at the cotton-mills begins at half- 
past five in the morning, and ends at seven in the evening, with 
the intermission of an hour and a half for meals. On Saturday, 
work ends at three o'clock in the afternoon. Children begin their 
work at the mills a quarter of an hour-to ten a. m., and end it at 
three p. m., that they may attend school. All in health when well 
employed can earn an adequate livelihood. 

V.— Parochial Economy. 

Villages, — There is no market-town in the parish, although all 
the necessaries and even many of the luxuries, of life are to be

had within its bounds. Perth and Dunkeld are resorted to, the 
former on Fridays and the latter on Saturdays, by the farmers for 
the disposal of the produce of their farms. The greater part of 
the parish is about equally distant from these towns — namely, from 
six to nine miles. There are three considerable villages, with 
eight hamlets, or clusters of houses, inhabited by small farmers 
and cottars. These were once much more numerous, but Bleloek, 
Ledmore, Tullybelton, and others have been razed to their foun- 
dations, and some of those which still remain are destined also to 
destruction. Self-defence must have been the inducement which 
made so many of the rural inhabitants congregate together in 
hamlets. " Their neighbourhood to the Grampians exposed them 
eternally to that species of visitation from the plaided gentry, who 
dwelt within their skirts, which made young Norval a warrior and 
a hero." But the days of the " creachs of the clans" have long 
gone by, and now there is not the least danger of a " foray." The 
third part nearly of Stanley, which has been so often mentioned, 
is within the bounds of the parish of Redgorton. It contains a 
population of upwards of 2000, and it owes its existence entirely 
to the cotton-mills. Previous to their erection in 1785, there was 
but one solitary house on the site which it now occupies ; and must 
have been a porter lodge to the house : for it was called the " Yett 
House of Stanley." Bankfoot and Cairniehill may be regarded as 
the same village, as the one stands on, and the other under, the 
same bank. They have been built within the last thirty years on 
ground feued by Mr Wylie of Airlywight. They are near the 
church, and contain 1000 inhabitants. The village of Waterloo, 
a mile and a half nearer Dunkeld, is also built on ground feued from 
Mr Wylie. It contains upwards of 100 inhabitants. Most of 
the weavers, the other tradesmen, and many of the labourers, live 
in the villages. Numbers of the feuars had once small farms in 
the parish, which now form parts of larger ones. 

Means of Communication. — The parish is traversed, for upwards 
of five miles, by the great north road from Edinburgh to Inver- 
ness, on which stage-coaches between Perth and Dunkeld pass 
daily, as well as the Inverness royal mail coach. There is a penny 
post from Perth to Bankfoot, at which letters arrive both from 
the south and the north every day. The statute labour ro ds in 
the parish extend to nearly twenty miles ; and across the streams 
in the line of these roads, including that of the turnpike, there are 
at least as many bridges, but none of more than one arch.

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church stands on a sloping 
bank, at the foot of which is the great road from Perth to Dun- 
keld. No situation could have been more convenient for the bulk 
of the population, when it was resorted to by that of Stanley. 
Since the erection of a church in that village, the population of 
the eastern extremity of the parish attend divine service there, 
while that in the western districts still attend the parish church, 
from which five families are from five to seven miles distant. The 
great body of the people, however, is within three miles and a half 
of the church, and many of them much nearer. The present fabric 
—an oblong building with a tower on its west end— was erected 
about twenty-six years ago. It is a firm substantial edifice, and 
seated to accommodate nearly 1200. At a meeting of heritors, 
held 8th June 1813, they divided the sittings among them accord- 
ing to their valued rent. And the Duke of Atholl's interest in 
the parish may be known from the fact, that nearly 700 of the 
seats fell to his share. His Grace built the tower, it is said, wholly 
at his own expense, besides his proportion along with the other 
heritors. Miss Mercer, now Lady Keith, assisted in building the 
church, and has seats in it for her tenants in Tullybeagles. The 
seats are all free, each farm having a certain number allotted to 
it ; and all have abundance of accommodation, except the people 
on the Airlywight property, which has been greatly increased by 
means of the feus in the villages of Bankfoot and Waterloo. 

Logiebride. — A small parish, named Logiebride, the church of 
which stood about a mile and a half to the south-west of that of 
Auchtergaven, on the banks of the Ordie, and where there is still 
a burying-place, was united to Auchtergaven, by an act of the 
Scottish Parliament, in the year 1618, and was afterwards separat- 
ed by the Bishop of Dunkeld. In 1647, the heritors and the 
parishioners petitioned the Presbytery of Dunkeld to have the pa- 
rishes again united : because there was not adequate stipend for 
two ministers — because the parish of Logiebride lay within the 
bosom of that of Auchtergaven, — and because all its inhabitants 

 " And as he" — the Bishop of Dunkeld — " found in an old record of his church, 
that the lands of Gawy, and the lands of Ferdischawe had once been a prebend for 
the entertainment of strangers, but the former Bishops had for sometime been in the 
use to apply it to their own advantage, this Bishop," Brown — " first got the consent of 
the canons, and then restored the prebend. But as the rents were too scanty for 
maintaining a decent hospitality, he joined to thisprebend the church of Logiebride." 
— Miln's History of the Bishops of Dunkeld in the Transactions of the Literary and 
Antiquarian Society of Perth, p. 51.

not exceeding six score of communicants, " were within a short 
mile of any of the two said kirks, without any stop or impediment 
of kirk-way." This matter was referred by the presbytery to the 
provincial synod of Perth and Stirling, which met at Stirling on 
the 14th April J 647, when in all probability they were put in the 
way of being again united, although I cannot state that such was 
the case, as the document, whence the above facts are taken, breaks 
off abruptly. The hardships of Mr Alexander Anderson, one of 
the ministers, are strongly insisted on in the petition of the heritors. 
" He was forced," they say, " to live these sixteen years in great 
distress, being burdened with wife, children, and family." This 
man's tombstone is still in the churchyard of Auchtergaven, on 
which his virtues are recorded. Divine service used to be per- 
formed at Logiebride for many years after the union, but nut 
within the memory of any one now living. An old man, upwards 
of eighty years of age, who died lately, remembered the church 
of Logiebride standing. 

Manse, Glebe, Stipend. — The manse was built ten years ago, and 
is a good plain house, situated a quarter of a mile westward from 
the church. The stipend consists of L. 73 money, 40 bolls of 
barley, and 81 bolls of meal. There are two glebes, one at Auch- 
tergaven, and one at Logiebride ; and the two together will mea- 
sure fully ten imperial acres ; they would let for about L. 20 ; the 
one is rather more than a mile distant from the other. A portion 
of the " Muir of Thorn,"  and also of another muir near Tully- 
belton, are said to belong to the minister of Auchtergaven. But 
as during the last thirty years the parish has been served by four 
assistants and successors to the late incumbent, who all that time 
lived at a distance from the parish, this land has not been claim- 
ed. The two first assistants and successors were soon removed to 
other parishes ; the third died in 1830; and the present incumbent 
has not hitherto deemed it prudent to attempt the establishment of 
his right to these "muirs," although he has not abandoned the inten- 
tion of doing so. There is no grass glebe unless it be these muirs. 

Stanley Chapel. — Soon after the erection of the cotton-mills at 
Stanley, the company employed a preacher, with the approbation 
of the parishes in which the village is situated, to do duty there on 
Sundays in a school-house. In 1828, the present proprietors of 
the works petitioned the presbytery of Dunkeld, praying to have 

 This muir extends over a portion of the surface of this parish, as well as that of 
the parishes of Little Dunkeld and Kinclaven.

a chapel of ease established in their village in communion with the 
Church of Scotland, and promising to erect a suitable place of 
worship at their own expense. This petition was favourably en- 
tertained, and a constitution for the chapel was sanctioned by the 
General Assembly of the same year. Mr Johnstone, now in the 
parish of Auchtermuchty, was ordained its first minister, and the 
promised chapel was built at an expense of more than L. 3000. 
It is an elegant building, surmounted by a tower, and contains 
sittings for 1150 persons. It was erected into aparish, quoad sa- 
cra, in 1834. As the church stands within the verge of the pa- 
rish of Redgorton, it belongs to the presbytery of Perth ; but more 
than two-thirds of the hearers are from this parish. The Stanley 
Company have generously given the minister a house and garden, 
which are in this parish, in addition to a stipend of L. 150. 

In the village of Bankfoot, there are two dissenting meeting- 
houses, one connected with the United Seceders, and another con- 
nected with the Relief Synod. About 150 heads of families, in- 
habitants of this parish, are members of these places of worship, or 
of a Seceder meeting in the parish of Kinclaven. But many of 
the younger branches of these families, as well as the servants be- 
longing to them, attend the Established Church. The ministers 
of these dissenting chapels are paid by the seat-rents of their re- 
spective places of worship; but the amount of which I am unable 
to state. The parish church, when the weather permits, is well 
attended both by old and young. The average number of com- 
municants at Auchtergaven, is 800 ; at Stanley, from this parish, 
600. The average amount of collections for religious and chari- 
table purposes, throughout the year, is L. 50. 

Education. — There are at present five schools in the parish, in 
all of which the common branches of knowledge, reading, writing, 
and arithmetic, are taught. The parochial teacher has the legal 
accommodation, and the maximum salary ; and besides the elemen- 
tary branches already specified, he is qualified to teach English 
grammar, Latin, book-keeping, and practical mathematics. The 
school-fees are small, and not well paid ; they will scarcely amount 
to L. 15 a year. The Stanley Company maintain a large school 
at their own expense. They give the teacher a house and gar- 
den, and a salary of L. 20 a year, besides furnishing a spacious 
school-room. This school is generally attended by about 1 00 pupils, 
and the teacher is qualified to teach the higher branches of know- 



446 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ledge, including those of Latin, Greek, and French. There is a 
school in the village of Bankfoot, called the " Subscription 
School." Mr Wylie of Airly wight gave the ground on which it 
is built, with a play-ground attached to it, and the feuars contribut- 
ed the money by subscription for its erection. By a legal disposi- 
tion, the teacher, before his election by the subscribers, which is 
annual, must have satisfied the presbytery of Dunkeld of the cor- 
rectness of his moral and religious character, and of his ability to 
teach the elementary branches of knowledge required. This school 
has no endowment, but as it is numerously attended, the teacher 
makes a tolerable livelihood. The other two schools are in situa- 
tions of the parish too remote from the parochial or the Stanley 
and Bankfoot schools to be benefited by them. One of them 
is at Obney, and is unendowed, as is also the other, which is at 
Tullybelton. Efforts are making at present to have a new school - 
house at Obney, and to have a school established at the Wester- 
ton of Kinglands, on the General Assembly's Scheme — a place 
where a school is much wanted, and by the erection of which that 
at Tullybelton would be superseded. The people are abundant- 
ly alive to the benefits resulting from education ; and all without 
exception are taught the elementary branches of knowledge, and 
many of them the higher departments of it. The only fault to be 
found with parents in reference to the education of their children 
is a capricious desire of novelty leading them perpetually to change 
their teachers, till they are themselves taught by experience, that 
the old were better than the new. From time to time adventurers 
open schools both in Stanley and Bankfoot, and are supported for 
a while, but both these teachers and their employers soon become 
mutually tired of each other. There is a Sabbath school at Stan- 
ley, attended by between three and four hundred of the young peo- 
ple of that place. The minister has a Sabbath school in the 
church of Auchtergaven, attended by from fifty to sixty young 
people. And another Sabbath school is taught at Tullybeagles, 
by Mr William Duff, a preacher, assisted by the schoolmaster 
of Obney school. In all the schools in the parish the Scriptures 
are regularly read, and the Shorter Catechism, with the Proofs, 
taught. The situation of the parochial school is somewhat out of 
the way of the people, and it would be a great advantage were it 
nearer the church. And no greater blessing could be bestowed 
upon the parish than a new school- house at Obney, and a school 



AUCHTERGAVEN. 



447 



on the General Assembly's scheme at Kinglands. A school here 
would also accommodate the barony of Mullion in Redgorton parish, 
as also a large district in that of Moneydie. 

Literature. — A library was instituted in the village of Bankfoot 
in 1822, and is under the management of a committee of the sub- 
scribers, consisting of apreses, a treasurer, a librarian, and a clerk, 
with five members elected annually. The books amount to near- 
ly 300 volumes, and consist of theology, history, and general lite- 
rature. The entry money is 2s. 6d. and the annual subscription 
is 2s., paid half-yearly. There is another library at Stanley, which 
contains 560 volumes of well-selected works on various subjects. 
The fees are 2s. for entry money, and afterwards 9d. per quarter. 
Stanley, however, is not a reading community, as those who avail 
themselves of the advantages of this valuable collection of books 
do not exceed twenty. By the laws of the library it cannot be 
alienated, but must remain the public property of the village. 

Charitable Institutions. — The Benevolent Society of Stanley is 
entitled to the first notice under this head. It was instituted in 
1831, for the purpose of assisting poor people, and is supported 
by voluntary contributions. The average disbursements have been 
till lately about L. 40 per annum — they now exceed L. 60 — and 
in such sums as the necessities of applicants may demand, but 
averaging about Is. per week. Coals, clothes, food, and medi- 
cines are given to the necessitous according to circumstances. 

Stanley Funeral Society. — A society for defraying the expense 
arising from funerals was instituted at Stanley in 1831, the mem- 
bers of which are now about 1200. Every member pays Is. of 
entry money, and afterwards Id. for every funeral which occurs. 
When the head of a family dies, L. 4 are advanced to pay the 
charges of his funeral ; and when a child dies, L. 2 are paid for 
the same purpose. The sum of L. 30 is always kept in hand, that 
in cgse of any unusual mortality taking place at nearly the same 
time, the collections may not come too frequently upon the mem- 
bers. An educational society has also recently been instituted at 
Stanley for assisting the poor to pay for the education of their 
children. 

Savings Banks. — In January 1831 a savings bank was also es- 
tablished at Stanley by a few individuals connected with the works. 
The baleful influence of the " cotton-spinners' combination" has 
prevented this institution from producing the benefits which it is 



448

fitted to yield to the inhabitants of such a village as that of Stan- 
ley, for not a few, of whom better things might have been expect- 
ed, have been busy in crying it down, not only as unnecessary, 
but in stigmatizing it as a nuisance. These persons think and say, 
and have been at pains in spreading their opinions, that were they 
to put their earnings into a savings bank, it would be the signal 
for their employers to reduce their wages ; and prefer spending 
them as they are won, to laying aside what might be spared against 
sickness or old age- The consequence of this feeling has been to 
create a general and astrong prejudice against savings banks; so that 
in four years only twenty-seven depositors had entered that of Stan- 
ley, the amount of their deposits being L. 214. This unhappy preju- 
dice is the more to be regretted, as there exists no Benefit or Friend- 
ly Society in the place, or indeed in the parish, although several of 
the parishioners are members of institutions of this description both 
in Dunkeld and Perth. A savings bank was instituted in the vil- 
lage of Bankfoot in January 1833, on liberal principles. The 
stock at present amounts to L. 350. Deposits from Is. and up- 
wards are received every Tuesday evening. This institution has, 
no more than that of Stanley, met with the encouragement it de- 
serves. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of paupers 
upon the poor- roll for the last seven years is 20, and the monthly 
allowance to each is, according to circumstances, from 3s. to L. 1. 
They receive their respective allowances once every lunar month ; 
and three times a-year — immediately after the dispensation 
of the Lord's Supper in summer, at the beginning of winter, 
and at the new year,— they receive an additional allowance for the 
purpose of purchasing fuel and warm clothing, and getting a loaf, 
and perhaps a bit of butcher's meat, at a time of general rejoi- 
cing. The funds for the poor in 1837 were L. 120, 9s. 4±d. and 
were derived from the following sources : 

Auchtergaven collections, 

Two-thirds of the collections of Stanley church,

L. 115, 9s. 6fd. In the course of 1837, the kirk-session receiv- 
ed the sum of L. 50 from the trustees of the late John Thomas, 
coach-builder in Glasgow, bequeathed by him for the benefit of 
the poor of this his native parishc This money is at present de- 
posited in the savings bank, and the interest is to be used in buy- 
ing warm clothing for a few aged persons. There has never been 
any assessment in -this parish enforced by statutory enactment ; 
and it will be obvious from the above statement, that were the 
heritors resident, and did they attend the parish church, none 
whatever would be required, as the small sum of about L. 30, vot- 
ed at their annual meetings according to their valued rent, is but 
a fraction of what they would give in the course of the year, did 
they and their families attend the parish church. The only heri- 
tor resident in the parish at present is a Dissenter, and consequent- 
ly contributes not one farthing towards the sum collected at the 
church doors. The spirit of independence by which Scotsmen 
have been so eminently distinguished is far from being extinct here. 
The villages at present absorb the whole of the monthly disburse- 
ments except 7s. monthly to a blind man, and 3s. to a bed-ridden 
old man in the landward part of the parish. 

Fairs. — An annual fair or market was once held on the banks 
of the Ordie, at a place called the Hole of Tulybelton, a beau- 
tiful dell, at which many Highlanders attended to sell wool, cheese, 
and butter, and other produce of their land and industry. This 
market no longer exists ; but there is still a fair held at Auchter- 
gaven, on the second Friday of November, for cattle, sheep, and 
general business. 

Public -Houses. — There are no fewer than twenty-six houses 
within the bounds of the parish, licensed to sell " porter, ale, and 
British spirits," a number altogether extravagant for the wants of 
the inhabitants. In the Stanley district alone, there are twelve of 
these houses, which is about one public-house for every thirty-one 
families. At least three- fourths of these are public nuisances, 
and most hurtful to the morals of the inhabitants, as it is by them 
chiefly that they are maintained. These houses are not so prejudi- 
cial in the other parts of the parish, as they are all on the turnpike 
and other public roads in it ; and are supported chiefly by tra- 
vellers and carriers to and from the Highlands. Still they are 
more numerous than necessary. It is difficult to get rid of houses 
of this description which have enjoyed a license any length of time, 
unless some complaint be preferred against them ; but the justices 

PERTH. F f 



450 



PERTHSHIRE. 



of the peace have of late very properly set their face against in- 
creasing their number. 

FweZ.-— English coals from the depots in Perth, at the rate of 
L. 1 a ton, form the staple article of fuel. They are hawked through 
the villages occasionally by carters from Perth. They are also re- 
tailed at Stanley Company's store ; and they are kept by one ge- 
neral merchant in Bankfoot for the same purpose. The Duke of 
AtholFs tenants and the minister of the parish have the right of cast- 
ing peats in Craigleith moss, situated in the moor of Thorn, which 
occupies a part of this parish, as well as of those of Little Dunkeld 
and Kinclaven. The inhabitants of Obney, Tullybeagles, and 
Kino-lands find peats in the Grampians, at the foot of which they 
have their habitations. The poor have also permission to cast a 
few loads of peats each in the Craigleith moss. Peeled coppice 
oak, slaps from saw-mills, in the parish of Little Dunkeld, and 
branches fallen in the woods are all used as fuel. Many of the 
farmers in summer drive coals from the coal fields of Fife and 
Clackmannan. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In the old Statistical account of this parish, after a statement 
of its extent, it is added, — " But a great proportion of this con- 
sists of hills and muirs, or waste uncultivated ground." And cer- 
tainly, so long as the road from Perth to Dunkeld passed through 
the Moor of Thorn, the aspect of the parish to the traveller must 
have been bleak and dreary in the extreme ; and consequently in 
Gazetteers, it is described as a " hilly moorish parish," and dismis- 
sed as unworthy of farther notice. And about forty years ago, 
when the 64 runrig" system of farming prevailed, it must have 
yielded a very limited quantity of produce in proportion to what 
now, under an improved system, it is made to yield. The hills 
stand, and must continue to stand, the norlh-western boundary of 
the parish, and a most striking feature in the landscape as far as the 
eye can reach. But now scarcely a vestige of moor ground 
can be seen from the turnpike road, and what still remains of it 
is on the outskirts of the parish, and is every year in the way of 
being reduced in quantity. Draining, planting, enclosing, im- 
proved tillage, and judicious cropping have completely changed 
the face of the country ; so that this parish is entitled to rank with 
the best cultivated districts in the wide county of which it forms 
a part. The landlords have encouraged the improvement of their 
property, and have been seconded by their tenants.

It is to be regretted, however, that the moral improvement of 
the ploughmen has not kept pace with that of the land, which 
they know so well how to cultivate. The bothy system may be 
regarded as the main cause of this. Young men associate to- 
gether in an out-house of the farm, cook their own victuals, which 
is generally oatmeal brose and milk. Thus they never meet in a 
domestic capacity, spend much of their time, especially in winter, 
not under the inspection of their masters, and the bad tend to cor- 
rupt the good. The evil arising from these causes is not very fla- 
grant as yet. But instances of young men breaking their contracts, 
and becoming regardless of the duties of religion, occasionally oc- 
cur. A corrective of this might perhaps be found by introdu- 
cing the practice of having married hinds on the farm, as in East 
Lothian, and causing the unmarried young men to live in their 
families. At present farm-servants who have wives have their 
houses not on the farms to which they belong, but in the villages. 

The police of Stanley is very efficient; and ill-behaved persons 
when found out, are forthwith discharged from the mills. And 
by this means there is not a more orderly or a more respectable 
manufacturing population in the empire than the inhabitants of 
that village. But the want of an active Justice of the Peace, as- 
sisted by a few steady and faithful constables, together with a tem- 
porary place of confinement for delinquents, is deeply felt occa- 
sionally at Bankfoot, to check the exuberance of youthful frolic.

PRESBYTERY OF WEEM, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. DAVID DUFF, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— So far back as anything can be traced regarding the 
parish, it has been called Kenmore ; or, as it is found in the re- 
cords of bygone times, Kenmure, Candmoir, Kandmor. The 
name is evidently Gaelic, and is a compound of the two simple 
terms, « ceann," head, and « nor," great. The name has ori- 
ginated, in all probability, from the geographical character of the 
place where the parish church stands, being a beautiful and con- 
spicuous headland projecting into the lower end of Lochtay, and 
forming the southern bank of the river at its outset. But though 
this has immemoriallv been the name of the parish, and though, 
from an indefinable period, there has been a place of worship where 
the present church stands, it appears from the session records, and 
other old documents, that the principal place of worship, as also 
the burying-ground and residence of the clergymen, were at 

Inchadyn.  . . 

Extent, 2c— The parish is of great extent, containing probably 
62 square miles of surface, or about 40,000 acres. Its figure is 
exceedingly irregular, stretching on both sides of Lochtay, and 
with portions detached by.the intersection of other parishes. It is 
bounded on the east by the parishes of Dull and Weem ; on the 

 Tn the  Black Book of Taymouth," there occurs this statement, " Sir Duncan 
rnvobell 7th laird of Glenurquhay, had a daughter, Elizabeth, married m the kirk 
S Candmoir to the 2d son of Irving of Drumc in 1621." And m the session re- 
cord of date 28th December 179, it is said « the mimster went to the ferry, but 
could not Get crossing for the storminess of the day, and so no sermon at Kenmure. 
But at n£ddon there was both lecture and sermon to all that came thither and on 
that side of the river." The place then and long known by the name of Inchadyn 1S 
Wrf W to be traced. It lies on the north bank of the Tay, rather more than a 
SEw y th°e s t e oft e church of Kenmore, and is comprehended within the parks 
of Taymouth. Prior to the Reformation it was a vicarage, as appears by the follow- 
Tng quotations from an old and rather cur cms MS in the library of Taymouth 
"obitus domini Morisii M'Nauchtyn, vicarn de Inchadyn, apudWeymvm Aprihs 
an° Di mvTrimo, et scpultus in Inchadyn." 1501. Again; « Obitus Drm Dunca- 
ni M'Nauchtyn, vicarii de Inchadyn apud Perth et sepultus in Inchadyn, sexto die

west by part of the parishes of Killin and Weem ; and on the 
south and north by those hills which rise from the sides of the 
loch, and border on the south with Comrie and Monivaird, and on 
the north with Fortingal and Weem. 

Topographical Appearances.— The most striking feature in the 
district is Lochtay, a beautiful basin of water, extending from the 
village of Kenmore, at the one extremity, to that of Killin at the other, 
a distance of nearly sixteen miles. On either side, there is a pa- 
rallel range of mountains, rising gradually from the margin, and, in 
one instance at the summit of Benlawers, attaining to an elevation of 
more than 4000 feet above the level of the sea. The lower portion 
of these Alpine ranges, from the edge of the lake, and all round it, 
to nearly a mile upwards, is in a state of tillage, or under pasture, or 
covered with wood, partly natural and partly planted. At the 
upper limit of this zone, commences the russet hue of the heath, 
but yet, all over, pleasingly and richly intermingled with verdure, 
which in many places prevails to the very loftiest ridge. Nor is 
there any interruption to this agreeable appearance by the inter- 
vention of rough, broken, and precipitous rocks. The line pre- 
sented to the eye, as far as it can reach, is the varied and waving 
line of beauty. There is but little of what may be styled low, flat 
land. At the mouths of the more considerable streams, whi ch 
rush into the lake, there are formed deltas of some few hundred 
yards. The most extensive formation of that kind is at the upper 
extremity of Lochtay, where the waters of Glendochart and Glen- 
lochay discharge themselves, and, by their spoils from above, have 
composed the rich meadows of Auchmore, Kinnell, and Finlarig. 
At the opposite extremity begins the basin or valley of the Tay. 
This opens out at once into a fine plain, about a mile in width, 
with the river, even at its very birth, full and deep, as if it had 
been a stream of an hundred miles, sweeping its powerful flood 
through the splendid parks of Taymouth. With these exceptions, 
the land rises everywhere with considerable acclivity, from the 
edge of the water, — the character of the arable portion, being in 
general that of steep ground, and rather difficult to be worked. 

There is a small detached part of the parish in Glenquaich. 
This valley runs nearly parallel to Strath tay, and its waters, first 
collected into the Quaich, and afterwards into the Braan, empty 
themselves into the Tay at Dunkeld. For the space of more 
than a mile above the entrance of the Quaich into Lochfraochie, 
there is a dead level of swampy, undrained, and apparently un- 
drainable land.

Meteorology. — No register of a meteorological nature has been 
kept in this district. But we may come to some interesting conclu- 
sions by the aid of a set of observations made at no great distance. 
In Moulin, for instance, where the writer was incumbent for many 
years, a parish about 12 miles in a direct line to the north-east of 
this, I found, on an average of six years, beginning with 1813, and 
terminating with 1818, the state of the thermometer to be 46.5 ; — 
that of the barometer 29.43; — that of the rain-gauge 30.81 inches; 
and the number of days in which the wind was from the west, with 
its different points to the north and south, to be 158, to which, if 
we add one-half of the days in which it blew from the north or 
south, which probably were as often on the west side of these points 
as otherwise, we shall have 204 days of a westerly wind. Though 
the distance between Moulin and Lochtay side be but small, I am 
inclined to think that we have heavier and more frequent rains in 
Breadalbane, so much so, perhaps, as to raise our average to about 
32 inches in the year : as I am inclined also to think that the 
wind is here oftener from the west. Upon the whole, we are ex- 
posed to great degrees of neither heat nor cold. The vast body 
of water contained in Lochtay probably exercises both in summer 
and winter, no inconsiderable influence upon the state of the at- 
mosphere. Certain it is, that neither does the loch ever freeze, 
nor does snow lie long except in winters of extraordinary severity, 
as those of 1814 and 1838, within a certain height from the verge 
of the water. In January, and the beginning of February 1838, 
when the thermometer in the open air was so low as to range be- 
tween 1° and 32°, the temperature of the lake was found to be 40°. 

The atmosphere of the parish is uniformly pure and salubrious, 
which is sufficiently evinced, as well by the general healthiness of the 
people, as by numerous instances of longevity. The prevalent dis- 
tempers may be stated to be affections of the breast and lungs, 
exhibiting themselves in coughs, consumptions, &amp;c. Rheumatism 
is a very common complaint. 

Lochtay. — The principal lake is Lochtay, a vast body of water, 
stretching from north-east to south-west, in nearly the form of the 
letter S. It is about 16 miles in length, on an average rather more 
than a mile wide, and in some places probably not less than 600 
feet in depth. It may be considered as presenting a surface of 
about 17 square miles, or 10,000 acres. Except at the two ends, 
the channel everywhere shelves rapidly from the edge, so as to 
bring you by a single step or two into deep and dangerous water. 
The lake is fed at its south-west extremity by the rivers Dochart 



KENMORE.

and Lochay, besides the supplies which it receives from the tribute 
of innumerable streams rushing down the sides of the mountains 
on both banks. From its north-east extremity, pours out the noble 
Tay, which, after flowing beautifully through Strathtay, part of 
Strathmore, and along the Carse of Gowrie, discharges itself into 
the German Ocean some miles beyond Dundee ; delivering, as is 
supposed, a greater quantity of water than any other river of Bri- 
tain. With the water which it is thus removing from us, it is, like 
all its congeners, incessantly taking away what can be less spared. 
It were interesting to inquire, if this were the fitting opportunity, 
what quantity of our best soil, the debris of the mountains and val- 
leys, is borne down by this ever-active agent, to the estuary of the 
Tay, and to the caverns of the deep. Say this river discharges 
3000 cubie feet of water per second. It is supposed that in each 
200 cubic feet of water, there is contained one cubic foot of mud. 
Say but the half of that, however. That would give to the Tay, 
7.5 cubic feet per second, 648,000 per day, or about 236,520,000 
cubic feet of mud per annum. The water of the lake suffers, at 
times, violent and uncommon agitations. An interesting descrip- 
tion of one of these phenomena is given in the former Statistical 
Account of the parish, Vol xvii. 457. 

Next to Lochtay, is Lochfraochie in Glenquaich, a sheet of water 
about three miles in length, and one in breadth, of which but a part 
is in this parish ; there being portions of it connected with the parishes 
of Dull and Little Dunkeld. The scenery of this lake is rather tame, 
and so is the general aspect of the glen, as there is hardly any plant- 
ing, and even but little natural wood. The chief feeder of Loch- 
fraochie is the Quaich, a bold mountain torrent rising in this pa- 
rish. From the loch, a little above Amulree, issues the Braan, 
which, after a run of about ten miles through Strathbraan, enters 
the Tay, as stated before, at Dunkeld. 

Cascades. — The formation of the country naturally occasions 
the existence of numerous cascades. Almost all the streams, in- 
deed, which come down the mountain sides, may be regarded, each, 
as one continued waterfall ; and when swelled with heavy rain, or 
the sudden melting of snow, they become peculiarly striking. 
There is one, however, which is well-deserving of being particular- 
ised ; the fall of Acharn, or otherwise the hermitage, distant about 
two miles from the village of Kenmore. Of the many travellers 
passing through Kenmore, few fail to pay a visit to that remark- 
able spot : nor, if they have been endowed with the capacity of re-

lishing nature in a state of beauty or grandeur, can they leave it 
without bearing along with them feelings of high gratification. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks of the parish are said to 
consist almost entirely of the oldest or primitive class, and are, for 
the most part, of a highly crystalline structure, and devoid of or- 
ganic remains or petrifactions. Where the rocks are stratified, 
the beds or strata run usually in a course from south-west to north- 
east, and dip generally to the southward, at angles rarely reaching 
30°. The mountains generally run in lines from south-west to 
north-east, parallel to the prevailing direction of the strata. The 
principal rock in the parish is the mica slate, which presents 
many varieties, and is in some places intermixed with some of those 
inter-stratified rocks which are commonly associated with it. There 
are gneiss, clay slate, chlorite slate, and some varieties of horn- 
blende slate. The chlorite slate is very conspicuous in Ben- 
lawers, and in the ridge that is continuous with it. In the south- 
ern part of the parish, and not far from the village of Kenmore, 
where the mica slate joins with the clay slate, there occurs 
a variety of this, approaching in character both to chlorite and to 
talc slate, which has been wrought for building the Castle of 
Taymouth. It is an excellent stone for architectural purposes, 
and resembles that of which Inverary Castle is built. Beds of 
primitive limestone occur in two or three places, on both sides 
of Lochtay, forming beds among the other primitive rocks, 
and conformable to them in direction and position. They are 
often extenuated after a very short course, so as to disappear ; 
sometimes, however, they recur again, in the same line, so as to 
make us suppose, that they have been continued without onr per- 
ceiving it. The strata about Lochtay appear to form part of the 
large bed which extends north-east towards Shichallein and Blair- 
Atholl, between which and Lochtay there are beds of this rock, 
which appear in several places. 

Zoology. — It is unnecessary to enlarge our article by many ob- 
servations on the zoology of the parish, as there can hardly be 
any thing in this respect to distinguish it from others similarly situ- 
ated. There is a long zoological list, given by the late Dr Stuart 
in his Statistical Account of the parish of Luss, Vol. xvii. 247 ; and 
it is likely that at one time or other of the year, there may be found, 
either remaining with us, or visiting us, almost every one of the

animals there enumerated. If you should saunter through the 
parks or woods of Taymouth, you might regard yourself as being 
within the bounds of a vast menagerie, so considerable is the va- 
riety of animals which you would see. Besides the different 
breeds of sheep to be found in one set of inclosures, and of 
cattle in another, you would perceive browsing or bounding here 
and there, the red, the fallow, and the roe-deer ; and besides 
having your attention ever and anon attracted by the gambols of 
the squirrel, or the whirrings of the pheasant, your walk may 
chance to bring you within sight, or perhaps encounter, of greater 
strangers, — the clumsy emu of the Asiatic isles may appear stalk- 
ing before you ; or you may meet the bison, which has come from 
the banks of the Missouri to astonish with his grotesque figure ; 
or you may find yourself in the vicinity of a staring buffalo, or in 
the middle of a herd of white Caledonian cattle. But by much 
the most interesting sight is that of the capercailzie, or cock of 
the wood, about to be again introduced to the forests of Scotland. 
With us, the bird has been a stranger for about seventy years. In , 
the course of 1837, there were brought to Taymouth twenty-eight 
birds of this beautiful species of grouse. They were given to the 
Marquis of Breadalbane by Mr T. Fowel Buxton, late M, P. for 
Weymouth, who sent his gamekeeper to Sweden to procure them. 
Of these, some are still kept in confinement, while a number have 
been allowed to go at large. The cock appears to be of a bold, 
pugnacious spirit ; is splendid in mien and plumage ; and may be 
about 16 lbs. in weight. The bird must have been pretty com- 
mon at one period in Scotland.  

Botany. — This parish, like most Highland parishes, presents an 
interesting field of observation to the botanist. 

In the low grounds, on the borders of Lochtay, and in the 
woods in its immediate neighbourhood, the lover of plants will 
find the following specimens of the less common plants.

Of the cryptogamic plants, the number is so great, that only a 
very few can be mentioned. The rarer Alpine ferns are, Asfi- 
dium Lonchitis, Cyatheafragilis and dentnta, IVoodsia hyperborea. 
The Aspidium lobatum, Asplenium viride and septentrionale, Sco- 
lopendrium vidgare, and Hymenophyllum Wilsoni, are found on 
the moist rocks at the sides of rivulets. In rocky places, the 
Polypodium Phegopteris and Dryopteris, Grammitis Ceterach y 
and Cryptogramma crispa, may be met with. In upland pastures, 
the Ophioglossum vulgatum and Botrychium lunaria ; and in fir

woods the Aspidium dilatatum and cristatum, also occur. The 
beautiful Osmimda regalis grows on the north bank of Lochtay, 
about two miles west from the village of Kenmore ; and on the 
walls of the Priory ruins in the island of Lochtay, the Asphnium 
Ruta-muraria is found. In wet places and lakes, the Pilularia 
globulifcra and Isoetes lacustris may also be met with. 

Of the order Musci, the following rare Alpine species may be 
found :

Woods, Natural and Planted. — The soil and climate of this district 
appear to be particularly favourable to the growth of trees. The indi- 
genous are, oak, ash, birch, mountain-ash, alder, hazel, bird-cherry, 
hawthorn, holly; and, of some of these kinds, not a few attain to a very 
great size. The plantations consist chiefly of larch and Scotch fir. 
There are interspersed, however, through these plantations, or there 
occur, either in groups by themselves, or in lines, a vast number of 
beeches, elms, sycamores, limes, chestnuts, both horse and Spanish, 
spruces, Weymouth pines, silver firs, geans, laburnums, white beams, 
&amp;c. The laurel, Prunus laurocerasus, is found in great profusion 
and of most luxuriant growth ; as is also the Portuguese laurel, 
Primus Lusitanicus, though by no means in such plenty. You will 
likewise meet occasionally with fine specimens of the cedar, the

cypress, the yew, the arbor-vitse of both east and west, the hem- 
lock-spruce ; not to speak of a considerable variety of smaller and 
shrubby evergreen exotics, now in course of planting. 

The extent of ground covered with wood, whether planted or 
natural, is very considerable; probably not less than 8 square 
miles, or about 5000 acres. And the susceptibility of the soil 
for the growth of timber, as well as the favourable character of 
the climate, may be clearly seen from an examination of the sub- 
joined table, it is the result of measurements made by the writer 
of this article at a few " idle hours," which, it is to be hoped, will 
not be said to have been altogether idly spent. The specimens 
selected are all within a circle round the Castle of Taymouth, of a 
radius little more than two miles, in latitude 56° 38', and growing 
at an elevation above the level of the sea, ranging from about 360 
to about 700 feet ; and some of the very largest trees, particular- 
ly the larches, oaks, and Scotch firs, are at the latter height. The 
measurement was taken, in each individual, at two feet above the 
surface of the ground.

these giants of the forest, let me recommend to him to look at the 
ash behind the Inn of Kenmore ; the beech at the saw-mill ; the 
four Spanish chestnuts at the foot of the bank in front of the fort ; 
the elm to the south of Lady Breadalbane's garden; the lime 
nearly in front of the castle ; and the larch beside the Rock-lodge. 

It is worthy of observation that many of the trees comprehended

in the list from which the preceding table has been constructed 
are flourishing in ground to which the plough could never be ap- 
plied ;— in some places, for instance, so steep as to be hardly climb- 
able ; and in others so rocky and full of stones, that no labour 
could remove them. To plant such situations, of which there are 
thousands in Scotland, seen bleak and naked, is the lesson obvi- 
ously urged by these facts. Nor would the doing so be a mere waste 
of labour or ground : on the contrary, there would, in process of 
time, be drawn from these solitudes more than a remunerating- re- 
turn ; and besides, let it be considered how much there would 
thereby be added to the beauty and picturesque appearance of the 
country. 

Horticulture. — Nor do soil and climate appear to be less propitious 
hereto the growth and maturation of several of the gardener's nurs- 
lings. Some interesting exemplifications of this remark might be 
given; as, for instance, the case of a gourd, probably the Cucurbitus 
pepo, which, in the open air, and without the aid of any artificial 
heat, in the summer of 1837, grew, in the space of about six weeks, 
to such an enormous size, that it measured round its largest cir- 
cumference 61 inches, and weighed 59 lbs imperial; — or the case 
of a cabbage of the flat Dutch which weighed 24 lbs ; — or the 
case of a plant of potatoe of a third year seedling which had nearly 
200 tubers, the weight of the whole being 24 lbs. 

II. — Civil History. 
The session records, in which there are entries so far back as 
1636, bring to view facts illustrative of the manners of the people 
in former times, by means of which we are able to institute a com- 
parison between them and the people of the present day. The 
result is an impression decidedly in favour of the superior know- 
ledge and comfort, as well as the superior moral tone of the ex- 
isting generation. From the middle of the seventeenth to that of the 
eighteenth century, scarcely a Sabbath occurred, but the session 
was occupied with a case of discipline, and sometimes with sever- 
al cases on the same day. These arose out of acts of drunkenness, 
quarrelling, and incontinence. To show still farther the state of 
those times, it may be mentioned that processes regarding the use 
of charms and incantations were not unfrequent. The present 
age is certainly not without instances of moral delinquency : but I 
will venture to say, upon the evidence of that document, that they 
do not amount to a tithe of their number in the days of our fore- 
fathers. From the testimony of another manuscript, it would appear 



KEN MORE. 



that those days were often disgraced by doings of a more atro- 
cious character. This manuscript, which is in the library of Tay- 
mouth, is of the nature of a Diary. The writer was a Roman Catho- 
lic, probably Vicar of Inchadyn or Fortingal, and lived several years 
before the end of the sixteenth century. Among the variety of 
curious things stated in that manuscript I find mention frequently 
made of bloody feuds and murders among the people. An event of 
either description hardly now occurs in a lifetime. There is an- 
other manuscript to which I may refer here. It is known by the name 
of the " Black Book of Taymouth." It is chiefly occupied with a 
genealogical account of the Glenarquhay family and the narra- 
tion of facts and incidents connected with the lives of the Barons 
of that house. 

Breadalbane Family. — In the outsetof that manuscript it is stated, 
that " Duncan Campbell, commonly callit Duncan in Aa, Knight 
of Lochow lineallie descendit of an valiant man, surnamit Camp- 
bell, quha cam to Scotland in King Malcom Kandmoir his tyme, 
about the year of God 1067, of quhom cam the house of Lochow, 
flourisched in King David Bruce his dayes. The foresaid Dun- 
can in Aa had to wyffe Margarit Stewart, dochter to Duke Mur- 
doch ; on quhom he begat twa sones, the elder callit Archibald, 
the other namit Colin, wha was first Laird of Gienurquhay." The 
following table exhibits a view of the succession in the family, from 
1432 to the present day.

It were easy, if our space admitted of it, to give some rather 
curious sketches regarding a few of the persons mentioned in the 
preceding list. Of Colin, who is at the head of the column, ,t is 



464 



PEttTUSHIR K. 



related that, " throch his valiant actis and manheid he was maid 
knicht in the Isle of Rhodes, quhilk standeth in the Carpathian 
sea near to Caria, and contrie of Asia the less, and he was three 
snndrie tymes in Rome." Descending along the series, we find 
Colin, the sixth in succession, represented as having been " ane 
great justiciar all his tyme, throch the quhilk he sustenit the deidly 
feid of the Clangregor, ane lang space ; and besides that he causit 
execute to the death meny notable lymarris, he behiddit the laird 
of M'Gregor himself at Kandmoir, in presence of the Erie of 
Athol, the Justice- Clerk, and sundrie other nobilmen." Dun- 
can, the seventh in the list, was the first, it is said, who attempted 
the civilizing the inhabitants of the estate ; for before, they were, 
like their neighbours, more given to arms than to any kind of in- 
dustry, and living pretty much at large, without distinguishing 
precisely between " meum and tuum." He set them the example 
of planting timber trees, fencing pieces of ground for gardens, and 
manuring their lands; at the same time assisting and encouraging 
them. One of his regulations of police for the estate was, " that 
no man shall in any public-house drink more than a chopin of ale 
with his neighbour's wife, in the absence of her husband, upon the 
penalty of L.10, and sitting twenty-four hours in the stocks, toties 
quoties." But the most interesting statement of all, perhaps, is 
that which we have in connection with Robert, the ninth name in 
the list. " In the year of God 1644 and 1645, the laird of 
Glenurquhay his whole landis and esteat, betwixt the foord of 
Lyon, and point of Lismoir, were burnt and destroyit be James 
Graham, sometime Erie of Montrose, and Alex. M £ Donald, 
son to Col. M'Donald in Colesne, with their associattis. The 
tenants their whole cattle were taken away be their enemies ; and 
their cornes, houses, plenishing, and whole insight weir burnt; 
and the said Sir Robert pressing to get the inhabitants repairit, 
wairit L.48 Scots upon the bigging of every cuple in his landis, 
and als warit seed cornes, upon his own charges, to the most of 
his inhabitants. The occasion of this malice against Sir Robert, 
and his friends and countrie people, was, because the said Sir Ro- 
bert joinit in Covenant with the Kirk and kingdom of Scotland, in 
maintaining the trew religion, the King's majestie, his authoritie, 
and laws, and libertie of the kingdom of Scotland ; and because 
the said Sir Robert altogether refusit to assist the said James 
Graham and Alex. M'Donald, their malicious doings in the king- 
dom of Scotland. So that the laird of Glenurquhay and his

countrie people, their loss within Perthshire and within Argyle- 
shire, exceeds the soume of 1,200,000 merks." 

Not less eminent than any of his predecessors was John, third 
Earl of Breadalbane, who, when yet but very young, exhibited an 
unusual degree of talent, as well as progress in education. As 
stated in a manuscript at Taymouth, " he possessed the talents of 
both father and grandfather in an eminent degree ; and was, at the 
age of 22, appointed by King George I., in 1718, Envoy extraordi- 
nary and Plenipotentiary to the court of Denmark, where he re- 
newed former treaties, and concluded a new one. He filled after- 
wards several state offices; was Master of the Jewel Office, Lord 
Chief-Justice in Eyre of all the royal forests besouth the Trent, 
Lord Privy Seal of Scotland, and Vice Admiral of Scotland. He 
died in 1782, aged 86." 

Land owners. — The whole lands of the parish belong to the 
Marquis of Breadalbane, with the exception of the property of 
Shian, a three merk land in Glenquaich, belonging to the Misses 
Campbell of Shian. 

Parochial Registers- — The parochial registers go a considerable 
way back, the first entry being in 1636. From that date it would 
appear, though parts of the records have been lost, that marriages, 
burials, births, and baptisms were registered ; and considering the 
large and scattered nature of the parish, the different entries seem 
to have been made with laudable minuteness ; much more so, in- 
deed, than they are at the present day. A record has also been 
all along regularly kept of the proceedings of the kirk-session, 
whether in matters of discipline, or in the management of the 
funds for the poor. 

Antiquities. — The ruins of greatest interest by far are those 
in the Isle of Lochtay. The isle itself forms a beautiful and pic- 
turesque object directly in front of the manse, being about a quar- 
ter of a mile above the outlet of the river Tay, and separated by 
a narrow channel from the northern margin of the lake. It is of 

 It may be mentioned here, as a portion of history connected with the parish, that 
Donald IV. of Scotland, who came to the throne in 632, perished in Lochtay, having 

been there, as it is said, " at fishing with his servants for pastime." Old Chron. of 

Scotland, p. 5o. 

It may likewise be mentioned here, more as a matter of literary curiosity, than of 
statistics, that the library of Taymouth contains a copy of the celebrated dispute be- 
tween John Knox and the Abbot of Crossraguell. It is worth while to record this 
circumstance, because it is stated by Dr M'Crie, in his Life of the Reformer, Vol. ii. 
page 73, " that the only copy known to exist at present is in the library of Alexander 
Boswell, Esq. of Auchinleck." That copy is said to be imperfect ; so is also the 
Taymouth copy, the want of leaves 2d, 3d, 14th, and loth, or 8 pages, making an 
" hiatus valde deflendus," in a production so rare.

an elliptical form, and may present a surface of nearly \\ acre. 
The ruins consist of two long side walls, extending to about 140 
feet, while the two end or gable walls are about 24 feet. There 
are three transverse walls parallel to these, thus dividing the edi- 
fice into four compartments, of which the two extreme ones ap- 
pear to have been the smallest. They are surrounded and almost 
hid by a thick belt of fine old sycamores and ashes ; to which, on 
the opposite shore, are corresponding trees of similar antiquity, to- 
gether with a few superannuated fruit trees, remnants, in all pro- 
bability, of the Priory garden. The notices regarding this build- 
ing are rather scanty. " The ruins upon the Isle," observes Sir 
Walter Scott, " now almost shapeless, being overgrown with wood, 
rose at one time into the towers and pinnacles of a priory, where 
slumbered the remains of Sibilla, daughter of Henry I. of Eng- 
land, and consort of Alexander I. of Scotland. It was founded 
by Alexander, and the care of it committed to a small body of 
monks." It was a cell from the monastery of Scone. This 
appears by a charter of the same Alexander, in the chartu- 
lary of Scone, directed " Episcopis," &amp;c ; and grants the Isle 
of Lochtay " ut ecclesia Dei ibi pro me, et pro anima reginse Sy- 
billae ibi defunctae fabricetur ; et hoc do iis interim quo usque de- 
dero iis aliud augmentum unde locus ille in Dei obseqiuum exalte- 
tur. Teste Herberto apud Strivelyne." I have extracted this 
quotation from a manuscript at Taymouth, in which it is stated that 
Fordun, in Book 6th, confirms this information. " The last re- 
sidents in the Isle," according to the novelist, -f- were three nuns, 
who, when they " did emerge into society, seemed determined to 
enjoy it in its most complicated and noisy state ; for they came 
out only once a year, and that to a market at Kenmore. Hence 
that fair is still called " Feill nam ban naomha," the market 
of the Holy Women. There are no precise data by which 
to determine the time of the existence of these nuns. It must 
have been subsequent to the year 1565, for that was the year 
when a market was for the first time held at Kenmore. This 
is proved by the manuscript of the Vicar of Inchadyn, al- 
ready referred to. At page 44, there is this statement, " ye yer 
of God mvlxv 1565, ye margat was halden and begun at the 
Kenmor at the end of Lochthay, and ther was na margat nor feyr 
haldyn at Inchadan quhar it was wynt till be haldin, al this don be

Collyn Campbell. of Glenurquhay." In the interval between the 
foundation of the priory, and its last occupancy by these holy sisters, 
the island must have been the scene of some not uninteresting events. 
The following meagre notices are all that I have been able to 
collect. 

« Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenurquhay, who succeeded Sir 
Colin in 1 480, biggit ye great hall, chapel, and chalmeris in the 
Isle of Lochtay." — Black Book of Taymouth. 

" Combusta fait insula de Lochthay ex negligentia servorum in 
Sabbato palmarum ultimo dieMartii anno Domini m° quingente- 
simo nono." 1509. — Vicar's MS. page 8. 

" Obitus Mariote Stuart dme de Glenurquhay xxvi die Julii 
apd Insulam de Lochthay et sepulta in Finlark ao Dmi mvxxiiii :" 
1524.— Ib. page 28. 

" Sir John Campbell, 5th Laird of Glenurquhay, deceissit in 
the Isle of Lochthay, in 1550." — Black Book of Taymouth. 

From the foregoing quotations, it is manifest that the island 
must have been a residence, as well as a place of religious retire- 
ment But it has long ceased to serve either the one purpose or 
the other. At this day, however, it is not without its inhabitants. 
Besides being the haunt of some few swans which enliven with 
their presence and graceful motions this end of the lake, and nes- 
tle here for the purpose of rearing their young, the branches of its 
trees are colonized by a swarm of rooks, far more numerous, and 
of a nature infinitely more clamorous than were the recluses that 
first occupied the cells below. From the spot where the writer 
now sits, and whence the island is distinctly seen, it is often his 
amusement to witness the wheelings and circlings of these birds 
over their water-girt dwelling; as oftener still is he pleased to listen 
to their singular music, when at even they return from their forag- 
ing flights, and ere they settle for the night, unite in one univer- 
sal song, as if they were offering the tribute of their vespers to the 
Great Parent, who deigns to comprehend them, as He does the 
highest seraph, within the range of His superintending Providence. 

Coins. — Some few coins, chiefly silver, of Edward 1. of Eng- 
land, and Alexander III. of Scotland, have been found in the pa- 
rish ; and here, as in other districts, the situations where they have 
been discovered are such as could little have been expected to 
contain these relics of other days. There are some in the pos- 
session of Lord Breadalbane, which were turned up in digging a 
field near the head of Lochfraochie. In the parish of Moulin 



468 



PERTHSHIRE. 



when the writer was minister of that place, there were found, well 
up towards the ridge of a lofty hill at the head of Glenbriarchan, 
nearly two dozen of the same sort of coins ; of which two or three 
were of Alexander, and the rest of Edward. Of these the writer 
has half a dozen ; and the singularity regarding those of Edward 
is, that while the obverse of all presents the head of the king, the 
reverse of one bears the inscription " Civitas Cantor;" of another, 
" Civitas London ;" of another " Civitas Eborac ;" and of a fourth 
" Civitas Dunelm ;" thus indicating, as it were, the different stages 
of the progress of that rapacious Monarch towards his destined 
prey. But it would seem that coins of even greater antiquity have 
been long imbedded in our soil. There is the following state- 
ment in a manuscript at Taymouth. " In the year 1755, in making 
a road across the hill from Taymouth to Glenquaich, there were 
found, near the crest of the hill, twelve Roman coins, about three 
inches under the surface of the ground, in what seemed like a bed 
of charcoal. They appear to be of silver, of the circumference 
of a sixpenny piece, but much thicker. The dies and inscrip- 
tions of most of them are distinct and legible. They are of the 
Antonines, and their Empresses. They are at Taymouth." There 
is also at Taymouth, as is mentioned in the same manuscript, "an 
urn or vase" a tripod of a mixed metal, something like a coffee- 
pot, with a handle and spout. It was found, about the year 1733, 
in the prsetorium of a Roman camp in Fortingall." 

Modern Buildings. — The modern buildings of any consequence 
are few. Improvement in that respect, though slowly, is never- 
theless gradually taking place. The houses of the tenantry are 
in progress to become more comfortable in accommodation, as 
they are made neater in appearance, being built, where a new 
erection is put up, of stone and lime, and covered with slates. The 
school-houses, too, are constructed in a style better adapted than 
heretofore to the purposes of these edifices. The only man- 
sion-house, understanding by that term the residence of a proprietor, 
besides the Castle of Taymouth, is the house of Shian, situated 
on the north bank of the Quaich, in the glen which draws its name 
from that water, and about a mile above its entrance into Loch- 
fraochie. The castle of Taymouth, formerly Balloch, is truly a 
splendid mansion, and is placed in a truly splendid situation. It 
is only within these few years that it has been finished, if indeed 
it can yet be said to be so ; for to the right of the great quadrangle 
there is still allowed to stand a remnant of the old castle of Balloch, 



KENMORE. 



469 



which, though sufficiently commodious, is hardly in keeping with 
the wino- which stretches out so strikingly to the left. The castle 
stands on the southern margin of the Tay, in a semicircular lawn 
or field about a mile below the end of the lake, and in the bosom 
of woods, which, rising on all sides, seem as if they were inter- 
minable. Nothing can exceed the beauty and grandeur of the 
scenery of this princely domain. Wood and water, mountain and 
meadow, objects animate and inanimate, in endless variety, are 
here so blended, and on such a scale, that, when viewed from cer- 
tain positions, and in certain states of the atmosphere, they give 
you an impression as if you had been transported to a region of 
enchantment. But to speak becomingly, there is here the workman- 
ship of far more than enchanter's ken or enchanter's might ; 

" Surrounded by His power, we stand ; 
On every side we feel His hand. 
Oh  skill for human reach too high, 
Too dazzling bright for mortal eye  " 

The most striking feature in the castle itself is its magnificent 
staircase, constructed in a quadrangular tower in the centre of 
the mansion, which rises to a considerable height above the main 
building ; admitting the light from the flanks and top, and having 
that light agreeably softened and varied in its hues by being made 
to pass through the medium of richly stained glass. The apart- 
ments, both in finishing and in furnishing, are in admirable keeping 
with the external appearance, as well as with the elegant stair- 
case by which they are approached. The Baron's Hall, the dining- 
room, the drawing-room, the Chinese-rooms, are particularly wor- 
thy of notice. In the three former of these, as in other parts of 
the house, are several valuable paintings, there being specimens by 
such artists as Titian, H. Carracci, Rubens, Salvator Rosa, Van- 
dyke, Teniers, &amp;c. There is a large collection of books, part of 
which are in the Baron's Hall, and part in a room in the old wing- 
fitted up as a library. 

Mills, fyc. — There is one saw-mill in the parish, situated on apower- 
ful stream, near the village of Kenmore. The only manufacture, 
properly speaking, is that of wool, and even that is yet but upon a 
very limited scale, though there are facilities for the purpose, as well 
in the command of water, as in the raw material being to be had 
upon the spot. We have sufficient proof that this species of ma- 
nufacture may succeed with us, from what has been done in our 
immediate neighbourhood at Camuserney, in the parish of Dull. 
At that place, a considerable quantity of wool is annually cleansed,

wrought into worsted, and woven into carpets, for which there is 
a regular demand. The manufactory is on the property of Sir 
N. Menzies, and receives from that spirited improver every pos- 
sible encouragement. 

III. — Population. 
There are no sufficiently accurate data by which we can with 
precision determine the ancient state of the population. The ma- 
terials within our reach indicate a fluctuation, for the last hun- 
dred years, between nearly 3000 and about 400 above that num- 
ber. Thus by 

The return to Dr Webster in 1755, it was 3067 

Mr M'Vean's census in 1794, - 3463

. ,_ n .  1520 males 7 T 1R ~C 1471 males 

In 1794, -J 1943 females I In 1836, j 168 females 

It thus appears, as indeed is generally the case in rural situa- 
tions, that there is a considerable excess on the side of the female 
population. 

Emigration. — People have been emigrating from this district, 
more or less, almost annually for many years back : and yet 
the population does not appear to have altered in any very 
sensible degree, in its general amount, for the last hundred 
vears ; — a clear proof that, though emigration may relieve tem- 
porarily the pressure of a redundant population, it is not suffi- 
cient of itself, without the contemporaneous application of other 
elements, to bring down the aggregate of a given number of years. 
On the contrary, it may rather have the effect of stimulating po- 
pulation, so as to do even more than fill up the ephemeral blank, 
unless, along with the encouragement of emigration, there be also, 
and simultaneously, the exercise of prudential habits, especially in 
regard to marriage, on the part of the people, as well as the ob- 
servance of a right economy on the part of proprietors in the letting 
of land and cottages. 

Villages. — There are no towns, and even but few such assem- 
blages of houses as are called villages. The only places worthy 
of this name are Kenmore, with about 80 inhabitants, Sronfernan 
with about 150, and Acharn with about 90. The population is 
thus entirely rural.

It was mentioned in an early part of the article, that there ane 
numerous instances of longevity. In corroboration of this aver- 
ment, it may be stated here, that, in the village of Kenmore alone, 
there are eight individuals, all females, of whom the united ages 
amount to 683, giving an average of 85 years to each. The ex- 
tremes of these ages are 74 and 94. 

There is one Noble family, that of the Marquis of Breadalbane, 
usually resident for a considerable part of the year in the parish. 
With this exception, there are neither individuals nor families 
of independent fortune in the parish. 

Number of unmarried men, bachelors, upwards of 50, 18 

widowers, - 39 

women, upwards of 45 years, 90 
widows, 95 

The number of families is 646 ; so that the average number of 
individuals in each family is 4.88. 

Number of insane, 7 ; blind, 5 ; fatuous, 10; deaf and dumb, 2. 

Language. — The language almost universally spoken is the 
Gaelic. It is likewise the language in which the greater part of 
the ministrations of religion is discharged. While I would say 
that, within the last forty years, the language has neither lost nor 
gained ground, I would likewise say that the English language is 
becoming every day more generally familiar; for there is now hardly 
an individual who is not capable, more or less, of making use of it. 
How this invasion of the speech of our southern neighbours is ulti- 
mately to operate, seems not a very difficult thing to conjecture. 
At no distant period, it will, in all likelihood, so far prevail over 
its less potent associate, as almost entirely, if not altogether, to 
take its place. Nor does the substitution appear to be an event 
greatly to be deprecated. 

Habits, Src — Our people are no longer the " Reidschankes" of 
Pitscottie, " cloathed with ane mantle, with ane schirt, fachioned 
after the Irisch manner, going bair-legged to the knie f for a 
single instance of the kilt is scarcely to be seen from one end of 
the parish to the other. Irish-like, indeed, we use a vast deal of 
potatoes, but then we manage to season these roots with a due 
mixture of beef, mutton, and pork ; not to speak of the milk, 
cheese, and butter with' which we are supplied from our dairies ;

or the higher dainties of tea and sugar with which not a few con- 
trive to regale themselves. I believe little or no poaching of any 
kind takes place in the parish ; and it is the same as to smuggling, 
though it is spoken of as a practice which was at one time very 
common. Independently of what many families import themselves, 
there are, within the parish, for the convenience of the public, ten 
small retail shops, where such articles as tea, sugar, tobacco, snuff, 
oil, cutlery, woollen, linen, cotton, and even silk stuffs, may at any 
time be procured. And, as if all this were not enough, two rival 
bakers from Aberfeldie penetrate, twice a-week upon an average, 
a considerable way into the parish with well-stored carts, to sup- 
plant our oaten cakes by the substitution of the luxury of wheaten 
bread. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — As this is confessedly the most important, so is it 
the most difficult part of our Statistical task. There are no ac- 
curate plans or maps of the parish to aid us in our calculations ; 
neither has the land hitherto been let at a specific rate per acre. 
In the statements, therefore, about to be made, whether regard- 
ing the extent of ground in tillage, or but occasionally so, or re- 
garding the annual amount and value of live-stock and produce, 
we must be considered as presenting only approximations to the 
truth. 

The soil, the primary source of wealth all the world over, 
may be described as being, in general, a light brownish loam with 
a slight mixture of clay ; such a loam as appears when hazel, birch, 
and the sort of underwood usually associated with these, have been 
grubbed out, and which has never been either richly or skilfully 
medicated with manure. " The hilly land," according to the 
statement of my predecessor, " chiefly consists of a light mossy 
kind of soil, which naturally is not unfriendly to vegetation. Heath, 
bent, and coarse grasses are the general product of the hills and 
muirs ; but the vallies, and water-carried soils in the glens, &amp;c. 
produce good crops of excellent grasses." To the enumeration of 
the articles of produce mentioned in that Account, I have to add 
the cultivation of turnips and sown grasses ; a part of husbandry 
attended to, more and more every year. It may safely be said, 
that there cannot, with a profitable application of capital, be made 
much addition, if indeed any, to the existing cultivated land. 
The error here rather is to toil on, from year to year, trying to 
keep in tillage a great deal of land manifestly unfit for that pur-

pose, by being at once too steep and too shallow for the plough, 
and so unproductive as scarcely to yield a return of three. Per- 
haps one-sixth of the land at present tilled may be of this cha- 
racter, which it were far better to convert to the state of perma- 
nent pasture. There are no undivided commons with reference to 
landlord and landlord ; but there is abundance of them as to one 
tenant and another; it being no unusual thing, though the prac- 
tice is now fast wearing out, for four, six, or even eight occupants 
of a hamlet to send their cattle to one upland common. There 
may about 5400 acres be in tillage ; 8600 in permanent pasture ; 
21,000 in moor and hill ; and, 5000 in wood. The land in til- 
lage may be rated at 16s. per acre, though it is no easy matter to 
determine this point, because to every arable holding there is 
attached a corresponding allowance, both of outfield pasture and 
of hill grazing, for the whole of which there is one undivided rent. 
The rate mentioned, however, must be near the mark. The 
pasture may be rated at 6s., and the moor and hill at 2s. per acre ; 
so that, by this mode of reckoning, the rental would be, as in 

fact it nearly is, as follows ; 

5400 acres in tillage at 16s. per acre, - L. 4320 

8600 acres in pasture at 6s. per do. - 2580 

21000 acres in moor and hill at 2s. per do- - 2100 

5000 acres in wood, natural and planted, - 360 

40,000 acres. Rental, L. 9360 

The return from the woods is here stated to be, one year with 
another, L. 360. But so rich in fine timber are now the plant- 
ings of Taymouth, and so much of valuable natural wood, parti- 
cularly ash, skirts the lake, and covers the numerous ravines on 
either side, that a much larger revenue might annually be derived 
from this source, without damage to either the worth or appear- 
ance of these places. The value of the woods themselves can 
hardly be estimated under L. 75,000. The distribution of the 
cultivated land, as to cropping, may stand nearly thus : 

3100 acres in oats ; chiefly the late white. 
1048 acres in bear ; Chester. 

640 acres in potatoes ; large Perthshire red. 

306 acres in turnips, peas, rye, lint. 

306 acres in sown grass. . 

The live-stock is nearly as follows : 

521 horses ; 3109 black cattle ; 12,050 sheep ; 500 swine- 
Rent. — The average rent of grazing for a horse per annum is 
about L. 2, 10s. ; for a cow, L. 1, 2s. ; and for a full grown sheep, 4s. 
Rate of Wages. — The rate of the wages of labour, considering 



474 PERTHSHIRE. 

that there is a numerous population, far from being over-employ- 
ed, is, upon the whole, high, varying from Is. 3d. a -day in win- 
ter, to 2s. 4d. in summer. The wages of men-servants vary from 
L. 10 to L. 14 per annum; and of maid-servants from L. 4 to 
L. 6 ; and they almost uniformly fare at the same board with 
their masters and mistresses. 

Breeds of Cattle, — The common breed of cattle is the West 
Highland ; and of sheep, the black-faced. But the Ayrshire cow 
may sometimes be seen ; as may likewise the Leicester and South- 
down breeds of sheep, particularly in the parks and pastures of 

Taymouth. Subjoined is a view of the value of agricultural pro- 
duce, as also of live-stock.

Till of late years, no great attention has been paid either 
to the management of land, or to the breeding of stock. But the 
recent efforts of the Highland Society, seconded, as in this part 
of the country they are, by the spirited encouragement of Lord 
Breadalbane, and other proprietors, bid fair to lead rapidly to im- 
provements in all the departments of husbandry. The ploughing 
matches which annually take place in sections here and there in 
the country, together with the premiums given for green crops, 
&amp;c. are already accomplishing very perceptible effects, as well in 
the extent and quality of these crops, as in the better aspect of 
the ploughs, and horses, and their harnessing. And as we are be- 
coming readers of newspapers, of which an astonishing number 



KENMOKE. 



475 



find their way among us, I doubt not but we shall also be gradual- 
ly stimulated to further exertion, by learning the facilities present- 
ed on both sides of the island, from the Tay on the east and the 
Clyde on the west, for transporting with unerring speed our sur- 
plus produce to the great marts of London and Liverpool. 

Leases. — Leases have as yet been but rarely granted, — the prac- 
tice in Breadalbane having been for the tenant to hold from year 
to vear. Such, however, is and has been the working of this sys- 
tern, that, precarious and discouraging as it may appear, there 
have been as few removals, on an average of years, among our pea- 
santry, as are found to happen where the system of letting on lease is 
in full practice. At the same time, leases are occasionally given, 
and are for periods varying from seven to fifteen years. The farm 
buildings, in general, are in an indifferent state ; nor, so long as 
the land continues so much subdivided as it has heretofore been, 
can they well be otherwise. As lots and crofts, however, begin 
to be thrown together, so as to make something like farms, an im- 
provement now in progress, neater, more substantial, and more 
commodious farm-steadings as well as dwellings arise, and, as a 
matter of course, will more and more arise. The iron plough is 
becoming not uncommon ; and on a farm here and there you will 
see the drill-harrow, as you will also see larger and stouter-built 
carts than were formerly used. Exclusive of roads, to be after- 
wards mentioned, one of the most obvious improvements recently 
carried on has been the clearing of land from large stones and 
rocks by blasting. Another is that of draining such parts of the 
hill pasture as are too retentive of moisture, an operation which 
seems to promise results highly beneficial. In these works it is 
needless to say, that the tenants are liberally assisted by the 
Noble proprietor. 

Quarries. — There are quarries both of limestone and of stone 
for building of different kinds, as is manifest from the mineralogi- 
cal part of our article. That of which the Castle of Taymouth 
is built has already been mentioned. It is a stone which admits 
of being dressed to a very fine surface, as may be seen from the 
castle and other buildings in the vicinity. The cross in particular, 
an elegant structure of a monumental character, midwav between 
the castle and the lake, on the left bank of the river, may be specified 
as an instance of the exquisite delicacy of workmanship of which 
the stone is susceptible. Here it is chiselled in every stage, from 
the large oblong block of perhaps twelve or fourteen feet, to the 



476 



PERTHSHIRE. 



finest imaginable tracery. There has lately started up another 
uncommonly handsome edifice, intended for a pinery, where the 
stone is seen in a still more beautiful state of polish ; as is another 
of a harder grain, quarried near the village of Kenmore, which 
presents a natural face equal in smoothness or polish to that pro- 
duced by the chisel. 

Quartz. — Quartz is another stone which occurs in great plenty 
and in vast masses. It is of an almost snowy whiteness. The 
dairy in Taymouth park is constructed of this mineral, — an erec- 
tion well worth the paying a visit to, whether to gratify the taste, 
or to examine the stone, and to see the use to which it has been 
so curiously put. 

Mines. — There are no mines wrought within the parish, though 
there is good reason to suppose, that the ores of several metals, 
particularly lead and iron, exist pretty plentifully in our moun- 
tain ranges. The attention of Lord Breadalbane is at present di- 
rected towards this object, and it is to be wished that his researches 
may be successful. 

Fishery. — The only fishery, properly speaking, is a salmon- 
fishery at the lower extremity of the lake, and for a few hundred 
yards at the head of the river. It is for the present kept by the 
proprietor in his own hands. Till the passing of the late act re- 
garding the Scottish fisheries, the Breadalbane family had the 
privilege of fishing in the lake for salmon all the year over. There 
are no salmon in Lochfraochie, the fish being unable, I suppose, 
to surmount the falls in the Braan, at the hermitage near Dun- 
keld. But in this loch, as in Lochtay, are to be found pike, perch, 
eels, char, and other trouts. The trout of Lochfraochie, though 
small, is an excellent fish, firm, and red-fleshed. It is such as 
to attract the angler from Crieff, Perth, and even greater distances, 
to take up his quarters often for days in its vicinity. 

There is a small manufactory in the neighbourhood of Ken- 
more, for carding, spinning, dyeing, and weaving wool ; employing 
about a dozen of hands. 

Agricultural Society. — The only association for encouraging in- 
dustry is the Breadalbane Agricultural Society, established about 
two years ago, under the fostering patronage of Lord Breadalbane. 
It gives premiums for the state of the crops, for improvements in 
the breeding and rearing of cattle and sheep, and for good ap- 
pearance in the case of farm steadings and cottages. It promises 
to be very useful.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Crieff, which is distant twenty-two 
miles. But the high hill separating the valley of the Tay from Glen- 
quaich has to be crossed, rendering the communication with that 
town rather difficult and inconvenient. That with Dunkeld and 
Perth being in the line of the valley, is more suitable, and, though 
longer, is much more employed. Dunkeld is twenty-three miles be- 
low the village of Kenmore, and Perth fifteen more. The principal 
villages, as already stated, are Kenmore, Sronfernan, and Acharn. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parish are good. The post from Dunkeld arrives 
here every day, but Wednesday, about five in the morning, and 
leaves Kenmore in return at two p. m. and there is a post 
three times a week to and from Killin, the days being Mon- 
day, Wednesday, and Saturday, and the time of starting from 
Kenmore, nine a. m. ; and having to be back in the even- 
ing. The salary of the postmaster is L. 10 per annum ; and the 
annual revenue of the office, which is sub to that of Aberfeldie, 
is about L. 60. From the village of Kenmore, there diverge, be- 
sides the west entrance to Taymouth Park, no fewer than five 
great lines of road, and all in good condition. If the traveller be 
bent southward, he finds the outset for some hundred yards to be 
but one line, but it immediately strikes off in three branches, 
whereof one takes the side of the lake on towards Ardeonaig and 
Killin, a second, winding up the hill, forms the access to Glen- 
quaich, Amulree, Glenalmond, and Crieff ; and the third is the 
beautiful turnpike to Dunkeld ; the other two being upheld by 
the statute-labour money. If, on the other hand, the traveller's 
course be northward, he sets out on that side also by one line of 
road, across the Tay by a handsome five-arched bridge, bestriding 
that water just as it becomes a river, in which line he continues 
for several hundred yards, when, at the foot of the richly wooded 
hill of Drummond, he finds it going in two opposite directions. 
The left hand division is the fine turnpike leading by the base of 
towering Benlawers to Killin ; the other is a country road leading 
to the fords of Lyon, and passing at one point scarcely 300 yards 
from the Castle of Taymouth. Though not turnpike, it is not a 
whit inferior to that species of road, and as soon as the Lyon has 
been crossed, rather a formidable feat at times, the great military 
road, one of General Wade's, now turnpike, leading from Crieff 
to Dalnacardoch, and so on to Inverness, is entered on, which is 



478 PERTHSHIRE. 

here little more than two miles from Kenmore. In all directions, 
therefore, there are convenient outlets, and admirable roads ; the 
only interruption being that now mentioned at the Lyon, where it 
is much to be wished that a bridge were erected ; and as the roads 
in every direction are good, so is there every facility for travelling. 
At Kenmore is to be had everything to induce the traveller to re- 
main as long as he pleases, as there are likewise various modes of 
conveyance whenever his humour inclines him to depart. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Kenmore is situated at one 
extremity of the parish, its eastern boundary being less than two 
miles distant, the intervening space being occupied with the plea- 
sure grounds of Taymouth, while the western boundary in Glen- 
lochay is about thirty miles distant. Such being the locality of 
the church, it is manifest that it must be inconvenient for by much 
the greater part of the population. The territorial division of the 
parish is in fact exceedingly unsuitable and defective. One por- 
tion, for instance, according to the census of 1836, with a popula- 
tion of 149, is in a detached situation in Glenquaich, the nearest 
point of which is five miles distant from the parish church, with a 
high and broad hill intervening. Another portion, with a popu- 
lation of 103, Cloicheran, is in a detached situation on the south 
side of Lochtay, the nearest point of which is rather more than 
ten miles distant. A third portion, with a population of 114, is 
in a detached situation in Glenlochay, the nearest point of which 
is about seventeen miles distant. And a fourth portion, Kiltirie, 
Moreinsh, &amp;c. with a population of 517, is in a detached situation 
on the north side of the loch, the nearest point of which is eleven 
miles from the parish church, and placed between similar detach- 
ed portions of the parishes of Killin and Weem. This is, indeed, 
a most anomalous arrangement.f But singular as is thus the divi - 

 The junction of Lochtay with Lochlomond, by means partly of canal, and part- 
ly of railroad, has been recommended by an experienced engineer. See, in particu- 
lar, " Report by Mr Baird, 24th August 1824, regarding the improvement of the 
navigation of the river Leven and Lochlomond." 

f What could have been the reason of a division so preposterous  The most like- 
ly origin of the matter is that adverted to in Vol. ix. p. 486, or in Vol. xii. p. 130, 
of the former Statistical Account. This explanation is borne out by a statement which 
I find in the Black Book of Taymouth ; " Sir Duncan Campbell, seventh laird of 
Glenurquhay, gave for the twelf mark land of Cranniche, the twentie pund land of 
Moreinsh, the ten mark land of Achmoir, and the twa merk land of Kandknock, to 
the Laird of Weem, 28,000 marks, anno Hi02." Now, it happens that Crannaich, 
Achmore, and Kenknock, are in the parish of Weem, though all at a great distance 
from the church of that parish, and altogether isolated fiom the portion contiguous 
to it. In other words, the Laird of Weem, whose residence, Castle Menzies, is be- 
side the church, chose to have the different parts of his property, wherever they might 
lio, or however remote, included in the parish of his own domicile.

sion of the parish, it cannot be alleged that any portion of the in- 
habitants is deprived of the means of public worship, or of religi- 
ous instruction and pastoral superintendence. The spirit, if not 
the name of " the Church Extension Scheme," has been in opera- 
tion here for a considerable time back. It is due to the Breadal- 
bane family, to put it on record, that they have been most efficient 
church extensionists. No individual along either bank of Loch- 
tay is at a distance of more than four miles from a place of wor- 
ship, or the services of a minister of the Establishment. Besides 
the parish church, there are other two places of worship, in con- 
nection with the Establishment, having each an ordained and re- 
sident clergyman. These are the chapels of Ardeonaig and 
Lawers, the one on the north, and the other on the south side of 
the lake, and each midway between the churches of Kenmore and 
Killin, which are sixteen miles separate. The parishioners of 
Kenmore in Glenquaich are attached to the mission of Amulree, 
to the chapel of which they have easy access in the line of the 
glen, having to travel from four to six miles. In like manner, those 
in Glenlochay are for the most part within a distance of about four 
miles from the church of Killin, being that to which they are near- 
est, and at which they receive Christian privileges. Some few 
in that glen may be from seven to eight miles distant. 

The parish church was built in 1760, and is in a good state of 
repair. It is a handsome substantial edifice of the form'of a cross, 
with a tower at the east end, and having the centre window in the 
south wall, immediately behind the pulpit, of stained glass. The 
church stands in one of the finest conceivable situations, and forms 
a delightful feature in the rich, varied, and beautiful scenery in 
the midst of which it is placed. But the interior can hardly be 
said to harmonize with either its outside, or its surrounding accom- 
paniments. It has rather a cold, damp, chilling appearance, from 
the circumstance of the walls having never been lathed and plas- 
tered, and from its being causewayed under the seats with stone, 
instead of being comfortably floored with deal. It is besides but 
indifferently lighted, there being no windows on the north side, 
except one small circular aperture in the Breadalbane gallery. 
It is abundantly capacious for the number of parishioners within 
reach, having been seated for about 700. The sittings are all 
free, as they also are in the two chapels. The manse was built 
about the same time with the church. It underwent a very thorough 
repair, and had a new wing added to it, in 1832, so that it is now 



480 



PERTHSHIRE. 



a commodious and comfortable residence. The glebe extends to 
about 22 Scotch acres, of which 13 are under wood, pasture, house, 
garden, and offices ; the other 9 have usually been in tillage, but 
the present incumbent has put them almost all under grass. If 
the whole place were rented, it might be worth about L. 30 per 
annum. The stipend is 17 chalders, half bear and half oatmeal, 
and there is an allowance of L. 10 for communion elements. The 
last augmentation dates from the last half of crop and year 1823. 

There are, as has already been stated, two chapels within the 
parish, connected with the Church of Scotland ; those of Ardeonaig 
and Lawers. They are under the patronage of the Society for 
Propagating Christian Knowledge, and intended to accommodate 
the distantinhabitantsofthe parishes of Kenmore, Killin,and Weem. 
They are so conveniently situated as to be little more than three 
miles distant in any direction from the furthest part of their 
boundary. The two chapels, with the dwelling-houses and offices, 
were built entirely at the cost, and by the munificence, of Lord 
Breadalbane. 

The mission of Ardeonaig was established in 1792; the salary 
is L. 60, with 17 acres of glebe land; the cost of the building- 
was about L. 800. 

The mission of Lawers, formerly a part of the mission of Ar- 
deonaig, was established in 1833; the salary is L. 50, with 6 
acres of glebe land ; the cost of the building was about L. 685. 

One-half of these salaries is paid by the Marquis of Breadal- 
bane, the other half by the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge. 

Dissenters. — There is one small Dissenting meeting-house 
in the parish, situated within the mission of Lawers, capable 
of holding about 100 sitters, and belonging to the denomina- 
tion of Baptists. They, with a few Independents, are the only 
description of Dissenters in the parish, and altogether they do 
not exceed 80 in number. There are neither voluntaries to 
whet our argumentative weapons, nor so much as a single Ro- 
man Catholic. The ministers of the denominations to which 
I have referred are paid by the free-will offerings of their fol- 
lowers, together with, I believe, some petty allowance from funds 
belonging to these separate bodies of Christians. The people o f 
this part of the country are a church-going people, of which cir- 
cumstance gratifying evidence is afforded by the distance from 
which many of them travel to attend public worship. It may fur-

ther be stated, that it is no unusual thing- for the separatists to at- 
tend our churches and chapels. In fact, the odious spirit of bi - 
gotry is scarcely known here, whether among the members of the 
Establishment, or among those out of its pale. The average num- 
ber of communicants is 870, and the number of male heads of 
families in full communion with the church, and entitled to exer- 
cise the veto in the settlement of a minister, as adjusted in No- 
vember last, is 261.

Education. — The parish is not deficient in the means of educa- 
tion, in so far at least as that may depend on the number of schools. 
These amount to 9 ; of which one is the parochial school ; three 
are endowed by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge ; 
one is endowed by the Marchioness of Breadalbane, and the re- 
maining four are entirely unendowed, the teachers having no other 
emolument, but that arising from the fees of the scholars, and the 
hospitality of the parents. The branches commonly taught are, 
English reading, spelling, writing, and arithmetic. In some, Gaelic 
reading also is taught, especially in the Society schools. At the 
parish school, besides the subjects common to the other seminaries, 
Latin, mathematics, English grammar, book-keeping and geo- 
graphy, are comprehended in the course of instruction. The 
Scriptures are read daily in all the schools ; nor does a day pass 
without some portion of religious information being conveyed to 
the pupils. 

The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary, L. 34, 4s. 
4|d : each of the Society teachers, at the stations of Moreinsh, 
Ardtallanaig, and Shian, has a salary of L. 15, paid by the Society 
besides a free house, and other accommodations, granted by Lord 
Breadalbane. The Marchioness's teacher at Kiltirie has a salary 
of L. 10, and suitable conveniences. The remuneration of the 
four who teach upon their own adventure cannot be accurately 
stated. The general expense of education for the year may aver- 
age from 10s. to 15s. reckoning attendance to be but for three 
quarters ; and it is seldom that there is even so much, parents be- 
ing usually satisfied, if they can send their children to school for 
the winter half year.

desire of parents and guardians to have the young instructed, 1 am 
inclined to think that there are none between six and fifteen, capable 
of instruction, who cannot read, though there are undoubtedly 
many, and particularly females, who cannot write. And, in like 
manner, while they are but few, and these chiefly aged people, 
above fifteen, who cannot read, there are certainly a great many, 
both males and females, who cannot write ; but the females form 
by much the greater number. It is due to the people to say that 
they do appreciate the benefits of education ; one for every five 
of the population ; attending school, a ratio of school-going 
equal to that in any place or in any country. The instruction im- 
parted, more particularly in the unendowed schools, is of the hum- 
blest character. Nor could it well be otherwise. The private 
schools are all taught by young men from among the peasantry, 
with no advantage but the moderate stock of knowledge which 
they had acquired by their own exertions, and I may say almost 
all at their own fire-sides ; and with no encouragement but the 
scanty allowance stipulated for by the parents, many of whom are 
in indigent circumstances. These inconveniences being consider- 
ed, it is a matter of wonder that the proficiency of the scholars 
should be such as we find it to be. 

The Marquis of Breadalbane has resolved to place at the dis- 
posal of the ministers of Kenmore and Killin, a sum of money to 
be expended in the purchase of useful books for prizes, to be award- 
ed at an annual competition of all the schools of Breadalbane. It 
is proposed that, at certain intervals of years, the teachers should 
also have their respective merits ascertained, so as to be signalised 
by the bestowal of similar honours. 

It would tend greatly to ameliorate the system of education in 
our Scottish schools, if there were introduced, by authority, an uni- 
form set of elementary books ; as matters are at present, no two 
schools have the same books, and, even in the same school, there 
is often to be found the most heterogeneous mixture. 

Library. — There is a small library in the village of Kenmore, es- 
tablished some few years ago, at the suggestion, and by the aid, of 
Lady Elizabeth Campbell, now Pringle. It is composed chiefly of 
religious books. There are but few persons, however, who have 
hitherto made use of it ; the people, though advancing, being hard- 
ly yet arrived at that state of intellectual improvement that they 
can be said to have a taste or appetite for reading. But the thing 
is evidently in progress. Of late also, a small library of well se-

lected, simple publications has been attached to the parochial 
school, by Lady Breadalbane, for the use of the pupils of that se- 
minary a measure likely to stimulate the rising- generation to the 
habit of reading, and so to generate and widen the desire of use- 
ful knowledge. 

Saving Bank. — There is no such establishmentasa Savings bank 
in the parish ; but there is one at no great distance in the village of 
Aberfeldie. It was established in 1833, and is in a thriving condi- 
tion. The sums deposited yearly exceed those withdrawn, and the 
ratio is regularly on the increase. The deposits are made chiefly 
by labourers, and by servants, male and female.

Poo: — The average number of persons receiving aid from the 
poor's fund, for six years back, has been 145 ; and, over head, 
they may receive somewhere about 12s. each per annum. A few, 
however, in more helpless circumstances, have an allowance pe- 
riodically given, at the rate of a shilling or two per week. Besides, 
we are always ready, from week to week, to give occasional aids 
of a few shillings, to persons who, from sickness or other valid 
causes, are brought to the need of temporary relief. In short, in- 
stead of being very nice about the technicality of an ordinary and 
an extraordinary list of the poor, and of making an avowed recog- 
nition of the right of any one to have a stated or periodic supply, 
we choose rather, laborious though the task be, to deal with each 
case separately, and as it may chance to present itself to our notice 
at each recurring examination. The funds are 

1. Ordinary collections, about L. 64 11 10 

2. Mortcloth, proclamations, &amp;c. 7 3 0 

3. Interest of mortified money, &amp;c. 66 0 0 

In all, L. 137 14 10 
It is also to be taken into consideration that, within a certain 
distance round Taymouth, the poor are supplied, twice a-week, 
with nourishing broth and meat from the castle, and, when they 
are not supplied in that way, they have milk and other articles of 
food given them from the dairy. Towards the depth of winter, 
the Marchioness of Breadalbane, with humane and considerate li- 
berality, causes to be distributed a most seasonable supply of 
clothing, together with some little offerings of money. The num- 
ber, over the whole of Breadalbane, who share in this judicious 
act of charity, may amount to about 240 individuals. But with all 



484

this ample fund at command, and more, as I have hinted, if re- 
quired, we feel that it is, on that very account, the more necessary 
to be cautious in the discharge of our duty, lest perchance we 
should augment an evil which is already too formidable. It may 
appear extraordinary that, in a rural district, such as that round 
Lochtay, with neither large villages nor manufactories, to oc- 
casion fluctuations of employment, we should have such a nume- 
rous body of poor. The proportion is unduly high, being rather 
more than one in twenty of the population. Nor does the evil 
seem to be one of recent origin. The cause, therefore, is to be 
sought for, not in any late change, but in something whose opera- 
tion is permanent. It may not be very obvious what that is. 
Perhaps it may have resulted from the excessive subdivision of the 
land, which has long existed on the Breadalbane property, and 
from the circumstance of the tenant, when no longer solvent, being 
permitted to descend to the condition of crofter, or even to a lower 
grade, that of cottar without sufficient consideration whether or 
not that class of men might be too numerous for the demand for 
labour existing, or likely to exist in the country. To a certain 
extent, this has unquestionably happened ; and so that class of 
the population has become too numerous. The consequence is 
just what might have been expected. It must not be concealed 
that, generally speaking, there is no disinclination to apply for pa- 
rochialaid, and that, in too many instances, such application is deem- 
ed to be no degradation. Nor is it at all improbable that the 
very kindness of their superiors may have tended, if not to generate, 
at least to foster, and to help on this unfortunate descent in spirit 
and condition. The policy of the Noble family of Breadalbane, 
for many years has been to retain, for the most part, their poorer 
tenants and dependents on the property, and to make provision for 
them by means of pensions, cheap crofts and otherwise. Here, 
therefore, at the very door, is exhibited a significant exemplifica- 
tion of one of the most important truths of political economy ; — 
that the more prominently you hold out the prospect of making pro- 
vision for people, and do actually provide for them, you tamper 
with the salutary spirit of independence, and in so far help to widen 
the domain of pauperism. 

One preventive, at least, of the evil seems, therefore, to be, to 
have the land so apportioned as to give full occupation to the 
tenant as a farmer ; to have no more cottages than suffice to fur- 
nish labourers for field-work, or such crafts as are required in a 

3

485 



rural situation, and for a rural population, and to permit entry to 
be made to no cottage but according to certain known rules, and 
with the cognizance, if not the written consent, of the landlord. 
Under some such management the happiest results might, in pro- 
cess of time, be expected ; and, in particular, the peasantry would 
be trained, in early life, to turn their eyes elsewhere than to the 
narrow limits of their natal soil for a home, and to learn the whole- 
some lesson that it was the duty of at least many of the young 
to betake themselves to other scenes, where their industry and 
talents would be abundantly in demand. 

Fairs. — The only place in the parish where fairs are held is 
the village of Kenmore ; and of these there are in the course of 
the year the six following:. I. The first Tuesday of March, O. S. 
for horses and general business. 2. The 28th June, for general 
business. 3. The 26th July, for wool and horses. 4. The 17th 
September, for cattle and country produce. 5. The Friday of 
November before last Doune tryst, for cattle and general business. 
6. The 22d December for country produce. 

Inns. — The principal inn is that of Kenmore, so well known as 
not to require any particular account or commendation : the only 
other inn is that of Lawers, midway between Kenmore and Killin, 
known by the name of Croft- House. There is not a single pub- 
lic-house in the parish. 

Distillery. — There is only one establishment for the distillation 
of whisky in the parish, and indeed in Breadalbane. It is a still 
of 150 gallons; uses about 700 bolls of barley, or rather bear in 
the year, producing about 7000 gallons of spirit ; and pays about 
L.855 of duty in that period. 

Fuel. — The principal fuel is peat, which we procure at a vast 
expense of time and labour. The average distance of the bogs is 
two miles. It is difficult to give a definite idea of the expense ; 
but it may be confidently said that, if the time and labour bestowed 
in working and bringing home the production were estimated at 
their proper value, our peat fires are as costly to us as are their 
coals to those who are twenty or thirty miles from the pit. It 
were a welcome boon, indeed, if the instrument for peat making, 
invented by Lord Willoughby D'Eresby, and exhibited at the 
meeting of the Highland Society at Dumfries in 1837, should be 
found to answer the purpose. Wood for fuel may be had from 
the thinnings of the Taymouth plantations, and the loppings of 
trees felled for timber. By a few families, coals are brought to

the country, but at an enormous cost, since, at this distance, we 
find them to be rather more than double the price paid for them at 
the shore of Perth. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In briefly noticing the more striking variations betwixt the pre- 
sent state of the parish, and that which existed at the time of 
drawing up the former Statistical Account, I have to observe par- 
ticularly, — that, from the patriotic and praiseworthy exertions of 
the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, as well as 
from those of a local nature, considerable improvement has ta- 
ken place in the management both of land and of live-stock. A 
greater extent of green crop in general, and of turnips in particu- 
lar is annually cultivated ; — greater attention is paid to the kind 
and quality of seed-corn ; — the breed of horses, cattle, and sheep 
is in progress to be better; — and the facilities are mightily increas- 
ed, whether for sending away or receiving produce. Moreover, 
there are afforded ampler means for the acquisition both of secu- 
lar and religious instruction, insomuch that it is to be hoped that, 
simultaneously with the improvement of the productive powers of 
the soil, and of the domesticated animals, we shall have to con- 
template the still higher and nobler result of man's personal ad- 
vancement in knowledge, power, and righteousness. Nay, this re- 
sult is not altogether a thing of prospect. In a certain de- 
gree, it has already begun to • make its appearance. Our festive 
meetings, our markets, our funerals, our bridals are no longer dis- 
graced with such instances of intoxication, brawling, and fightings 
as were but too common some fifty or sixty years ago. Common 
swearing, gross profanation of the Sabbath, low gambling, are vices 
almost unknown. The kirk-session of the present day does not 
require, as did a kirk-session of the days of our forefathers, to 
reprimand the people, because they had gone on the Sabbath to 
the wood a-nutting, rather than to church ; — or to subject them to 
a course of discipline, because they had devoted the evening of that 
hallowed day to the unsabbatical pastime of fiddling and dancing. 
There is to be found among our peasantry a measure of religious 
knowledge which might put to shame more favoured situations ; and, 
while I would fain believe that, in the case of many, that knowledge 
is a knowledge unto salvation, 1 rejoice to testify, that, in almost all, 
it manifests itself in the pleasing fruit of an orderly and respectful 
regard to the civil and religious institutions of the country. In fine, 
1 would embody in one single sentence what, in my humble opi- 



CRIEFF. 487 

nion, seems calculated to promote the progress of industry, and, 
so far as regards the peculiarities of this district, the comfort and 
happiness of the labouring classes. It is this : Let the popula- 
tion be proportioned to what is required for the due management 
of the land, and for the demand for labour, whether in-door or out- 
door, existing or likely to exist among us ; and with matters in 
this healthy state, our valuable institutions, religious, educational, 
and agricultural, improved and improving as they daily are, will 
accomplish all else desirable. 

And now I close these Statistical lucubrations by saying, in be- 
half of my own section of the country, as our Scottish classic said 
in behalf of the country at large,

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. WILLIAM LAING, MINISTER. 
JAMES FERGUSSON, ASSISTANT 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Scenery, Sfc. — It is a very common opinion that the 
name of the town and parish of Crieff is derived from the Gaelic 
word Craobh, a tree; though some have thought it probable that 
it comes from Crubha Cnoic, the " haunch or side of the hill" on 
which the town is built. 

The town of Crieff is situate near the foot of the Grampians, 
about 17 miles west from Perth, and 22 north from Stirling. It 
is the second in importance in Perthshire. It takes the rank of 
capital of upper Strathearn ; and it stands on the slope of a hill, 
enjoying a fine southern exposure, and commanding a prospect 
at once sublime and beautiful. Many ancient seats of distinguish- 
ed families are in the immediate neighbourhood, of which not a 
few are spacious and elegant ; and these circumstances, together

with the remarkable salubrity of the atmosphere, have long procur- 
ed for Crieff the distinction of being accounted the Montpelier 
of Scotland. 

Boundaries, Extent, fyc. — The parish of Crieff, quoad civilia, 
is divided into two parts, viz. the Highland and the Lowland, which 
are separated from each other by the intervention of the parish of 
Monzie. The Highland division, in addition to Corriemuck- 
lock, contains by far the greater part of the strath of Glenalmond, 
through which the river Almond runs a course of more than nine 
miles. The lands on the north side of the river belong to two 
brothers, viz. James Murray Patton, Esq. Perth, and Thomas 
Patton, Esq. W.S. Edinburgh; and those on the south side be- 
long to Abercairney. The whole of this tract of country, with the 
exception of the lower portion, exhibits a very good specimen of 
the wild and romantic, and even sublime in Scottish mountain 
scenery ; and though it be naturally much better fitted to afford 
occupation to the sportsman, and the shepherd than the husband- 
man, it was once the home of a goodly number of contented fa- 
milies. When the former Statistical Account was drawn up, the 
population of Glenalmond amounted to 500 souls, and the annual 
rent was about L. 700. The rental including the yearly value of 
what is not let has now increased to considerably upwards of 
L. 2000 ; but the population has decreased to 230 ; and while the 
diminution of the one and the increase of the other, have certain- 
ly been caused by the custom which has, for sometime back, been 
prevailing, of converting the pendicles of former days into large 
and extensive farms and sheep-walks, we have a striking proof of 
the fact that the latter mode is the more profitable for the pro- 
prietors. 

In addition to the district of Glenalmond, there are two de- 
tached portions of land in the low country, which belong to the 
parish of Crieff quoad civilia ; viz. Callander and Achalhanzie or 
Alchanzie ; the former, consisting of several farms, lies to the 
north-west of the House of Monzie, and is the property of Sir 
William Keith Murray, Bart, of Ochtertyre ; the latter, consisting 
of one farm, lies east of the House of Cultoquhey, and is the pro- 
perty of Anthony Maxtone, Esq. ; and they both together contain 
a population of 69 souls. But as the whole of the fore-mentioned 
places have been annexed to the parish of Monzie, quoad sacra, 

• The following entry occurs in the records of the kirk-session. « At CriefF,

they will more naturally fall under a description of that parish than 
of this, and we shall therefore take no farther notice of them here 
than to say, that they are included in every census which has been 
taken of the parish of Crieff by order of Government. 

The lowland division, which is more properly the subject of our 
observations, is an irregular four-sided figure, and may contain about 
3800 imperial acres. It is bounded on the north-east by the pa- 
rish of Foul is Wester ; on the north and north-west by the parish 
of Monzie, and the water of Shaggy ; on the west by the Turret, 
which divides it from Monivaird ; on the east by the Pow, which 
divides it from the parish of Madderty ; and on the south by the 
river Earn, which divides it from the parish of Muthil ; with the 
exception of a single farm of about 100 imperial acres belonging 
to Crieff, which lies south of the Earn, and which was cut off by 
the river having changed its course about the end of the seven- 
teenth century. 

The length of the parish from north-west to south-east is 
about 4 miles ; the breadth of it from south-west to north-east 
is about 3 miles ; and the only eminences of any consequence 
are the Cnoc or Knock of Crieff, a hill of an oval shape, which 
rises immediately behind the house of Ferntower to the height of 
about 400 feet above the level of the sea, and Callum's hill, which 
stands south-west of the same mansion. They are both in the 
park of Ferntower, and both are well wooded with different kinds 
of fir and forest trees. 

Meteorology, 8fc— The climate upon the whole is remarkably 
good, variable perhaps, but salubrious. The temperature is higher 
than either in the parish of Monzie on the north side,] or in 
the district of Strathallan on the south ; and more rain falls in 
both these places than in this. The explanation usually given is, 
that the Ochil hills on the south, and the Grampians on the north 
are believed to attract the clouds, and thus to cause a greater fall 
of rain among themselves, and in their neighbourhood. But what- 
ever may be thought of the explanation, the fact is undisputed, that 
heavy showers are often seen falling round us, while Crieff and its 
vicinity are enjoying fine weather. The quantity of rain that an- 
nually falls in the strath is ascertained to be much the same with 
that which falls in Mid-Lothian, and the harvest is generally 

tnis parotn ot Crieff, and annexed to the paroch of Monzie."

gathered home in both places at nearly the same time. The snow 
seldom lies long, and it is the opinion of an intelligent English 
gentleman, who has resided for some years in this quarter, that 
though our spring months are colder, our winters are almost as mild 
as they are in the south of England. 

Winds. — The directions of the winds are very irregular, — owing, 
in a great measure, to the different directions of the glens which 
form the channels of their currents ; but the -north and west winds 
are certainly the most boisterous. In severe frost, the south-west 
wind is the harbinger of a decided change, and it is regarded here 
as an established fact, that the thaws which sometimes commence, 
when the wind is in a different direction, are not of long continu- 
ance. 

Colds, catarrhs, influenzas, and other complaints that are usu- 
ally found in the train of variable weather, are not uncommon in 
winter. Consumption may be termed the principal disease of this 
country, and unfortunately it is not of rare occurrence in this pa- 
rish ; typhus fever is also prevalent among the lowest orders, more 
prevalent than might have been anticipated, and much more so 
than it would actually have been, if ordinary attention were always 
paid to ventilation and cleanliness. There are many old people 
in Crieff at the present time ; and within the last few years, while 
we could enumerate several individuals who had outlived a century, 
there was one in particular who had reached the advanced age of 
110 or 111 years before she died. It is worthy of remark, that the 
cholera was never known in Crieff. 

Hydrography. — The springs in this quarter are all perennial, 
and the water is of the very finest and purest quality. At the 
north-west end of the town, rises the ever-flowing fountain of 
Coldwells, — overbuilt by a substantial stone edifice. From this 
spring an abundant supply of water is conveyed in a large pipe to 
St James' Square, in the middle of which stands a plain but hand - 
some structure, enclosing a cistern where the water discharges 
itself. This building, which forms the centre both of the square 
and of the town, and which is shaded by some very fine lime trees, 
is an object of considerable local beauty ; and most of the wells 
that are distributed over the west and south quarters of the town, 
are supplied by pipes that communicate with this reservoir. The 
north and east parts of Crieff are supplied from another, and al- 
most equally abundant source ; and the memory of St Thomas, 

the tutelary saint of Crieff, has been rescued from oblivion bv a

market and a well, which still bear his name. The principal river 
is the Earn, which flows from Loch Earn,  passes through the 
whole strath, — and joins the Tay above Newburgh, after a course 
of more than thirty miles. It is joined at Crieff by the Turret, and 
is the southern boundary of the parish for nearly three miles. It 
has very obviously changed its channel frequently below Crieff; 
and tradition says that it has ranged the whole of the level plain 
between Tom-a-chaistail and Comrie above Crieff, — that it once 
passed close to Ochtertyre House, f and much nearer to Crieff 
than it now is, — and that its present course, by Strmvan, must have 
been formed when its swollen current was impeded by ice or some 
other obstruction. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — " The Grampian mountains, which 
constitute the Highlands of Perthshire, on the north and west of 
Crieff, extending many miles in breadth, and running from the east 
coast of Scotland, south of Aberdeen, till they terminate at the 
extremity of the Mull of Cantyre, near Ireland, consist chiefly of 
mica slate rocks, with occasional beds of quartz and hornblende 
slate and some patches of granite. All the high mountains near 
Crieff, such as Benlawers, Benvorlich, Benichonie, &amp;c. are com- 
posed of mica slate. But, on the east edge of the Grampians, 
there is a narrow tract of clay slate, which may be traced from 
Stonehaven, in Kincardineshire, to the Gareloch in Dumbarton- 
shire, without interruption. This strip of clay slate approaches 
within about a couple of miles of Crieff. It mav be seen as we 
descend from Loch Turret to the low country. But its breadth 
in that place scarcely exceeds half a-mile. There is a patch of 
granite between Benichonie and Lochearn. It is bounded on the 
south by Glen Lednick, and extends from west to east about four 
miles. At the foot of the clay-slate rocks there is a narrow valley, 
which may be traced for many miles running parallel to the Gram- 
pians. To the east of this valley there rise a number of isolated 
hills;— Cnoc- Mary, Turlum, Lochlin, Tom-a-chaistail, Laggan, 
Cnoc of Crieff, Glowero'erhim, &amp;c. are well known hills in the 
neighbourhood of Crieff. Many of these are covered with wood ; 
and, varying much in their shape and appearance, it is to them 
chiefly that the beautiful landscape to the south -west of Crieff, 
scarcely equalled in any other part of Great Britain, is owing. 
These hills are composed of greywa.cke, varying much in its appear-

ance in different places. Sometimes it is a red sandstone in beds 
almost vertical ; sometimes a very coarse red conglomerate, com- 
posed chiefly of hornblende porphyry, very like the rocks in Glen- 
co; and sometimes having the appearance of common greywacke. 
The sandstone is frequently employed in the neighbourhood of 
Crieff as a building stone. 

" The Vale of Strathearn, from about two miles east of Comrie, 
consists of a red sandstone, quite similar in appearance to that 
which accompanies the greywacke; but the beds, instead of being 
vertical, as they are in the hills, are in the low country about Crieff 
horizontal, or nearly so. This sandstone occupies the whole strath 
from the Ochils to the hills on the north side, and may be traced 
without interruption from the south-west corner of Dumbarton- 
shire to the east coast of Scotland. It is of great breadth. On 
the west side, its breadth is from Dumbarton to within a mile of 
the Row Church, or about ten miles ; and on the east coast, from 
Stonehaven to the Redhead, constituting the boundary of the Frith 
of Tay, not less than thirty miles. 

" This sandstone, so far as has been observed, contains no fossil 
remains either of animals or vegetables. It has been generally 
considered as the old red sandstone. On the north shore of the 
Clyde it may be seen reposing on clayslate, and we may presume 
that this is its position also in Strathearn. How far it is similar 
to the old redstone rocks in the neighbourhood of Bristol, it would 
be difficult to say. Trap dikes occur here and there in this sand- 
stone ; but they are not numerous. There is a very remarkable 
one between Muthil and Crieff, called Concraig, composed of a 
kind of greenstone, which may be traced for several miles running 
east and west. There is another consisting of greenstone at Mon- 
zie, which is quarried for mending the roads. Many granite boul- 
ders occur in Strathearn. A considerable number may be seen 
on the south-east shoulder of the Cnoc : the most remarkable of 
these is the one known by the name of the Cradle-stone. It is 
nearly spherical, with a circumference approaching to 30 feet. Its 
weight is about 30 tons. It has been split in two by lightning, 
and one of the pieces has made a revolution down the hill. It is 
composed of syenitic granite. No ores of any kind, so far as I 
know, have been observed near Crieff. Boulders of sulphate of 
barytes, water-worn and about t\e size of an egg, occur in the bed 
of the Shaggy, indicating a vein of that substance ; but it has not 
been observed in situ."

There are no alluvial deposits except those that are found on 
the banks of the Earn, and those that are left by the mountain 
streams. They generally consist of sand, gravel, and sometimes 
of vegetable substances ; and do not appear to be in any way re- 
markable. 

The soil varies considerably in different parts of the parish. 
On the north, west, and south sides, it is light and sandy or gravel- 
ly, and occasionally rests upon rocks of freestone of a tolerably 
good quality ; in the immediate vicinity of the town, it becomes a 
pretty rich loam, owing principally to the quantity of manure which 
it receives, and the care which is otherwise bestowed upon it ; and, 
on the east and south-east sides, it is in general a kind of stiff, 
reddish, tilly clay — often wet, and frequently resting upon rocks 
of the same colour, which do not admit of being hewn, but which 
are hard and durable, which split easily, and which are much used 
for building fences. 

No mines have yet been discovered in the parish, and it is ex- 
ceedingly probable that none exist. Several attempts have been 
made to find coals in the neighbourhood. One was made with- 
out success, many years ago, and another is now being made with- 
out any flattering prospects, in the district of Strathallan. A pro- 
posal was lately made to Lady Baird Preston, of Ferntower, by 
one who professed to be acquainted with the subject, to sink a shaft 
in a part of her Ladyship's property, which lies about a mile and 
a half east of Crieff; and the terms on which he seemed disposed 
to make the attempt were such as could leave no doubt of his own 
hope of success. He was willing that the discovery of coals should 
be made the condition on which he was to be remunerated for his 
trouble, that he should receive so much if he succeeded, and that 
he should receive nothing if he failed. The terms were not ac- 
cepted, because it did not appear right to be the means of bring- 
ing any man into circumstances in which the chances of success 
were believed to be so much against him ; but the proposal was 
so very specious that it gave occasion to very particular inquiries. 
The result has been most decidedly unfavourable. And, however 
much we should desire that it were a mistaken one, we fear that 
the opinion is too well founded, that there are no coals to the north 
of the Ochils.

called rare in Scotland, and those that are common in similar dis- 
tricts are also common here. The only species of foreign ani- 
mals are the pheasant, the woodcock, and the squirrel ; and it is 
not supposed that any which formerly existed have disappeared. 

The principal singing birds are, the blackbird, the thrush, the 
starling, the bullfinch, the goldfinch, the linnet, and the lark. 
The crested-wren is also known here. 

The Game are, the black-cock, the pheasant, the partridge, the 
woodcock, the snipe, the landrail, the green and grey plovers, 
the curlew, the heron, the roe-deer, and the hare. The wild 
goose is often seen, but is rarely got at. To these may be ad- 
ded the wood-pigeon, wild ducks of different tribes, and rabbits 
in great abundance. 

The vermin are, the badger, the fox, the otter, the marten and 
polecat, the stoat, the weasel, the mole, the rat, and the mouse. 

The birds of prey are, the sparrowhawk, the harrier, the mer- 
lin, the salmon-tailed glede, the buzzard, the night-hawk, the grey, 
white, and horned-owls, the raven, the carrion crow, the magpie, 
and the jay. The eagle is occasionally seen in the Cnoc in severe 
winters. 

Since the establishment of the Agricultural Society, the best 
breeds of horses, black-cattle, and sheep are reared — the sheep 
in very limited numbers. There does not appear to be any thing 
peculiar about the breed of swine : but great numbers of them are 
reared, and sometimes fed for the Glasgow market. 

The rivers all abound with the common trouts ; and, in addi- 
tion to this, the Earn contains the salmon, the sea-trout, the eel, 
the perch, and the pike. The salmon generally comes up the 
Earn during the months of August and September, spawns 
in November and December, and returns again to the sea in Fe- 
bruary and March. The sea trout usually comes up the river 
earlier than the salmon, and spawns during the months of Sep- 
tember and October. And the loch and river trouts appear to 
seek the brooks with a view to spawn at the same time. 

Wood. — There are two small coppices of oak and birch, amount- 
ing to about ten acres; and, if we except those on the Ferntower 
property, the plantations are nowhere else of any great extent. 
The forest trees, which are planted, and which all appear to thrive, 

 The Right Honourable Lord Willoughby D'Eresby has lately sent down a 
boar and some pigs — the latter as gifts to several of his tenants, with a view to in- 
troduce the best English breed into Strathearn.

are reared in a public nursery in the parish, and consist of the 
following kinds, viz. the common oak, the scarlet oak, Turkey oak, 
larch, spruce, Scotch and silver firs, Weymouth pines, ash, elm, 
beech, plane or sycamore, horse chestnuts, limes, walnuts, and po- 
plars of various descriptions. 

There is no tree in the parish that is remarkable for age, size, 
or form, save the vew at Inchbrakie, which is said to be the second 
largest in Scotland, and in the thick foliage of which the Marquis 
of Montrose is reported to have been concealed during a season 
of danger. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Notices, §c. — " This town, 1 ' says one who is every 
way qualified to give an opinion, " is a place of respectable anti- 
quity ; — various notices of it occur in the annals of Scottish his- 
tory. Justice courts in Air sat at Crieff at a period of a very 
distant date. It formed the head-quarters of the army of Montrose 
more than once during the civil wars of the seventeenth century, 
and in the two last eras of intestine commotion, it was traversed 
and occupied by the insurgent and royalist forces. In the year 
1715 it was burnt down by the Highlanders, and in all probability 
it would have undergone the same fate in 1745, if the Duke of 
Perth had not interfered to preserve it from destruction."  

The Highlanders had no good will to Crieff ; and the fact, that 
it was stedfast in its loyality to the then reigning Prince, will be 
fully sufficient to account for their dislike. They were wont to 
say of it, that " she would be a bra toun gin she had anither sing" 

 There are no ancient or modern accounts of the history of the parish, in so far 
ai we know, neither are there any maps, plans or surveys, of the parish ; but there is 
a plan of the town of Crieff in Wood's Town Atlas, published in Edinburgh in the year 
1822, and, since, accompanied with a " Descriptive Account" of the principal towns 
in Scotland. The above extract is taken from the account which is there given 
of Crieff, and it has the advantage of being written by a native. The only other do- 
cuments of public importance, concerning which we have been able to obtain any in. 
formation, are the records of the legal and judicial proceedings of the courts of the 
Stewarts of Strathearn, including those of Chancellor Drummond. These interest- 
ing and valuable relics of antiquity, which are said to have consisted of upwards of 
40 volumes folio, bound in vellum, together with many loose papers, were certainly 
in existence in Crieff about the year 1796. There are several respectable individu- 
als still alive, who remember seeing the books, and reading portions of the less ancient 
of them ; but there is much reason to fear that they are now all lost. It is common- 
ly reported that the greater part, if not the whole of them, were burnt instead of fuel, 
by a regiment of fencibles who were stationed in Crieff in the year 1798, and who 
made the court-room their guard-house. It is also said that some of them were sent 
to the Sheriff- Clerk's Office in Perth ; but, though careful search has been made 
through the obliging kindness of Mr James Patton, no trace of them could be dis- 
covered in the Sheriff- Clerk's record rooms. The probability, therefore, is, that they 
were never sent to Perth ; and it is somewhat curious that the early records of the 
parish, both civil and ecclesiastical, have, at separate times, been destroyed by the 
military. ' '

singeing, and certainly it was from no want of inclination on their 
part that the " tither sing" was not given it. But they were pre- 
vented by the superior, who generously interposed his authority 
to protect the town, even though its inhabitants had espoused a 
different political interest from that which he was himself support- 
ing with all his might. We know not how the calamity was per- 
mitted to happen in his father's time, or whether any efforts were 
then made to prevent it. The same authority, doubtless, which 
averted it in the latter case might have done so in the former ; and 
the subjoined copy of an original order, which was given by the 
Duke of Perth, in the year 1713, exhibits a specimen of the man- 
ner in which that authority was usually exercised, and of the con- 
sequences which might be likely to follow disobedience at the hands 
of the Highland soldiers. It was issued when the Duke was rais- 
ing those troops with which he joined the standard of the Earl of 
Marr, and fought at Sherrif Muir. It is titled on the back, — 
" Order Ja. Ld. Drummond to William M'Gruther, William 
M'Nivan, and Alexr. M'Gruther, farmers in Glenartney, 1713." 
Previous to the reign of Malcolm Canmore, in the eleventh 
century, the chief titles of distinction under the King in this coun- 
try were those of Abthane and Thane. The Abthane of Scot- 
land was invested with a jurisdiction over the whole kino-dom : 
and the Thane possessed a similar power over a district. But, 
as Malcolm had lived a considerable time in England, when he 
fled from the usurper Macbeth, he introduced the English offices 
and titles into Scotland, after his restoration to the Scottish Crown : 
and, subsequently to his time, we find the antiquated title of Ab- 

 The order runs in the following terms : — " William M'Gruther in Dalelathick 
yow are hereby ordered to acquaint William M'Nivan in the same town, and Alex- 
ander M'Gruther in Dalchrown, to goe along with yow as officers, to Command the 
Company of our men that is to come out of your glen, and all the men are hereby 
ordered to obey your Commands on their highest perill, which you are to Intimate to 
them as you will be answerable to us, and this shall be your warrant. Given att 
Drummond Castle this fifteenth day of August one thousand seven hundred and 
thirteen years." " See that none of the men of Achinner of whatever rank be absent, 
as they will be answerable, and all the men in good order." Signed Drummond. 
This curious document was found among the papers of the late Miss M'Gruther 
of Migger, and is still in the possession of one of her relatives who resides in Crieff. 
Miss M'Gruther was a grand-daughter of the above-mentioned William M'Gruther • 
and it may be worthy of notice that he, together with his two companions, obeyed the 
instruction of their superior, and took the command of the company that was raised 
in Glenartney ; but, after the insurrection was put down and the disturbances quelled 
they were banished to America, on account of that obedience, and sold as slaves. From 
this captivity the two M'Gruthers, who were ransomed by their friends, returned 
home in the guise of travelling packmen, and remained seven years in hiding with- 
out having either been at kirk or market.

thane giving way to that of Steward of Scotland, and that of Thane 
to Steioard of a district 

The spot is still pointed out where the Steward of the King's 
estate of Strathearn was in the habit of holding his court, after the 
earldom was forfeited to the Crown, in the year 1320, by the trea- 
son of its heiress, Joanna, daughter of Malise, the last Earl. This 
lady married the English Earl de Warrenne ; and, while the alli- 
ance was the means of inducing her to violate her allegiance to 
Robert I., it proved fatal to all her pretensions as the represen- 
tative of a noble line of ancestors. She was deprived of her titles, 
and the forfeiture of her patrimonial possessions gave occasion to 
the appointment of a steward of Strathearn ; — an office which was 
vested in the house of Drummond ; which in course of time became 
hereditary in the family ; and which they continued to enjoy till 
the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in the year 1748.f The 
spot referred to is a circle of about 12 yards diameter, which is 
situated in a field belonging to Mr M'Laurin, of the Broich, about 
half a mile south-east of Crieff, and which, in comparatively mo- 
dern times, was surrounded with a low wall of earth and stone which 
is now hardly discernible. It is marked out by a blasted tree, 
which stands in the middle of it, and many are the tales of those 
who were arraigned, and tried, and condemned at this dread tribunal. 

The Gallow-Hill, a rising ground where criminals were exe- 
cuted, is a little to the west of Crieff, adjacent to a street which 
bears the same name. A stunted tree of no great age is now 
growing where the fatal beam was wont to stand in the memory 
of a former generation. And the timber of the identical gallows 
itself is still in good preservation. It is now the property of a 
lady in Edinburgh. 

It would be a very hopeless undertaking to attempt giving any 
account of the numerous traditional stories which are related con- 
cerning the administration of the Stewards of Strathearn. Suf- 
fice it to say, that the number of convictions must have been con- 
siderable ; that the justice which was awarded was always sum-

mary, and sometimes very arbitrary; and that there is reason to 
fear that the innocent occasionally suffered with the guilty. Crieff 
was in consequence regarded with no little dread by all those who 
had any cause of apprehension, and especially by those lawless 
marauders who infested the country from the distant glens of the 
north. The fate of those who were once arraigned and brought 
to trial was looked upon by their companions as being already 
sealed ; and such is the tendency— we should have said the folly 
—of humanity, that the kind gallows of Crieff, as they were pleas- 
ed to term it, became a byword, at least, if not a jest, among 
those who deemed it very likely that it might put a period to their 

own existence.  

In the year 1665, the present tolbooth was erected in Crieff, for 
the accommodation of the Steward's Court, which from this pe- 
riod ceased to be held in the open air, and for the despatch of 
other public business.f It now contains a jail in the ground flat, 
where offenders are occasionally lodged for a night or so ; a court- 
room, where the justices hold a small-debt court, on the first 
Monday of every month ; and another apartment above, where a pub- 
lic library is kept. There is also a spire attached to it, which con- 
tains the town clock, and a good bell, of which tradition says that 
it was that which was rung at Scone when the Kings of Scotland 
were crowned. If the tale be true, the bell must have been recast ; 
for it bears a Latin inscription, setting forth, that it was gifted in the 
year 1725 by John Lord Drummond, uncle of James, the third Duke 
of Perth. The bell was recast, perhaps we should have said re-recast, 
in the year 1821, at the expense of the inhabitants of Crieff. The ori- 
ginal inscription was replaced, but an addition was made to it. The 
motto to the Drummond arms is inserted between the old inscnp-

a fac-simile of the old. 

The superiority of the town is now vested in the three proprie- 
tors, the Right Honourable Lord Willoughby de Eresby; Anthony 
Murray, Esq. of Crieff and Dollerie ; and Alexander M'Laurin, 
Esq. of the Broich, who hold of the Crown, and who respectively 
appoint baron bailies to exercise all that remains of the ancient 
feudal jurisdiction. 

From time immemorial, previous to the year 1770, Crieff was 
the great mart for the sale of black- cattle in the north of Scotland. 
The dealers from all parts of Britain were regularly accustomed to 
attend it. And it is stated in the former Statistical Account, that 
the " old people used then to speak with deep regret of the glo- 
rious scene which was displayed to view, when 30,000 black cat- 
tle overspread the whole adjacent country." But at the period above- 
mentioned, the great annual trysts were removed to Falkirk ; and 
Pennant informs us, that, in 1771, 24,000 heads of black cattle 
were sold there. 

Eminent Characters, fyc— James Drummond, fifth Laird of 
Milnab, was forty years steward- depute of Strathearn. A mar- 
ble bust, with the following inscription, was erected to his memory 
in the church of Crieff, from which it appears that he had made 
some figure both as a judge and as a poet

Patrick Graeme of Inchbrakie, Colonel of the Posse Comitatus 
of Perthshire, and cousin-german to the celebrated James, Mar- 
quis of Montrose, was distinguished by the part which he took in 
that nobleman's fortunes. He held a conspicuous place during 
all his wars, and appears to have enjoyed a very considerable share 
of his master's confidence. He is said to have defeated the Duke 

" Milnab — or Mill of the Abbot, is now greatly reduced both in size and conse- 
quence from what it was in former days. We read, in Malcolm's Memoirs, of a royal 
charter of the lands and mill of Milnab being granted in 1321 by James V. to John 
Drummond, grandson of one of the stewards of Strathearn. Tn the year 1677, men- 
tion is made of the lands and barony, which contained the town, mill, and mill-lands 
of Milnab. There was a religious house, connected with Ir.chafFray, near the mill ; 
and the last generation but one remembered the ruins of it. The family of Milnab 
was a branch of the house of Drummond, and maintained a distinguished rank in 
the country for many generations. The line is now believed to be extinct, and the 
estate is the property of the Right Honourable Lord and Lady Willoughby de Eresby.

of Argyle near Dunnoter, and taken possession of Aberdeen ; and 
in return, Cromwell burnt down his bouse of Incbbrakie, which, in 
those days, was a stronghold surrounded by a moat, and defend- 
ed at the entrance by a drawbridge. There are still some traces 
of this ancient fortification. 

Another branch of the family, a grandson of Colonel Graeme, 
who is commonly known by the name of Father Graeme, and who 
is represented as having at first been an officer in the army of 
James II., afterwards became a monk of the Mendicant Order of 
Capuchins, at Boulogne, in France. This change of profession 
is mentioned by Smollet, in his " Travels through France and 
Italy," as having been caused by a desire to atone, by voluntary pe- 
nance, for the sin of having killed his friend in a duel ; and the 
current tradition bears a similar testimony. But be this as it may, 
there can be little doubt that this monastic lived for a long course 
of vears at Boulogne : that he conformed to all the austerities of 
his order with the most rigorous exactness ; that he arose to emi- 
nence in the institution ; and that he died, at a very advanced 
age, Superior of the Convent. There is a portrait of him at Aber- 
cairney Abbey, in his Capuchin dress ; and another at Inchbrakie, 
together with a family-tree which he had drawn, exhibiting his 
pedigree for several generations. 

Mallet, the poet, and Dow, the historian of Hindostan, are gene- 
nerally believed to have been educated at the school of Crieff. The 
late Dr William Wright, a physician and naturalist, and Dr Thomas 
Thomson, the present distinguished Professor of Chemistry in the 
University of Glasgow, were natives of this parish. And General Sir 
David Baird, Bart. G. C. B. and K. C. passed the later years of his 
life and ended his days in the neighbourhood. There is a marble 
tablet attached to the western gable of the church on the outside, 
setting forth the important service which this illustrious individual 
rendered to the parish when that edifice was repaired. The re- 
membrance of his worth and generosity and public spirit is still 
cherished with enthusiasm. And there is nothing in the memory 
of the present generation, that called forth anything like the gene- 
ral emotion which was produced by his death.

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers of Crieff do not 
extend far back, and they are very incomplete. The earliest entry 
is 20th November 1692; and from that date to the present Au- 
gust 1837 the register of proclamation of banns is complete, with 
the exception of one blank between the 1st of March 1713 and 
the 6th of November 1748. The register of births and baptisms 
extends from the 27th December 1692 to the present time, with 
the exception of a blank between the 8th of June and the 1 6th of 
November 1746. The records of discipline are very defective. 
They begin 3d October 1699 ; and from that date to the present 
time there are no fewer than four blanks, viz 15th of February 
1713 to 16th September 1723; 14th October 1739 to 1st No- 
vember 1746; 26th October 1760 to 12th July 176J ; and 6th 
December 1772 to 11th April 1833. The accounts of the poor's 
funds commence 19th June 1700; and from that to the present 
time the following blanks occur, viz. 18th March 1713 to 25th 
October 1747, and 19th November 1790 to 24th May 1807. The 
whole is comprised in eleven volumes of different sizes, The deaths 
have never been recorded. 

Antiquities, §•.— The antiquities of the parish are not nume- 
rous ; and of those that exist we have already mentioned some 
in connexion with those historical events to which they stand re- 
lated. We shall now proceed to notice the few that remain. 

The Cross of Crieff is certainly a monument of great antiquity. 
It stands near what was formerly the middle of the town, elevated 
a step or two on a base of hewn stone, and measuring 6 feet 3 
inches in height, nearly 2 feet in width, and 6 inches in thickness.

It is curiously carved in front, having the form of a cross embossed 
upon it; and there are traces of what is likely to have been a 
motto or inscription, but the characters are so much effaced that 
it is now altogether im'possible to decipher them. Of its early 
history little seems to be known, save that it is not the original 
cross of Crieff. Nobody can tell what or whose it was ; but some 
of the last, or at least of a previous, generation remembered that it 
stood on the neighbouring farm of Trowan ; and on the back part of 
it which is not carved the remains of an iron loop or staple are dis- 
cernible, to which a ring or collar might have been attached, for the 
purpose of securing those who were sentenced to the pillory. Another 
implement of ancient jurisdiction, which was certainly used for 
this purpose, and which is still preserved, is what is vulgarly term- 
ed Choucks, probably the French Jougs. It is a tapering octa- 
gonal stone, about 10 feet in length, to which an iron collar was 
attached, which locked by a padlock. The ancient Crieff Stocks 
are likewise preserved. 

At the demolition of the old parish church which was an antique 
Gothic structure, 95 feet long, 18 feet wide, and 14 feet in the 
quire in the year 1787, about forty gold coins of Robert I. of 
Scotland were found deposited in a niche of the wall, about six 
inches, from the floor. Each piece, which was equal in breadth 
to a modern guinea, and precisely one-fourth of its weight, had 
the head of this monarch, with the words, " Robertus Rex Sco- 
torum," upon the one side, and St Andrew with his cross upon the 
other. These relics of antiquity, it is believed, passed into the pos- 
session of some of the neighbouring gentry.  

There is a Roman road, or what is reputed to have been one, 
passing through the lands of the Broich. It is supposed to have 
connected the encampment at Strageath with that at Dalginross ; 
and, as a confirmation of the tradition, it is worthy of remark, 
that, when the present road was being made through Burrel Street, 
a pavement was discovered under ground, composed of common 
flag stones, bedded close together, in the usual way that Roman 
roads are laid, and manifestly surrounded with a different sort of 
earth from that which was found in the immediate neighbourhood. 

 Fifty-eight gold coins, nearly of the same, and sixty-two of a larger description, 
were lately discovered in the Cathedral at Glasgow, by some workmen, who were 
employed in renovating the interior. They were all found deposited under the pave- 
ment, about five inches from the base of one of the pillars, which divided the outer 
. High Church from the nave ; and they are all said to be in a state of the most per- 
fect preservation.

Close to this road, and near the field where the stewards of the 
King's estate of Strathearn were wont to hold their courts, stands 
a large upright stone, which is understood to have been either a 
memorial of some Roman event, or the. remains of a Druidical 
circle ; and, while both suppositions are likely enough, it is im- 
possible to say which should have the preference. It is well known 
that many of these circles once existed in the neighbourhood, 
though most of them have been removed for agricultural purposes. 
There is one, at least a part of one, in the park in front of Fern- 
tower-House. The largest, and several of the smaller, stones of 
the circle are still remaining. And the spot is remarkable .for 
more than Druidical rites. It was the scene of a deadly ren- 
contre, which took place in the year 1413 between Patrick 
Graeme, who had become Earl of Strathearn, by marrying its 
heiress, a grand-daughter of Robert II., and Sir John Drummond 
of Concraig, who was then Steward of Strathearn. The Earl was 
slain by Sir John, and the life of the survivor was embittered ever 
after. It is also the spot which, according to popular tradition, 
Sir John Cope, chose for his camp, so long as he remained in this 
neighbourhood, during the troubles of the year 1745. There is 
a very fine well, which still goes by the name of " Cope's Well," 
and, in a bog near it, an old sword was lately found, which cer- 
tainly confirms the truth of the tradition. This sword is still at 
Ferntower House ; but there is another sword there, which is a 
trophy of far greater importance, viz. that of Tippoo Saib, which 
was presented to General Sir David Baird, in the name of the 
British army in India, immediately after the storming of Seringa- 
patam. There are several other articles at Ferntower, which it 
may be proper to mention,— such as a magnificent Egyptian saddle, 
massy silk window curtains, which were manufactured for Na- 
poleon Bonaparte,— and the remains of what is supposed to have 
been the bracelets of the Countess of Strathearn, who is said to 
have been imprisoned at Tom-a-Chaistail, before the castle was 
consumed by fire. The bracelets have manifestly undergone the 
action of fire ; and the same thing is true of the stones that were 
dug out when the foundation of General Baird's monument was 
being cleared. But, for a full account of this matter, we would 
refer the reader to the New Statistical Account of Monivaird. 

Inchbrakie's Ring. — There is a curious relic in the family of 
Inchbrakie, and the history of it is as curious as itself. It is well 
known that, at no very distant period, there was a war of exter- 



504

mination carried on against all those hapless women who were 
suspected of being witches ; and the last who fell a victim in this 
quarter, is reported to have been one of the name of Catherine 
M'Niven, who was burnt at the north-east shoulder of the Cnoc 
of Crieff, at a spot which is called " Kate M'Niven's Craig," to 
this day. All accounts agree in giving credit to the Laird of 
Inchbrakie, for having exerted himself to the utmost to save poor 
Kate's life, though his exertions proved in vain. When the flames 
were lighted, and her sufferings commenced, she is said to have 
uttered various predictions against her enemies, — and, turning 
round to Inchbrakie, to have spit a bluish stone out of her mouth, 
which she requested him to take and keep, declaring that, so long 
as it was preserved in the family, his race would never cease to 
thrive. The stone resembles, and is said to be, an uncut sapphire. 
It is now set in a gold ring, and is most carefully preserved. 
The story of " Inchbrakie's Ring" may not be an unfit companion 
to the celebrated Lockart Lee- Penny of the West. 

Modern Buildings, fyc. — The parish church is comparatively a 
modern building ; but there is an additional church in progress, 
which is intended to become the parish church of half the present 
parish of Crieff, quoad sacra, and which is likely to be finished in 
the course of the present year. It is building by subscription ; is cal- 
culated to accommodate about 1000 sitters; and is likely to cost 
L. 1500 before it is completed. It occupies a commandingsituation, 
and will be by far the finest object in Crieff. The ground was 
gifted by the Right Hon. Lord and Lady Willoughby deEresby, in 
addition to a very handsome subscription which they made; and the 
foundation stone was laid by this nobleman's only son on the 22d 
August 1837. 

There is another new church, nearly finished, in connexion 
with the United Secession. It is also building by subscription, 
and stands on the site of their former place of worship. It is fitted 
to accommodate about 500 sitters, and may cost between L. 500 
and L. 600. 

The Masons' Hall, or St Michael's Lodge, was erected in the 
year 1816 at the expense of the corporation, and at a cost of about 
L. 2000. The weavers built their hall in the year 1786, at an 
expense of L. 200 ; and the only other hall in the place is that in 
the principal inn, which is sometimes termed the Assembly Room, 
though the other two are perhaps more frequently occupied by the 
public in this capacity. There are only three mansion-houses in

the parish, viz. Ferntower, Inchbrakie, and the Broich ; and the 
chief manufactories are three tan-works; a barley, a flour, and two 
corn mills ; a bark mill ; a flax, and a flax-seed- oil mill ; a saw and 
turning mill ; a woollen manufactory, and two distilleries. All these 
manufactories with the exception of the tan-works are situated 
on the river Turret, and within the space of three quarters of a mile. 

III. — Population. 
The population of the town has for a long time been increas- 
ing ; sometimes rapidly ;  and Crieff" now contains more inhabi- 
tants, perhaps, than it did at any former period. But, owing to 
the decrease of the country population, especially that of Glen- 
almond, the gross population of the whole parish, quoad civilia, 
has been proportionally slower in its growth than the population of 
the town. 



The following table presents a view of the population from 
1755 to 1837, and contains all the information which we have 
been able to collect on the subject.

 The principal cause assigned for the rapid increase of the population of Crieff, 
previous to the year 1792, is that, having little trade, and being ignorant of the 
means by which any money they had acquired, could be improved to advantage, the 
people thought themselves fortunate in having it in their power to invest it in a bouse 
and garden of their own property ; a spirit which the proprietors of the town were 
then disposed to encourage and gratify, by granting email feus to those who were in- 
clined to build upon them.

Language. — The language generally spoken is the best 
Scottish dialect. Within the last two or three years, a Gaelic 
sermon has been preached in Crieff on communion occasions, 
and the attendance was considerable. But many of the hear- 
ers came from a distance ; and the great majority of them are ca- 
pable of deriving benefit from Sabbath ministrations in English. 

Habits of the people, fyc. — The habits of the people are cleanly ; 
they dress remarkably well ; and, in general, they live comforta- 
bly. This latter circumstance must doubtless be attributed, in a 
great measure, to their own industry ; but it is considerably aided 
by the accommodation which is given by the proprietors of the 
town and neighbourhood, in the shape of what are ordinarily term- 
ed feus, pecks, and acres. 

Feus, Sfc. — The whole town consists of feus, which have been 
granted at different periods, and are held at different rates of feu- 
duty ; but its antiquity is not to be confined to the date of the 
earliest feu-charters ; inasmuch as there is every reason to 
believe that there was a village in the place, long before the exist- 
ence of any of the present charters. Crieff, properly so called, lies 
east of the tolbooth, and the oldest feus are near the cross. They 
all hold of the family of Crieff and Dollerie, and some of them 
were granted before the middle of the seventeenth century ; others 
are of a more modern date ; and the last feus are not yet twenty 
years old. The remaining part of the High Street, from the tol- 
booth to Comrie Street, including St James' Square, was feued by 
James Drummond of Perth, in the year 1738, with the exception 
of the portion between Fraser's Corner and Hill's Wynd, on the 
north, and the tolbooth and Brydie's Corner, on the south side, 
which had previously been feued by George Drummond of Milnab, 
in the year 1683. 

Commissioners' Street ; King's Street, as far as the meadow ; 
Galvil More ; Tainshe's Lane ; the upper part of Hill's Wynd ; 
and the back feus west to Comrie Street, — were feued by the com- 
missioners upon the forfeited estates of Perth about the year 1774. 
Brown's Row, from the Meadow to M'Farlane's Lane, and a 
small portion of the street at the north of Bridgend ; Mitchell 
Street; Miller's Street; Comrie Street; and Milnab Street, — were 
feued by James Lord Perth, after the year 1785, when the for- 
feited estates were restored. 



CRIEFF. 



507 



Bridgend and Pittenzie have been feued by the family of Broich; 
the former after the year 1730, and the latter after the year 
1766. And Burrel Street; Burrel Square ; that part of Brown's 
Row below M'Farlane's Lane ; and the villas north of the Comrie 
road, where the new church is built, were feued by the Right 
Honourable Lord and Lady Willoughby d'Eresby in the years 
1809 and 1810. 

These feus are of various dimensions ; but the average size 
is 400 square ells ; and the rates of feu -duty are as follows :— 
The old feus paid considerable sums in the name of purchase 
money, in addition to a small feu-duty which is annually 
to be paid to the superiors. Dollerie's old feu- duties range 
from 2s. 6d. to 10s. each; and Broich's are nearly the same. 
James Drummond of Perth's feus, and those of George Drum- 
mond of Milnab, are possessed on low terms, — so very low, indeed, 
that, in some instances, the feu-duties are nominal. The com- 
missioners' feus paid no purchase money, but they pay a yearly 
feu-duty of 4s. each. Lord Perth's feus paid each L. 4 of pur- 
chase money, and are paying 2s. 6d. of yearly feu-duty. And 
Lord Willoughby's feus, as well as those that have of late been 
granted by the other proprietors, have paid no purchase money, 
but are paying a yearly feu-duty at the rate of L.16 per acre. 

Pecks. — The pecks are patches of lands, containing each a 
fourteenth part of an acre, which are regularly let to the inhabi- 
tants at a yearly rent, and which may be continued or recalled at 
pleasure by the proprietors. They are all the property of Messrs 
Murray of Crieff and Dollerie, and M'Laurin of the Broich, with 
the exception of a few which belong to Lord Willoughby d'Eresby. 
And the rents range between 4s. 6d. and 9s. each ; that is to say, 
they are let at the rate of from three to six guineas per acre. 

Acres. — The acres differ from the pecks in nothing but their 
size and rents. They contain from one to seven acres each, and 
they are commonly let from two to three guineas per acre. 

The three proprietors of the town, and Lady Baird Preston of 
Ferntower, have between them upwards of 300 acres of land, let 
out in these pecks and pendicles. The community, in general, 
are thereby enabled to raise corn, potatoes, and other necessaries. 
Many of them also keep a cow or cows, by which they have it in 
their power, not merely to add to the comfort of their own families, 
but also to supply the wants of their less fortunate neighbours, at 



508

a moderate expense ; and there is scarcely a single householder 
who does not possess a pig. 

Poaching, Sfc. — Poaching was once very prevalent ; but it is be- 
lieved that it is now on the decline. Smuggling also, at one time, 
prevailed exceedingly in this quarter; but it may be said to be now 
altogether relinquished. 

Character of the People. — The general character of the people, 
as to intellectual, moral, and religious attainments, is much the same 
with that of the inhabitants of most of our overgrown Scottish 
villages. " The tradesmen here," says the author of the former 
Statistical Account, " very few individuals excepted, are all on 
a level ; no one chooses to serve another after he understands bu- 
siness himself. When the young weaver has finished his appren- 
ticeship, and acquired as much free stock as will purchase a loom, 
furnish a room, and defray the expense of a wedding, he scorns to 
be a journeyman ; but sets up for himself, marries a wife, and be- 
comes the father of a family." The weavers commonly train 
their sons to their own occupation ; the boys are set to the loom 
at a very early age ; their apprenticeships are short; and, by the 
time they are fifteen or sixteen years old, they are as expert at 
their business, and able to earn as much as their fathers are 
themselves. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— There are, as already stated, about 3S00 impe- 
rial acres in the parish, quoad sacra ; and these are either planted 
or cultivated, with the exception of about 60 acres, which are in 
course of cultivation, and the ground occupied by the streets and 
houses in the village. The plantations may cover 550 acres, ex- 
clusive of about 10 acres of coppice, and the trees are generally 
a mixture of different kinds, many of them intended more for or- 
nament than use. They are usually interspersed with firs, as 
nurses for the hard-wood, and the nurses are removed, as soon as 
they are fit for palings, to leave room for the ornamental trees to 
grow. 

There are few sheep kept, except by the proprietors for their 
own use, and by the butchers for the use of the public. Any 
oxen which are grazed are merely put into condition for the 
home consumption, or for the south country market; and this 
kind of stock may be changed two or three times in the course of 
a season. But it is important to remark, that Crieff enjoys pecu- 
liar advantages in regard to butcher meat. Not less than 1500

heads of cattle are annually fed by the different distillers within 
five or six miles round us. The best beef may thus be command- 
ed at a marketable price; and, while the mutton of this district 
has always been accounted superior, there is no part of the country 
where a more regular or better supply of both can be had, at alL 

seasons of the year. . 

The black-cattle are commonly crosses between the Uunlop, 
and the Highland or Teeswater breeds. The farmers have paid 
particular attention to the improvement of their stock; and there 
are few districts in Scotland where a comparison in this respect 
would not be creditable to them. The breed of horses has been 
greatly improved of late years by the exertions of the Agricultural 
Society ; and Strathearn might now compete successfully with the 
south of Scotland. 

Husbandry.— The husbandry is of the most improved kind, by 
alternate white and green crops ; and particularly by allowing the 
land to remain long under grass. Draining, too, has been brought 
to great perfection throughout the parish, and deep or trench 
ploughing is likely soon to become very general. Colonel Graeme, 
of Inchbrakie, has drained and trench-ploughed the whole of his 
home farm; and he has likewise completed about ten acres of 
flooded meadow. Mr M'Laurin of the Broich has also been in 
the habit of ploughing his parks very deep, after they have been 
pastured for a considerable time ; and he has practised irrigation 
successfully for many years. The farming at Inchbrakie is thus 
described by the enterprising proprietor himself, who has obliging- 
ly favoured us with the following remarks : " The fields are drain- 
ed five feet deep. The drains are filled with small round stones 
to within twenty -two inches of the top, and covered with the earth 
formerly cast up. In trench ploughing, the common plough drawn 
by two horses and two oxen is followed by the trench plough, 
drawn by four oxen and two horses, and making a furrow eigh- 
teen inches deep ; the ground is then cross-ploughed to the same 
depth, and in the same manner ; and, after the large stones have 
been blown with gunpowder, and removed, together with the small 
ones, which should be done with as little delay as possible, it is 
then harrowed, rolled, limed with forty bolls of shells, which are 
ploughed in with the small plough to the depth of six inches, and 

 Great care and attention are necessary, in order to flood meadows properly. If 
the drains or conduits be not well and skilfully managed, the thing is sure to fail ; 
and, if the necessary processes be neglected or delayed, beyond the proper time in 
spiing, success cannot be reasonably expected. 



510

followed with such a rotation of crops as may be deemed expedient 
for the space of six years. On the expiry of this term, the next 
stratum, or bed of earth, is ploughed up other six inches, making 
a furrow of twelve inches deep, and the ground undergoes the same 
process as before with the exception of the liming during the next 
six years. At the end of the twelve years, the last stratum, or bed 
of earth, is to be taken up and treated in the same manner, for 
the third period of six years. And, at the conclusion of the eigh- 
teen years, it will probably be expedient to give a half-liming for 
the nineteenth year, and so on ; but this time must try. A con- 
venient portion of land should be let out in perpetual grass, after 
it has gone through the routine above specified, with a view to be- 
nefit the tenant, who is prevented, by the present system, from 
having the use of the grass for more than two or three years, and 
thus from having the advantage which arises from grass parks." 
By the foregoing mode of procedure, Inchbrakie has converted 
what was once comparatively an unproductive place into a perfect 
garden ; and it is only a specimen of what might be still more 
common than it is, if trench-ploughing were better understood, and 
more generally practised, by all those farmers who are likely to de~ 
rive benefit from its introduction. 

Leases, Sfc. — The duration of leases is nineteen years. The farm 
buildings are almost all good, and generally covered with slate. 
The enclosures are also well kept, and fences of every description 
are maintained in proper repair. 

The superior state of the roads ought not to be passed over with- 
out a special commendation. The praise of this is certainly due 
to the late Sir Patrick Murray, Bart, of Ochtertyre, to whose pub- 
lic spirit, Strathearn chiefly owes this, as well as many other pri- 
vileges. Still, the great expense at which coal and lime are pro- 
cured, is certainly a bar both to agricultural and commercial ad- 
vancement. 

Quarries, c. — There are five freestone quarries, which are or 
have been worked by the proprietors, and sold to the public. They 
are composed of a gritty kind of sandstone, which varies consider- 
ably both in hardness and durability. The stones that have hi- 
therto been taken out, are not of first rate quality ; but there is 
no doubt that the Crieff quarries contain as good materials as any 
in the neighbourhood, and that stones and flags, admitting of a re- 
markably fine polish, might be obtained if the veins were worked 
to a sufficient depth.

Fisheries. The fisheries are never let, though the principal 

heritorshave the right of catching fish with arks, nets, gullets, cruives, 
and other instruments, secured to them by their charters. Nets 
are still sometimes employed on the lochs by the proprietors ; and 
cruives are also in existence on the Earn, in the neighbouring pa- 
rishes of Muthill and Trinity-Gask. But, with the exception of 
set lines, the rod is. the only implement that is used in this 
parish for the rivers ; and the public are permitted to use it, during 
the proper season, as often as they are disposed to avail them- 
selves of the privilege. 

Raw Produce, Sfc. — It would be extremely difficult to arrive at 
any thing like a correct estimate of the average gross amount of 
raw produce raised in the parish. An approximation might be 
made to the value of what is raised in the different farms ; but the 
acres, pecks, and garden, are so numerous and so varied in their 
productions, that the labour necessary to form a tolerably accurate 
guess of what they may be likely to produce, would not be war- 
ranted by any practical good that could arise from a knowledge of 
the result. Suffice it to say that, with the exception of a few 
farms, the soil is not adapted for wheat ; but it produces excellent 
oats and barley, and it is particularly adapted for green crops, 
especially potatoes and turnips. The potatoes which are raised 
here may compare with those which are produced in any of the 
neighbouring counties. The great demand that has of late years 
been made for them in the London market has given a stimulus 
to their production ; and the growing crops are often sold at from 
L.12 to L.15 the acre.

Manufactures. — It is stated in the former Statistical Account, 
that, previous to the year 1792, the manufactures had had little 
effect on the population, in comparison of what they would soon 
be found to produce. But when we compare the statement which 
was then made with the present condition of the manufacturing 
interest, we do not feel ourselves warranted in saying that the

 Our remarks on the manufactures of Crieff are to be understood, as referring 
to the period immediately preceding the late stagnation of trade. 



CRIEF F.

writer's ideas have hitherto, at least, been realized. The inland 
situation of the place ; its distance from every sea-port ; and the 
great expense of land carriage, have, doubtless, had a very con- 
siderable effect in checking the progress of manufacture, and in 
preventing speculators from making Crieff' the field of their commer- 
cial enterprises ; and yet, notwithstanding all this, it is on its manu- 
factures that it may be said principally to depend. The most nume- 
rous class, beyond all question, is the hand-loom weavers ; and the 
trade which they are the means of carrying on with Glasgow is 
the most extensive in the town. There are about half-a-dozen in- 
dividuals, commissioned by different houses in Glasgow, who give 
out cotton yarns to the weavers, to be converted into cloth, and to 
be paid for at so much per web of 180 yards, -f There are above 
360 looms regularly employed at this work, and producing checks 
and handkerchiefs. The average value of the yarn that has been 
annually brought to Crieff from Glasgow for a number of years 
back, is computed, by a very intelligent and experienced manu- 
facturer, at between L. 15,000 and L. 16,000 ; the average 
value of the same when converted into cloth, at between L. 18,000 
and L. 20,000 ; and the average number of webs produced in the 
year, at about 5200. There are others who are employed in 
weaving linen cloths and worsted stuffs ; but, with the exception 
of those who are engaged in one manufactory, they are almost en- 
tirely confined to articles of home consumption, — so that cotton 
yarns may be said to be the staple commodity by which the weav- 
ing trade of Crieff is supported. The manufactory alluded to has 
been lately erected on the banks of the Turret, and is confined 
entirely to woollen goods. The business is extensively carried on 
in all its branches, embracing the manufacture of blankets, plaid- 
ing, shawls, and different kinds of coloured work, from the raw 
material. It has the advantage of a plentiful supply of water ; 
and all the processes, except dyeing, weaving, bleaching, &amp;c. are 
performed by machinery. It requires about forty work-people to 
keep the mill in full play. They work eleven hours a-day, and 
six days a-week ; and their wages are as follows :— weavers, from 
10s. to 15s. per week; spinners, from 12s. to 15s. per week; and 
children from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per week. It is considered a very 
wholesome occupation ; and children, in particular, who enter in a

delicate state of health, are often found in a short time to forget 

all their ailments. 

Of the three tan-works now in operation, two belong to one es- 
tablishment, which does business on a very extensive scale. It 
emplovs more men, perhaps, in the processes of tanning and 
leather-dressing, and produces more leather, than any similar ma- 
nufactory in the county, and its business appears to be daily ex- 
tending. The corn, flour, and barley mills, wh.ch are all m the 
hands of one individual are likewise on an extensive scale, and the 
produce is chiefly sold at the Glasgow and Dundee markets. 1 here 
are two licensed victuallers; 2 distillers ; and 5 malt barns at pre- 
sent working. The grain malted may be computed at 120 quar- 
ters per week, and it is consumed in making spirits from malt only. 
The quantity of spirits produced is variable ; but at present, it 
may be stated at about 1400 gallons weekly. The quality is con- 
sidered very good ; and the greater part of it is exported, and sold 
in the English markets. , 

Crieff is the seat of the periodical excise collections for the dis- 
trict The following excise returns for the year ending January 
1836 relate exclusively to Crieff, viz. . licensed venders of ardent 
spirits, 48; gallons sold out of stock by permit, 2056 ; ; gallons 
retailed 14,622 ; revenue arising from duties on malt U 5244, 
12s. 10d. ; and revenue arising from the duty on distillation 

L. 7331 10s. lid. 

The oil-mill appears to have constant employment, and must 
produce a considerable quantity ; but the two other oil-mills 
spoken of in the former Statistical Account, have long ago ceased 
to exist The same thing is true of the paper-mill, the two mills 
for carding and spinning cotton, and the extensive bleachfields 
with suitable machinery, which were then in operation. And, 
though some females are still employed in what is called tam- 
bouring, the manufactory which was established in Crieff for this 
purpose in 1792, and which gave employment to 30 girls from 
eight to twelve years of age, is also not in existence. 

Tambouring, sowing plain and figured muslins, and filling 
the weaver's pirns, are the most common occupations of those 
industrious females in humble life that reside in town ; and 
those who are so employed are seldom able, in their old age, 
to do any thing more than earn a partial provision-the re- 
sidue being made up either by the public chanties, or else by 
the private benevolence of the parish. Within the last two 
years, a manufacturing establishment was dissolved, by the part-

ners retiring from business, which had given regular employ- 
ment to many of the inhabitants, and particularly to poor women, 
during the space of eighteen years, and which paid the average 
sum of L. 60 a-week in wages. The dissolution of this partner- 
ship was a great loss to many a poor person in Crieff. 

Agricultural Society. — The Strathearn Agricultural Society was 
instituted on the 6th December 1809, by the late Sir Patrick Mur- 
ray, Bart, of Ochtertyre, for the improvement of stock, farm-pro- 
duce of all kinds, and other agricultural purposes ; and it includes 
a district of ten parishes in the upper part of Strathearn. At its 
first institution, and for some years afterwards, the meetings of the 
society were well attended, both by the principal resident heritors, 
and by their tenantry. But the former became gradually more 
and more remiss in their attendance, and the latter seceded from 
it, owing to the neglect of the former, and to the depression in the 
value of agricultural produce, which took place about the year 1815, 
and which has continued ever since. From these circumstances, 
the Strathearn Agricultural Society had fallen into a state of such 
abeyance that it was found necessary, either to break it up alto- 
gether, or to remodel it upon a scale much less comprehensive than 
that upon which it had been originally framed. And accordingly, 
on the 27th March 1834, it received a new constitution, and was 
subjected to new rules, by which its transactions are still carried on. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Town. — There is no other market-town and no other village in 
the parish, than Crieff itself, and the population of the landward 
part of the parish bears no proportion to that of the town. The po- 
pulation of the town amounted in 1776 to 1532 ; in 1792 to 2071 ; 
in 1827 to 3700; and in 1835 to 3835. The trade of Crieff 
is principally carried on with Glasgow ; though mercantile con- 
nexions are maintained with Edinburgh, Perth, Stirling, Dundee, 
and several towns in England. And some idea may be formed of 
the home consumption of different commodities from the circum- 
stance, that employment is given to not fewer than 7 bakers, 3 
bankers, 8 blacksmiths, 12 butchers, 7 carriers, 21 carters, 10 
dress-makers, 37 grocers, 10 haberdashers and cloth shops, 6 
medical men, 17 shoemakers and shoe shops, 16 tailors masters, 
and 8 writers. 

But though there is no lack of tradesmen, and professional per- 
sons of every description, it is different with the representatives of 
civil authority. It is very true, as we have already stated, that a 
baron-bailie — we should have said that three baron bailies — are

nominally vested by the superiors with all that now remains of that 
formidable power, that was so rigorously exercised by the higher 
vassals of the crown in former days ; but the exercise of their 
power is little more than nominal. It is also true that a Justice 
of Peace Court is regularly held on the first Monday of every 
month for the settlement of small debts, and the punishment of 
minor offences ; but there are many irregularities of which no cog- 
nizance is taken, and which it would be much better to prevent 
than to punish. And it is likewise true, that there is a most re- 
spectable committee, who are appointed by the Right Honourable 
Lord and Lady Willoughby de Eresby, and their bailie, who take 
charge of the public affairs of the town, and who are sometimes 
denominated the town-council ; but there is no regular magistracy, 
—no properly constituted civil authority,— and with the excep- 
tion of one individual, who is employed by the committee, and 
left to discharge, as he best can, a duty for which a considerable 
number would be necessary, no police at all. This desideratum 
is likely to be soon supplied, for Crieff is one of those places for 
which the Legislature intend to provide a regular magistracy. And 
it is to be hoped that a regular police will be considered as an in- 
dispensable appendage. 

Means of Communication.— Crieff is a post-town ; and the gross 
annual revenue derivable from the Crieff post-office, on an ave- 
rage of the last three years, may be stated at L. 740. The 
public roads in the parish and neighbourhood are excellent. 
The Tay-Bridge Road, through Glenalmond, is perhaps the 
finest specimen of hill-country road-making in the whole country. 
And, besides the mail, a stage-coach passes and repasses be- 
tween Perth and Stirling every lawful day, while an arrangement 
is made for conveying the passengers to Glasgow by the Canal. 
There is also a coach from Crieff to Edinburgh, by Gleneagles, 
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday ; and it returns from Edin- 
burgh to Crieff on the alternate days. Three carriers leave this 
for Glasgow, and two for Edinburgh, the one by Stirling and 
the othe°r by Dunfermline, every week. Two carriers leave for 
Perth twice every week. And weekly carriers come from Comrie, 
Killin, and Aberfeldy. 

" The rivers are all furnished with stone bridges, generally 
built by the voluntary contributions of the country. That of Crieff 
was the second stone bridge ever thrown over the Earn. It con- 
sists of four large arches ; and was built out of the vacant stipend 



CRIEFF. 



517 



of the parish, in the interval between the suppression of Episco- 
pacy in 1690, and the readmission of a Presbyterian minister in 
1699."  One of the arches — the farthest south — was broken 
down by the Highlanders in the year 1715, to arrest the progress 
of the Royalist forces. It was afterwards rebuilt ; but the frame 
that was used, must have been one which had been employed in 
constructing some other bridge, — for the new arch is somewhat 
higher, and not quite in keeping with the remaining arches of the 
Crieff Bridge. 

There is neither a canal nor a rail-road in the parish, but sur- 
veys have been made for both. In the year 1806, a survey was 
made by the late Sir John Rennie, at the expense of the late 
Marquis of Breadalbane, for a canal between Perth and Lochearn. 
It was supposed that twenty-six locks would be required ; and of 
these there were to be only six below the town of Crieff. Another 
survey was made last year, at the expense of some private indi- 
viduals, by the Messrs Stevenson, for a railway between Perth and 
Crieff. The lines selected by . both surveyors were nearly the 
same ; and though a canal be now out of the question, there is 
reason to hope that the railway may be laid out at no very distant 
period. It would be difficult to find a more level country ; and, 
while the want of minerals is the only drawback, the advantages 
that would result from a railway to the whole community, but es- 
pecially to the landed interests, are very great. 

A gas manufactory for Crieff was projected last year ; and some 
steps were taken with a view to obtain a site a and open subscrip- 
tions; but the matter has been allowed to drop. 

Ecclesiastical State. — " John Drummond was minister of Crieff 
from 1699 to 1755. In his time none separated from the church 
who had been previously of the Establishment ; but a number still 
adhered to the Episcopal mode of worship, whose forefathers, in 
the preceding century, had, in conformity to the wishes of the 
Court, embraced Episcopacy. During the incumbency of Thomas 
Stewart, his immediate successor, about the year 1763, the se- 
ceders of the class of Antiburghers formed there a congregation. 
Next in succession was" Mr Robert Stirling, "admitted in 1770. 
In his time arose the sect called Bereans, whose founder had been 
a private tutor in the parish, and formed some of his relations and 
connexions there into a party. The sect of Relief also was in- 
troduced there about the year 1785, though a ferment excited by 

" Old Statistical Account, p. 585.

the settlement of a minister on a reluctant congregation in the 
neighbourhood." After the death of Mr Stirling, which occur- 
red on the 16th December 1813, the right of patronage appears 
to have been claimed by the Crown ; and two presentations were 
accordingly laid on the table of the presbytery in one day, viz. one 
in favour of Mr Alexander Maxtone, now minister of Foulis 
Wester, which was issued by the Crown ; and another in favour 
of Mr Alexander M'Intyre, which was issued by the Honourable 
Miss Drummond of Perth — now the Right Honourable Lady 
Willoughby de Eresby, whose right had hitherto been undisputed. 
The question was settled in favour of the claims of the latter ; Mr 
M'Intyre's presentation was, in consequence, sustained by the 
presbytery, and the usual steps taken with a view to his settle- 
ment. But, as he encountered a very strong opposition from the 
people at the moderation of his call, the matter was referred to 
the synod for advice, and instructions were given by the court, that 
a second call should be moderated in. This was done without 
being followed by any satisfactory consequences ; and the call was 
again carried to the synod, when it was decided that the presentee 
should be rejected, and that intimation thereof should be trans- 
mitted to the proper quarter. Against this decision Mr M'Intyre 
protested, and appealed to the ensuing General Assembly, where 
the judgment of the synod was reversed, and a decision given, ap- 
pointing that the presentee should be ordained with all convenient 
speed, according to the rules of the church. The ordination took 
place in the midst of uncommon excitement and demonstrations 
of hostility. But the unhappy minister, whose health had by this 
time begun visibly to decline, almost immediately engaged the 
services of an assistant, and went to the south of England, where 
he died very soon after. He was succeeded by the present incum- 
bent, who was ordained in the year 1816. 

The parish church is conveniently situated in the town of Crieff, 
and is not more than three miles distant from the farthest bound- 
ary of the parish. It was built in the year 1786, and repaired in 
the year 1827, at the joint expense of the heritors and old feuars, 
the former paying in proportion to their valued, and the latter in 
proportion to their real rents. It affords accommodation for 966 
persons, allowing 18 inches to each sitter, and as the seats are al- 
located according to the same rule by which the church was built, 
the old feuars have obtained a right to about three-fourths of the 
whole accommodation. The heritors in general retain their sit-

tings for their own use or for that of their tenants; but the feuars 
let as many as they do not themselves require ; and during the 
last five years, the prices of sittings have ranged from 2s. to 5s. 
each. There are no free sittings provided for the poor, with the 
exception of a few that are gifted by Lady Baird Preston, of Fern- 
tower ; but there are temporary forms and stools in the different 
passages, which the poor have procured for their own accommo- 
dation. Divine service is generally very well attended in the pa- 
rish church. 

The manse, which is very inconveniently situated at the distance 
of more than a mile from the town, was built and declared a free 
manse in 1701, and frequently repaired since that time. It is 
now in any thing but a comfortable condition, and whenever a new 
one may be considered necessary, a more eligible situation should 
be chosen. 

The glebe contains about eight acres imperial ; it may be worth 
about L. 10 annually, and the stipend, which arises principally from 
teinds, averages L. 175 per annum. There are ten chalders, 
two-thirds of which are oatmeal, and one-third barley, with 
L. 48 in money. The teinds are exhausted. 

There is no other place of worship in connexion with the Church 
of Scotland ; but the new church will be finished by-and-bye, 
and will afford ample accommodation to all classes of the inhabi- 
tants, who are at present destitute of it. The General Assem- 
bly's jChurch Extension Committee have voted a most liberal 
grant of money towards its erection. 

An assistant minister has been employed and paid by the heri- 
tors and parishioners for many years, who has shared the labours 
of the pulpit with the minister, and aided him in the discharge of 

 The want of church accommodation in Crieff has for years been a subject of re- 
gret to many of the inhabitants. As far back as the year 1822, a public meeting of 
the feuars under Lord and Lady Gwydir, called by order of the baron bailie upon 
the estate of Perth, deemed it to be their indispensable duty to submit the 
urgency of their claim for an additional church and minister in Crieff, to Dr John 
Inglis, convener of the Government Committee for the erection of new churches and 
endowments in Scotland." They grounded this urgent claim upon the facts that, in 
181 1, the census of the town and parish of Crieff was about 3:}00 ; that in 1821, it 
was 4216; and that the population was then rapidly increasing. An application 
was accordingly made in due form by the Managing Committee for obtaining a grant 
from Government, and an answer was returned by Dr Inglis, which is engrossed in 
the Committee's minutes, and which is represented as being as favourable as could be 
expected. The matter, however, was allowed to drop. On looking over the list of 
the Committee at that time, we find the names of several individuals who are not only 
unable now to discover any need of additional church accommodation in this parish, 
but who are entirely opposed to ecclesiastical endowments and establishments of re- 
ligion altogether.

some of the other duties of a parish which is much too large for 
any one man pastorally to superintend. 

There are three Dissenting or Seceding chapels in the parish, 
exclusive of a Popish one, viz. the United Secession, the Relief, 
and the Original Seceders. The ministers of the two former are 
paid by the voluntary contributions of their people ; and at the 
rates of L. 105 and L. 94 per annum respectively, with allowances 
for sacramental expenses. The Original Seceders have no stated 
minister; and the Priest who died lately has hitherto had no succes- 
sor. There are some adherents belonging to other denominations, 
who have no place of worship, and no minister in Crieff, but their 
designations and their numbers may be gathered from the follow- 
ing abstract of a survey of the parish, quoad sacra, which was made 
by the kirk-session in the year 1835.

The only Association for religious purposes is the Bible Society, 
which promotes the circulation of the Scriptures without note or 
comment. Since the period of the Apocrypha controversy, an an- 
nual collection in the parish church, towards which the Original 
Seceders cheerfully contribute, forms the principal source of re- 
venue; and the average sum of L. 9, 18s. 8d. has been annually 
realized. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is 15, 
viz. one parochial school, taught by one male teacher ; an infant 
or juvenile school, taught by one male teacher ; three schools on 
the teachers' own adventure, taught by males ; six schools on the 
teachers' own adventure, taught by females ; four Sabbath even-

ing schools ; and a Tuesday evening class, for the religious in- 
struction of grown up young men and young women. 

The Sabbath evening schools have been in operation for a con- 
siderable number of years, and they have doubtless been a great 
blessing to the parish. Crieff has enjoyed the benefit of having 
one or more of them for nearly half-a-century. And they are in 
general well attended, though the numbers have varied according 
to circumstances. The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum 
salary of L. 34, 4s. 4d. per annum, and the full amount of ac- 
commodation allowed by law. The other teachers have nothing 
but their school fees to depend upon. 

We have not been able to ascertain the exact numbers of those 
who cannot read or write. There are various circumstances which 
combine to render the inquiry a difficult one ; but the nearest ap- 
proximation which the members of session have been able to make 
is as follows : viz. between six and fifteen years of age, who can- 
not read, 18; between ten and fifteen years of age who cannot 
write, 29 ; above fifteen years of age who cannot read, 41. 

The people in general are much alive to the benefit of educa- 
tion, and there are few who do not contrive to send their children 
to school, during a longer or a shorter period. But many of them 
are not able to keep them there a sufficient time ; others are un- 
able to pay the fees for those whom they do send ; and the con- 
sequence is, that the teachers, who are ill able to afford it, are losers 
to a considerable amount. The managers of the Sabbath even- 
ing schools were in the habit some years ago, of sending a number 
of poor children to the week-day schools ; but they soon found 
themselves involved in such pecuniary difficulties, that they were 
reluctantly compelled to relinquish the practice, and some bene- 
volent private individuals are still pursuing the same course ; but 
there are many whom private benevolence cannot reach, and who 
are in consequence greatly behind in the attainment of that know- 
ledge which it is so desirable that all should possess, and which has 
for so long been the glory of our Scottish peasantry. 

Morison's Bequest. — The late Mr Thomas Morison, builder 
in Edinburgh, who died upwards of eleven years ago, left the bulk 
of his property which was very considerable for the purpose of 
erecting and endowing an academy, where the higher branches of 
education might be taught. There is a preference given in Mr 



 This class has lately been changed to the Sabbath evening. It meets after the 
Sabbath evening schools have been dismissed.

Morison's will to Muthill, the place where he was born, and to 
Edinburgh, the place where he made his fortune ; but his great 
object was to benefit his fellow- creatures : And, accordingly, his 
trustees were vested with the fullest powers to carry this object 
into execution in any way, in any place, and in any form which they 
might deem the most desirable. 

The attempt to find a suitable site in Muthill was unsuccessful, 
and Crieff was then fixed upon as an eligible situation. Negocia- 
tions were entered into with a view to purchase ground and, at 
one time, they appeared to be all but completed. But somehow, the 
affair miscarried, and the plan was relinquished altogether. Theat- 
tention of the trustees was next directed to Inverness, where they do 
not appear to have come to any arrangement; and the result seems to 
be, that hitherto Mr Morison's bequest has produced none of those 
fruits which the testator was so very anxious to realize. The re- 
spectability of the gentlemen who are still entrusted with the ma- 
nagement of this legacy is such, however, that it will doubtless be 
a guarantee to the public for its being managed well. It is sup- 
posed that the fund cannot now be much under L. 20,000. 

Literature. — There is a subscription library in Crieff, which 
contains about 900 volumes on general literature, and from which 
books are regularly lent out to the subscribers twice every week. 
There is a circulating library, kept by one of the two booksellers 
in town, which contains a pretty extensive collection of those books 
that are usually found in such libraries. There is a small Sab- 
bath evening school library, which consists entirely of books on 
religious subjects. And there are two public reading-rooms, main- 
tained by subscription, where many of the Scotch and English 
newspapers are regularly taken in. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — The most important chari- 
table institution in the parish is the Crieff Female Society. It was 
instituted on the 9th March 1818, principally through the exer- 
tions of Lady Baird of Ferntower, who has always been its Presi- 
dent, and the most liberal of its supporters, for the purpose ofal- 

 The Subscription Library was instituted in the year 1818, when scveial regula- 
tions were framed and printed, office-bearers appointed, and a committee formed for 
purchasing books and managing other matters. The printed catalogue bears that 
many books have been presented to the library by private individuals, and that the 
library of the Strathearn Agricultural Society which contained between 200 and 300 
volumes, of which the greatest number had been gifted to that Society by Sir Patrick 
Murray, Bart, of Ochtertyre, was transferred to the Crieff subscription library in 
the year 1819. But the Agricultural Society have reserved to themselves the right 
of again recalling their books, in certain events, and on certain conditions set forth 
in the minutes of their meetings on the subject.

leviating the miseries of the sick, aged, and indigent in the town 
and parish of Crieff, especially the most deserving of them ; and 
it has since continued in active operation, doing much good 
in a district where the poor are proverbially numerous. We can- 
not afford the space that would be necessary to give a full de- 
tail of the history, means, and management of this society. But 
we may state, in general, that it commenced under the distinguish- 
ed auspices of many of the ladies of upper Strathearn ; that its be- 
nefactions are ordinarily distributed in the shape of meal, coals, 
and clothing; that the average number of those who receive 
monthly aid from its funds is between 80 and 90; and that 
the average annual expenditure exceeds L. 100. It is suported 
by private subscriptions, donations, and public collections ; and the 
gross amount collected in the parish church in its behalf is about 
L. 500. 

Friendly Societies. — Not many years ago there were twelve 
friendly societies in Crieff, but four of them have been dissolved. 
Those now in operation are the Masons', Weavers', Shoemakers', 
Gardeners', Hammermens', Fax-Dressers', Ploughmens', and Pa- 
triotic Societies. Those dissolved are the Tailors', Joiners'', Strath- 
earn Union, and Friendly Societies. The Masons' Society was in- 
stituted by the Duke of Perth, on the 26th December 1737, and 
their fund is intended for the benefit of the widows and distressed 
members of the corporation. The weavers formed themselves into 
a corporation in the year 1770, and began to establish their fund at 
the same period. And the other societies have risen successively 
since that time, following the example which was set by the ma- 
sons and the weavers. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — 1. Average number of person re- 
ceiving parochial aid, exclusive of four lunatics, who are supported 
at the Perth asylum, 1 1 1 ; 2. average sum allowed to each from the 
funds of the kirk-session per month of four weeks, 2s. 4d. ; 3. an- 
nual amount of collections at the church doors, on an average of 
the three years ending February 1 837, L. 88, 5s. Of d ; 4. annual 
amount arising from proclamations of bans, on an average of the 
same three years, L. 10, lis. 4d. ; 5. ditto arising from bills and in- 
terest, on an average of the same three years, L. 14, 6s. 8d. ; 6. 
ditto arising from donations, on an average of the same three 
years, L. 9, 4s. lid.; 7. ditto arising from mortcloths, on an ave- 
rage of the same three years, L. 8, 0s. 6|d. 

In the year 1819, the heritors agreed to assess themselves vo- 



524 



PERTHSHIRE. 



luntarily in a sum equal in amount to what is collected at the church 
doors ; this agreement was fully implemented for a conside- 
rable number of years, and a majority of the heritors are still 
found to adhere to it. But some have withdrawn ; others have 
allowed themselves to fall into arrears, which they decline paying 
up ; others again are dissatisfied with a system, which permits some 
to go free while the rest are submitting to the burden, and they 
make the payment of all arrears the condition on which they will 
continue to abide by the compact ; and the probability, therefore, 
is, that the parish of Crieff is, at this moment, on the verge of a 
legal assessment for the poor. 

The average value of the monthly allowance granted to each 
of those who are receiving aid from the funds of the Female So- 
ciety, may amount to Is. 1 ld. But a very imperfect idea would 
be formed of what is actually done for the poor of Crieff, if pri- 
vate charity were not taken into account. They obtain a great 
deal themselves, both in the town and country, by private beg- 
ging. They have the privilege of going about, if they be re- 
sident, from house to house, and many householders have a list 
of poor whom they regularly serve, once in the week, in the 
fortnight, or in the month, as it may suit their convenience. 
The Right Honourable Lord and Lady Willoughby De Eresby 
are in the habit of distributing clothes, coals, and meal, at stated 
periods, to the poor who are resident in that part of the town 
of which his Lordship is superior. — Lady Baird Preston of Fern- 
tower, and Miss Preston, are also very liberal in this way and 
in many others. They support a soup-kitchen, where a portion 
of excellent broth is regularly dealt out, three times a week, 
and coals once a month, to each of 60 individuals. They 
have many pensioners who receive weekly allowances in money. 
And the extra donations, which were received in the course of last 
winter, added greatly to the comfort of the poor during a season of 
peculiar distress and severity. The family of Ochtertyre have, 
for many years, been steady friends to the destitute in Crieff. And 
it would not be an easy task to enumerate the whole of what is 
done for alleviating the poverty of the parish. 

With regard to the feelings of the poor themselves, it is believ- 
ed that some of them, — and these perhaps not the least destitute, — 
do refrain from asking parochial relief, because they think it de- 
grading. But the feeling does not appear to be, by any means, a 
general one : on the contrary, that spirit of independence, which 



CRIEFF. 



525 



was once so characteristic of our Scottish population, has now great- 
ly declined; and, in as far as paupers. are concerned at least, it is 
in some danger of being entirely lost. 

Prisons. — There is a jail, to which we have formerly alluded as 
having been erected in the year 1665. It is still used as a place 
of temporary imprisonment, till the offenders are otherwise dispos- 
ed of by the proper authorities. It is seldom that any one is con- 
fined in it longer than a single night. And it might perhaps be 
prejudicial to the health of the inmates, if they were kept there 
for a much longer period. It is abundantly secure for all the pur- 
poses required. 

Fairs. — There is a weekly market every Thursday, principal- 
ly for the accommodation of the neighbouring farmers ; and ori- 
ginally there were three annual fairs, viz. St Thomas', which was 
formerly held on new year's day ; — Douchlage, which was held on 
the third Tuesday of June O. S. ; and Michaelmas, which was by 
far the most considerable, and which was held on the 10th of Oc- 
tober. But as Crieff occupies a central situation, and as Lord 
Willoughby has granted a commodious stance, it has been found 
expedient to transfer the markets that previously belonged to the 
neighbouring parishes, to this place. Nine annual fairs are now 
held at Crieff, and they are arranged as follows : St Thomas', held 
on the first Thursday of January ; Strowan do. third Thursday of 
February ; Big Thursday do. second Thursday of March ; Lady 
do. first Thursday of April ; Turret do. first Thursday of June ; 
Douchlage do. last Thursday of June ; Monivaird do. second Thurs- 
day of July ; Monzie do. third Thursday of August ; Michaelmas 
do. Thursday immediately preceding the October Falkirk Tryst. 
These fairs are intended for the sale of cattle, farm produce and 
utensils of every description. 

In former days the principal fairs at Crieff were opened with 
considerable pomp by the Duke of Perth in person. He held his 
court often in the open air in the morning, with a view to make 
the necessary arrangements, settle differences, and provide against 
the commission of outrages among the community. He after- 
wards rode through the market at the head of his guard, and pro- 
claimed his titles at the different marches or boundaries of his pro- 
perty. Many of the feuars are bound by their charters to provide 
a given number of the halbert-men that composed the guard at 
the fairs ; and it is not many years since their services were dis- 
pensed with. 

 The halberts are presened in the armoury at Drummond Castle. 



526 



FKRTHSHIRH. 



The regulation and management of the fairs are now entrusted 
to the committee formerly mentioned who have the charge of the 
town's affairs ; and the public funds of the town are principally 
derived from the grass upon the bleaching green, the public weights, 
and the rates of customs charged upon the different articles, and 
subjects that are exposed for sale during any of the market days. 

Inns, Alehouses, &amp;fc. — There is one principal inn — the Drum- 
mond Arms, which is much frequented, particularly in the sum- 
mer and autumn, and which is generally approved of by travel- 
lers for the superior accommodation, which it affords. Of the 
48 spirit licenses, which we have already mentioned as grant- 
ed, in the parish, by the Justices, a large proportion is held by 
the occupiers of alehouses. Their effects on the morals of 
the people here, as well as in every other place, where they are 
equally prevalent, are injurious in a very high degree ; and the 
half of them might be swept away with great advantage to the best 
interests of the community. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used by the richer classes is coal — though 
peeled oak is occasionally burnt by them ; and it is calculated that 
the average value of the coals that come weekly, from Bannoek- 
burn, Dollar, &amp;c. to the Crieff market, may amount to L. 50. The 
price generally ranges between 8d. and Is. 2d. per cwt. ; — but, 
during the last severe winter, it was higher, and averaged Is. 4d. 
per cwt. The poor contrive to buy some coals for themselves, in 
addition to what they receive in charity, and this is perhaps the 
cheapest fuel they can purchase ; but they are not able to obtain 
a constant supply : and we may still say, in the language of the for- 
mer Statistical Account, that " there is nothing that the people, in 
general, feel more than the difficulty of procuring fuel." 

 Lord Willoughby has let a park, in the immediate vicinity of the town, sub- 
ject to the markets being held in it. The rent of the park includes the customs 
realized at the markets, so that the committee do not levy them. But his Lordship 
makes a suitable allowance to the town in lieu of the customs.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF WEEM, SYNOD OF PERTH. 

THE REV. ROBERT MACDONALD, MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish is said, at one period, to have had the name 
of " Cille-Bhrain," i. e. the burial place of Bran, a reputed saint in 
his day, — of whom little, however, is now known, excepting, that a few 
places in the parish, as also, in other districts, bear his name ; as 
" Ath-Bhrain" i. e. St Bran's Ford, upon the river Lyon, near 
the east end of Fortingal, — " Breanamh" i. e. Bran-naomh ' Holy 
Bran's," i. e. burying-ground or cell. 

The modern name is " Feart-a-chill " u e. Fortingall, the 
derivation and etymology of which is involved in considerable ob- 
scurity. The English term would lead us to conclude that the 
name is derived from " Feart Fhionnghail," Fingal's stronghold. 
And the many circular " Forts" of which afterwards in the vici- 
nity, which the uniform tradition of the natives ascribes to the Fin- 
galians, called " Caistealan-nam Fiann" — the castles or strong- 
holds of the Fingalians, support this conclusion. Others Resolve 
the name into " Feart-nan-Gael," the stronghold of the Gael or 
Caledonians, and they fix the date of this name to the period 
when the Romans invaded the country. Situated, however, as 
the parish is, in the south-west corner of the ancient Caledonian 
Forest, it might, not inaptly, have obtained its Gaelic name, from 
" Feart Choille," " the stronghold of the Forest." 

The derivation of the name, as given by my predecessor, Mr 
M'Ara in his report of the parish, from Feart-nan-gall, " the 
works or exploits of strangers," is one to which I am not inclined 
to accede. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The extreme length of the parish from east 
to west is about 40 miles, and extreme breadth from 30 to 35 miles. 
But taking the mean length at 35 miles, and mean breadth at 20, 
the parish will be found to contain 448,000 imperial acres, including 
about 25,600 acres for lakes, &amp;c. It is bounded on the east by 



528 



PEKTriSIIIRE. 



the parish of Dull, the respective parish churches being six miles 
distant ; on the north-east, by that of Blair- Athole, parish churches 
twenty-one miles distant ; on the north, by the parish of Laggan, In- 
verness-shire, churches being forty -one miles distant; on the north- 
west, by the parish of Kilmanivaig, the churches being seventy miles 
distant ; on the west, by the parish of Appin, Argyllshire, churches 
seventy four miles distant; on the south-west, by the parish of Glen - 
orchy, churches distant forty-four miles ; on the south, by the parish- 
es of Kenmore and Killin, the parish churches being distant six and 
sixteen miles respectively ; and also by a detached portion of the pa- 
rish of Weem. The parish thus occupies a very considerable por- 
tion of the north-west corner of the county of Perth, and south-west 
angle of the great Caledonian Forest, as already mentioned. Fol - 
lowing the boundary line in all its indentations and projections, it 
is no less than 130 miles in circumference. 

It may be necessary here to premise that the parish is naturally di- 
vided into three comprehensive districts, viz. Fortingal properly so 
called, Rannoch, and Glenlyon : besides the detached district of 
Bolfracks on the south side of the Tay, distant by the high road 
about ten miles ; — all separated from each other by high hills, rivers, 
and other impediments. 

Mountains. — The mountains and hills connected with the pa- 
rish are almost innumerable. Both on the north and south sides 
it is bordered by high mountains. There is also a high chain of 
mountains, which may be said to belong exclusively to the parish, 
extending its whole length from east to west, and dividing it into 
two grand divisions, and almost into two equal parts, having the dis- 
tricts of Rannoch to the north, and Glenlyon and Fortingal to the 
south. This ridge rests upon a base of about seven miles broad ; 
and many of its mountains considerably exceed 3000 feet above 
the level of the sea. A little detached from this ridge, in the dis- 
trict of Rannoch, is the mountain Sith-chaillinn, conspicuous as 
you enter the country by its towering and commanding summit, — a 
mountain whose name is recorded throughout the scientific world 
as the scene of observations by Dr Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal, 
in 1777. " Sith," by the old Highlanders' interpretation, means 
any hill or mountain disjoined or apart from others, — " Sithain" a 
little round hill, is the diminutive of the term ; — which hill was in- 
variably haunted, as was supposed, by the " Sith-chean" or " da- 
oine sith" " men of peace,"" — whence the name, " Sith-chaillinn " 
given to this hill from its being the supposed place of resort of the

maiden or queen of the fairies. Viewing this lofty mountain from the 
north-west, it appears of a conical figure ; but from the south and 
east, it is the very reverse. It rests upon a long narrow base, ris- 
ing from the east end with a gentle acclivity, the west end and 
both sides being very steep, and here and there covered with a 
surface of stones ; but it is marked on the whole with fewer inequa- 
lities from base to top, than perhaps any mountain of equal magni- 
tude in the Highlands of Perthshire. 

The height of the mountains within or connected with the pa- 
rish, above the level of the sea, may be reckoned nearly as follows ; 
but perfect accuracy is not to be expected.

Besides these, there are many other mountains of considerable 
magnitude, interspersed here and there, which have the effect of 
diversifying the character of the scene. From the top of the hill 
of Comrie, head of Rannoch, there is a very grand and extensive 
prospect. A spectator finds himself situated in the centre of a 
vast amphitheatre, 40 miles by 20. The river Gauir meanders bv, 
and Loch-Rannoch, 12 miles long, with its bosky banks, expands 
below. Of this vast and picturesque amphitheatre, the range of 
mountains which intersects the parish from east to west, and the 
mountains of Glenorchy form the south side — the rugged peaks of 
the " Black mount" and Buachaille Eitibh, the west,— the moun- 
tains of Lochaber and Badenoch, the north-west and north ; —and 
on the east « Sith-chaillin" and " Beinn-a-chualaich" upon opposite 
sides,— rear their summits like vast pillars, as if to guard the only 
seeming ingress to the grand expanse. 

Valleys— Glenlyon. —This district or valley extends in a westerly 
direction from the head of Fortingal, to near the stage-house of Tyn- 
drum, upon the western military road,— a distance of from 32 to 
35 miles. A considerable part of the head of the glen is now 
but thinly peopled, being occupied by extensive sheep-graziers, 
one of whom possesses a tract of upwards of 15 miles in length' 
and numbers above 8000 sheep. The glen is very narrow ; wh a 
may be termed its general level ground by the river's side, being 
seldom above a furlong broad ; and the mountains often encroaching 
so far from opposite sides, as even in some places to confine the

struggling river to a bed of not. much more than eight yards broad. 
It is evident that, at one time, there were several lakes in the 
glen, especially in the lower parts of it ; but as the river, in the 
course of- ages, wore a deeper channel through rocks and emi- 
nences, they disappeared. The only one now remaining is that 
at the head of the glen, " Lochlyon," which is the source of the 
river of that name. To this circumstance may, perhaps, be attri- 
buted the name " Glenlyon," Gleann-Linne, i. e. the glen of the 
lakes, or pools. Others derive the name from " Glen-lighe-amhitinn" 
" the glen of the flooding river," a name highly characteristic. 

Tradition also bears that a battle was fought in this glen be- 
twixt the M c Ivors, the first inhabitants of the glen, after the Finga- 
lians, at which period it was called Gleann-Fasach, " the desert- 
ed Glen," and Stewart of Garth, commonly called the Cuilean 
Curta, i. e. « the fierce wolf," in which the M'lvors were defeat- 
ed, and the few that survived expelled the district ; and that the 
Stewarts, on their return from the pursuit, washed their arms, 
&amp;c. in the river. From the tinge thus given to the water, it 
was called Gleann liarnhuinn, the tinged river. Various places 
in the glen take their names from circumstances connected with 
the battle fought on this occasion, viz. Laggan-a-chatha, " the 
hollow of the battle"— Leachd-nan-cuaran, the stone of the sand- 
als, it being customary for each man, preparatory to the engage- 
ment, to cast off one of his buskins,— so that, on their return, the 
number amissing might be easily ascertained. 

Immediately previous to its assuming its present name, tradition 
bears that it was called Gleann-duibhe, the Glen of the black water : 
—and during the Fingalian period it was called Crom-ghleann-nan- 
clack"— -the crooked glen of the stones ;— not, however, because 
more stony than many other glens in the Highlands, but on ac- 
count of the many circular castles and forts in several parts of the 
olen, built entirely of dry stones : and which the people affirm to 
have been the residences of Fingal and his heroes, — 

Bha da chaisteal dheug aig Fionn 
Ann an Crom-ghleann-nan clach,' — 

" Fingal had twelve castles in the crooked glen of the stones." 

For pasturage, Glenlyon is exceeded by few, if any glens, in the 
Highlands of Perthshire. Its sides are, in general, green to the very 
top°of the mountains. The acclivity of the north side is almost always 
abrupt ; and consequently, the distance to the summit ofthe ridge is 
shorter than on the south side, exceeding in no part five miles, and 
often falling short of- this ; whereas the latter sometimes exceeds six 



rORTINUAL. 



531 



miles Many places of the glen have no sunshine for a long period 
of the winter season : several farm villages are deprived of it from 
the middle of October to the middle of February. 

The dells which branch out from the sides of Glenlyon are 
very numerous : some of them extensive, being upwards of 4 miles 
long; each augmenting the Lyon with its limpid stream, — which 
in time of thaw or rain comes down with irresistible impetuosity. 
One of these streams, Allt-da-ghob, proceeding from a small glen 
of that name, is a fine natural curiosity. When viewed from Chest- 
hill, the opposite side of the river, in a swollen state, it rushes 
from a height of between 400 and 500 feet down a precipice, in- 
to a chasm so deep as to be entirely hid from the eye : it appears 
a second and a third time, bursting over perpendicular rocks, in a 
solid body, and is immediately lost in the bottom of the same, or 
in a similar invisible chasm : and on every successive appearance, 
it bursts again upon the view, as if sprung from the solid rock, or 
bowels of the mountain. Leaving its confinement, it at last gushes 
down a precipice of 200 feet in a sheet as white as snow, till it 
reaches the level ground and joins the Lyon. 

The cascades that dash down everywhere, on the sides of the 
mountains, in a rainy day, are almost innumerable. In a single 
mile, many of these may be seen, — in places where there is no run- 
ning stream at other times, rushing from a height of no less than 
1000 feet high, parallel to each other, till they arrive at the flat 
ground. A stranger, wondering from whence they had their rise, 
would at once conclude that they sprung from the rock, or bowels 
of the mountains, and that he even observed the spot from whence 
each issued forth. 

The upper part of Glenlyon is very elevated: — The lower part 
may be about 100 feet above the level of Lochtay. 

Glenmore. — Situated between Rannoch and Fortino-al, and im- 
mediately to the south of Sith-chaillinn, is a considerable valley of 
this name. At one period, it formed no small portion of the old 
forest of Sith-chaillinn, no trace of which is now remaining, save 
such innumerable roots of trees as the natives were and are yet 
occasionally in the habit of digging from under ground, for fuel 
and light,— the roots of thezr affording a flame which far sur- 
passes the brilliancy of gas.  Numerous trunks of oak are also 
found on such occasions. They are of a blackish colour, and of a

softish texture, but harden on exposure to the air. The country 
people were accustomed to split these and sell them at markets, as 
strakes for scythe-sharpening,— a purpose to which they are found 
well adapted. 

Passing over a great number of minor vales, such as Glen-mul- 
lin, Glen-da-ghob— the vale of Lochs, of Glenlyon, Glenmeran, 
Glen-duibh, Glen-comrie, Glen-sasun, Glen-caillich, we shall now 
advert to that of Fortingal. 

Fortingal— This interesting vale, from which the parish takes 
its name, is about 6 miles long. The river Lyon meanders through 
it. The base or level ground is, for the most part, fully half a mile 
broad. A stranger, stationed at the village of Fortingal, would at 
once fancy there was no ingress or egress from or to the district. 
There are, however, three egresses,— one, on the south to the turn- 
pike road on Loch Tay side, Breadalbane ; a second, to the north- 
west through Glenlyon, by and through the remarkable pass, narrow 
defiles, and romantic scenery of the wood of Chesthill, to which, 
in the opinion of many, the far-famed pass of Killachrankie is, in 
point of defence and security against the incursions of a foreign foe, 
ranked inferior. The third is to the eastward, meeting the Crieff 
and Inverness turnpike road at Coshiville, Appin of Menzies. It 
is a fact worthy of notice, that, except in the detached district 
of Bolfracks, there is not a foot of toll road in this extensive pa- 
rish : yet the country is well accommodated by statute labour roads, 
kept in very good condition. 

Like Glenlyon, Fortingal is surrounded with mountains. Al- 
though not equally calculated with those of Glenlyon to raise 
wonder and awe by their " cloud-capt" summits, their precipitous 
fronts, and foaming torrents, bursting down their deep furrowed 
sides,— still it is a beautiful and naturally a picturesque vale, 
finely sheltered from the northern blast, and adorned with a 
number of gentlemen's seats, viz. that of Major- General Sir Archi- 
bald Campbell of Garth, Bart., the hero of the Burmese war, and 
lately Governor of New Brunswick,— which was formerly the proper- 
ty of Major-General Stewart of Garth, author of " Sketches of 
the Highlands," &amp;c. and late Governor of St Lucia, where he 
died,— a name dear to philanthropy, and never to be mentioned 
but with respect; also that of Mr Menzies of Chesthill, and that of 
Mr Garden Campbell of Troup and Glenlyon ;— all of which are 
embosomed in wood and environed with verdant fields. 

Fortingal is fronted on the south by Druim-Fhinn, Drum- 



FORTINGAL. 



533 



mond Hill, which intercepts from the district the view of Taymouth 
Castle, the seat of the noble Marquess of Breadalbane. From a 
point on the east end of this hill, where a strong fortification is still 
extant, called Dun-mac Tuail, the stronghold or fortress of Tuail, 
a natural son of the King of Denmark, who, as tradition bears, 
figured much in this quarter during the Fingalian period, — there is 
to be seen one of the grandest views imaginable, of the whole dis- 
trict between Killin and Dunkeld. 

Fortingal is bounded on the west by the hills of Culdares, — green 
to the very top ; and by the pass of Chesthill : on the north, by 
Sith-chaillinn and contiguous hills : and on the east, by Appin of 
Menzies ; — forming altogether a grand natural amphitheatre, not 
so extensive, to be sure, as the one to be seen in Rannoch, but, at 
the same time, comprehending as beautiful and fertile a vale as is 
to be met with in any part of the Highlands of Perthshire. 

Bolfrachs. — This is a district of about sixteen ploughs of land, 
the only detached part of the parish, situated on the south side of the 
Tay, and containing a population of nearly 200 souls, who, from 
the distance, are precluded from receiving benefit at their parish 
church, and participate of Gospel ordinances in other parishes, viz. 
Weem, Kenmore, and Dull, from each of which they are some 
miles distant. This population is all connected with the Esta- 
blished Church, two individuals only excepted. 

In this district is an extensive quarry of that beautiful stone, of 
which the splendid edifice Taymouth Castle is built. 

Rannoch — According to some, this name is derived from Rai- 
neach, Ferns ; but, though abounding with this plant, the district is 
not more " ferny" than others. The name is rather to be derived 
from " Rath," water, " Ratheanach" watery — the th being 
silent in the Gaelic term, — a meaning very descriptive of the 
country, especially when Bun-rannoch is covered over with back 
water, which it frequently is during a thaw after a great fall of 
snow on the surrounding mountains. Rannoch then appears as 
if it were one continued sheet of water. We have the term in 
the names of many waters, as Uisge-rath, a considerable stream 
which pours its water into the head of Lochtreig, parish of Kil- 
manivaig;— Caol-rath, a mountain-stream at the head of Bade- 
noch, parish of Laggan ;— also Caol-rath, the sound separating 
the isle of Skye from the main-land. The district of Rannoch 
is collateral, and runs parallel with Glenlyon, extending from 
the northern base of Sith-chaillinn, on the east, in a wester-

ly direction upwards of 30 miles, about 18 miles of which are in- 
terspersed with gentlemen's seats, viz. that of General Robertson 
of Strowan, chief of the clan Robertson, or " Clann Donnachidh" 
as they are called, at Mount Alexander ; a seat of Sir Neil 
Menzies, Bart, of that Ilk, at Rannoch- Lodge, holding a valuable 
property contiguous, consisting of upwards of 70,000 acres Scotch 
measure ; a seat of Lord Grantley's, eldest son of the late Baron 
Norton of the Exchequer, whose name is yet mentioned with every 
mark of respect by the natives ; — that of Stewart of Bunrannoch ; 
that of Messrs Stewart of Crossmount and Lassintullich ; and that of 
Colonel John M'Donald of Dalchosnie, 92d Highland Regiment. 

The breadth of Rannoch from north to south, is in several 
places nearly 20 miles ; the distance from the lake to the top of the 
surrounding mountains, on the north, is from 12 to 13 miles. On 
the south, from 5 to 6 miles — the hilly part is generally a wild 
tract of moors and deep bogs, mostly covered with heath, with here 
and there, in a sequestered glen, by the side of a lake or at the 
foot of a mountain, a green spot, where a number of huts or 
" bothies," called in Scotch shealings, are to be met with, to 
which the natives were, and I believe still are, in some places, in 
the habit of retiring during the summer months, with their cattle 
for pasture, — although the sheep-system has, of late years, a good 
deal superseded this exhilarating and healthy practice. 

At the head of Rannoch, on the estate of Robertson of Strowan, 
there is a tract of flat land upwards of 4 miles square, consisting 
of moss, swamps, and bogs, a wild of little value, affording but an 
indifferent pasturage, even during the summer half-year. The Com- 
missioners upon the forfeited Estates, after 1745-6, observing several 
parts of this tract level or with a gentle slope, thought to convert 
them into arable land, and thus, in their estimation, benefit a country 
where the land capable of cultivation bears a very minute propor- 
tion to the waste ; they accordingly divided a flat of several hun- 
dred acres into four or five portions by deep ditches, digged and 
burnt the moss ; but, after carrying on their labours for several 
seasons, they at last discovered that where nature does little or no- 
thing, art seldom succeeds ; and therefore they were obliged to re- 
linquish the design. The parallel ditches still point out the place, 
and the labours of the Commissioners. 

Caves. — There are several caves in the parish, which do not ap- 
pear to have ever been properly explored ; consequently, little 
is known of their extent and internal structure. Old people point out 



PORTING A L. 



535 



the cliffs and dales where formerly extensive caves existed, capable 
of containing some dozens of men under arms— which can no longer 
be discovered, probably because the earth and sand and even rocks 
have fallen in, and thus for ever closed them up. They were prin- 
cipally formed by nature, but improved by art ; and they were re- 
markable on account of the events of history connected with them, 
and the heroes who, in troublesome times, took shelter in them, — 
such as Gille-Bride, or Bredus of the cave, Sir William Wallace, 
King Robert the Bruce, Ranald Og, chief of Keppoch. This last, a 
firm supporter of the royal cause under Montrose, was, after the de- 
feat at Philiphaugh in 1645, and the butchery at Dunaverty in 1647, 
obliged to seek shelter in the caves of Rannoch, several of which 
bear his name to this day. 

There is a very remarkable cave near the south-west angle of 
Sith-chaillinn, at the " Shealing," called Tom-a-m/wrair, or the 
Earl's eminence. Some miles to the east, there is an opening in 
the face of a rock, which is believed to be the termination thereof. 
Several stories are told and believed by the credulous, relating to 
this cave; — that the inside thereof is full of chambers or separate 
apartments, and that, as soon as a person advances a few yards, he 
comes to a door, which, the moment he enters, closes, as it opened, 
of its own accord, and prevents his returning. 

Leapa-dionadh, or Sheltering Beds. — In several places, there 
occur the caverns known by this name. They do not extend, like 
caves, under ground, — being only hollows under the shelves of 
rocks or precipices where one might rest without being observed, 
and notice any danger or emergency. Several of them bear the 
names of those who, in consequence of having offended the law, or 
flying from some hostile party, betook themselves to these lonely 
retreats. One or two of them may be noticed. In the north 
side of Glencomrie, in the district of Rannoch, in a rocky precipice, 
is Leaba Dhonnacha Dhuibh-a-mlionaidli, i e. the Bed of Black 
Duncan of the Mountain, — a Cameron belonging to that district, 
and one of Prince Charles Edward Stuart's heroes. After the 
battle of Culloden, he often lay concealed in his cavern viewing 
the soldiers in quest of him, passing and repassing at the foot of 
the rock, not more than twenty yards distant from him. This man 
was remarkable for agility and swiftness of foot. While Prince 
Charles was besieging Stirling Castle, Donnacha Dubh was sent 
upon some important business to Fort William. Duncan is said 
to have performed the journey on foot, eighty-eight miles, in one

day, — a task which few pedestrians of this generation, or probably 
of his own, could achieve. 

Another of these sheltering beds is in the face of a hill, on the 
farm of Invervar, Glenlyon. It is 14 feet long, 6 feet broad, and 
4 feet high ; and there is a spring of clear water at the end of it. 
Here, during their cruel proscription, a gentleman of the clan 
Gregor, commonly called Jain Buidhe ruadh, i. e. John of the yel- 
low-reddish hair, concealed himself. He was a man of an extreme- 
ly handsome figure, possessed some lands in Glenlyon, and re- 
sided on the said farm of Invervar. His principal pursuer was 
Campbell of Lawers, whose emissaries, by flattering promises, pre- 
vailed upon M'Gregor's wife to betray him, which she did in the 
following manner : She desired the pursuers to come to the glen, 
and wait in ambush in a certain place all night, and, by keeping an 
eye on the face of the hill upon the north side of the glen about 
sunrise, she would discover to them her husband's hiding place by 
coming out of the cavern, and would walk several times backward 
and forward in front of it. The morning arrived ; — and the sun 
had no sooner illuminated the rugged mountain than the traitress 
performed her promise ; and, upon her husband's remonstrating on 
the impropriety of her conduct, she expressed her hopes that no- 
body, at that early hour, would be in the glen to do them injury. 
So saying she returned to repose beside her devoted husband. 
M' Gregor, in a short time, happening to raise himself on his el- 
bow, observed his enemies just at hand, started up, and, after up- 
braiding his wife as false and treacherous, betook himself to the 
hills ; and never again was heard of. 

Meteorology. — Our high mountains have sometimes their peaks 
enveloped in white clouds, containing little or no moisture. This 
takes place only during the continuance of warm dry weather. At 
other times, the mountain tops are covered with dense black clouds, 
containing a good deal of moisture, and discharging a considerable 
quantity of very small rain ; while such places as are not covered 
with clouds, as well as the valleys below, are entirely free from rain. 
In wet weather, mists and fogs sometimes form many singular ap- 
pearances. At such times, if the day clears up and is sultry, the 
exhalation from the earth becomes so great, as to form thick clouds 
upon the face of the steep mountains. Sometimes, a great num- 
ber of these little clouds unite into one, forming a stripe, seemingly 
resting on the ground, several miles in length, and not a hundred

feet in thickness, half way up the acclivity, and maintaining a per- 
fect level along the face of the hill. 

In the end of harvest or beginning of winter, cold fogs, which 
collect upon marshes, lakes, or rivers, that receive mossy waters, 
often prevail. . They are seen to ascend the bottom of the glens 
in every direction, seldom, however, reaching farther up the hill 
than 700 or 800 feet perpendicular ; and a spectator upon the top 
of a high hill or mountain, would almost imagine the strath and 
low grounds, when thus covered, to be a vast spreading ocean, with 
the upper parts of the hills as so many islands scattered upon its 
surface. 

Winds are seldom steady here in any quarter, for any consider- 
able time. In the end of spring or beginning of summer, we have 
sometimes east or north-east winds, perhaps for a month or more 
together. Our narrow glens and high mountains often give a con- 
trary direction to the wind, especially when it blows across them, 
north or south. We find, then, in the bottom of the glen or foot 
of the mountains, the wind blowing straight east or west. 

Prognostics of Weather. — It is well known that large rivers and 
waterfalls sometimes emit certain sounds, even in the calmest wea- 
ther, resembling those of cataracts or torrents rushing down rocks 
and precipices, — which sounds are sure indications of the weather. 
If the sound of the rapid or cataract descend with the si ream, it 
foretells such rainy weather to be at hand, as will swell the brook or 
river to its margin ; whereas, if the sound ascend along the stream, 
and die away in the distance, it is an omen of the continuance of 
dry weather. 

If, during a storm of frost and snow in winter, the ptarmigan, — 
the hardiest among the feathered tribes of the Grampians, — be re- 
peatedly heard in the face of the mountain, an additional fall of 
snow may soon be expected. 

Our climate has all the vicissitudes experienced in moun- 
tainous countries,— especially in the higher parts of the parish, 
where the atmosphere, when not damp and saturated with moisture 
which in some seasons is the case for nearly two-thirds of the year, 
is keen, sharp, and chill. In summer, our proximity to the 
mountains has a contrary effect upon the atmosphere. Their 
steep fronts reflecting the solar rays, occasion a greater degree of 
warmth in our narrow glens than is felt in lower and more south- 
ern situations; and during the continuance of this warmth, vegeta- 
tion is very rapid. 



538 



PERTHSHIRE. 



The~upper parts of the parish are liable, during summer and 
harvest, to cold dews and fogs, which arise from low and marshy 
places and mossy soils, often destroying the crops. 

In the lower parts, the crops are generally sure and early. Our 
climate, upon the whole, is healthy. When easterly winds prevail 
in the end of spring or beginning of summer, catarrhal complaints 
are common. We have no other epidemical distempers ; and often 
in wet weather and unhealthy seasons, when neighbouring districts 
are affected with influenzas and other pulmonary complaints, our 
glens, owing to their hard and gravelly bottoms, are quite healthy. 

Hydrography. — No mineral waters of any consequence have yet 
been discovered in this parish. On the south side of Sith-chaillinn, 
there is a spring of clear water, allowed by the common people to 
be nephritic and diuretic, and persons labouring under complaints 
of gravel or stone drink plentifully of it. From time immemorial, 
young people of both sexes, sometimes to the number of several 
hundreds, on the morning of the first Sabbath of May O. S., have 
been in the habit of repairing to the mountain to quaff the spring. 
They come from all the surrounding districts, Rannoch, Foss, Ap- 
pin, Fortingal, and Glenlyon, often a distance of nine or ten miles. 
It is reckoned particularly lucky to get the first draught, or what 
is called the cream of the spring. Often, the crystalline dew of 
Sith-chaillinn is qualified by some other dew of a more exhilarating 
nature. 

Lochs. — These are both numerous and extensive, amounting to 
four or five large, and eight smaller ones, — besides about fifteen 
pools of considerable size, scattered over the moors. 

Loch Rannoch. — This lake is about 12 miles long, and its ave- 
rage breadth may be about 1 mile. Its depth has never been 
exactly ascertained ; but there is every reason to believe, that in 
the greater part of it, especially in the east end, it is from 60 to 85 
fathoms, as 50 fathoms were at one period tried and found short. 
The lake extends nearly due east and west. In common frost, it. 
freezes for a few miles at the west end, and it is there crossed, in 
time of hard frost, from side to side, by the country people, with- 
out apprehension. But the oldest inhabitant living does not remem- 
ber, nor has heard of its being frozen from end to end, except twice, 
the last occasion being in the beginning of the year 1809. 

There are two small islands situate in the upper end of the 
lake. The east and larger one is wholly artificial, resting upon

large beams of wood fixed to each other. This island was some- 
times used as a place of safety in cases of emergency ; at other 
times, as a place of confinement for such as rebelled against or of- 
fended the chief. To this retreat, there is a road from a point on 
the south side, — which road is always covered with three or four feet 
of water, is very narrow, and has a great depth on both sides of it. 

The scenery of Loch Rannoch is grand and picturesque, es- 
pecially when viewed from near the east end, whence you 
behold a vast body of water which covers the whole level be- 
tween the hills. The whole south side, from the very margin 
of the lake to half way up the face of the mountains, seems 
one continued forest of native birch and pine, known by the name 
of the " black wood of Rannoch," hiding in its bosom here and 
there, as you go along, several beautiful farm villages and gentle- 
men's seats. The north side, also, presents alternately extensive 
woods and well cultivated spots. 

On both sides of the lake, the hills retire — gradually leaving an 
immense expanse open to the view of the beholder. Above the 
first tier, the highest mountains present to the eye, their dusky 
summits ; and the snowy peaks of Glenetive and Glencoe, are seen 
in the west, at the distance of 40 miles, as if piercing the highest 
clouds. 

Loch Erochd. — This lake extends from the head of Rannoch 
in a north-easterly direction towards the stage-house of Dalwhinnie, 
fully 16 miles. Its mean breadth may be reckoned one mile. A 
great portion of it belongs to this parish ; the rest to the parish of 
Laggan, Inverness-shire. It is surrounded on both sides by craggy, 
steep, and lofty mountains, of dreary appearance ; but beautiful 
spots are seen here and there, on which shooting quarters have been 
erected, and where game of all kinds are to be met with in great 
abundance. Notwithstanding its elevated situation its water never 
freezes.  

 Before leaving Loch Erochd, it may not be improper to notice a very old 
but vague tradition prevalent, regarding the circumstance of its original forma- 
tion. The tradition, old beyond the memory of several generations back, bears that 
the whole space now covered with the waters of the lake, was once an inhabited dis- 
trict, and formed a parish called the parish of Feadail ; that, in the course of one 
night, after the inhabitants had retired to rest, the flood-gates of some great subter- 
ranean body of water were thrown open by some fearful convulsion of nature, and the 
whole district or parish of Feadail was thus inundated, and the population, with 
their cattle, houses and fields, overwhelmed by this sudden and awful catastrophe. 

The tradition also bears, that, for a long period of years, the church, and other re- 
markable houses and objects were distinctly to be seen on a clear summer's day, un- 
der the water. On the confines of this lake, Prince Charles Edward Stuart took 
shelter for some time, after the battle of Culloden.

Locltyarry. — This lake is situated at the distance of nearly seven 
miles to the north-east of Loch Rannoch, extending, nearly due 
north about 4 miles, to the confines of the parish. It is about half 
a mile broad. 

Loch Laoidean lies about eight miles west from the head of Loch- 
Rannoch, and is about 6 miles long, stretching westward towards 
Argyleshire. Its breadth is about half a mile. It is a beautiful 
sheet of water, with many little bosky creeks and promontories, 
and studded with several finely wooded islands. There is one 
near the west end, called the Island of Yew, where the red-deer 
often take shelter, and the noble eagle, undisturbed, builds her 
nest, and rears her young. It readily freezes. 

Loch Lyon is situated at the head of the glen of that name, 
and extends upwards of three miles south-west. Its breadth is 
not above half a mile. It is a beautiful and romantic little lake. 

All the lakes, both small and great, are well stored with trout, 
with one exception, and that the only one requiring a particular 
description. This is in a hollow on the top of Bein-a-gharlagan, 
a detached mountain at the head of Rannoch. It is called Loch- 
a-mhige, — literally the whey lake, and is a real curiosity. It is nearly 
three quarters of a mile round, and apparently very deep, and is 
probably the crater of an ancient volcano ; the mountain itself 
is circular, presenting onthe east side a front almost perpendicular, 
for a space of nearly 1500 feet. 

Rivers. — The Tummel, in Gaelic Teth-thuil, signifying the hot 
or boiling flood or river, bears a name not inapplicable to the stream 
after it has passed the boundaries of this parish. This river, issuing 
out of Loch Rannoch, is a deep smooth flowing water for several 
miles, until it leaves the confines of Rannoch, during which it is 
called the " Water of Rannoch :" but leaving this district, it be- 
comes quite impetuous, till it enters Foss, where it properly receives 
its general name, — Tummel. 

This river at one period flowed out of the lake at a considerable 
distance south of its present channel. At that period, or probably 
prior to it, the level ground on both sides of the river, if not wholly 
inundated, was at least covered with water for several miles. That 
the water had a higher elevation is also quite observable at the 
head of the Loch, where the water-marks show that the lake has 
receded some hundred yards. 

Gamhair, i. e. Gaoir, signifying loud noise. The rapids and 
cataracts of this river when swollen are distinctly heard at the 



FORTINGAL. 



541 



distance of several miles. It has its rise on the south side 
of Glen-Etive, in the deer-forest of the Marquis of Breadal- 
bane, or Coirreacha- Batha. Augmented in its course by the union 
of many mountain streams, it becomes a considerable river. It in- 
tersects the military road in the Black Mount, 5 miles south of 
the stage at King's House. After a course of 10 or 12 miles, and 
forming some lakes in its way, especially Loch Batha, nearly 2 
miles long, and upwards of half a mile broad, with fine woody islets, 
— it expands into the fine lake, Loch Laoidean, already described. 
Issuing thence, it assumes the name of Gearr-Ghamhair, or 
short Gamhair, for 4 or 5 miles ; then it enters an extensive 
tract of low meadow land, which in time of rain it completely in- 
undates, presenting a lake of several miles in circuit, called 
Loch Eathach. Leaving this ocasional lake, it enters the inhabit- 
ed parts of Rannoch, under the name of Gamhair, and after a course 
of 8 miles between Loch Laoidean and Loch Rannoch, it enters 
the latter by two mouths, leaving a beautiful green islet in the 
middle. 

The Lyon. — The source of the Lyon is the lake of that name. 
Issuing thence, it immediately receives the waters of Meran from 
the north. After flowing about ten or twelve miles, it receives 
the Conait, also from the north. The course of the Lyon, with 
little variation, is easterly. After flowing upw r ards of forty miles, 
and being in its course augmented by innumerable mountain streams 
and rills, it merges into the Tay below Taymouth Castle. 

Erochd issues out of the lake of that name, already described. 
For the space of a mile or two, it is a slow, deep-running water ; 
then it becomes a torrent, tearing its banks with almost irresistible 
fury, till it is lost in Loch Rannoch. The course of Erochd is 
about 6 miles. 

There are a number of other considerable streams ; such as 
Uisge Arlair, Cam-chriochdain, Alt-Eathach, Meran, Conait, 
Duibhe, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

Cascades. — These, as might be expected, are very numerous, 
there being hardly a solitary brook in a sequestered glen without 
its waterfall. 

On the confines of the parish the Tummel forms a fine cascade. 

The rivers Gamhair and Duibhe, at the head of Rannoch, pre- 
sent very fine and picturesque waterfalls, — that of the former call- 
ed the falls of Garbhdhun ; and of the latter the falls of Tormor. 

The only cascades on the Lyon are the Sput-ban, as you en- 



542 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ter the glen ; and the fall at Moar, where the river is precipitated 
from a considerable height into a narrow deep pool. Here, when 
the river is somewhat swollen, great quantities of salmon are caught. 

The Conait, for upwards of a mile before it joins the Lyon, pre- 
sents a succession of beautiful cascades. 

The falls of the Keltney, with its wild and rugged banks and 
romantic scenery, are also worthy of notice. 

Geology and Mineralogy — Lime. — The remarkable bed of lime- 
stone which traverses the range of the Grampians in a south-west- 
erly direction from Aberdeenshire to Dumbartonshire, passes 
through this parish towards the east end. The stone is allowed to 
be of a superior quality. A fine quarry of blue granite has lately 
been opened and wrought to advantage on the estate of Mr Men- 
zies of Chesthill. 

Several veins of marble are to be met with in the parish, par- 
ticularly on the estate of Garth, of various hues and colours. 

Rock crystals, spars, and pebbles, of great variety and brilliancy, 
are frequently gathered among our mountains. 

In Glenlyon, there is a vein of lead glance, which is allow- 
ed to be of considerable richness. It was wrought for some 
time about the beginning of the last century, but was then relin- 
quished from some cause or other, probably the want of roads in 
the district at that period ; and it has never since been resumed. 
Behind the village of Fortingal, there are also several places where 
the ore partially appears. 

Appearances of slate are visible in several parts, particularly on 
the east side of Sith-chaillin, and also in the hill above Fortingal, 
the stratum evidently following the direction of the fore-men- 
tioned lime bed. 

The soil in the bottom of the low valleys is generally gra- 
velly and dry ; farther up the hill sides, it becomes cold, yet af- 
fords excellent pasturage for cattle, sheep, &amp;c. Still higher up, 
it is, in general, bleak moor, producing little grass, and covered 
with heath, abounding with game of various kinds. The summits 
are often free of heather, and covered with a thick carpet of beau- 
tiful moss. 

Zoology. — The animals which formerly existed among us, but 
which are now no longer to be met with, were of the quadruped 
kind, viz. the wild boar and the wolf. The ancient Caledonian 
white cow also inhabited our forests in former times. And many 
are the places which take their designation from these several ani- 



FORTINGAL. 



543 



mals, as Tom-an-tuirc, L e. the knoll of the boar ; — Ruighe-a-mha- 
daidh, i. e. the haunt of the mastiff or wolf : — Doire na-bo gile, 
the thicket of the white cow. 

Of the feathered race we had, at one time, the capercailzie 
caper-coille or great cock of the wood. 

In our remote dells and mountains, there are red-deer : and our 
woods and forests abound with roes and fallow-deer. We have also 
the common and Alpine hare ; the latter of which is always whit- 
ish, — and in winter perfectly white. The fox is of the kind pecu- 
liar to high mountains ; and although there have been regular fox-hun- 
ters in this, as in other quarters of the Highlands, for these seventy 
or eighty years bygone, they have not yet been able to effect its ex- 
tirpation. We have, besides, badgers, otters, martins, wild-cats, 
polecats, weasels and other small quadrupeds. The squirrel has 
lately also made its appearance in our woods and plantations, as 
also the rabbit ; and another intruder, not quite so welcome, the 
rat, has forced his way into our most sequestered glens, and even 
to our most retired apartments. 

Among our hills are sometimes seen serpents from a foot to 
three feet in length ; but no person has ever been known to have 
been hurt by them. 

The indigenous birds are the great eagle, the kite, the hawk, 
the raven, the hooded-crow, the rook, the magpie, water-ouzel, &amp;c. 

Those belonging to game are the ptarmigan, the red and 
black grouse, the partridge, and the woodcock : and towards the end 
of harvest, the snipe, plover, the fieldfare, the pheasant. Among 
the migratory tribes that annually visit us and bring up their 
young with us, are, the swallow, the cuckoo, the corncrake, the 
sea-mew, the curlew. 

We have also the wagtail, the stonechatter, the yellow bunt- 
ing ; as also, on our waters, the crane, wild duck, sand-piper, &amp;c. 

In severe winters, flocks of wild geese visit our lakes ; but up- 
on the first setting in of fresh weather, they take their departure. 

Our finest native songsters are the thrush mavis, the lark, 
blackbird. 

In size and symmetry, our black-cattle, and especially our 
sheep, yield to few or none in the Highlands ; and some of our sheep, 
and cattle generally, fetch the highest prices, when exhibited at the 
great cattle-markets in the south. 

The lakes, not only those which discharge rivers, but even the 
small pools in the moors, as already observed, are well stored with 



544

fine trout. In Loch Rannoch, the trout vies in size and shape with 
the salmon itself, although it is universally allowed that salmon 
never reach that lake, — being intercepted by the falls of the Tum- 
mel. The spawning season of the great and small river trout may 
comprehend from the beginning of October to the middle of No- 
vember, when the fish descend into their winter-quarters, in the 
bottom of the deepest pools. 

The best spawning stream in Rannoch, or, indeed, in the whole 
parish, is Ald-Eithach, at the head of that district. The fish wait 
the first flood, in the end of September or beginning of October, 
to ascend this stream ; and trout not salmon of upwards of a 
yard in length, and weighing above 30lbs., are met with, and kil- 
led by the spear and torch. The otter, too, sometimes destroys 
the very largest of the trout, and they are often found dead in the 
water. The mode of his attack seems to be, to seize the fish in 
shallow water, by the breast, close to the gills ; for, when found dead, 
no other part of it seems injured or touched. At the confluence 
of the Erochd with Loch Rannoch, the finest trout imaginable 
are caught by the fly or minnow, in the months of December and 
January. 

The only river in the parish which the salmon reaches, is the 
Lyon, which it ascends as early as the middle of March. Its 
spawning-time commences about the middle of October, and ter- 
minates by the middle of December. In the Gamhair and Lyon, 
and also in many of the smaller streams, there is abundance of 
that species of shell-fish, or, as it is called, the horse-muscle or pearl 
oyster, in which beautiful pearls are sometimes found. 

Botany. — This parish, from the mountainous nature of it, is 
fertile in rare botanical productions. On the tops of the highest 
mountains, the botanist may gather, with the greatest delight, 
different kinds of plants, such as the various kinds of Lycopodiums, 
as also that beautiful tribe the Saxifrages ; and on some of them, 
the Saxifraga reticulata : — the Azalea procumbens, the Sibbaldia 
procumbens, the Thalictrum alpinum, the Epilobium alpin- 
um, the Vaccinium uliginosum the Vaccinium Vitis-ideea ; and 
on the tops of some of the hills in the braes of Glenlyon, the 
Vaccinium oxycoccos ; also the Rubus Chamcemorus the Arbu- 
tus alpina, the Dryas octopetala : and the Drosera rotundifolia 
and longifolia, these two very common, and the Myosotis ru- 
picola : also rearing its majestic head among the steepest rocks 
the Iihodiola rosea, and numerous other rare small plants interest- 



FORTINGAL.

ing to the naturalist and botanist, and too numerous to be mention- 
ed. But I cannot pass by that beautiful tribe of the vegetable 
kingdom, the Cryptogamia, without remarking the great varie- 
ties of them in this district. Of the Filices, the botanist will find 
the Osmunda regalis, the Lycopodiums, the Polypodium, and 
the Cytheas; of the Musci tribe, the Sphagnums, the Phas- 
cums, and the Splachnums : and that most interesting of all, the 
Dicranums, and Hypnums. 

On the whole, this parish is well worthy of being travelled by 
botanists, where perhaps they will discover new plants, on moun- 
tains never before explored by any with a philosophic eye. 

Forests and Plantations. — Our plantations, though they meet 
the eye in many parts of the parish, are not very extensive. They 
are chiefly of fir ; both the spruce and larch seem to thrive almost 
as well as the native species ; as also ash, oak, birch, beech, elm, 
&amp;c. 

In Rannoch, there is a considerable forest of native fir, and a 
great deal more of birch still remaining, which is considered as part 
of the ancient Caledonian forest, which, at one time, extended from 
Glencoe to Braemar, a distance of not less than 80 miles, and from 
Glenlyon to the Spian, Loch Laggan, and the Spey, Inverness- 
shire, — comprehending a tract of mountains, glens, morasses, and 
blue lakes, of upwards of 2100 square miles. 

What remains of the celebrated yew tree of Fortingal church- 
yard, described by Pennant in his Tour, appears as two distinct 
trees, some yards distant from each other. At the commence- 
ment of my incumbency, thirty-two years ago, there lived in the 
village of Kirktown, a man of the name of Donald Robertson, then 
aged upwards of eighty years, who declared that, when a boy going 
to school, he could hardly enter between the two parts; now a coach- 
and-four might pass between them ; and that the dilapidation was 
partly occasioned by the boys of the village kindling their fire of 
Bealltuinn at its root. It is from 52 to 56 feet in circumference. 

II. — Civil History. 
Battles. — In the reign of King Robert I. or II., a battle was 
fought near the River Erochd, two miles north of the head of Loch 
Rannoch, between Donnacha Reamhar i. e. athletic Duncan 
progenitor of the Robertsons of Strowan, and M'Dougal of Lorn, 
who, with his followers,, had penetrated into Perthshire as far 
as the Erochd, in order, it is said, to correspond with, or join, 
the English. Donnacha Reamhar, as soon as apprized of the

circumstance, quickly assembled his followers from Rannoch, 
Strath-Tummel, and Athole ; concealed them near the east side 
of Erochd, that he might seize the first opportunity to attack 
the invaders ; and, wishing to ascertain as well as possible their 
numbers and strength, disguised himself as a beggar, and got into 
the very heart of their camp. The Lorn men anxiously inquired 
of him concerning the number of the army opposed to them, and 
Donnacha Reamhar's personal prowess. They were answered that 
he was allowed by those who knew him to be a very cruel man ; but 
he hoped they would have him soon in their power. Duncan hav- 
ing now obtained his desire, and not wishing to remain any longer 
surrounded by inquiring crowds of enemies, endeavoured slowly to 
withdraw to the outside, which raised the suspicions of the invaders 
that their new acquaintance was either a real spy, or even Don- 
nacha Reamhar himself; and immediately they commenced a keen 
pursuit. But the Rannoch hero soon distanced them all except one, 
on whom he turned with all his fury, despatching him "before his 
countrymen could come up to his rescue ; then, redoubling his ex- 
ertions and speed, he came to the Erochd, which he cleared by one 
spring, and his pursuers were obliged to stop short. Afterwards, 
with his men, recrossing the river, he came upon the Lorn men 
almost unawares. They, however, made a noble and determined 
stand ; but after a dreadful conflict, in which many were slain, 
they were completely overpowered, and a great many taken pri- 
soners ; among whom was the Chief of Lorn himself, who, for some 
time thereafter, was confined in the artificial island of Loch Ran • 
noch, but was afterwards amicably released. 

About a century later, a severe conflict took place on the farm 
of Dunan Rannoch. The hostile parties were the Stewarts of Ap- 
pin, Argyleshire, and a tribe inhabiting, at that time, the head of 
Rannoch, called Clannjain Bhuidhe, the children or descendants 
of John of the yellow hair. The cause was this,— Two pedlars of 
the Stewarts of Appin went to Perth for goods, and, upon their re- 
turn home by Rannoch, were robbed or killed by Clann Jain 
Bhuidhe. As soon as tidings reached Argyleshire, the Chief of 
Appin gathered his clan, and marched immediately to Perthshire. 
The first night, he rested his men upon the confines of Rannoch, 
where he observed at some distance a habitation with some flocks 
and herds. This belonged to one of the M'Gregors of Roro Glen- 
lyon, who, for some fault, was banished that district by the rest of 
the clan, Stewart sent him a polite message, requesting some re- 



FORTINGAL. 



547 



freshment to his men ; when M'Gregor, in the true spirit of an- 
cient hospitality, sent his servant with a fat cow, which pleased the 
Chief of Appin so well, that he desired an interview with M'Gre- 
gor; and proposed that he should accompany him next day, and that, 
should they be able to extirpate or banish Claim Jain Bhuidhe 
from Rannoch, he should have all their lands to himself. This 
proposal was readily accepted ; and next day M'Gregor with 
his servants marched along with the Stewarts. On the farm of 
Dunan, near the side of the river Gamhair, they were met by the 
Clann Jain Bhuidhe in full muster to receive them. In the battle 
which ensued, most of the Clann Jain Bhuidhe were slain, the rest 
were hemmed in by the victors, and obliged to swim the river ; 
and the few that escaped fled to other districts. A small rill, call- 
ed by old people Caochan-na-Fola the rill of blood, points 
out, to this day, the place where the action was fought. The chief 
of Appin, having now had his full revenge, quickly retraced his 
steps to Argyleshire, after bidding adieu to his new ally, and wish- 
ing him joy of his newly acquired possessions. M'Gregor had 
now as much land as his chieftain of Roro ; and the family of 
Dunan for many generations was among the most respectable of 
the clan Gregor in these districts. 

Many other battles might be mentioned, such as that of Lag- 
gan-a-chatha, fought betwixt the Stewarts of Garth and the M'lvors 
of Glenlyon; that of Glen-Sassun, — fought betwixt King Robert 
the Bruce and Edward adherents ; — of which a short notice was 
given in the former Statistical Account. 

A long and severe feud existed betwixfr the clan Cameron and the 
Macintoshes, — whereof this parish was occasionally the scene, and 
which continued, it is said, for 350 years ; during which, many acts 
of cruel retaliation took place, until the latter submitted to Sir 
Evan Cameron in the seventeenth century.  

Remarkable and Extraordinary Leaps. — These are, — 1st, Don- 
nacha Reamhar's leap over the river Erochd, when he was pur- 
sued by the M'Dougals, as already related. The river is confined 
by the opposite rugged rock into a breadth of about 16 feet, where 
the torrent rushes through with irresistible fury ; and this chasm 
the hero is said to have cleared at one spring, — the bank of the 
stream at that place being so steep and uneven that it could not

be ;i running but a standing leap. It retains still the name of Leum 
Dhonnacha Reamhair. 

•2d, Lcum-a-Chleasaiche, the man of Feats' leap. This is at the 
head of Fortingal, properly so called, where the Lyon has opened 
for itself a passage in the solid rock, seemingly not worn down 
from the surface by degrees, as is generally the case ; but as if 
the river had at once burst through, leaving the rock joined above 
like an arch, which the swellings of the stream have in the course 
of ages widened and separated. The breadth of the gullet is 
about 2M feet. The depth of it is about 20 feet. 

3d, Leum-mhic-a-Cheannaiche, i, e. the chapman's son's leap, 
over the river of Bunrannoch, — which consists of first a leap to a 
rock in the middle of the current, and then a spring to the oppo- 
site bank. The hero of this feat is said to have been one of the 
M'Gregors proscribed by the law at the time, — and pursued by the 
Campbells and the black dogs, as they were called. After gaining 
the opposite bank, he turned round upon the latter with all his fury, 
dispatched them, and got clear off. 

4th, Leum Phurraig. — This was a nickname of one Campbell, 
who lived in Carie Rannoch in the earlier part of the seventeenth 
century. He was a famous marksman with the bow and arrow, 
and very swift of foot, — qualifications he had sometimes occasion to 
avail himself of. In flying from the Macdonalds of Glencoe, he 
is said to have made the leap here mentioned over Linne-choimh- 
leum, in the den above Innerchadden and Dalchosnie. 

Records. — Most of the proprietors of this parish having risen 
with Prince Charles Edward Stuart in 1745, their houses, papers, 
&amp;c. were destroyed by the royalists, and consequently the prin- 
• cipal family records were thus lost. There are in my own posses- 
sion, documents showing, that, in the reign of Charles II., a paro- 
chial school was in existence in this parish. 

Eminent Men. — Major- General David Stewart of Garth, author 
of Sketches of the Highlands and of the Highland Regiments, was 
a native and an heritor of the parish. He died in St Lucia, 
West Indies, in 1829, Governor of that island, much and justly 
regretted by all who knew him. 

Struan Robertson, chief of that name, and, in his day, one of 
the most considerable proprietors of the parish, was an elegant 
poet. An octavo volume of Struan's poems was published after 
his death from his manuscripts, or rather from the recollection of 

 Particulars are detailed in the M S.

those who heard them repeated at the time ; but while the worst 
of them were recollected, as generally happens, the best were al- 
lowed to escape the memory. 

Allan Stewart of Innerchadden, who lived much about the same 
time, and was also a proprietor in the parish, was a poet no less 
eminent than the chief of the brave Clann Donnachaidh Robert- 
sons above-mentioned. He, as well as Strowan, shared in the 
common calamities of those who took up arms in favour of Prince 
Charles in 1745. Their houses were burnt, and their properties 
plundered. 

Dougal Buchanan was another eminent character connected with 
the district. Though not a native, he resided here for a consider- 
able time after the middle of the last century, as teacher on the 
establishment of the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge, at Kinloch Rannoch, — a valuable man in his day, and 
highly useful in enlightening the people in the knowledge of the 
truths of the Gospel. In his manners among his intimate ac- 
quaintance, he was affable, free, and jocular ; he was consequent- 
ly much esteemed, both by the gentlemen and common people of 
the district, who, when they had not an opportunity of hearing ser- 
mon from the parish minister, flocked to him upon Sabbaths, when 
he read and expounded the Scriptures to them. He was a severe 
disciplinarian, feared, but at the same time beloved, insomuch, 
that the people offered to raise a fund to send him to College, so 
as to get him licensed to preach the Gospel, and become their pas - 
tor in the district on the Royal Bounty ; but, from some cause or 
other, the plan was not followed out. Dougal Buchanan was the 
author of a small but valuable collection of sacred poems, in the 
Gaelic language, — which displays poetical talent of no ordinary 
kind. They are to this day admired, and read with benefit by every 
Christian who understands the language. He composed several 
songs on various subjects, that were never published. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, John Stewart Men- 
zies, Esq. of Foss and Chesthill ; Ronald Menzies, Esq. of Cul- 
dares; Major-General Sir Archibald Campbell, Bart, of Garth; 
Francis Garden Campbell, Esq. of Troup and Glenlyon ; The 
Most Noble the Marquess of Breadalbane ; General Robertson of 
Strowan ; Sir Neil Menzies of that Ilk, Bart. ; Colonel John

gisters now extant, is 1748. They are now very irregularly kept, 
not a tithe of the births or baptisms being recorded. 

Antiquities and Curiosities. — Among these, may be included 
the yew tree in the churchyard of Fortingal, already noticed. 
The Roman Camp, as it is called, is at the west end of Fortin- 
gal. The spot where the General's tent is allowed to have stood, 
is surrounded by a deep fosse. To the west of this, at a short 
distance from each other, are two obelisks, the one about 6 feet 
high : the other lying on the ground, having been undermined 
some fifty or eighty years ago. Itis 8 feet long. The prajtorium, 
is still complete. A little to the north-west, is an ablong emi- 
nence, nearly 60 feet long, and 18 broad, and about 7 feet high, 
which appears to be a tumulus, raised over those who fell in the 
deadly conflict. 

From a slight inspection of the ground, it appears that the 
Lyon at one period flowed to the north of the camp, though now 
some hundred yards to the south ; and this is farther confirmed 
by the tradition of the country. Nor is it unlikely that all the 
ditches surrounding the camp were filled with water from the river. 
The area occupied is allowed to be from 80 to 90 acres in extent. 

Near the church of Fortingal, in the middle of a field, is a large 
Druidical circle. Many of the stones have, from time to time, been 
buried in the ground, to make way for the plough. The circular 
forts, of which the ruins of fourteen or fifteen are still distinctly tra- 
ced, are built without any cement or mortar, of such large stones as 
wouldcostthe moderns immense labour, ifnot altogether baffle them, 
without the aid of machinery, to raise and lay with such nicety 
and regularity on each other. The diameter of the circles with- 
in walls which are generally 8 feet thick is sometimes 60 feet. 
The original height of the walls cannot now with accuracy be tra- 
ced or ascertained ; because of the constant dilapidation carried on 
by people from the neighbouring villages ; but the presumption is, 
that it was not less than 12 feet. It does not clearly appear that 
they were watch-towers, as has been conceived by some, as they 
are but seldom in view of each other, and are as often in low as in 
high situations. That they were real habitations, there can be 
little doubt; for it is quite evident that, in some of them, there were 
several halls or apartments ; tradition bears that there were twelve. 
The apartments extended from the wall, which served as a com- 
mon gable, towards the centre. Some ascribe these buildings to 
the Druids : but if any credit be due to the uniform tradition of old 



FORTINGAL. 



551 



people, these buildings belonged to the Fingahans. For Fingal s 
heroes are said to have had 20 or 21 castles, as they were called, 
scattered over this parish. In the upper part of the glen, on the farm 
of Cashlie, i.e. Castles, there are, within the distance of a mile, three of 
these, one—CaistealanDeirg, the Castle of Dargo— another, Cais- 
teal an Duibhe-the castle of the black hero,— and Caisteal coin- 
a-bkncain—the Castle of the dog's kennel. This bacan, or stake, 
to which the Fingalians tied their stag-hounds, and from which 
the castle is named, is a thin stone, about 2 feet in height, re- 
sembling the letter q, with the small end set into the ground, up- 
on a little green eminence. 

Although it is difficult or rather impossible to ascertain the era 
to which these forts should be referred,— the total want of lime in 
their construction, though it is often found in great plenty in the 
very neighbourhood, renders it probable that they were built be- 
fore its use was known to the inhabitants. The presumption also 
is, that these forts are the first rude specimens of architecture in 
the country. The difference between these and the castles of suc- 
ceeding or feudal ages is remarkably striking, and shows clearly 
that the art of building had, before the era of the latter, under- 
gone a very great change. 

Besides the Fingalian castles, there are other two old castles, the 
residence of chiefs during the feudal ages, and which, before the 
introduction of fire arms, might be deemed impregnable. The one 
in the east end of the parish, was occupied by the Cuilean Cursta, 
or the Fierce Wolf, as he was called, brother of the Earl of 
Buchan, from whom a great number of the Stewarts of Athol 
are descended.  See Stewart's Sketches. This castle is built 
upon the point of a rock where two deep chasms meet, formed- by 
brooks flowing at their bottom ; it was defended by a ditch or draw- 
bridge. 

The other castle is at the foot of Glenlyon, situated on a high 
steep bank, and defended also by a drawbridge. The last pro- 
prietor that resided here, about the middle of the sixteenth cen- 
tury, was Duncan Campbell of Glenlyon, commonly called Don- 
nacha ruagh na feileachd, i. e. Red Duncan of Hospitality : he is 
said to have carried his hospitality to such an extravagant and ro- 
mantic height, that his fame in this respect was not confined to 
Scotland, but extended to the sister island, Ireland. 

There is on the farm of Inverchadain, an old ruin, called She- 
omar-na-Stainge, i. e. the Ditch Hall. It seems to have been 



552 



PERTHSHIRE. 



built of no other materials than earth and turf, according- to the 
description given of it by Blind Harry. Here Wallace, coming 
from Argyle, attended by a few faithful adherents, rested with his 
men for some days. And the Rannoch men, glad of such an op- 
portunity, immediately joined the hero's standard, and marched to 
attack the English at Dunkeld and Perth. 

King Robert the Bruce was in Rannoch on two occasions ; 
on one of which, he gained a victory over the English at Dal- 
chosnie. On another occasion, after sustaining a defeat on the 
confines of Argyle, he was obliged to conceal himself for a con- 
siderable time in Rannoch, at a place, still called after him, 
Seomar an-righ, the King's Hall, a sequestered and beautiful ro- 
mantic spot on the side of the Tummel, below Crossmount. Gil- 
bride, or Bredus of the Cave, as he is called in history, also took 
shelter in Rannoch. Being defeated by the King's troops in his 
attempts to recover possession of " the Isles," he for some time 
concealed himself till the King's troops should retire. Hence he 
was called Gilbride of the cave. The cave or hiding-place was 
no other than the north side of Loch Rannoch, where he princi- 
pally took shelter; and a farm there got its name from the circum- 
stance, Aulich, i. e. Uamh-f/ialaich, the hiding-place or cave. There 
is on the face of the hill above the farm, a- remarkable well or 
spring of water gushing out of the earth, the strongest I ever re- 
member seeing, called Fuaran Ghille-bhride, or Bredus's well. A 
few such would inundate the parish of Feadail, — of which already. 
Gillebride's Cairn is not far distant ; and other places in the 
neighbourhood are still called after him. 

III. — Population. 
At present, no part of the parish is more populous than it was 
in 1790 ; whereas in several districts, the population has since de- 
creased fully a half; and the same will be found to have taken 
place, though not perhaps in so great a proportion, in most or all 
of the pastoral districts of the county. 

According to census of 180], the population was - 3875 



1811, - - 3236 

1821, - - 3189 

1831, - - 3067 

Number of families in the parish, - 621 

chiefly engaged in agriculture, - - 273 



in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, - 119 

One of the principal causes of the decrease has been emigra- 
tion. Upwards of 120 families from this parish, since the former 
Account was dgawn up, have crossed the Atlantic, besides main 



FORTINGAL. 



553 



individuals of both sexes ; while many others have sought a liveli- 
hood in the low country, especially in the great towns of Edin- 
burgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Perth, Crieff, &amp;c. The system of unit- 
ing several farms together, and letting them to one individual, has, 
more than any other circumstance, promoted emigration. 

There are seven different burying-places in the parish,— two in 
Glenlyon, one in Fortingal, and four in Rannoch,— at none of 
which are registers of burials kept. 

Language, Character, c. of the People.— -The Gaelic is the 
language of the natives. It is, however, losing ground, and losing 
its purity, very much of late. Forty years ago, in some parts 
of the parish, especially in the district of Rannoch, it was spoken 
in as great purity as in any district of the Highlands. That race 
of genuine natives having disappeared, many of their phrases and 
idioms have become almost unintelligible to the rising genera- 
tion. It is, however, gratifying to the antiquary and to the lover 
of Celtic literature, that so much has been done to rescue the 
language and insure its permanency and stability ; still all that is 
practicable has not yet been achieved. Hundreds of vocables 
might be collected which have escaped the notice of .the several 
learned compilers of our Gaelic dictionaries. 

The people may be characterized as intellectual, sober, and in- 
dustrious in their habits, honest and religious. Crime and delin- 
quency are ashamed to raise their heads ; and consequently occur 
as rarely among us, as in any parish of equal extent and popula- 
tion, in the Highlands, or in any part of the kingdom. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Not even an approximation to the number of 
acres of arable, waste, pasture, common, woods, &amp;c. can be given. 

The indigenous kinds of trees that prevail are the birch, fir, 
alder, hazel, oak, elm, ash, plane, willow, beech, the yew. The 
kinds generally planted, and which thrive well, are the Scotch fir, 
larch, spruce, oak. 

The arable land in this parish bearing but a very small proportion 
to that in pasture, and the holdings invariably consisting of very dis- 
proportionate quantities of both, — the rent of small crofts will give 
the best idea of the rate of land in this parish. The rent of a lot of 
two acres, with as much hill grazing attached as is sufficient for the 
maintenance of a horse, a cow, and two dozen sheep, summer and 
winter, is from L. 6, 10s. to L. 7. ; of a lot of five acres, having 



554 PERTHSHIRE. 

corresponding pasture for a horse, two cows, and one or two young- 
cattle, with some dozen sheep, L. 14 to L. 17. 

The average expense of grazing a sheep, of which there are 
about 62,000 in the parish, is from 3s. to 3s. 6d. per annum. The 
summer grazing of a cow, of which there are about 1200 in the pa- 
rish, is L. 1 ; of young cattle, of which there are about 3000, 
from 5s. 6d. to 8s. 6d. ; horses, of which there are about 360, from 
L. 1, 5s. to L. 1, 10s. on low ground, and L. ] for hill grass. 

Wages. — A farm-labourer receives in winter about Is. per day 
with victuals; in harvest from Is. 6d. to 2s. A woman, during the 
same seasons, respectively, from 3d. and 9d. to Is., with victuals 
also. A farm-servant's wages run from L. 10 to L. 13, with vic- 
tuals in his master's family. A servant-maid's wages are from 
L. 4 to L. 5, 10s. 

Live-Stock. — Our sheep are mostly of the black-faced kind, and 
our black-cattle of the West Highland breed. Great attention is 
paid to the improvement of both among all classes of graziers ; and 
consequently, when a public sale happens by one of our principal 
graziers, it is not uncommon to see a bull knocked down for L. 50, 
a cow for L. 40, and queys at L. 35  

Some of our best sheep stocks, when sold by apprizement, bring 
L. 26 per clad score. 

Leases generally run for five, seven, eleven, fifteen, and nineteen 
years. Seven is the most general term. Leases are considered fa- 
vourable to the occupiers, as affording them confidence in carry- 
ing on improvements on their farms. The improvements on the 
old mode of farming have been very great. In my younger days 
hardly any plough went without four horses, and two athletic men 
to lead and drive. But that mode of agriculture is now gone by. 

The improvements in farm-buildings and inclosures are equally 
remarkable and progressive. When a new lease is obtained, the 
heritor or proprietor meets the farmer's wishes, with a liberality 
that does him credit. Splendid and elegant accommodations are 
furnished for the tenant ; and the steadings and houses for the cat- 
tle, &amp;c. are excellent. 

V. — Parochial Economy, 

Market-Town. — It can hardly be said that there is any market- 
town or village in the parish. The nearest market- towns are Crieff 
and Perth, distant respectively thirty and forty miles. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parish are but indifferent. There are several carriers 



FORTINGAL. 



555 



from the parish, regularly plying betwixt it and Perth. Between 
Aberfeldy and the extremity of Glenlyon, there is a runner three 
times a-week, passing and repassing through the district of For- 
tingal ; but the graziers in the upper parts of the glen are served in- 
differently. At Kinloch-Rannoch, a penny post-office was lately 
established. The communication is with Pitlochry three times a- 
week. The letters, &amp;c. for the district are regularly brought for- 
ward thus far by post, and thence circulated by the best means that 
offer, through the country. 

Our bridges and fences are generally kept in good repair. I 
would particularly refer to the great improvements made, of late 
years, in bridges, fences, and roads, upon Sir Niel Menzies's pro- 
perty of Slismine, in this parish. In connection with the trus- 
tees of the estate of Strowan, the patriotic Baronet also caused 
to be erected, last summer, a most elegant new bridge over the 
Gamhaire, at the west end of Loch Rannoch. I regret to say 
that the heavy floods of last harvest carried off this beautiful struc- 
ture; but it is now in the course of being rebuilt by the same par- 
ties. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated within three 
miles of the south-east corner of the parish. There are, also, two 
Government churches, — one in the district of Rannoch, and the 
other in that of Glenlyon, — both of which have lately been erect- 
ed into parishes  quoad sacra  by the General Assembly. The 
three churches form nearly the angular points of an equilateral 
triangle, whose side is about twelve miles. The parish is thus di- 
vided into three great portions or districts, exclusive of the dis- 
trict of Bolfracks, south of the Tay. The parish church is about 
six miles from the limits of its own district, quoad sacra, on the 
west, three from the east, and about four from the north-east ; but 
its distance is from thirty-five to forty miles from the western boun- 
dary, quoad civilia. The government churches are at least seven- 
teen and twenty-six miles from the extremities of their respective 
districts. To afford the remote parts of their congregations every op - 
portunity to hear the word, the ministers often preach, the one at a 
station eight miles, and the other twelve miles, distant from their 
respective churches. There are eleven heritors or land proprietors 
in the parish, all whose estates are of the yearly value of L. 50 and 
upwards. It is but justice to mention here, as an instance of their 
generous spirit and liberality, that a few years ago they built one of 



556 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the most handsome school-rooms in the Highlands of Perthshire, 
lor the parish, with suitable accommodation to the teacher. 

A most splendid manse and court of offices were also lately 
erected for the accommodation of the minister ; to the building of 
which the heritors agreed, without any solicitation on his part. 

The church, a very old fabric, though as firm as the surround- 
ing rocks, was newly seated, roofed, ceiled, lathed and plastered 
about the year 1821. It bears every mark of having been a Po- 
pish construction ; and is rather inconveniently narrow, particular- 
ly at the time of dispensing the Sacrament, when immense crowds 
attend from the surrounding districts. 

Education. — There are 12 schools in the parish, viz. the paro- 
chial school ; 2 schools on the General Assembly's scheme ; 2 on 
that of the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Know - 
ledge ; and 7 others supported by families, which, being remote 
from the established schools, join in hiring a young lad, to teach 
their children, during four or five months of the winter only. All 
are, however, connected with the Established Church. The pa- 
rochial teacher has the legal accommodations to the full, and the 
maximum salary, besides an allowance for a garden. The Assem- 
bly teachers have each a free house, croft, and cow's grass, and a 
salary of L. 20. Those of the Society have the same emoluments 
as the Assembly teachers, with a salary of L. 15 or L. 20, and a few 
pounds for fuel. The amount of fees received by the teachers of 
the Assembly and Society schools, owing to the indigence of the 
inhabitants in their neighbourhoods, is merely nominal, or quite in- 
considerable. 

Poor. — The number of persons receiving parochial aid is from 
60 to 70, throughout the whole parish. The weekly collections at 
the churches may amount to about L. 50 per annum. Some of the 
poor get only 10s. or 12s; others L. 1 or L. 1, 10s. In cases of 
emergency, the heritors meet, and assess themselves for the sup- 
port of extraordinary paupers and lunatics, sometimes to the extent 
of L.60 or L. 80. 

Rannoch, Glenlyon, and Fortingal have each their separate kirk- 
sessions and boxes for the poor ; and each district may collect 
L. 16 or L. 18, which goes to the support of their own paupers, 
while the heritors' assessment is for the whole parish generally. 

Few of our poor go about begging, — none in this section of the 
parish. Still we are infested by. a great many vagrants from the 
great towns of the south. Our poor are thankful and patient un- 



FORTINGAL. 



557 



der privations ; and excepting in cases of real want, and when 
compelled by the strongest necessity, it may be said that the dis- 
position to refrain from seeking parochial aid is general. 

Fairs.— There are 7 fairs held in the parish,— one at Kirk- 
ton of Fortingal in the beginning of December, lasting two or 
three days ; at which sheep, goats, and cattle are exposed and 
bought for being slaughtered for winter store. Some of the in- 
habitants buy a clad score or two. At this market, a great 
deal of other business is transacted, accounts paid, servants en- 
gaged, &amp;c. There is another fair held at Kirkton, about the 
end of April, called the " Seed Fair," because the tenants and 
others resort to it for their lintseed, clover-seed, &amp;c. Another is 
held in August, being the greatest market for lambs in these 
bounds. At Kinloch-Rannoch, there are also three fairs, — one in 
August for lambs, &amp;c, one in the end of October, and another in 
April for cattle, &amp;c. ; and one at Inverwick, Glenlyon, first Thurs- 
day, O. S. for sheep, &amp;c. 

Inns. — There are 4 inns in the parish, affording such accommo - 
dations as can be expected in a district like this. There are, be- 
sides, 6 other houses in retired or remote districts, where whisky, 
porter, &amp;c. are sold to refresh the traveller, and to which the 
tenants in the neighbourhood retire on rent days, weddings, &amp;c. 

Fuel. — The principal fuel of the parish is peats. In many 
places, these are scarce, and procured, sometimes, from an eleva- 
tion of little less than 3000 feet. Wood and turf are partially used 
also. Coals are brought to the district, by such as can afford it, 
from Crieff or Perth. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The changes which have taken place since the former Account 
was drawn up, are quite striking. Then, most of the tenantry in 
the parish removed, for the benefit of grazing, with their cattle 
to their shealings, sometimes to the distance of twenty miles. 
There they remained several months during the summer season, 
the men employing themselves chiefly in fishing and hunting, the 
women in spinning and attending to the dairy. And among the 
middle class of tenants, instances were not uncommon of families 
paying the rent in this way, by manufacturing lint of their own 
growth. But now, nothing more is done than what is barely re- 
quired for family use ; because there is no demand. The milk 
cows are now generally housed every night, summer and winter, 
and the dairy-maid's musical voice is no longer heard in the fold. 



55H 



PKKTHSHIK E. 



The tale and the song have now also ceased to cheer the win- 
ter ingle; and our old people often complain, that the reign 
of ancient faith and brotherly neighbourhood, which knew no guile, 
is usurped by mercenary and selfish aims, which have complete- 
ly done away with that clannish and family attachment, for which 
Highlanders in former times were so celebrated. 

At that time, the women, when they went abroad, dressed in lin- 
sey-woolsey, or other homespun apparel, their finest attire ; and it 
was exceedingly rare to meet a woman at church or market, with a 
straw bonnet or umbrella. Now, the meanest servant maid can- 
not appear at either, without being provided with both. 

Excepting in families of independent circumstances, tea was then 
unknown. Now, it is almost incredible how much is expended on 
this article by our peasantry. There was, then, little if any clover 
or turnip sown in the parish; now, even the crofter who rents a few 
acres, must have his little plot allotted and enclosed for the former, 
and a ridge or two for the latter. Very great changes for the bet- 
ter have also taken place, in the management of funerals, late- 
wakes, and weddings. Instead of the unseemly scenes and riots 
which frequently took place on such occasions, the strictest pro- 
priety and decorum now prevail. In husbandry, also, a most re- 
markable improvement has taken place : and societies for the ad- 
vancement of every branch of agricultural improvements have been 
established among us, the beneficial effects of which are visible.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JOHN STEWART, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, fyc. — The four separate parishes of Blair, 
Lude, Kilmaveonaig, and Strowan, constitute what is now gene- 
rally designated the parish of Blair-Atholl. Though the condi- 
tions and period of the annexation of these parishes are unknown it 
is certain that their union took place before 1632. The names 



ULAIR-ATHOLL. 



559 



are Gaelic. Blair, Mar, signifies a plain ; Lude, leth-jhoid, le'oid, 
signifies the half of a furrow, and hence a declivity; Kilmaveonaig, 
Cille-Eonaig, the chapel dedicated to St Eonaig ; Strowan, Cille- 
Biiain, the chapel dedicated to St Rowan ; and Blair in Atholl, 
or Blair- Atholl, the modern name of the parish, signifies the plain 
in or of Atholl. 

Blair- Atholl is a very extensive parish, and is situated in the 
north-west district of Perthshire. Its length is 30 miles, and it is 
about 18 miles broad. It is bounded on the east by Kirkmichael 
and Moulin ; on the south by Dull ; and on the west by Rannoch ; 
on the north by Laggan and Kingussie, in Inverness-shire ; and on 
the north-east by Braemar, in Aberdeenshire. 

Topographical Appearances. — The valley of the Garry, from 
the pass of Killiecrankie to the point of Strowan, may be consi- 
dered the nucleus of the parish. On both sides of the Garry, 
there is a considerable extent of plain in a state of cultivation, and 
which is surmounted by sloping banks of excellent arable land, 
terminating in hills of valuable pasture, or covered with plantations. 
The back ground on the north side of the Garry is formed by the 
lofty Grampians, which separate Perthshire from the counties of 
Aberdeen and Inverness. Glentilt and Glenfendar, Glengarry 
and Glenerichkie, are narrow vales diverging from the leading val- 
ley of the Garry. They receive their names from their respective 
streams. Bohespick, Strathtummel, and Borennich, constitute the 
remaining portion of the parish. These are districts upon the sides 
of the river and loch of Tummel, separated from the valley of the 
Garry, by a moor of four miles in breadth, but of inconsiderable 
altitude. 

The Grampians form the northern boundary of the parish. In 
this extensive Alpine range, there are several mountains of great 
elevation. Beinnghlo, with a base of many miles in circumference, 
has four separate summits, viz. Carn-nan-Gabhar, 3720 feet high ; 
Airgiod-bheann, Cam Liath, and Cam Torkie. And in the same 
Alpine range, there are other mountains little inferior to Beinnghlo 
in height, viz. Beinn-mheadhonaidh, Beinn-Chait, Beinn-deirg, 
&amp;c. &amp;c. 

Hydrography — Lakes. — Loch Garry is situated in Drumuach- 
dar, and very near the boundary-line of the counties of Perth and 
Inverness, or where the waters separate. It is surrounded by very 
high hills, and thus appears to be as it were in a den, — hence the 

 Strowan is vulgarly understood to signify streams.

PERTHSHIRE. 



etymology of the name. Garaidh is a common Gaelic word, signi- 
fying a den. The lake is about six miles in circumference, and it • 
abounds in large and excellent trout. 

Loch Tummel, teamhuil, signifying dark or shadowy, forms a 
part of the southern boundary of the parish. It is a beautiful little 
Highland lake, of four miles in length, and about three-fourths of 
a mile in breadth. Its cultivated banks, and numerous hamlets, 
and artificial island with its ruins, give it a peculiar aspect of cheer- 
fulness. Si-chaillein, with its barren dreary base, however, throws 
a gloom upon the scene, which may lead one to say that the ap- 
pellation is justly merited. It abounds in pike and in trout of su- 
perior quality, and of the largest size. It is well kHown to afford the 
angler excellent sport. 

Eivers. — The Garry is the leading and principal river of the 
parish. It issues from Loch Garry, and, after running for thirty 
miles, is lost in the Tummel, at the south-east extremity of the pa- 
rish. It takes its name, like every other Highland river, from the 
parent lake. In its course it receives many tributary streams, as 
the Erichkie, the Bruar, and the Tilt. When flooded by a heavy 
fall of rain, or by the melting of the snow in spring, it forms a large, 
and rapid, and irresistible current, making destructive inroads upon 
its gravelly banks, and owning subjection only to the rugged rocks 
by which it is here and there confined. 

The river Tummel flows from the loch of that name. It is a 
large body of water, and though its course be short, it is one con- 
tinuous rapid stream from the lake to its magnificent fall. 

The Tilt flows from Loch Tilt, upon the summit of the Gram- 
pians, and after a course of sixteen miles, it terminates in the 
Garry at Blair. It is a beautiful mountain stream, whether con- 
sidered by itself, or in connection with the glen and the scenery- 
through which it runs. 

Falls.— The fall of the Tummel is remarkable for the great 
mass of water. Its height is about 18 feet. It is a grand and 
beautiful object. The turbulent river, with its rugged banks and 
lofty precipitous rocks, covered with birch to their very summits, 
present to the traveller a scene of unusual magnitude and grandeur. 

The celebrated and well-known Falls of the Bruar consist of a 
series of falls, the highest of which falls perpendicularly, and is 
about 60 feet in height. They have many natural and artificial 
attractions. The deep and narrow chasm of the river, its rocky 
and precipitous banks, its characteristic bridges, the well-dressed

walks, and the continually increasing interest which every successive 
step excites, are objects with which the numerous visitors of the 
scene are powerfully struck. The merit of its wooded banks is ge- 
nerally ascribed to " Burns' Petition :" it may with much greater 
justice be ascribed to the Noble proprietor. 

One peculiar fall, and a rapid turbulent stream, confined by 
shelving and rugged rocks, form the cataract of the Garry. The 
banks were enclosed, planted, and ornamented about ten years ago 
only, by the late Duke of Atholl. 

Climate. — In 1836, Fahrenheit's thermometer ranged from 18° 
to 75°. The climate is dry, which may be inferred from the cen- 
trical situation of the country, it being equidistant from the Ger- 
man and Atlantic oceans. Rain comes with an east or south-east 
wind, which, on account of the intervening hills, loses much of its 
humidity before it reaches the vale of the Garry. The climate is 
also cold, which its elevation must indicate. The north wind 
blows with piercing keenness ; and frosty dews are frequent in the 
beginning of summer and in autumn. Rheumatic and inflamma- 
tory diseases are the prevailing distempers ; and fevers are occa- 
sionally introduced from the low country. The great age to which 
many of the people live attests, however, that the climate is salu- 
brious. The oldest man in the parish at present is ninety-seven 
years of age. He is in the full possession of all his faculties ; and 
other five persons are alive who are about ninety years of age. 

Geology. — Glentilt has been the scene and subject of much 
geological discussion. Playfair, Macknight, M'Culloch, &amp;c. have 
contributed to its celebrity in that department of science. 

Marble of various shades was discovered in Glentilt about twenty 
years ago. It is found of a light gray and pure white, but the 
green is the one most prized. The late Duke of Atholl worked 
the quarry with that vigour and spirit which characterized all his 
undertakings. The green marble found its way to the principal 
towns of Britain, and is now frequently met with as mantel-pieces, 
&amp;c. in many modern mansions. 

The great limestone vein which commences in the south-west 
at Leney, near Callander, runs through the parish, and terminates 
its course north-east at Braemar. The hills of the country abound 
in moss, which, when dried, produces black hard peat. The 

 The Falls of the Fendar also cannot fail to be appreciated by the tourist. A 
minute description of the scenery of the parish in this Account is avoided as unne- 
cessary, for every traveller can so easily furnish himself with a copy of the late Dr 
Macculloch's correct and ample guide upon the subject. Published in 1823.

mosses are full of decayed fir trees, and whole roots of a very large 
size, and perfectly sound, are often dug, supplying the people of the 
country with faggots to light up their cottages in the winter nights, 
raid when dried well are not a bad substitute for oil or candle. 

Forest and Zoology.— Atholl Forest is understood to mean a 
mountainous tract of land furnished solely with deer and other 
game. Its extent and superiority to every other forest are well 
known. Its immunities and privileges in former times were great, 
which may be seen from the following curious legal document. 

Report concerning Forestries, &amp;c. in Scotland, anno 1G80.  From the original.— 
At Edinburgh, the eighth day of July, sixteen hundred and eightie years, anent the 
supplicatione presented to the Lords of Counsell and Sessions, hy Alexander Robert- 
son of Fascallie, shewing, that where the petitioner haveing obtaineat arte signature, 
superscrived by his Majestie's royal hand, of his lands and baronie of Fascallie, contain- 
ing an novedamus and erection of the outfield, woods, &amp;c. ; which the petitioner hav- 
ing presented to the Lords of Treasurie and Exchequer, to be past by them, after 
revising thereof; the same was taken up by the Marquis of Atholl, to see, and re- 
fused to be reproduced until the Lords ordained him to do the same ; and, after re- 
production thereof, the petitioner having addressed himself by ane supplicatione to 
the said Lords of Exchequer, craving that the said signature might be past ; the said 
Lords of Exchequer, by an act made by them thereanent, upon the eleventh day of 
February last by past, recommended to the Lords of Counsell and Sessione aforesaid, 
to consider the import and priveledge of a forrestrie, and how far his Majestie's inte- 
rest might be concerned in the foresaid signature, or the lyke ; craving, therefore, that 
the saids Lords of Sessione would appoint a tyme to the effect foresaid, as the said 
supplicatione at length bears, — Which being read in the presence of the saids Lords 
of Counsell and Sessione, they recommended to Sir Alexander Seatoun of Pitmedden, 
ane of the saids Lords of Counsell ther own number, to call both parties before him ; 
and to hear them and ther Prors. upon the said matter, and to make report thereof 
to them. According whereunto the said Lord Pitmedden having called both parties, 
and ther Prors. before him, and having heard them debait in the said matter, did 
make report of the same to the said Lords of Counsell and Sessione ; which Teport 
being considered by the said Lords, they appoynteat Charles Maitland of Hattoun 
Lord Treasurer Deput, Sir Thomas Murray, Lord Regr. Sir David Falconer of New- 
toun, and the said Sir Alexander Seatoun of Pitmedden, four of the saids Lords 
their own number, to prepare ane report to the saids Lords of Exchequer, anent the 
import and priveledge of ane forrestrie, and how far his majestie's interest may be 
concerned in the said signature, or the lyke. Lykeas, according to the foresaid re- 
commendation, the saids Lords Treasurer, Deput Register, Newtoun, and Pitmedden, 
having considered the debait in the said matter, betwixt the said supplicant Prors. 
and likewayes the Pror. of the said Marquis of Atholl, hcretable keeper of his Ma- 
jestie's forrestrie in Atholl, neir adjacent to Fascallie's estate, they fand, That by 
the lawes and acts of the Parliament of this kingdom, the priveledge and import of 
ane forrestrie is, That it is a place appoynted for deer, and for hunting ; and that 
any deer or cattle, or other beasts that are found within the forrestrie, are confiscable 
to the proprietor and keeper of the forrest ; and that his Majestie's and his Hedge's in- 
terest is, That whereas, by the lawes and custom, of this kingdom, no man is obliged 
to herd his cattle, or other beasts, except when the corns are upon the ground, after 
quhilk, the possessor of the ground may keep ther own ground, and turn of other 
folk's cattle, but cannot oblidge them to herd, or keep ther cattle, or pay for the trans- 
gressione, except in the case of enclosures, where violence is done to the dykes there- 
of; yet this forrestrie now craved, is not to be enclosed, ascommonlie forrestries are 
open. And by the erecting of new forrestries, all the neighbouring heritors must 
either herd their goods through the whole year, and keep them off these forrestries ; 
or otherwise suffer the loss of them, by being confiscate for pasturing upon these for- 
restries. And it is represented, that, in this particular case, there is a forrestrie of the 
King's foresaid, in which ther is a considerable stock of deer, as the report of the saids 
bur Lords in the said matter at lenth bears ; which being read in presence of, 
and consider ed by the saids Lords of Counsell and Sessione, this day, they have approv-

The Lords Commissioners having heard and considered the above written report, 
doe ordain and appoint, that before Fascallie's signature, above-mentioned, be past in 
Exchequer, the claus anent the forrestrie, therein contained, be deleit and expunged : 
As also, that ther be an extract of this report transmitted to his Grace the Duke of 
Lauderdale, whereby, for the future, when any such signatures, bearing forrestries, 
sal be offered to his Majesty, for his royal hand, whereunto his Majesty may be gra- 
ciously pleased to take notice thereof, and to signifie his pleasure to his Exchequer, 
it being of a great concerne, both to his Majestie and his Hedges. — Signed, Rothes,

there was a stop put to the passing of that signature, until such time as the Lords

It is said that there are 7000 red-deer in the Atholl Forest, and 
the number is not over-rated, if the extent of ground, of which they 
have the undisturbed possession, be any criterion. The roe-deer 
also are numerous in the different plantations of the country. 

The fox, the wild cat, the martin, the polecat, the weasel, and 
the Alpine hare, are common. The rabbit, the squirrel, and the 
rat have lately made their way into the country, and have increas- 
ed so rapidly as to become troublesome and destructive. 

The eagle has his eyry in the mountains of the Atholl forest. 
The kestrel builds his nest in Glentilt, and at the Falls of the 
Bruar. Red and black game, the ptarmigan and the plover, and 
partridges are plentiful. The jay and the woodpecker are to be 
met with in the plantations of Blair. The oyster-catcher {Hcama- 
topus ostralegus comes up the Garry towards the end of March, 
and nestles upon its gravelly banks. The land-rail, the cuckoo, and 
the swallow, the woodcock and the fieldfare, are our migratory 
birds, and visit the country in their season. 

Botany. — In a tract of country so extensive as this parish, and 
with such a variety of soil, and climate, and surface, the number 
of indigenous plants may easily be conceived to be very great. Of 
the rarer Alpine plants the botanist can scarcely meet with a 
more productive field than Beinn-ghlo itself. Upon its west side, 



564 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Saxifraga oppositifolia, Silene acaulis, Dryas octopetala, Azalea 
procumbens, Betula nana, grow abundantly ; and it has been said 
that the Ilubus arctica is to be found there. Convallaria verticil- 
lata grows upon the side of the Tilt near the Fender. It is now well 
known that the Menziesia carulea has been discovered upon Carnan 
Dobhrain, which has obtained the soubriquette " the Sow of 
Atholl," to the north of Loch Garry. And Dr Arnottof Arlary, one 
of our most learned botanists, states, that Dicranum Schreberi is 
found in an old quarry towards the head of Glentilt. Of these 
two plants, this parish is the only habitat in Britain. 

The natural wood of the country consists of oak, birch, ash, as- 
pens, alder, &amp;c. Oak ceases to grow as a natural wood in Atholl, at 
a height of 400 feet above the level of the sea, and at which the 
region of the birch seems to commence. This may be owing to 
the higher elevation, or to a difference in the soil, which certainly 
exists — or to both causes combined. At Aberwainie, and upon 
the glebe, about 500 feet above the level of the sea, there was an 
extensive clump of the largest oaks, and where many standard 
trees of great dimensions may still be seen. It grew, however, in 
a well sheltered spot, and in a bank of excellent soil. To the 
north of Killiecrankie, the birch is the prevailing tree of natural 
growth, and of which there are numerous and extensive woods. 
Along the banks of the Garry, the alder abounds, but it is dwarf- 
ish in its growth. Every different estate in the parish has its plan- 
tations, though some of them were but lately formed. A conside- 
rable portion of suitable ground upon the estate of Lude has been 
planted. The plantations of Blair are very extensive, and the size, 
age, and quality of the timber render them very valuable. Lime, 
elm, and plane trees are unusually large and numerous in the 
park. The surrounding grounds and hills are covered with Scotch 
fir, spruce, and larch. And though Blair supplied the materials 
of which the Atholl frigate was built, many magnificent speci- 
mens both of larch and of spruce still remain. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Events. — To give Pitscottie's account of the magnifi- 
cent hunt with which James V., his mother, and the Pope's Le- 
gate, were entertained by the Earl of Atholl, on the north side of 
Beinn-ghlo, is unnecessary. It is familiar to all the readers of 
Scottish history, and of Scottish tours from the date of Pennant's 
Journal to the present day. 

The battle of Killiecrankie cannot be said to be a subject which 



BLAIR-ATHOLL. 



505 



properly belongs to the account of this parish, and its history also 
is known to every one. Viscount Dundee had his head-quarters 
at the Castle of Blair, and the contending armies met on the 
north side of the Girnag, upon the lands of Runrory or Urrard, 
in the parish of Moulin. A despatch on the following day from 
Dundee himself, and which is published in the Stuart papers, 
contradicts the common belief, that he died near the scene of ac- 
tion ; and no good reason has ever been assigned for the assertion 
that that despatch is a forgery. He was buried in the vault of the 
Atholl family, in the old church of Blair. 

Blair Castle was often occupied as an important military post, 
not only in the incessant warfare of feudal times, but even in the 
late Rebellion of 1745. When the Duke of Cumberland arrived 
with his army at Perth, in February 1746, he deemed it expedient 
to have a military force in Atholl, where almost all the inhabitants 
were known to be Jacobites. A detachment of 300 men, command- 
ed by Sir Andrew Agnew, Bart., Lieutenant- Colonel of the Royal 
N. B. Fusileers, was sent by the route of Dunkeld, and through 
the pass of Killiecrankie, to take post at Blair Castle. 

The chief object of the service committed to Sir Andrew was 
certainly to prevent any treasonable correspondence, and to cut 
off by proper parties, at fit out-posts, the communications by the 
great roads between the south and northern parts of the country. 
So effectual was this manoeuvre for the purpose intended, and so 
annoying was the occupation of this military post by the King's 
forces, that Lord George Murray was sent from the north to re- 
gain possession of Blair Castle. He was accompanied by other 
officers of rank, and a force of about 100 men. After having com- 
pletely surprised and made prisoners of all the detached parties with- 
out the castle, his head-quarters were established in the village of 
Blair upon the 17th of March. 

From the measures adopted by Lord George, he seems to have 
wished to reduce the garrison to surrender by famine. He had 
heard of its scanty provisions, and with his numerous force he 
blocked up the castle so closely, that it was impossible to receive 
any supplies into it. 

 At this time no siege or blockade had been foreseen. It was never expected 
that the open communication with the country, and a regular supply of provisions 
would have been interrupted. The quantity of garrison provisions sent to the castle 
was small. With respect to water, there was a draw-well in the castle. No artillery 
or military stores even were sent ; and when the number of serviceable cartridges of 
powder and ball in possession of the soldiers was strictly examined, it was found 
that they did not exceed nineteen per man. 



566 



PERTHSHIRE. 



It is also probable that he had some expectation of hastening 1 
a surrender, by threatening to set fire to the castle. He fired red 
hot bullets from two field-pieces which he had brought with him. 
The point from which he fired at the north side was so distant, that 
the heated balls only charred the very thick rafters of the roof. 
And a night or two before breaking up the blockade, he removed 
his field-pieces to the south side of the castle, whence their shot 
produced no greater effect than from the former position. 

The garrison was reduced to the last extremity, and obliged to 
eat horse flesh. There was no probability of the blockading force 
being soon withdrawn. Wilson, the gardener at Blair, and a trust- 
worthy servant, was despatched with intelligence of its desperate 
state to the Earl of Crawfurd, who commanded some cavalry and 
Hessian troops at Dunkeld. On the 1st of April, the day after 
Wilson set out, not a Highlander was to be seen at Blair. Lord 
George Murray had received a sudden order to join the main 
body of the Prince's army near Inverness. 

At this distance of time we cannot but admire the prudence and 
sagacity which this distinguished officer exhibited in the blockade of 
his native castle. He knew its provisions consisted chiefly of bis- 
cuit and cheese, and of which, too, the quantity was small. The 
allowance fixed for each man was only one pound of biscuit, a 
quarter of a pound of cheese, with a bottle of water a day. Had 
the Prince's counsels, guided at the time by weak and ignorant 
courtiers, permitted Lord George to remain but a few days longer 
at Blair, the garrison must have capitulated, and Crawfurd's caval- 
ry perhaps would have been destroyed in Killiecrankie. Though 
the Prince's affections were alienated by the basest acts, and his 
confidence withdrawn from his Lieutenant- General, Lord George 
paid implicit obedience to his commands, and served him with un- 
daunted bravery, fidelity, and zeal. By the unanimous concur- 
rence of the Highland army, he was its ablest officer. He was a 
man of a noble deportment, of independent mind, and indomitable 
spirit. 

Though it was certain that the Highlanders had raised the 
blockade in the night-time, the garrison was kept shut up by Sir 
Andrew Agnew until the next morning. On the 2d of April, an 
officer arrived on horseback from the Earl of Crawfurd, and in- 
formed the commandant, that his Lordship, with some cavalry, 
might be expected in an hour. The garrison was accordingly 
drawn out, and his Lordship was received by Sir Andrew at the

head of it with this compliment — " My Lord, I am very glad to 

see yon, but by you have been very dilatory, and we can 

give you nothing to eat."  To which his Lordship answered 
laughingly with his usual good humour — " I assure you, Sir An- 
drew, I made all the haste I possibly could ; and I hope that you 
and the officers will do me the honour to partake with me of such 
fare as I can give you." 

The Hessians would not march from Dunkeld with Lord Craw- 
furd against the Highlanders. They were horror-struck at the 
thought of Killiecrankie. Their commandant feared the swords 
of the wild mountaineers, as he called them, and which had but 
recently twice beaten the King's troops with their regular artillery 
and fire-arms. 

Public thanks were afterwards given to the garrison by the Duke 
of Cumberland, for its steady and gallant defence of the castle, and 
Sir Andrew Agnew was rewarded with the colonelcy of a regiment 
of marines.

Parochial Registers. — The register of marriages, or rather of 
the proclamation of bans, is well kept. There never was a re- 
gister of burials ; and the register of births and baptisms, pretty 
regular and well kept from 1750, fell into disrepute with the pa- 

 Of Sir Andrew's peculiarities and fiery temper, there are many reminiscences. 
The writer used to hear the following related, and long before he knew the scene of 
its operations, by a much esteemed and particular friend. 

A waggish subaltern in the garrison got hold of the block, upon which he 
placed Sir Andrew's wig with a cocked hat, an old uniform coat, &amp;c. and set it up 
one morning in a loop-hole in the castle. The trick succeeded, and the Highlanders 
instantly commenced pouring their fire upon the window. Sir Andrew was startled 
at the sudden incessant fire directed against one particular spot, and, upon going to 
reconnoitre, he soon discovered the reason ; and a loud peremptory order was issued, 
that the playful hero should remove from the view of the Highlanders the object 
which had excited their hostility, and that, too, without delay, during the hottest of 
their fire.

Antiquities. — Cille Aindreas, St Andrews, lies upon the banks 
of the Tilt, and immediately to the south of the inn. The sepul- 
chral remains which were found there, and the names of some ad- 
joining grounds, indicate that the place was the site of an ecclesi- 
astical establishment. Dail-an-t-sagairt, the priest's field, is near 
the spot. The establishment may have been removed to Kilma- 
veonaig, as a more convenient situation, and dedicated to St Eonaig. 

A complete or perfect specimen of a Druidical temple is not 
to be met with in the parish. Single upright stones, which are evi- 
dently a part of such temples, are to be seen in several places. An 
upright stone at Pittagowan is still known by the name of Clach 
an iobairt, the sacrifice stone. Some writers have maintained that 
the circular stones so frequent in the Highlands, were places where 
Druids assembled for the administration of justice, and not for any 
religious service. Whether that be the case or not, the customs 
and the language of the Highlanders evince a connection between 
these stones and religious purposes. Burying grounds are found 
near these Druidical temples, and to this very day, a village, where 
a church is situated, is called, An clachan, the place of stones. Am 
bheil thu dol do'n chlachan, are you going to the stones  is the 
common Gaelic expression for, are you going to church  

Buildings. — Blair Castle, the baronial mansion of the Atholl fa- 
mily, is the residence of Lord Glenlyon. It is a building of great 
strength, magnitude, and extent. The date of its erection is not 
known. It is generally supposed to have been built by John of 
Strathbogie, a Cumin, who became Earl of Atholl in right of his 
wife. A part of the castle is still known by the name of Cumin's 
Tower. Its locality rendered it an important military post in the 
warfare of feudal times; and in 1750, two stories were taken from 
its height, and the great military garrison of the country convert- 
ed into a modern building. Whether James, Duke of Atholl, 
acted from personal feelings, or in obedience to a mandate of the 
privy-council, it is much to be regretted that the turrets, embra- 
sures, and bartisans of his feudal castle should have been demo- 
lished and replaced by a plane pavilion roof. Its apartments, how- 
never, are numerous and elegant, and its accommodations are suited 
to the residence of a ducal family. The park contains many 
hundred acres of excellent arable land, exclusive of its extensive 
plantations ; the garden is large and productive ; the gravel walks

along the Tilt, the Banavy, and the Fendar, the Bruar, and the 
Garry ; the various and well-conducted carriage drives : all afford 
the advantage of active exercise, with the pleasure of admiring 
magnificent scenery ; and, if the whole be viewed in connection 
with the forest and its lodges, its lakes and its rivers, Blair may be 
justly said to be one of the most splendid hunting chateaux in 
Europe. 

The House of Lude has been built at different times, and the 
greater part of it is old. Its elevated situation, and style of archi- 
tecture, render it a very striking object in the scenery of the Garry. 

There is a good modern house at Auchleeks.

There is good reason to suspect that the last Government cen- 
sus is overrated. The present incumbent in his parochial visits, 
and more especially in 1814, found the number of his parishioners 
to be about 2333. The parish is divided into eleven districts, with 
an elder in each district, and in May 1836, according to the cen- 
sus of the elders, the population was found to amount to 2312. 

The gradual decrease of the population is easily accounted for. 
In former times, the higher grounds were inhabited by numerous 
tenants. Their possessions were small ; their supply of farinace- 
ous food was precarious, and in the very best seasons afforded but 
a scanty subsistence. They had no potatoes, and their principal 
aliment was animal food. A system of more beneficial manage- 
ment has converted these dreary and comfortless habitations into 
sheep-walks ; and greatly to their own interest, though not perhaps 
at first so congenially to their feelings, the people have emigrated 
to the large towns of the south, or to America. And though the 
population upon the whole has diminished, it has greatlv increased 
in the strath of the country, which is certainly a more natural and

the Grampian mountains. The parish is entirely landward, and 
it cannot be said that there is a town or village in it. 

Land-owners. — There are 15 proprietors of land, and of 
whom 1 1 are heritors with a valued rent. Three of the heri- 
tors reside constantly, and four occasionally, in the parish. Each 
of them has more than L. 50 of annual rent. 

The people of the country are of the middle stature, active, and 
capable of enduring much fatigue. Their food is plain and whole- 
some ; and the poor cottar has his cow, which supplies his family 
with milk. The Gaelic is the language of the country. There 
are few, however, under thirty years of age who cannot read and 
write, and speak the English language. The manners of the 
people, as well as their dress, resemble those of their low- country 
neighbours, and no power can resist the assimilation of their lan- 
guage. The elementary books now in Gaelic, and the numerous 
publications of the present day in that language, whether well or 
ill executed, and the more general reading of Gaelic in the schools, 
are but indirect methods of enabling the children to acquire a know- 
ledge of English with greater facility. Exertions are also made here 
and there to restore the tartan costume, and the practice of High- 
land games. Interest and industrious habits render the people in- 
different to the latter ; and their dress is now regulated by views of 
comfort and convenience, rather than by vanity or conceit. The 
people are quiet and peaceable, and anxious to maintain a 
good character for honesty, and sobriety, and industry. Even petty 
thefts are unknown among them ; and every species of immorality 
is discountenanced. They are sincerely attached to the Establish- 
ed Church. They are well acquainted with the plain and funda- 
mental truths of Christianity, and regular in their attendance upon 
its solemnities. 

The illicit distillation of whisky, which some years ago prevail- 
ed in the country, might then have been said to have been a ne- 
cessary evil. A wiser and more favourable system of excise laws 
has enabled the Highlander now to convert his barley into money, 
and to abandon a practice which had well nigh ruined the country 
and its people. Though there be not a legal distillery in the pa- 
rish, there are many in the lower district of Atholl. 

If a young man be occasionally found in our distant and exten- 
sive moors with a gun in his hand, it need not be wondered at. 
Sportsmen from the south train them either as servants, or guides, 
or sacketmen to a fascinating amusement, and which, when their 
masters leave off their sport, it is not easy for them to relinquish.

Poaching, however, is not so general now as it was, and it is get- 
ting every year into greater disrepute. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — All the land of the parish 
is either arable, or hill pasture. There are neither meadows nor 
outfield. In such an extensive tract of country, it is impossible 
to ascertain with precision, the number of acres in pasture, or in 
tillage. From those sources of information to which recourse was 
had, the following list of acres may be relied upon as being pretty 
nearly accurate. 

Land occasionally or constantly in tillage, 3000 acres, 

uncultivated land, or hill pasture, 105,000 
under natural wood, - 50 
under plantations, - 2000 

The Scots fir was almost the only tree which used in former 
times to be planted in the country. Experience has shewn that 
its growth upon light soil and moorish grounds is stinted. It ceas- 
ed, many years ago, to be a favourite with the late Duke of Atholl, 
whose knowledge and experience as a planter have not been 
equalled by those of any British proprietor. The larch is now 
planted in dry soils, and the spruce where there is moisture. The 
birch is the indigenous wood of the country, and it grows here and 
there in extensive clumps, affording excellent shelter for sheep and 
cattle in winter. The ash and the mountain ash, the aspen and 
the alder, also grow naturally. 

Kent, 8c. — The average rent of arable land is about L. 2 per acre. 
To every farm, however, a considerable portion of hill is attached, 
and which is included in the preceding rent. The expense of hill 
grass for a cow is L. 1 a year, and for a sheep 3s. The rental of 
the parish, in which is included the rent for shooting grounds, may 
be about L. 14,000 a year. The yearly wages of male servants 
are from L. 10 to L. 12, and of female servants from L. 5 to L. 7. 
Tradesmen receive about 2s. a day ; and day-labourers Is. 6d. 

Breeds of Live-Stock, fyc. — The black-cattle of the country are 
the Highland breed, and in this immediate district they have been 
much improved of late. The black-faced breed of sheep, which 
in exposed lands are the surest stock, is the only kind to be seen 
upon our hills. By some of the more intelligent storemasters, a 
few goats have lately been introduced, as they consume many 
plants which the sheep reject ; and among rocks they can find their 
way to pasture which is inaccessible to sheep. 

Husbandry and Produce. — At a remote period, there was cer- 
tainly a greater quantity of cultivated land than at present. Fur- 



572 



PERTHSHIRE. 



rows, and the traces of the spade, are still to be seen in many s'pots 
which are now covered with heather, and have returned to their 
natural state. And in the higher districts, much even at present 
under crops, would yield a larger and more certain return under 
permanent pasture. In such elevated situations, the soil is deep, 
and mossy, and naturally late, which, with the want of climate, ren- 
ders the cultivation of the land in spring an arduous labour, and 
its produce in harvest extremely precarious. In the strath of the 
country, ami upon the sloping banks of the Garry, the arable land 
is either a light loam, or a gravelly soil. The rotation now pur- 
sued is a four or five-shift. The soil is particularly well adapted 
for the growth of turnips. This valuable crop, however, is raised 
in small quantities only, and as a food for the cattle of the court- 
yard. The consumption of turnips by sheep, though the soil be 
dry and gravelly, has been hitherto on a very limited scale. Leases 
are generally given for nineteen years. The inclosures are dry 
stone walls; and, though the old thatched tenements are in general 
the habitations of our peasantry, many of the tenants have good 
dwelling-houses and steadings, built of stone and lime, and cover- 
ed with slates. 

Fuel. — The greatest obstacle to improvement is the scarcity of 
fuel. Coals are driven by many from Perth, a distance of thirty- 
five miles. Our mosses are abundant, but, generally speaking, they 
are distant. The difficulty of bringing peats home by bad hill 
roads renders them a troublesome and expensive fuel, and the 
months of July and August are necessarily devoted to this haras- 
sing work. Lime would be more extensively used, and made to 
contribute to the quantity of manure, if fuel to burn it could be 
more easily procured. 

The proprietors of the country, by their influence and example, 
encourage its agriculture, and the different breeds of stock ; and 
as constituent members of the Atholl Club, which meets once a 
year, they stimulate, by a distribution of prizes, a spirit of laudable 
emulation among the tenantry. 

The average gross amount and value of raw produce raised 

yearly in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

3000 acres, arable, produce at L. 5 per acre, L. 15,000 

30,000 sheep, at 5s. per sheep, 7,500 

1200 milch cows, at L. 3 per cow, - 3,600 

100 goats at 3s. - - 15 

100 hill horses, at L. 5 - - 500

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is no market-town in the parish, and it can scarcely be 
said that there is a village in it. The people of the country pro- 
cure what is required either from Pitlochrie, Dunkeld, or Perth. 
There are four weekly carriers from the parish to Perth. The 
great toll-road from Perth to Inverness runs through the parish. 
There are also excellent country roads through Strathtummel and 
Glenerichkie. Bridges are now numerous, and afford safe and 
easy access to every separate district of the country. The new 
Tilt Bridge is a handsome structure. At Blair Atholl is a post- 
office, where there is a daily arrival from the south and north by 
the Royal Mail Coach. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Lord Glenlyon is patron of the parish. 
The walls of the old church of Lude are still standing, and the 
old church of Kilmaveonaig was rebuilt in 1791 by the Episcopals 
of the country, as a place of public worship for those of their own 
communion. When the parishes were united, the churches of 
Blair and Strowan only were retained for divine service. Both of 
them were for many years in a ruinous state ; but when the altera- 
tion of the public road, so long contemplated, was effected about 
ten years ago, a very handsome parish church was built, and a 
new parochial churchyard assigned, and the site was changed so 
as to correspond with the new line of road. The church is seat- 
ed for 650 hearers. In 1829, a new church was built at Strowan 
and seated to contain 450. No seat rents are exacted. Public 
worship continues to be performed two consecutive Sundays at 
Blair, and the third at Strowan. The congregations are in a 
great measure distinct, but the sacrament is dispensed at Blair, 
only. The people are regular in their attendance at church. 

In 1752, the manse was removed to its present situation, two 
miles distant from Blair, and three miles from Strowan. A good 
new manse with offices was built in 1828. 

The glebe upon which the manse is built was assigned in ex- 
change for the conjoined glebes of Blair and Strowan. The glebes 
of Lude and Kilmaveonaig still remain, and form a part of the be- 
nefice. The glebe land of the parish is much beyond the ave- 
rage value of a glebe, and it is worth about L. 100. The stipend, 
as modified by the Court of Teindsin 1813, consists of 6 chalders 
of victual, half meal, half barley, with L. 63 in money, including 

 The church of Tennandry is now endowed, and the above was written without 
reference to the new erection. 



574 



PERTHSHIRE. 



L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. In May 1835, the stipend 
was augmented, and is now 13 chalders of victual, half meal, half 
barley, with L. 10 for communion elements. 

A clergyman of the Scotch Episcopal Church officiates every 
Sunday at Kilmaveonaig, and the members of his congregation 
who are parishioners here may amount to 20. 

There is also a Baptist meeting-house at Bail-an-t-sabhuil. It 
is conveniently seated for the accommodation of its members from 
this parish, and Moulin, and Fincastle, in the parish of Dull. The 
spirit which led to the introduction of this sect into the country, 
manifested itself more than thirty years ago, and its adherents are 
not numerous. About 20 persons of this parish are Baptists. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is 7, 
viz. 1. parochial school, and 2. Society schools. The private 
schools are maintained by the inhabitants of those districts which 
are remote from the established schools. They are generally well 
attended, and are taught by young men whose incomes depend 
solely upon their school fees. In the parochial school, Latin and 
the other usual branches of education are taught. The number of 
scholars is about 80. The school fees are extremely moderate, and 
amount to about L. 30 annually. A new dwelling and school-house 
were lately built, and a garden of one rood of land was assigned 
for the schoolmaster. He has a salary of L. 34, 4s. 4|d. 

There are about 358 children in attendance upon the 7 public 
schools during the winter months. There are other three districts 
viz. Bohespick, Glenerichkie, and Glen Garry, in which there is 
scarcely the semblance of a school, except for three months in win- 
ter. The very difficulties which the people encounter and surmount 
in procuringthe means of instruction for their children are sufficient 
evidence of their anxiety to give them education. And to educa- 
tion we must attribute in a great degree the rapid and striking im- 
provement in the habits and manners of our people. Instead of 
indolence and sloth, and repugnance to every change, by which 
they were long characterized, a spirit of exertion and industry is 
apparent in our Highland glens. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor's funds have always been 
under the management of the minister and elders of the parish. 
Every elder has the more immediate oversight of the poor of the 
district in which he resides, and in so extensive a parish, it is ne- 
cessary that care be taken to have an elder for every separate dis- 
trict. The heritors meet once a year, when they audit the poor's 



BLAIR-ATHOLL.

accounts, and settle any other parochial business in which they 
have an interest. The number of paupers is about 70, consisting 
mostly of aged unmarried women, or widows from whom their 
children have withdrawn their support. The funds are not dis- 
tributed according to any stipulated rate, but according to the 
urgency of the case. The funds arise from the following sources, 
and in 1835 amounted to, — Church collections, L. 32, 8s. 4d. ; in- 
terest of L. 193 capital, L. 7, 17s. 4d. ; mortcloth dues, fines, &amp;c. 
L. 4, 10s. ; total, L. 44, 15s. 8d. 

There is a mortification of twelve bolls of meal for six old men, 
four bolls from Blair, and eight bolls from the lands of Urrard. 
The benefit of this charity is confined to aged poor men, resident 
upon the Atholl estate in the parish. Each of them had a free 
house and garden in the village of Blair. When that village was 
removed in 1750 by James Duke of Atholl, the bede-men were 
removed from it, and 6s. 8d. was assigned to each as house-rent, 
which continues to be regularly paid. There is also a mortification 
upon the lands of Blair, of 13s. 4d. each to two old men. As to 
the origin or history of either mortification, no information can now 
be procured. 

The heritors have always given pecuniary aid to the kirk-ses- 
sion when required. If non-resident heritors do not contribute 
voluntarily to the poors funds, recourse must inevitably be had to 
assessment, when property will be severely taxed, and the condi- 
tion of the poor rather worsened. That there is an encreasing 
outcry among the poor for pecuniary relief, and that they are well 
aware of their legal rights, are facts which it would be wrong to 
conceal. And it must be confessed, that the shame which attach- 
ed to the receiving parochial aid, now acts but seldom as a re- 
straint upon their claim even for a trifling support. The tenantry 
of the country are charitable in a high degree. They give alms 
of meal, and " of such things as they have," to the poor of the pa- 
rish, with the greatest liberality, and also to hosts of wandering 
beggars from the south, by whom they are heavily oppressed. 

Fairs. — The fairs held in the parish are as follows : Blair Atholl 
general business Feburary 2d. Ditto cattle and horses May, 
third Wednesday. Bridge of Tilt cattle August 20th O. S. 
Ditto Ditto June 25th. Trinafour horses March, third 
Tuesday 0. S. Ditto cattle October, Wednesday before Falkirk. 

Inns. — Upon the great Iuverness road within the parish, there 
are three excellent inns, viz. Bridge of Tilt, Blair, and Dalna- 



576 



PERTHSHIRE 



cardoch, where every accommodation in the way of posting and lodg- 
ing is found, equal to that of any inn in Scotland. There is also 
a good inn at Trinafour, at the junction of the Glenerichkie road 
with the toll-road from Dalnacardoch to Tummel Bridge. Se- 
veral small houses along the public road, and at proper distances, 
are licensed to sell British spirits. They afford cheap and con- 
venient accommodation to foot-passengers, and it cannot be said 
that they are hurtful to the morals of the people. 

Fuel. — Though coals be consumed by many families, yet peats 
are the common fuel of the country. In general, they are of ex- 
cellent quality, but they are distant. 

- Miscellaneous Observations. 

Several important changes in various respects have taken place 
since the last Statistical Account was written. The great mili- 
tary road from Dunkeld to the north was formed about fourteen years 
ago into a toll-road, which is kept in the very best state of repair. 
It has also been much improved by a total change of its line, or 
lowering its acclivities. A very beneficial change was made at 
Blair. The old line of road, which was one successive series of 
ascents and descents for nearly three miles, forming the arch of 
a circle, was drawn in the diameter, or in a straight line of two 
miles in length, through a level plain along the side of the Garry. 
Within the last twenty years, it may be said that L. 25,000 at least 
have been expended upon buildings and bridges. Several farm- 
houses with courts of offices have been erected, not inferior to those 
in the low country. And many of our tradesmen and cottars live 
in comfortable houses, built of stone and lime, slated and plastered. 

About five years ago, Lord Glenlyon conferred upon the country 
one of the most substantial benefits, by the erection of a meal 
mill and kiln at Blair, upon the most improved principles of con- 
struction. Five wretched mills, to which his own tenants, and those 
of other proprietors, were thirled, have been demolished. The peo- 
ple have thus been generously freed from a vexatious and expen- 
sive thirlage, and permitted to dry and grind their corn at Blair, 
where the work is done in the most perfect manner, without loss 
of time to themselves, with a greater return, and at less than half 
the former charge. There are five thrashing mills in the parish, 
and all these buildings, and an addition of 300 acres to its plan- 

 There is also an excellent meal-mill and kiln at the bridge of Tilt, and a saw- 
mill at Blair, and one at Lude. 



BLAlli-ATHOLL

tations, and the regular rotation of cropping, have greatly changed 
as it were the face of the country. 

The Roval Mail from Perth to Inverness leaves letter-bags at 
Blair post-office every day, and the receipts for postages are con- 
siderable. 

In their dress, as well as in their domestic economy, the people 
exhibit a very favourable change. In the houses of the peasantry, 
there is a much greater attention paid to the simple comforts of life. 
And the cloths and muslins of the south have superseded the coarse 
expensive manufacture of the country. Schools are more nume- 
rous, newspapers are abundant, and general knowledge is more 
widely diffused. The acquaintance of the people with the Scrip- 
tures, and their serious respect and regular observance of the or- 
dinances of religion, sufficiently testify that they are not indiffe- 
rent to a knovvlege of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. 

Extensive plantations towards Strowan would beautify and im- 
prove that naked tract of country. A good road across Sliabh- 
bac would be highly beneficial, shorten and facilitate an inter- 
course with the southern districts of the country. And the great- 
est disadvantage under which this extensive parish labours is the 
want of divine service every Sabbath day in both its churches. The 
imperfect system of occasional public worship is the greatest evil 
and defect in our Ecclesiastical Establishment. It holds out every 
encouragement to ignorant and wandering sectarian preachers, or it 
is apt to confirm a people in habits of indifference to the habitations 
of religion. And if the labours of a minister could be regularly se- 
cured for the congregation of the church of Strowan, by which 
that of Blair would be no less benefited, it would greatly contribute 
to the well-being and spiritual comfort of a people, who are obliged, 
as it were, to forsake the assembling of themselves together on every 
Lord's day, and thus to devote publicly unto the Lord only a third, 
of those days which he hath sanctified, and blessed to be a holy 
Sabbath unto himself.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH &amp; STIRLING. 

THE REV. WILLIAM MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 



I — Topography and Natural History. 

The ancient parishes of Comrie, Dundurn, and Tulliehetal, to- 
gether with parts of Monivaird, Strowan, and Muthill, are contain- 
ed in the present parish of Comrie. 

Name. — The name Comrie, signifying in Gaelic confluence, is 
derived from the site of the parish church, at the confluence of 
the rivers Earn, Ruchill, and Lednock. A dun or fortified hill at 
the east end of Loch Earn gave name to Dundurn or Dun-d-earn. 
Tulliehetal signifies " the plain of sleep," referring, it is thought, 
to the burying-ground where the dead sleep around the ruins of 
a very ancient church. The date of the conjunction of the 
three original parishes is unknown. It was in 1702 that the Com- 
mission of Teinds, at the request of the General Assembly, made 
the additions, quoad sacra, from the parishes of Monivaird, Strowan, 
and Muthill. 

Extent, 8fc. — The united parish is about 13 miles long and 10 
broad, and if a district two miles long at the west end of Lochearn, 
which in 1702 was annexed, quoad sacra, to Balquhidder, be 
reckoned, the parish of Comrie, quoad civilia, is 13 miles long 
throughout its entire breadth, and contains about 130 square 
miles. This parish, lying at the head of Strathearn, is bounded 
by high mountains on three sides, the east opening on the valley 
of Strathearn. The principal range of mountains is the Gram- 
pians, running from south-west to north-east. Benhonzie is 
2900 feet above the level of the sea, and Ben Vorlich, the high- 
est, is 3300, and may be seen from Perth, Edinburgh, and Ayr- 
shire. There is very little low or flat land in the parish ; the 
principal valleys Glenartney, Glen Lednock, and the banks of 
the Earn are from 200 to 350 feet above the level of the sea, 
and they open upon the village of Comrie. 

In a portion of country like this parish, whose surface is so di- 



COMRIE. 



579 



versified with mountain, glen, and strath, a corresponding diffe- 
rence of climate is to be expected. The dry, gravelly nature of the 
soil, and the shelter of the surrounding hills, render the climate 
of the strath mild, salubrious, and favourable to longevity, so 
much so, as to have formerly obtained for Strathearn the epithet 
of the Montpelier of Scotland. A thermometer in the village of 
Comrie was found, during the months of November and Decem- 
ber 1831, to average higher than that registered in Edinburgh. 
The glens are colder than the strath, and the more so the higher 
they ascend into the mountains. But in them the air is general- 
ly dry and clear. 

There is nothing so peculiar either in the soil, climate, or mode 
of living here, as to produce any endemic disease. But, though 
remote and almost isolated, this parish appears to have no immu- 
nity from those diseases that spread in that mysterious manner 
termed epidemical. It, however, was exempted from the visita- 
tion of the cholera. 

In the spring and summer of 1831, influenza was prevalent; in 
the winter, chincough was common ; in the summer of 1832, 
measles appeared ; in the spring of 1833, influenza was again very 
prevalent, succeeded in the autumn by scarlet fever, which was fol- 
lowed by small-pox, that continued till the winter of 1834. In- 
fluenza again prevailed in the spring of 1835, and was followed by 
chincough, which was more general among the children than either 
of the two preceding epidemics. In the spring of 1836, there were 
a number of cases of continued fever, and the influenza, so univer- 
sal at the beginning of 1837, seized at least three-fourths of the 
population, but apparently not with so many fatal results as in the 
districts to the east. 

Before each of these epidemics appeared, they were prevalent 
for some time to the east of this parish. As Comrie has little 
communication from any other quarter, an inference might be 
drawn from this, in favour of the opinion, that these diseases are 
caused by contagion alone, were it not a fact that epidemic dis- 
eases generally travel from east to west. Typhus fever is very 
rare ; intermittent fevers or agues never occur ; common continu- 
ed fever occasionally prevails, but never in the severe form, the 
typhus gravior, so frequent and fatal in large towns. Inflamma- 
tions fill up the largest space in the catalogue of our diseases, and 
of these bronchitis appears to be the most frequent and fatal. 
Pneumonia and pleurisy are not uncommon, but the true idiopa- 



580 



l'HKTHSHIRE. 



thic croup is very rare, while the symptomatic and spasmodic va- 
rieties are more frequent. Rheumatism is common and severe ; 
chronic gastritis is a very frequent complaint in this parish, which 
may be owing to one or both of the following reasons' : The fre- 
quent imbibing of undiluted spirits, and taking the ordinary diet, 
potatoes, as hot as they can be got. Scrofulous diseases do not 
bear so high a proportion as in our larger towns, but they are by no 
means rare here. The deaths from consumption are as 1 to 9f of the 
whole mortality. 

Hydrography. — Loch Earn, the only considerable body of water 
in the parish, is 7 miles long, from 1 to 1 broad, and its depth, 
in common with some other Scottish lakes, is very great, in many 
parts about 100 fathoms. Its temperature varies little through- 
out the year, so that even the river Earn, which flows from it, sel- 
dom if ever freezes above its junction with the Ruchill. There 
is a small artificial island at the east end of Loch Earn covered with 
ruins ; and at a small distance may be traced, under the surface on 
a calm day, the apparent commencement of another artificial isl- 
and. There is a tradition that freebooters of the name of Nish 
occupied the castle on the island at one time, and, having the only 
boat on the lake, were secure from reprisals, until, having presum- 
ed to seize the Christmas cheer of the Laird of M'Nab, on its 
way from Crieff to Killin, the sons of that chieftain carried on 
their shoulders from Lochtay, a boat across the Grampians, and, 
surprising the Nishes when asleep after their Christmas feast, car- 
ried back their heads in triumph to the old M'Nab. This feat is 
commemorated on a monument in the beautiful burying-ground of 
M'Nab, at Killin. The island was latterly occupied by the fami- 
ly of Ardvorlich, who had an occasional residence and a granary 
there. 

The rivers in the parish are the Earn ; the Ruchill flowing from 
Glenartney ; and the Lednock, from the glen of that name. 

Earthquakes. — This parish has acquired some notoriety from its 
earthquakes. These very remarkable phenomena have undoubt- 
edly been felt here at intervals for nearly fifty years, but of late 
have been very feeble and rare. The writer of this felt one earth- 
quake very distinctly, and has heard of several others during his 
incumbency. At and after the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, the earthquakes were so frequent and violent, and accom- 
panied with such loud noises, as to occasion great alarm, — especially 
one which occurred on a Sabbath, while the congregation was as- 



COiMRIE.

sembled. There has been no plausible theory of the causes of 
these local earthquakes ; their centre seems to be about the round 
hill above Comrie ; they have been felt at twenty miles distance, 
but their effects at no time have been serious. Probably there is 
some connection between the earthquakes and the numerous ex- 
tinct volcanoes in this neighbourhood. 

Topographical Appearances. — The scenery around Loch Earn, 
and along the river Earn, is rugged and picturesque, richly wood- 
ed on both sides, and hardly if at all inferior to the scenery of the 
Trosachs in the next parish. There is a beautiful cascade at 
Glenbeich, on the north side of Lochearn, seldom visited and little 
known. There are several on the Lednock, particularly the Cal- 
dron, a mile from Comrie, and a few on the smaller streams, as at 
Dunira, Aberuchill, and Ardvorlich. Few parishes can abound more 
in varied and striking natural beauties. The views from Lord Mel- 
ville's monument above the village of Comrie, and from the road 
to Glenartney, are peculiarly fine. The road from Crieff to Loch- 
earnhead passes through a district that is surpassed in natural and 
acquired beauties perhaps by no other of equal extent in the High- 
lands, and being within so convenient a distance from Edinburgh, 
Glasgow, Perth, and Dundee, is well worth the attention of tourists. 

Geology. — The prevailing rock of this district, in common with 
the other parts of the Grampian range, is the mica slate, con- 
taining in the western part of the parish, at Lochearnside and 
in Glenartney, a very extensive bed of primitive limestone. Granite 
also occurs in Glen Lednock, and extensive rocks of clay-slate in 
Glenartney. In the lower part of the parish, as well as in Glen- 
artney, the old red sandstone formation occurs, and also conglo- 
merate, or plum-pudding stone. Marble has been found at Ardvor- 
lich. Lead has been met with in small quantities. Iron ore is 
abundant, and seems at a remote period to have been wrought to 
a considerable extent. Many remains of furnaces for smelting iron 
are to be seen in different parts of the parish. 

Clay occurs rarely, and is mixed with sand. The soil is al- 
most universally a light, sharp gravel, abounding with stones, and 
not very fertile. In some parts of the glens, it approaches more 
to a loamy nature. 

Zoology.— Of rarer animals there are found the red-deer and 
roe in considerable numbers. At the head of Glenartney, to the 
south-east of Benvorlich, Lord Willoughby de Eresby has a pre- 
serve of red-deer, containing several hundreds. It was here that

PERTHSHIRE. 



Sir Walter Scott laid the commencement of the chase in the Lady 
of the Lake. The ptarmigan, and the alpine or white hare are found 
in a few of the higher hills. The moor-fowl and black-cock are 
abundant on most of the estates. The goats that formerly were 
abundant in this parish, as well as the hill horses, have now almost 
disappeared. 

In the rivers the salmon appears in June or July, and spawns in 
October or November. The sea-trout generally appears in July 
or August in the Ruchill only, it being remarked that they are 
scarcely ever found in the Earn above its junction with the Ruchill, 
although it is the larger stream, while they go up to within a mile of 
the source of the Ruchill. Trout of good quality are found in the 
lake and river Earn ; perch also occur rarely. Abundance of small 
trout are found in the Lednock, and in the Boltachan, a hill loch 
above Dunira. In Loch Earn, char of excellent quality is found ; 
but, from ignorance of its habits, the fishery has never been pro- 
secuted, although from the demand for that fish in the English 
markets, a reasonable prospect of success might be anticipated. 

Woods. — There are extensive natural woods of oak, ash, birch, 
alder, and hazel, and a large revenue is derived by the proprietors 
from the annual cuttings of oak-coppice. The soil is peculiarly 
adapted for oak and ash. There are several natural grown oaks 
at Aberuchill, about 15 feet in circumference. The trunk of an 
ash at Wester Fenglen, on the estate of Ardvorlich, is 17 feet 9 
inches in circumference. Firs of different kinds with larch have 
been extensively planted, and have thriven well. Where the soil is 
dry, rocky, and sloping, the larch thrives best. The Scotch fir 
grows best where the soil is dry, and barren, with a mixture of peat. 
When the subsoil is moist and tilly, the spruce and silver fir thrive 
well. 

II. — Civil History. 
There are, in several places, remains of Druidical temples, and 
large upright stones. Tradition reports that Dundurn was a 
preaching station of Fillan, the Culdee Saint, and at Dun Fillan, 
the hill overhanging the old church of Dundurn, is a holy well 
at which many Popish superstitions were practised, even so lately 
as at the date of the last Statistical Account. These happily are 
now abandoned. Fifty years ago, there were very distinct remains 
of two Roman camps at Dalginross. The larger camp is now 
obliterated by the plough. This station seems to have been con- 
nected with those at Ardoch and Strageath, and a Roman road 

3 



COMRIE. 



583 



ran from it eastward, down through Strathearn. It has been sup- 
posed that the battle described by Tacitus between Agricola and 
Galgacus took place on the plain of Dalginross, or, at all events, 
that it was in this camp that the ninth legion sustained their disas- 
trous night attack from the Caledonians. These suppositions re- 
ceive some countenance from local traditions and etymologies of 
the names of neighbouring places. 

The noted outlawry of the clan Gregor originated in this pa- 
rish. The Reformation, though then triumphant in the south of 
Scotland, had evidently benefited this district as little, as to this 
day, the south of Ireland. Drummond of Drummondernoch, a 
forester of James VI., having in 1588 cut off the ears of some 
M'Gregors whom he had found trespassing in the royal forest of 
Glenartney, they, with the aid of clansmen, soon after murdered 
him, and after savagely exhibiting his head to his sister, Mrs Stew- 
art of Ardvorlich, upon her own table, carried it to Balquhidder 
Kirk, where the M'Gregors assembling on the Sabbath, and each 
man laying his hand on the bloody head, they swore to make com- 
mon cause with the murderers. This outrage and contempt of 
Royalty, at the time when James was on his marriage excursion 
to Denmark, brought upon the clan Gregor, by royal proclama- 
tion, the vengeance of neighbour clans, and the proscription of 
their very name. To this day, there are many of the clan in this 
parish who are known both by their original surname, so long pro- 
scribed, and by their adopted names of Murray or Drummond. 

Sir James Campbell, Lord Aberuchill, and the first Viscount 
Melville, were connected by residence with this parish ; the for- 
mer a Presbyterian, and defender of the Whig government at the 
British Revolution of 1688, — most of the gentry of Strathearn be- 
ing then Episcopalian or Popish Jacobites. A very handsome 
and conspicuous monument has been erected on the hill oyer the 
village of Comrie to the memory of Lord Melville, by his friends 
in Perthshire. Dunira was his favourite residence during the in- 
tervals of parliamentary duties, and by him the extensive mansion 
house was erected. Mr Menzies, the minister of this parish in 
1745, rode to Carlisle, and, by his intercession with the Duke of 
Cumberland, is said to have saved the lives of many of his pa- 
rishioners who had joined the Pretender's army under the Earl of 
Perth. 

 Vide the Royal Proclamation, which distinctly states that the murder was commit- 
ted by the clan Gregor.

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, Lord and Lady Wil- 
loughby de Eresby ; Sir David Dundas, Bart, of Dunira ; Mrs Wil- 
liamson of Lawers ; Thomas Graham Stirling, Esq. of Dalginross ; 
James Drummond, Esq. of Strageath ; Robert Stewart, Esq. of 
Ardvorlich. The Marquis of Breadalbane is connected with the 
part of this parish annexed, quoad sacra, to Balquhidder. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers consist of ten 
volumes ; the date of their earliest entry is 1693. The money trans- 
actions seem to have been always regularly recorded, and the re- 
cords of marriages and baptisms are tolerably full. I find from 
the records of Presbytery, which commence in 1 660, that there 
have been three presbyterial visitations of this parish ; one on Au- 
gust 7th 1678, under the system of pseudo- Episcopacy, then esta- 
blished, at which time it is noticed that there were eight elders, 
who were exhorted to assist the minister in censuring faults, and 
additional elders were ordered to be elected. A second visitation 
took place on June 10th 1707, when the elders were exhorted 
to their respective duties as Christians and elders, and particularly 
to be careful to attend on meetings with their minister and among 
themselves for prayer, religious converse, and privy censures. 
The third visitation was on 20th August 1718. 

The ministers of this parish since the Revolution were, Mr John 
M'Allum, ordained in 1702, translated in 1710 to the parish of 
Callander; Mr Dugald Campbell, inducted 1711; Mr Adam 
M'Adam, inducted 1721 ; Mr Andrew Mushet, inducted 1723 ; 
Mr iEneas Shaw, inducted 1731 ; Mr Robert Menzies, ordained 
in 1743; Mr Hugh M'Diarmid, admitted 1781; Mr Patrick 
M'Isaac, admitted 1802 ; Mr William Mackenzie, ordained 1829. 
All the ministers previous to Mr M'Diarmid appear to have been 
inducted on the call of the heritors, elders, &amp;c. 

Antiquities. — A very curious relic of antiquity has been preserved 
in the family of Ardvorlich, from a very remote period. It is ap- 
parently a lump of pure white rock crystal, about the size and 
shape of a large egg, bound with four bands of silver of very an- 
tique workmanship. Over a considerable district of the country, 
it is known by the Gaelic name of the Clach Deary, which means 
the red stone, arising probably from a reddish tinge it appears to 
have, when held up to the light. The water in which the stone 
had been dipped, has been considered a sovereign remedy in all 
diseases of cattle, and many persons even from distant parts of 
the district are in the habit of resorting to Ardvorlich to procure 



COMRIE. 



585 



the water; but, like all similar objects of superstitious reverence, it 
is fast losing its repute. It is supposed by. antiquarians, that this 
relic, as well as several others of a similar kind, is of Druidical 
workmanship. One precisely similar in every respect to this, is to 
be seen on the top of the Scottish sceptre preserved in the Castle 
of Edinburgh. Some have asserted that this kind of stone was 
the official badge of the Archdruids. 

Mansion-Houses. — The chief modern buildings in the parish 
are, the mansion-houses of Dunira, Aberuchill, Ardvorlich, Dal- 
honzie, and Comrie House. The parish church is a plain, sub- 
stantial building, with a spire, forming a striking feature in the 
landscape. An excellent parish school has lately been erected. 

III. — Population. 
The amount of population, so far as it can be traced, has varied 



little for upwards of a century. 

Dr Webster in 1755 stated it to be, - 2546 

At the period of the last Statistical Account, it was said to be, 3000 

The Parliamentary census of 1 800 stated it at, - 2458

The population of the district annexed quoad sacra to Balqu- 
hidder, which at present amounts to 205, so far as known, has 
never been counted in this parish, unless perhaps by the writer of 
the last Statistical Account. 

The soil and situation of the parish form a natural barrier against 
the increase of population. Education having been general since 
the beginning of last century by means of the parish school, and 
by several schools maintained by the Society for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge, the people were enterprising and ready to 
emigrate when they felt straitened at home. Many have emigrat- 
ed to Canada, during the last twenty or thirty years. The system 
of enlarging the farms and introducing sheep greatly diminished 
the agricultural population at the beginning of this century ; but 
the villages which were then in process of being feued, kept up the 
population of the parish at its usual amount. The high war prices 
of hand-loom weaving, at the same time, encouraged the village 
system. The village population at present amounts to 1666, and 
the country population to 1010. 

The register of births being imperfect, and that of deaths be- 



,386 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ing more so, it is difficult to give their yearly averages. There 
being 446 children in the parish under seven years of age, 65 may 
be the yearly average of births. The average of marriages is 15 
for each of the last seven years. 

There are nine proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and 
upwards ; and of these only three are resident, and one other re- 
sides during the summer months in the parish. 

The parish maintains three lunatics at the Perth Asylum ; be- 
sides whom, there are at least ten fatuous persons at present, one 
blind man, and five deaf and dumb, three of whom have received 
instruction in the Edinburgh Asylum, chiefly through the liberali- 
ty of the Dunira family. 

The English language is generally spoken, and has gained 
ground greatly within the last forty years. At present, scarcely a 
fourth part of the congregation attend on the afternoon Gaelic ser- 
vice, whereas forty years ago, the attendance on English was very li- 
mited. An annual meeting for the encouragement and exhibition of 
Highland games and dress was, some years ago, instituted under 
high patronage at St Fillans. It is now kept up with very great 
difficulty, and probably will soon be discontinued. A great im- 
provement has taken place in the habits of the people, in re- 
spect of cleanliness in their persons and houses ; about three- 
fourths of their houses being slated, and plastered, and their dress 
being in general bought, not homespun, as formerly. Their ordi- 
nary food is potatoes, milk, and oatmeal. The use of wheat 
bread is becoming general, though no wheat is ever raised in the 
parish. There are three butchers, two brewers, three bakers, 
and more than twelve grocers ; and there are annually consum- 
ed in the parish upwards of 1567 lbs. of tobacco, 1749 lbs. 
of snuff, at 4s. per lb., and 2000 gallons of spirits at 9s. 6d. ; 
3000 lbs. of tea at 5s., and 16,000 lbs. of sugar at 8d; making 
for these items a sum total of L. 3000, or of L. 1, 3s. for each in- 
dividual to spend upon these articles of luxury. While the high 
duties were on spirits, there was much smuggling in this parish, 
which experience proved to be most detrimental not only to the 
morals, but to the temporal interests of all engaged in it ; now, 
however, it scarcely, if at all, exists. There is a good deal of 
poaching, although the game and fish are carefully watched. 

Upon the whole, it is believed that the advantages of edu- 
cation which this parish has so long enjoyed, and of ample 
church accommodation, and above all the preaching of the 



COMRIE. 



587 



Gospel, have to a manifest degree operated beneficially on the 
intellectual, moral, and religious character of the body of the 
people. The intelligence of the agricultural class, the religion 
of the manufacturing, and the morality of both classes, are hence, 
it is believed, above the average. They read and think for 
themselves, and are not liable to be carried about by every wind 
of opinion. They are, on the whole, honest, sober, frugal, and 
industrious. Only on one occasion during the last seven years, 
was there anything like a serious disturbance on the streets, and 
that was at]a market, by some young men, who beat each other, and, 
being taken before the Sheriff, at once confessed, and were dismissed 
with a fine. Although there has been an endeavour to exercise 
scripturally strict discipline, no more than about two dozen of per- 
sons are under sentence of exclusion excluded from church commu- 
nion for offences of all sorts. All parents shew a laudable desire to 
educate their children. The public ordinances of religion are well 
attended; and the Sabbath is observed with great outward decorum. 
Some time ago, a south country proprietor, on a visit in this parish, 
wishing to send away his luggage by a cart on the Sabbath, could 
not get an individual in the parish who would do this, for favour or 
money. But, with all our external morality and religion, the vi- 
vifying power of the gospel of Jesus Christ seems to be not much 
sought or experienced amongst us. 

IV. — Industry. 

In so extensive a parish, it is difficult to obtain accurate statis- 
tics of agriculture ; and on various points, we cannot even reach ap- 
proximations to the truth. The proprietors, or their factors on all 
the estates, have politely furnished answers to the queries sent to 
them ; and from these, it is calculated that the number of acres, 
standard imperial measure, in the parish, which are either cultivated 
or occasionally in tillage, amounts to 7097 ; waste or in pasture 
55,571; improvable, 1865; common or disputed, 1315; under 
wood, 3139. The quoad civilia portion attached to Balquhidder 
may contain 250 acres arable, and 3500 acres of pasture. 

Oak coppice is the species of wood most attended to ; and in the 
larger properties, there are twenty-two annual hags or cuttings, 
which, sold by auction, amount to the annual value of L. 1248. 

Rent— The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 6s. per acre, 
and of hill pasture 2s. per acre, making the average rental of the 
parish to be L. 12,000. The valued rent amounted to L. 344, 8s. 
10±d. Sterling, or L. 4133, 6s. 8d. Scots, so that the actual rental 



588 



PERTHSHIRE. 



is thirty-four times the amount of the valued rent. The average 
rent of grazing is for an ox or cow L. 2 for the summer half year, 
and for a sheep in the low grounds 8s., on hill pasture 3s. 6d. 

Wages. — The wages of men farm-servants are L. 13, and of wo- 
men L. 6, 6s. a year. 

Live-Stock. — On the estate of Lawers, which is chiefly in the 
hands of the proprietor, most attention has been paid to the im- 
provement of sheep. The late enterprising proprietor, Lord Bal- 
gray, reported " that the ordinary breed of sheep is the black-faced. 
These have been improved, entirely by introducing the best breeds 
from Crawford Muir, Dumfries-shire. Some years ago, the Che- 
viots were introduced, and they thrive well, and have been very pro- 
fitable. Of late years, Leicester sheep have been also introduced 
with much advantage, by taking cross-bred lambs from black-faced 
ewes. The wool on Lawers has been much improved and doubled 
in weight within the space of ten years. The most beneficial salve 
which has been found, is the tar and butter." 

The Ayrshire breed of cows has been very generally introduced, 
and its excellence kept up by superior animals purchased by the 
proprietors. Some good stocks of the best Highland breed are 
also to be found in the higher parts of the parish. 

In regard to the general character of the husbandry pursued, the 
very intelligent land -steward reports as to the Perth estate, which 
extends over the upper districts south and west : " The arable 
land is stated at the utmost extent, and comprehends all that was 
ever subjected to the plough, and, in my opinion, more than is so 
at the present time, as a great part of the land called arable in 
that quarter is found to pay better, as pasture, except what may 
be necessary for the support of the people and stock in the winter, 
being mostly pasture or grazing farms. The tenant's principal de- 
pendence is stock, the preservation and improvement of it is his 
chief object. The general husbandry, in the pasture farms, is al- 
ternate white and green crops, and long rested as pasture." 

In the low grounds, the usual system is a rotation of five years, 
in the order of oats, green crop, barley, and grass seeds, — hay 
pasture. There is no wheat grown in the parish. The soil is 
excellently adapted for potatoes, barley, and oats, and, if largely 
manured, produces heavy crops. The deep soil ploughing has 
not yet been introduced. 

On the estates of Aberuchill and Ardvorlich, the cultivated 
land has been doubled during the last forty years ; and a large 

4 



COM IDE. 



589 



quantity has been reclaimed on Dunira of late, and in the time of 
Lord Melville. It is stated respecting Lawers, that any land at- 
tempted to be improved appears to be improved at an expense which 
affords no remuneration ; and respecting the Perth estate, that 
forty or fifty acres have recently been converted from bog and pas- 
ture to arable land, and about one-half of w hich will return to pasture. 

Leases. — Leases, when principally of grazing farms, run from 
nine to eleven years ; and when of arable, always nineteen years. 

The farm-buildings and enclosures are generally sufficient for 
the farm, and are in the course of improvement. 

Improvements. — The improvements recently made in the parish 
consist of drainage, enclosures, the erection of suitable farm-stead- 
ings, irrigation, turning useless marshes into profitable hay-mea- 
dows, and planting woods. The oak woods have been brought 
under a regular system of management; the vacancies planted 
up with oak, and the barren wood destroyed. Much might still 
be done, and is now in course of being done. The hill pastures 
are susceptible of very considerable improvement, were the prac- 
tice followed in the south of Scotland, of cutting open drains along 
the hills, generally introduced. Little, however, has been done 
in that way, except on the estate of Lawers. A whole farm has 
lately been reclaimed by the proprietor of Dalginross, so as to 
yield a fair return ; and various other improvements have been 
made on that property. 

The lime -quarry at the head of Lochearn in the quoad civilia 
district of the parish greatly improves the agriculture of the dis- 
trict. A boat-load, containing from sixty to seventy bolls, may 
be had, burnt, for L. 3 or L. 4 ; and usually thirty bolls are ap- 
plied to an acre. Manure is sold at from 4s. to 5s. the cubic yard. 

Quarries. — There are two slate quarries on the Perth, and 
another on the Aberuchill estates. Both are wrought, though 
not extensively, and seem to yield a fair return. There are a 
number of whinstone quarries. 

Gross Produce. — I cannot ascertain with any accuracy the ave- 
rage gross amount of raw produce reared in the parish. The fol- 
lowing is a specimen. 

The farm of Tullybannocher, on Dunira estate, possessed by 
Mr M'Isaac, is the largest arable farm in the parish. It contains, 
in Scots acres, 270 arable, and 1200 uncultivated land ; and the 
average rent is L. 1, 10s. per acre. He grows annually, on an 
average of years, 250 quarters of barley, 350 quarters of oats, 27 



590 



PERTHSHIRE. 



acres of turnips, 8 acres of potatoes, and 80 tons of hay, clover, 
and rye-grass. 

At Mr M' Isaac's distillery, the malt made from 10th October 
1835 to 10th October 1836 was 7098 bushels. The whisky dis- 
tilled during the same period was 18,546 gallons; and the whisky 
sold and consumed within the parish, 1498 gallons. 

Manufactures. — The manufacture of cotton and woollen cloth 
is carried on in this parish. The hand-loom cotton weavers are 
employed by houses in Glasgow and Perth. During the winter 
months, 136 hand-loom weavers are employed; and of these one- 
tenth are employed only during three months of winter. The re- 
maining 120 may, on an average, earn Is. per day, for 280 days in 
the year, — that is, deducting thirty days in harvest, and Sundays 
and other occasional vacant days, sixty-five. Of these there are 
about 50 heads of families who have each good gardens, and a 
patch of potatoes, and a pig, which may add about L. 4, 10s. to 
each family's income. 

The only woollen manufacture is carried on at the river Led- 
nock, in the village of Comrie. Eleven men and eight children are 
employed at the mill, and five persons are employed out-of-doors. 

There are several streams in the parish, affording excellent 
water-power for manufactures, which might afford eligible in- 
vestments for capital, were the contemplated railroad brought to 
the neighbourhood. But the distances from market, and commu- 
nication, and coals, will always form a heavy drawback. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The village of Comrie, with the adjoining villages of Dalginross 
and Ross, contains a population of 1469. The chief trade is cot- 
ton weaving. It is a burgh of barony. The baron bailie appointed 
by the superior, Sir David Dundas, resides in Perth. There are 
a number of constables, and one is paid by the heritors, to peram- 
bulate the villages and keep away vagrants. There is much need 
of an effective system of police for all the villages in this part of 
Perthshire. The four villages of Comrie, Dalginross, Ross, and 
St Fillans have populations respectively of 978, 337, 154, 197. 
Crieff, in which is held a weekly market, is six and a-half miles 
distant from Comrie. 

Means of Communication. — In Comrie, there is a sub-post office 
to Crieff ; its annual revenue is about L. 120. The length of 
turnpike roads does not exceed twenty miles. No public carriage 
travels upon them. There is a weekly carrier to Edinburgh and 



COMIIIE. 



591 



to Perth ; and one thrice a week to Crieff. The Killin carrier pas- 
ses weekly through Comrie. There are three stone bridges upon 
the Earn, three on the Lednock, and one on the Ruchill ; and there 
are five wooden bridges upon these rivers, all in good repair. 
There are no canals or railroads, although there have been pro- 
posals to make one or other between Perth and Loch Earn. Farm 
produce and lime might be exported, and coals might be import- 
ed by a canal or railroad, to the great benefit of the district, but, 
it is to be feared, without corresponding advantage to the share- 
holders. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, situated in the village 
of Comrie, at the eastern extremity of the parish, is convenient for 
the greater part of the population. There are 674 persons resid- 
ing farther than three miles from it, 107 houses are more than 
four miles, and 30 houses are more than six miles distant from 
it. Having been built in 1805 it is in good repair. The accom- 
modation is for 1044 sitters, at eighteen inches each, and there 
are no seat rents. 

The manse was built in 1784, and an addition was made to it 
in 1822. There are two glebes ; that of Tullychetal at the manse, 
which is a mile and a quarter from the church, contains eight acres, 
for which L. 1, 10s. per acre would be a high rent. The glebe 
of Comrie, adjacent to the village, contains four acres of good soil, 
and has drawn a rent of L. 12. The stipend consists of 16 chal- 
ders of victual, and an allowance of L. 10 for communion elements ; 
the average value in money for the last seven years is L. 244. 

There is a chapel at Dundurn, five miles west of the parish 
church ; in which the parish minister appears, for a long time back, 
to have been in the habit of preaching every fourth Sabbath. In 
1834, this chapel was almost rebuilt by subscription, and is seated 
for 400 persons. For the last three years, a preacher having been 
engaged at a salary of upwards of L. 60, raised by subscription, to 
officiate in the chapel and neighbouring district, not only have the 
population around Loch Earn, amounting to upwards of 800, and 
many of them much more than five miles distant from any church, 
been supplied with religious ordinances, but also 800 sitters in 
the church of Comrie are no longer deprived of preaching every 
fourth Sunday. An endowment would lead to the immediate esta- 
blishment of a parish at Loch Earn side, and is much needed. 

There has been a small body of Seceders in this parish, almost 
since the commencement of the Secession in Scotland. The per- 



592 



PERTHSH1K E. 



sonal influence of Ralph Erskine is said to have originated it. 
The established pulpit was not very efficiently supplied at the time, 
and the obligation on the minister to leave the parish church va- 
cant once a month by going to Dundurn, occasioned a deficiency in 
the ministrations of the national church, which it was most desir- 
able and commendable to supply. The necessity of conducting 
public worship in two languages gave a farther opening to the Se- 
cession, by leaving the increasing English portion of the congrega- 
tion with only one-half of the ordinary Sabbath ministrations. For 
a time the Secession provided sermon only on the fourth Sabbath, 
when the parish church was vacant. The minister has a house 
and garden, and is said to receive a stipend of L. 90. 

About half a dozen individuals occasionally attend the Episco- 
palian chapel at Muthill. The Roman Catholics, since the last 
Statistical Account, have completely disappeared from this parish. 
According to the best information that could be procured, when re- 
plies were returned to the statistical queries of the Royal Commis- 
sioners and General Assembly, there were of persons of all ages 
belonging to the Established Church 2357, and of persons belong- 
ing to other denominations 317; of communicants belonging to 
the Established Church 1195, and to other denominations 157. 

Education. — According to the report sent to the General As- 
sembly for 1836, there were seven schools in this parish, besides 
four Sabbath and three week-day evening schools, viz. one paro- 
chial school ; two schools on teachers' own adventure ; three sup- 
ported in part by individual subscription ; and one by subscription 
of the inhabitants of the district. The winter attendance at the 
seven day schools amounted to one in every five of the popu- 
lation. Besides the common branches taught in all the schools, 
the parish teacher instructs in Greek, French, and mathema- 
tics. The modern improvements of the Normal and Sessional 
School of Edinburgh, and the training school of Glasgow, have 
been introduced with success. The salaries amount to about 
L. 71, and the probable amount of fees per annum to L. 90, be- 
sides the value of the legal accommodations of an excellent house 
and garden provided to the parochial teacher, and of three houses 
and of land for three cows, provided for three other teachers. The 
fees in all the schools are, per quarter, 2s. for English ; 2s. 6d. for 
English and writing ; 3s. for English, writing, and arithmetic ; and 
5s. for Latin, inclusive of every other branch. There are none 
between six and fifteen years of age who cannot read or write; and, 



COMRIE. 



593 



so far as is known, there are no natives of this parish above fifteen 
years of age who cannot read or write. The people are much alive 
to the benefits of education. With the exception of the parochial 
teacher, the others are in no better circumstances than day-la- 
bourers ; and, from inability to support his family, one of them has 
lately exchanged his school for a weaver's loom. Small endow- 
ments are much needed in two or three districts, especially in 
Glenlednock, where, for want of one, a teacher is engaged by the 
inhabitants only during winter. The facilities of education have 
not been materially increased since last Statistical Account. 

Libraries. — There is a parochial library at Comrie, containing 
about 500 volumes. It was commenced in 1822. The subscription 
is 2s. annually, and the annual proceeds amount to about L. 7. 
There is also a small subscription library at St Fillans ; and a small 
circulating library in Comrie. There is no public reading-room,— 
every weaver's shop and farm-house being more or less employed 
for this purpose. No newspaper is printed in the parish, but a 
sufficient number is sent to it. 

Friendly Societies.— There were three, and are now two, Friendly 
Societies in the parish. The Friendly Society of Weavers was in- 
stituted in 1805, and dissolved in 1834. The capital then was 
L. 270 ; the members were 200 ; the widows, 10. St Fillans High- 
land Society was instituted in 1819; present capital, L. 100; mem- 
bers about 60 ; widows on fund, 3. The Mason's Society com- 
menced in 1818; capital at present, L. 450 ; members, 320 ;] wi- 
dows on fund, 16. This Society is yearly increasing in numbers 
and capital. Neither of the Friendly Societies has as yet taken the 
benefit of the Lord Advocate's bill for regulating Friendly Socie- 
ties ; but means are at present employed to obtain this benefit for 
the Mason's Society. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was established in 1815, by the 
heritors and minister. It affords an example of the evils of the 
old law now happily repealed, which did not extend to Scot- 
land the same protection and facilities, as to the English Savings 
Banks. The funds used at first to be transmitted to Crieff, and 
lodged in the hands of the agent of the Leith Bank in that place. 
In 1823, when the deposits amounted to L. 500, that agent failed. 
The directors expected that the Leith Bank would be responsible 
for the amount, as having been lodged in the hands of their ac- 
knowledged agent ; but the directors of that establishment denied 

that the money had ever been entered into their books. In this di- 
perth. p p

/ 



lemma, the directors of the Comrie Bank obtained upon their bond 
L. 300 from the Commercial Bank, in order to pay off the most 
clamant of the depositors, and to carry on operations until a settle- 
ment could be procured with the Leith Bank. This has not yet 
been obtained ; and consequently, although the savings bank is still 
doing business, it is comparatively on a limited scale. The amount 
deposited since 1823 is above L. 1200, being an average of L. 90 
per annum ; the number of depositors 250, consisting of all 
classes of labourers, but especially of servant girls. The sum ac- 
tually deposited at present is about L. 600. About L. 300 of the 
sum invested, previous to the failure in 1823, have been paid up 
from the funds of the bank, or from the pockets of individual di- 
rectors. 

Poor. — The average number of paupers is 55, of whom 45 re- 
ceive an average monthly aliment of 4s. 2d.; and 10 are occasion- 
ally aided. There are three lunatics in Perth asylum, who cost 
the heritors L. 60 a-year. The annual expense of the poor is 
thus about L. 180. The practical management of the poor funds 
is in the hands of deacons, who hold a monthly meeting, and their 
proceedings are reviewed at an annual meeting of the heritors and 
kirk-session. The ordinary church collections average L. 90 per 
annum : about L. 12 accrue from marriages and funerals ; and 
during the last twenty years, one legacy of L. 180, and another of 
L. 50 have been received. 

Since 1816, there has been a voluntary assessment paid by the 
heritors, amounting to L. 40 ; a good deal is given in private charity 
by heritors and other individuals. There is little disposition among 
the poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief, and it is not con- 
sidered so degrading as before the commencement of the village 
system, and of friendly societies. 

There is a small lock-up-house in the village of Comrie, erected 
about three years ago, but it has been scarcely, if at all, used. 
The great distance of this parish from the county town makes it 
necessary to have a place of security to lodge vagrants and disor- 
derly characters for a single night, or at least that they should be 
aware that such a place is at hand. The village constable, paid 
by the heritors, keeps the key. 

Fairs. — There are five annual fairs held in Comrie, in the 
months of March, May, July, November, and December. The 

principal of these are, St Kessack's on the third Wednesday of 

3 



COM R IE. 



595 



March, and Clog Market on the first Wednesday of December. 
The Crieff fairs are the principal ones in this district. 

Inns, £c.— There are 13 inns or alehouses in the parish, licen- 
sed to sell spirits. The number of licensed houses may not be so 
great in proportion to our population as in several neighbouring- 
parishes ; but it is far too high. Four would be quite sufficient 
for the real wants of the public, and the excess of nine is a source 
of deplorable evil to the morals of the people. Efforts have been 
made to get the number reduced, which were so far successful, that 
from being 16 in 1829 they were reduced to 11; but, in opposi- 
tion to the strongest remonstrances from the kirk-session, the Jus- 
tices have lately seen fit to add to the number of these moral pest- 
houses. The excise returns give 1874 gallons as the quantity 
retailed in the parish last year. 

i_Coals, wood, and peat are the fuel used in the parish. 
The coals are carried from Bannockburn, a distance of twenty-two 
miles, and cost generally Is. the cwt. At the annual sales of peel- 
ed oak, a cart load can be had for about 5s. Peats are distant, 
and not very accessible ; they cost 4s. the cart load. It is stated 
in the last Statistical Account, that the greatest disadvantage un- 
der which many parts of the parish labour, is the scarcity and high 
price of fuel. This disadvantage is still greatly felt, but the mak- 
ing of a shorter road from Bannockburn across the hill between 
Ardoch and Comrie, and the increased quantity of oak coppice 
since that time, have both tended to diminish the price of fuel. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Many changes have taken place in this parish since 1795. 
While the population has continued stationary in amount, it 
has been changed in two respects ; from being resident in farms 
it has come to be chiefly resident in villages, and from using the 
Gaelic it now generally uses the English language. The High- 
land dress is entirely disused. Proprietors have diminished in 
number to one-half, while their rental has been quadrupled. The 
system of small farms has been put down ; considerable enterprize 
has been shown in the improvement of land and stock ; by means 
of green crops and sown grass, a proper system of rotations has 
been introduced ; excellent farming utensils are in use ; capital and 
skill have greatly increased, so that, instead of farm produce being 
imported, a good deal is now exported from the parish. The roads 
have been exceedingly improved, and a new road to the south has 
been of great benefit. The manufacture of linen yarn, plaids, and 



506 



PERTHSHIRE. 



tartan, has given place to handloom cotton weaving. The coarse 
woollen manufactory, desiderated in the last Statistical Account, 
has been set up and is useful. The small whisky stills that con- 
sumed 1200 bolls of barley, have all been put down, and a large legal 
distillery performs their functions. Wages are doubled, and pau- 
perism has increased fourfold. The small old and ruinous parish 
church has been replaced by a commodious erection, and the 
chapel at Dundurn has been renewed and supplied with regular 
preaching. The attendance at the Established Church has in- 
creased ; education has continued stationary in quantity, but greatly 
improved in quality ; the " Papists" have disappeared, and the 
" Antiburgher Seceders in the village," have become Voluntary 
Dissenters. 

As to the improvements of which the parish is susceptible, a 
canal or railroad, chiefly for the import of coal and export of lime, 
slates, cotton goods, and farm produce, might, if practicable, benefit 
the parish. A road to Loch-Tayside through Glen-Lednock would 
be advantageous. 

If an endowment could be procured to supply the inhabitants 
of Lochearnside with an ordained and resident minister, and if 
at least one endowment were given for an additional school in the 
village of Comrie, and if the Dissenters could be persuaded to co- 
operate as brethren with the Established Church, and an endowment 
procured for their minister, so as that there might be as formerly 
three endowed ministers freely chosen by their congregations, and 
three parishes each with a population of about 1000 souls, — the in- 
terests of religion, education, and morality would be greatly pro- 
moted in this large district, the pressing danger of compulsory pau- 
perism averted, sectarian and party bitterness would be greatly re- 
moved, and while a better system of preparation for eternity would 
be thus instituted, present benefits of great value would, under the 
Divine Blessing, be largely reaped — according to the promise, 
" Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and 
all other things shall be added to you."

PRESBYTERY OF DU MFERMLINE, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. A. B. DUNCAN, I MINISTERS. 
THE REV. JOHN BALFOUR, J 



I —Topography and Natural History. 

Name __The name is considered to be of Gaelic origin ; and 
to be compounded of two words, Cul and Ross, the former signi- 
fying back or side, and the latter a Peninsula : and this meaning 
is certainly descriptive of the town and parish, lying as they do 
at the back or side of that tract of country, comprehended between 
the Friths of Forth and Tay, and which in ancient times went 
under the general name of Ross. The barony of Kincardine, on 
the west, formerly belonged to this parish, but was disjoined in 
the year 1672, and added to Tulliallan. It lies on the north bank 
of the Frith of Forth ; the land, particularly that part where the 
town is situated, rising abruptly from the shore. 

The surface of the parish is generally undulating, with consider- 
able elevation of ground towards the north and north-west, but con- 
taining no hills. It is about 4 miles in extent from east to west, and 
about the same from north to south. The soil which extends along 
the shore is, for the most part, very fertile, being of a black loam. 
Towards the middle, it is generally of a clayey nature ; but being ge- 
nerally abundantly fertile, and when under active mangement, which 
is almost universally the case, it produces very heavy crops of all 
kinds. Towards the north and north-west, the soil is naturally much 
poorer ; but even there, a great deal has been done since the date 
of the former Account, in the way of improvement ; and the laud is, 
for the most part, either brought into a state of cultivation, oris under 
thriving plantations. It appears that the proprietors had, then and 
for some time before, begun to turn their serious attention to the 
rearing of wood. 

Geology.— The geological structure of the parish presents no- 
thing peculiar. The soil consists chiefly of clay, mixed in many 

 Drawn up by the Rev. A. B. Duncan. 



598 



PERTHSHIRE. 



parts with sand, resting on masses of sandstone and clay slate,— 
these two substances being laid in alternate strata, and forming slop- 
ing banks and eminences of considerable height ; and rendering 
the general surface of the parish extremely uneven. The dip of 
the strata is inclined to the north-west, at an angle varying from 
30 to 40 degrees. 

Coal mines were wrought here at one period, but are now too 
much exhausted to afford a profitable return. In some places, 
there is found good tenacious clay, of considerable depth and ex- 
tent, which might be turned to advantage in making bricks, tiles, 
&amp;c. There is also fire clay of good quality, fit for pottery, and 
which has been partially wrought. Thin seams of ironstone ap- 
pear in different places between the beds of clay slate, rich in ore, 
but not sufficient in quantity to defray the expense of working. 

A bed of limestone of about eight feet in thickness is found in 
one place, but at such an inclination as to be but partially wrought. 

Zoology. — In zoology, there are one or two species of animals 
met with in the parish, which are becoming rare. The roe,  Cer- 
vus capreolusj the most beautiful of the deer family, is frequent- 
ly seen : it is, however, much persecuted, being considered very de- 
structive to the young plantations. The badger has also been 
seen. The viper,  Coluber berus, the only species of the serpent 
tribe found in Scotland, is seen during the summer months bask- 
ing in the open sandy spaces among the heath. 

Botany. — A few of the rarer plants found here may be pointed 
out. Narcissus pseudo-narcissus is found in one spot growing 
abundantly, and has by some been supposed to be indigenous ; 
butthere is reason to think that its existence there, seemingly in 
a wild state, is owing to its having been cultivated in a garden, at 
one time situated there. Doronicum Pardalianches is found at a 
short distance from the last mentioned plant. The other plants 
which are not so common are, Adoxa moschatellina, Aquilegia vul- 
garis, Arum maculatum, Ballota nigra, Briza media, Chelidoni- 
ummajus, Cistus Lelianthemum, Corallorhiza innata, Nepeta cataria, 
Parietaria officinalis, Polygonum bistorta, Pyrola rotundifolia, So- 
lanum dulcamara, Trientalis Europea. 

II. — Civil History. 
Town. — The town was erected into a royal burgh in the year 
1588, by James VI., and, in conjunction with Stirling, Dunfermline, 
Queensferry, and Inverkeithing, sends a representative to Parlia- 
ment. The object of greatest historical interest is the Abbey or Mo- 



CULROSS. 



599 



nasteryof Culross, founded by Malcolm, Thane of Fife, m 1217. 
It occupies a commanding situation at the top of the town.; and 
some rather beautiful remains of it exist. The only part in good 
preservation is what now forms the parish church, and which was 
formerly the chapel of the monastery. It is in the form of a cross 
with a massive square tower on the west. 

The period at which the town seems to have attained its great- 
est importance, was about 200 years ago. Then, a very active 
trade in coal was carried on, the coal was conveyed to Holland, 
and from thatsupplies of various kinds of merchandise were brought 
back, and sent from this to other parts of the country. This trade 
has now, for a long period, entirely ceased ; and there does not even 
exist a supply for the parish,— the coals which are used being all 
brought from some distance. 

Another branch of trade and manufacture was established here, 
but which has now ceased. This consisted in the fabrication of 
girdles, a kitchen utensil, formerly much employed for toasting un- 
leavened cakes of oatmeal. The right of making girdles was se- 
cured to the girdlesmiths of Culross by patent, both from James 
VI. and Charles II. But the exclusive right was set aside by a 
decision of the Court of Session in 1727. But the decline in the 
manufacture which soon after took place, and which, at the date 
of the former Account, had proceeded so far, that the manufac- 
ture is said to have then almost entirely disappeared, is attri- 
buted not so much to the loss of the patent, as to the fact of the 
same article being made by the Carron Company at a much lower 
rate, and to the more general use of wheaten bread, which began 
then to prevail. 

Eminent Men. — In the history of the place, it is proper to men- 
tion the names of two distinguished individuals, who were both for 
some time ministers of Culross, viz. Drs Webster and Erskine, the 
former noted as the projector of the Ministers' Widows' Fund, 
and likewise as one of the most popular preachers of his time; and 
the other no less distinguished for his great personal piety and 
worth, and for his theological attainments and writings. It is pro- 
per also to mention the late Earl of Dundonald, who appears to 
have been a person of very considerable talent, and of no mean 
acquirements in natural science, as his discovery of the method of 
extracting tar from coal sufficiently proves. And his son, the 
present Earl of Dundonald, whose abilities and enterprise have 
illustrated the naval history of this and other countries, is a native 
of this parish.

dvM§vitm-~Nmt to the monastery, the object of greatest in 
terest is the house now called the Abbey of Culross, so called 
from its being situated in the immediate neighbourhood of the old 
abbey or monastery. It was built by Edward Lord Bruce of Kin- 
loss, about 200 years ago, and here it is said King James VI. was 
entertained when he visited the proprietors. The abbey with the 
lands annexed came into the possession of the Dundonald family 
by marriage, and both were purchased about thirty-five years ago 
by Sir Robert Preston of Valleyfield, Bart., to whose representa- 
tives they have descended since his death. 

The church of this place was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, 
and also to St Serf or Servanus, who resided here, and°who edu- 
cated St Mungo or Kentigern, the Patron Saint of Glasgow. 

The festival of St Serf was kept yearly on the 1st of July, when 
the inhabitants marched in procession, carrying green boughs. 
The custom has not altogether disappeared, although the day has 
been altered to the 4th of June, the birth day of his late Majesty 
George III. 

A convent was sent to the Abbey of Culross from the Abbey 
of Kinloss. The last abbot of this place was Alexander, son of 
Sir James Colvilleof Ochiltree, who was admitted a Lord of Ses- 
sion anno 1574. Sir James, brother of Alexander, was raised to 
the dignity of Lord Colville of Culross in 1609, when the King 
gave him a grant of the dissolved abbey. 

At the Reformation, the rental of the abbey amounted to 
L. 708, 16s. 7d. money; besides considerable payments in kind, 
of wheat, barley, oats, &amp;c. At that time there were nine monks 
in the convent of the Cistertian order. 

About a quarter of a mile to the west of the abbey, are the 
ruins of the former parish church ; but which, as appears from the 
terms of an act of Parliament of Charles I. sanctioning the use of 
the present, as the parish church had not been in use " in the 
memorie of man." 

At the east end of the town are the remains of a chapel, called St 
Mungo's Chapel, near to which, tradition says, that saint was born. 

Modern Buildings.— C\ose on the banks of the Forth, is a mo- 
dern house called Castle Hill, anciently Dunemarle, that is, the 
castle by or near the sea. The ancient castle of this name is said 
to have been a stronghold of the Macduffs, Thanes of Fife, and 
was considered to mark the utmost boundary of their dominion. Ac- 
cording to tradition, it was in the ancient Castle, only small vesti- 



CULUOSS. 



601 



ges of which now remain, that the murder of Lady Macduff and 
her children by order of Macbeth took place ; which event forms so 
prominentanincidentin Shakspeare's tragedy. Fartherwest, is Blair 
Castle, a handsome modern house ; the old house of the same name 
which was removed when the present one was erected, is said to 
have been built by Hamilton, Archbishop of St Andrews, about 
the time of the Reformation. In the east part of the parish, stands 
Valleyfield House, the seat of the Preston family, a handsome 
and commodious dwelling, surrounded with beautiful grounds. 
No noble family resides in the parish. 

Land-owners.— There are nine proprietors in the parish, in- 
cluding properties under the management of trustees whose pro- 
perties vary in value from L. 150 to about L. 2000 a year. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest date of the session records 
is the year 1646; they seem full and accurately kept from that 
year to 1662. There is a blank from that time till the year 
1676. Thence until the year 1684, they are again full. There 
is again a blank from that year to the year 1700; and from that 
period they continue without interruption to the present time. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish is not known previous to the year 
1755, when it amounted to 1695 ; in 1791, it was 1442 ; and by 
the census in 1831, it was 1484. A very considerable decrease, 
which took place from 1755 to 1791, is stated in the former Ac- 
count to have arisen from the improved system of agriculture and 
husbandry then introduced, by which as much work was accom- 
plished by one man, as formerly by three or four; and from the 
throwing of several small farms into one large, by which fewer hands 
came to be employed. Another great reason is stated to have been 
the loss or failure of several branches of trade and manufacture, 
which formerly employed from forty to fifty hands: something also 
must be imputed to the flourishing state of trade in Dunfermline and 
Glasgow, and to the carrying on of the numerous public buildings 
in Edinburgh, by which all the surplus hands were drained off.

From the great irregularity in registering baptisms, it is not easy 
to say with precision what the exact number of births may be ; but 
we think they may be safely reckoned at from 34 to 37 in the year. 

The average number of marriages for seven years, is 10 or 11; 
and of deaths for the same period, 26. In that period, 29 indivi- 
duals had attained the age of eighty and upwards, at the time of 
their death. One individual, the late Sir Robert Preston, was 
ninety-four. 

Number of unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers upwards of 50 years of age, 33 
women and widows upwards of 45, . . 50 

The calculation for the above statement was made in the year 
1835, and the population, as rated in the Government census of 
1831, is a little more. The difference amounting to 34 may be 
accounted for, by the circumstance that, in the latter year, a num- 
ber of workmen were employed about the repair of the abbey, 
many of whom were strangers, but fell to be rated in the return to 
Government. 

When manufactures are depressed, they who are engaged in 
them experience, of course, an abridgement of their comfort ; but, 
such seasons excepted, the inhabitants are perhaps as well off as 
any in similar situations through the country, and they are, general- 
ly speaking, contented and industrious. Many even of the hum- 
blest show an inclination for reading. 

The number of persons of all ages employed in weaving is about 
70, who are connected either with the Dunfermline linen manu- 
factures, or in working cotton cloths for the Glasgow trade. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agricultural Produce.— The soil of the parish has already been 
described, as also its general state as to cultivation ; and we give 
here a statement of the agricultural produce of the parish, with the 
value of the same.

Since the time of the former Account, the real rental has been 
more than doubled: nearly double the quantity of wheat is now 
raised ; more than double the quantity of potatoes ; and nine times 
the quantity of turnips. 

All sorts of trees are planted, but of hardwood, the oak and 
beech agree best with the soil of the parish. The management 
with respect to thinning and felling is very good. Since the date 
of the former Account, 306 acres have been added to the arable 
land of the parish, and 492 acres to the plantations. 

Leases.— The ordinary duration of farm leases is nineteen years, 
and the wages of a good ploughman L. 14 or L. 16, with perqui- 
sites. 

Rent of Land.— The rent of best land near the town is from 
L. 3 to L. 4. Land let in large farms through the parish varies 
from L. 1 to L. 2, 10s., and some in the worst situations, and of 
inferior quality, lets as low as 10s. and 15s. per acre. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town.— Although Culross is a royal burgh, it is not a 
market-town. Dunfermline, distant seven miles, is the chief mart 
for the produce of the parish. 

Villages.— There are two small villages in the parish besides 

the town. 

Means of Communication. — Since the date of the former Ac- 
count, the means of communication in the parish have been great- 
ly improved, owing to a turnpike road having been made through 
the parish from east to west, in place of the former incommodious 
post road along the sea shore. There are about four miles of the 
turnpike road in this parish. From the state of the shore being 
very shallow and rocky, there is, and can be, no good harbour, 
and as there is no trade the want of one is not felt. A small pier, 
which will be a great accommodation for the passage and fishing 
boats, has been lately constructed. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church stands at the upper part of the 



604 



pkhtiishirk. 



town, and although the northern district of the parish is rather dis- 
tant from it, it is well situate for the population, the great propor- 
tion of whom reside in the town. The church being part of the 
ancient monastery, the time of its erection is the same with that of 
the monastery. It had fallen, like most other old churches in the 
country, into a state of great disrepair; but about fifteen years ago, 
it received a most complete and judicious repair, and is now one 
of the most comfortable places of worship in the country; — while, 
from its structure and the ancient tower attached, it has all the 
venerable appearance which one expects to find in a building that 
dates so far back. It is seated for nearly 700. The communicants 
are above 400 in number. 

From a date upon it, it is probable the manse was built about 200 
years ago. Like the church, it had fallen into great disrepair, and 
it was substantially repaired, at the same time receiving a consi- 
derable addition, soon after the church was put in order. 

This parish is a collegiate charge. The second charge was 
founded about 200 years ago, when the town was in its most flou- 
rishing state,, and when it and the parish were most populous. 
The first minister has a manse with a small garden, a glebe of four 
acres, value L. 11 or L. 12 yearly rent, and about three-fourths of 
an acre of garden ground arising from private donation. There 
is no grass glebe, but the heritors have for some years back allow- 
ed a small sum of money in lieu of grass. Owing to the great fall 
in the price of grain, the average stipend drawn for some years 
back has only been about L. 150. The second minister has no 
house, but receives a sum of money from the Exchequer in lieu 
thereof, owing to an extension of the Small Stipend Act, meant 
to apply to the cases of second ministers in burghs, whose stipends 
are below L. 200. This stipend has also of late years, and owing 
to the same cause, amounted only to about L. 150. There are 
no vacant teinds, but it is believed that some small portions of 
land in the parish are unvalued. 

The number of families in the parish connected with the Esta- 
blished Church is 333, of Dissenting or Seceding families, 16, 
and one Episcopalian family. 

Education.— This parish is well provided with the means of 
public instruction to the young. Besides the burgh and parish 
school, there is an endowed school for boys and girls, and two fe- 
male private schools. The salary of the parish teacher is the 
maximum, L. 34, 4s. 4£d. with house and garden ; besides which, 



CULROSS. 



605 



he receives from a charitable foundation L. 10 for teaching twelve 
poor scholars, and may make from L. 20 to L. 30 in school fees. 
The salary of the teacher of the endowed school is L. 3b, with a 
house and small garden. On account of his salary, he is required 
to teach twenty poor scholars and to keep a Sabbath school He 
charoes fees from all attending, above the number on the list ot 

poor scholars. . , 

In both schools, the ordinary branches of education are taught; 
and the parish teacher is required, besides, to be able to give 
instruction in Latin, French, practical mathematics, and the 
elements of Greek ; and the same branches are expected to 
be taught in the endowed school. Number of children under 
six ye;Trs of age learning to read, 15; between six and fifteen 
years of age who are learning to read, 165 ; who are learning 
writing, 97 ; arithmetic, 67 ; Latin, 3 ; Greek, 2 ; mathema- 
tics, 13; geography, 32 ; total number at school, 180. There 
is no person in the parish above the age of childhood who 
cannot read ; and only about 40 individuals, and these chiefly 
elderly females, who cannot write. The inhabitants appear in ge- 
neral alive to the advantages of education. Fees at the parish 
school, 3s. for reading ; 3s. 6d. for writing with reading ; and 4s. 
for arithmetic along with the two other branches. Those at the 
other public school are nearly the same as the above. 

Charitable and other Institutions.— Compared with the popula- 
tion, the funds for giving relief to the indigent are very ample. 
Besides the one for education, already mentioned, there are diffe- 
rent establishments for affording relief to the poor, or to those who 
have fallen into decayed circumstances. 

Dr Bill, a native of Culross, who was settled in London as a phy- 
sician, and who died there in the year 1738, mortified a sum of money, 
which, won by savings made in former times, amounts to L. 1000 ; 
the interest of which is employed in giving quarterly allowances in 
money to four decayed tradesmen, and two tradesmen's widows ; 
in the educating and putting to apprenticeship of some young per- 
sons of the town and parish of Culross ; and in providing a bursa- 
ry for a student for four years at any of the Universities in Scot- 
land. 

In 1639, Sir George Bruce of Carnock founded an hospital in 
the west end of the town, for the maintenance of six decayed poor 
and aged women, widows of colliers or salters, or, if these be defi- 
cient, to other decayed poor and aged women in the parish of Cul-

loss. The building having long since fallen into ruin, was lately 
removed, but the garden exists ; the rent of which, along with the 
aliment of twenty-four bolls of meal, now apportioned among eight 
instead of six widows, is given to the incumbents on the charity. 

A very important endowment was established by the late Sir 
Robert Preston and his lady, for the purpose of affording a weekly 
allowance in their own houses, of meal and money to six aged men and 
six aged women of respectable character, and who have lived ten 
years in the parish. These persons receive also some allowance for 
clothes, and a sum towards the payment of their house rent. In 
a building connected with this endowment, a supply of soup is 
given on two days of the week, and for three months during win- 
ter, to a number of families in this and the adjoining parish of Tor- 
ryburn ; and a large room is provided, where a Sabbath school is 
taught, and to the teacher of which a salary of L. 12 is paid out 
of the funds of the establishment. The appointment to the bene- 
fits of this endowment lies in the proprietor of Valleyfield for the 
time being. The fund has been in operation for several years. 
Out of the funds of the endowed school, which was founded by 
the late Patrick Geddes, Esq. provision is made, after the death 
of certain annuitants, for giving a bursary to a student, and for af- 
fording a small yearly pension to five indigent individuals. 

Miss Halkerston of Carskerdo, in Fife, left a sum of money to 
be invested in land, the proceeds of which are to be employed by 
her trustees for the relief of industrious persons who may be in dis- 
tressed circumstances, but who may not come so directly under the 
name of poor, seeking and receiving relief from the parish. Her 
trustees are the ministers and elders, and the proprietor of West 
Grange for the time being. The fund has only now come into 
operation. 

Poor's Funds. — Notwithstanding the large private funds for the 
relief of the poor, the disbursements by the kirk-session have been 
for a long time considerable. The number receiving regular al- 
lowances averages between 20 and 30, occasional about 20. The 
weekly allowances to the regular poor are from 6d. to Is. 6d. The 
church collections with some other items amount to about L. 40. 
There is a sumofmoney consisting of L. 500, which was left at diffe- 
rent times for the use of the poor, the interest of which is applied to 
the relief of the ordinary and occasional poor along with the col- 
lections. An assessment has also existed for a considerable time, 



ST MADOES. 



607 



which was as high, some years ago, as L. 60 or L. 70 ; but which 
of late years has fallen to L. 30 or L. 40. 

Library. — A parish library has existed for some years. Number 
of volumes about 200. 

There is a benefit society for funerals. 

There is no savings bank in the parish, but a good many of the 
inhabitants have taken advantage of the establishment of a bank 
in Dunfermline last year, on the national security system, by lodg- 
ing their savings in it. 

Jail— A small jail, containing an apartment for debtors, and 
another for criminals, is attached to the town house ; it is consider- 
ed sufficiently secure. 

inns.— There are two inns in the town, and five other houses in the 
town and parish, where spirituous liquors are either sold to cus- 
tomers, or consumed on the spot. It is gratifying to be able to 
state, that the number of such houses has considerably decreased 
of late years ; from which circumstance we would willingly argue, 
that the desire for indulgence in spirituous liquors, which is de- 
plored as such an evil through the country, is on the decline in 
this place.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JAMES NOBLE, A. M. MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In ancient records, the name of this parish is almost 
invariably spelt St Mados instead of St Madoes, its modern or- 
thography. Neither of these modes however, in which its name 
is written, will account for the strange appellation it receives from 
the inhabitants of the district in which it lies, viz. Semmiedores. 
It appears to the writer of this account, that a corruption has taken 
place alike in its written orthography and its provincial pronun- 
ciation. There can be little doubt that the saint after whom it is 



608 



PERTHSHIRE. 



named was Madoch or Modoch, who is said to have been a 
Bishop in Scotland in the third or fourth century. The tradition 
existing in this neighbourhood is, that on coming from France to 
Scotland, he landed on the banks of the Tay, and that having 
made converts to Christianity, a church was by them built and de- 
dicated to him, where the present church of St Madoes stands, from 
which, at a subsequent period, the neighbouring district, when 
erected into a parish, received its name. Whether there be any- 
thing of truth in this tradition, we have no means of judging beyond 
Its common reception ; but that Madoch, of whom Ecclesiasti- 
cal History makes mention as a Gallic Missionary to Scotland in 
the early times of Christianity, was the person from whom this parish 
originally derived its name, is much confirmed by the fact, that 
there is another parish, also within the bounds of the county of 
Perth, which, from being the place of his usual residence, or from 
his being buried there, acknowledges him as the origin of its name : 
I mean Kilmadock, in the presbytery of Dunblane. The likeli- 
hood therefore is, that the name of this parish originally was St 
Madoch or Madox, which would easily be corrupted into Madois, 
and that as easily into Madoes. 

Extent and Boundaries, c. — The parish of St Madoes is situ- 
ated in that division of the county of Perth called the Carse of 
Gowrie. In point of extent, it is among the smallest in Scotland, 
containing only 1152 imperial acres. From the irregularitv of 
its form, it is difficult to convey any idea of it in writing. Bound- 
ed on the south, by the river Tay ; on the east, by the parish of 
Errol ; on the north, by Kinfauns ; and on the west, by Kinnoul, 
it lies about six miles from the city of Perth, and sixteen from Dun- 
dee, and therefore forms the western portion of that district so famed 
for its fertility — the Carse of Gowrie. Strictly speaking indeed, the 
Carse of Gowrie may be regarded as commencing about four miles 
westward of this parish, or with the level land which skirts the Tay at 
the bottom of Kinnoul Hill ; but it is when approaching St Madoes 
that the Carse first begins to be fully disclosed to the view of the tra- 
veller from the west, and that suddenly he finds himself, from the 
narrow, though fruitful and picturesque limits by which he has 
been confined since he entered on carse-land, two miles eastward 
from the city of Perth, — ushered into the breadth and the beauty, 
the riches and the luxuriance, of that expanded and variegated ter-

ritory, which for centuries has been renowned as affording the finest 
in quality, .as well as the largest in quantity of Scotland's fruits. 

Topographical Appearance. — A casual observer would pronounce 
the aspect of the parish to be that of an uninterrupted flat, except 
towards the northern part, where it rises into a gentle elevation ; 
but on minuter examination, apart from the more elevated ground, 
it consists of three different levels or flats, the first commencing 
on the verge of the Tay, and composed of land which partly 
within the last six, and wholly within the last fifty years, has been 
reclaimed or banked off from the river, the greater portion of it 
being from three to five feet below high-water mark, — the second 
from six to eight feet higher, having also at no very distant period 
been under water, — the third and by much the most extensive, rising 
to the height of fourteen feet above the second, this is the gene- 
ral level of the Carse of Gowrie. Then commences a gradual 
ascent, which terminates at an elevation of 42 feet more, the high- 
est part of the parish being thus 62 feet above the level of the 
Tay at high-water mark. Towards the northern boundary, there 
is a descent again, corresponding to the ascent from the highest 
level on the south. The land along this boundary is flat. Like 
the highest level referred to, it is about 20 feet above the Tay at 
high-water mark. 

Seen from Inchyra Hill, an eminence about half a-mile to the 
north-west, which places it completely under the observer's eye, this 
parish presents a very captivating landscape. Skirted by the noble 
Tay, receiving on the opposite side its finest tributary, — the Earn, 
— beyond which to the east and west, respectively, appear the town 
of Newburgh, and the ancient capital of the Picts, Abernethy, rest- 
ing on the slope of a range of rugged hills ; traversed by numerous 
hedge-rows of oak, elm, and beech, mature in age, studded too with 
solitary trees of splendid growth and handsome form, that " tell 
where once some cottage garden bloomed," and holding in its 
bosom Pitfour Castle with its fine demesne, and the church shew- 
ing its humble spire from amid a screen of ancient trees, — the scene 
is altogether one of the most beautiful that can well be contem- 
plated ; and seldom is an observer found to depart from it, with- 
out expressing his admiration of the mingled richness, repose, and 
grace that distinguish it. 

Meteorology. — The climate is here peculiarly temperate. A 
variety of circumstances, which the most inattentive observer can 
hardly fail to notice, indicates and attests the truth of this. Green

pease and potatoes may, with ordinary care, be counted on by the 
first week of June in the sheltered border. Not only do the more 
common fruits cultivated in Scotland, such as the apple, the pear, 
and the apricot, come early to maturity, but the peach, the nec- 
tarine, and the fig, are found to bear abundantly, and to ripen to 
high perfection. The Fuchsia, the Passiflora purpurea, and se- 
veral varieties of the Rosa Inclica, may be seen in ordinary sea- 
sons, flowering in the open border in the middle of November ; and 
without any extraordinary protection, these and other exotics even 
more tender, are found to survive the winter. Still there are 
drawbacks to be mentioned. In the months of April and May, 
we are subjected to a haar or thick vapour with cold nipping 
breezes from the east. These prevail for several days at a time, 
and should they happen during the period when the fruit-trees be- 
gin to expand their blossom, they throw a damp over the hopes 
of the orchardist. In autumn and winter again, rime or hoar-frost 
is very frequent, and may be seen clothing the trees on the 
low grounds with a fantastic though beautiful icy foliage, while to 
the braes around it does not extend. On the other hand, however, 
snow seldom falls with us but to disappear, suddenly melting away, 
so that it is quite a common thing to see the hills and uplands 
within a mile and a-half, deeply covered with a wintry mantle, 
while the plough is busy at work in the plains below. 

By comparing meteorological registers kept here, and in the neigh- 
bourhood within a range of three miles, and at heights of from 50 
to 150 feet above the level of the sea, I have been enabled to form 
the following table, which may be regarded as affording a pretty 
correct account of the average results of meteorological observa- 
tions for the last six years. The observations were taken at a 
quarter past nine in the morning, and half-past eight in the even-

In the temperature, as well as the pressure of the atmosphere, 
as exhibited by the above table, indications of a genial climate may 
readily be perceived. The prevailing winds are from south-west 



ST MADOES. 



611 



and west. From the north wind, which is generally so blighting, 
we are greatly sheltered by the hills that form the northern boun- 
dary of the Carse of Gowrie. 

From the previous statements a pretty correct idea may be 
formed of the climate in this part of the country. In salubrity it 
may compete with any part of Scotland. A superabundance of 
moisture, at a period not more remote than sixty years, rendered 
it productive of ague ; but from the extensive drainage to which 
the land has been subjected, and the consequent disappearance of 
those marshy exhalations so pernicious to health, the disease re- 
ferred to is now never heard of, nor is there any other disease which 
can be said to be peculiar to the climate. Typhus fever has 
sometimes prevailed, though not in its most fatal type, and its in- 
troduction could generally be traced to individuals who had brought 
it from some infected town or district. Pulmonary affections are 
rare, calculous complaints almost unknown, and apoplectic at- 
tacks very uncommon. Colds, rheumatisms, and inflammations 
are our most prevalent distempers. 

Hydrography. — As already stated, the Frith of Tay forms the 
southern boundary of the parish. It is here something more than 
a mile in breadth. Its greatest depth at high water averages 17 feet. 

Apow or drain, in which is a sluggish stream, winds along the 
north and west sides of the parish, forming the march between it 
and portions of Kinfauns and Kinnoul. It is almost dry during 
the summer months, but in winter and autumn its banks are fre- 
quently overflowed, owing to the quantity of water, which, after 
heavy falls of rain or snow, it receives from the braes of the Carse. 
When these overflowings occur, they sometimes do injury, by soak- 
ing or floating away the unhoused grain that may be within their 
reach, and always by driving mud into the drains, many of which 
empty themselves into the pow. 

Springs. — There are several springs, which may be called per- 
ennial, in the parish. One of these, which is situated in the 
flower garden of Pitfour, is worthy of particular notice. It sends 
forth a very strong current at all times, the quantity varying little 
in summer or winter. Its supply is at the rate of 20 gallons im- 
perial per minute. In some distant age it had no doubt been 
deemed worthy of sacred regard, for the name by which it is still 
designated is Tranty or Trinity. 

Geology. — The whole district of the Carse of Gowrie, as is well 
known to geologists, rests upon what is termed the old red sand- 



612 



PERTHSHIRE. 



stone formation. In that portion of it comprised in this parish, 
and its immediate vicinity, this formation has been brought dis- 
tinctly into view. In the low and level parts of the carse district, 
the superincumbent mass of alluvium is so immensely thick, that 
only in one single locality has the sandstone been reached. It is 
in the higher parts of it that opportunity has been afforded for 
fully examining the geological character of the strata. By a par- 
tial up-heaving of the strata, that slightly elevated ridge, lying be- 
tween the Tay and the braes of the Carse, and running nearly 
west and east, from almost the western boundary of this parish to 
nearly a mile beyond the village of Errol, has been raised. In 
various localities in this ridge, the red sandstone has been brought 
so near the surface as to be opened for quarries, and thus made 
subject to investigation. In particular, two quarries have been 
opened, one in this parish, called the Cot-town quarry of St 
Madoes, the property of Sir John Stuart Richardson, of Pitfour, 
Bart. ; and another in the parish of Errol, the property of John 
Lee Allen, Esq. of Errol, about half a mile to the east of the 
former; both on the summit of the afore-mentioned ridge, where 
the character of the formation is very obviously exhibited, and 
other most interesting circumstances connected with it, have been 
developed. Clashbennie, the latter of these quarries, are well known ; 
this, though it is not within the limits of St Madoes' parish, may be 
regarded as geologically connected with it ; and I do not, there- 
fore, hesitate to interfere a little with the geology of Clashbennie. 

The sandstone lies in beds, varying in thickness from one foot 
to three feet, with thin layers of clay between them. These beds 
exhibit very much the same appearance, with this exception, that 
now and then a bed of a brecciated aspect presents itself. Evi- 
dences of the action of water in their formation are very ob- 
vious, the different layers or laminae, if we may apply the term, 
of which they are made up, being easily traced by the observer. 
These most generally lie parallel to the plane of stratification, and 
are sometimes straight, implying tranquillity, — and sometimes more 
or less undulated, indicating a corresponding commotion, at the 
period of deposition. Beds are also to be seen, whose layers are 
oblique, forming angles of various degrees, with the plane of stra- 
tification. Such, however, are rare ; and considering that they 
present their layers of deposition straight as well as undulated, 
there is difficulty in accounting for the peculiar form they have as- 
sumed. It is but seldom that pebbles of any kind are found im-

bedded in the sandstone. When they do occur they are general- 
ly small, very rarely so large as a pigeon's egg, always water- 
worn, and belonging to the primitive rocks. In the brecciated 
beds innumerable nodules appear both of brown and green matter, 
flatly elliptical in form, compact in texture, but soft and soapy to 
the touch. These are generally supposed to be indurated clay. 

The dip of the strata varies exceedingly. In the Cot-town of 
St Madoes quarry, it is about 1 0° towards north-west. In that of 
Clashbennie, which, to the most casual observation, presents ex- 
traordinary dislocation and confusion, it will be found in one cor- 
ner not more than 2°, and in another as much as 36° ; and perhaps 
in opposite directions, but the grand dip of the strata is undoubted- 
ly towards north-east. The cause of peculiar disturbance in the 
stratification is a local one. It is found in the protrusion of a mass 
of trap, conically formed, through the strata. This exists in one 
of the most dislocated portions of the quarry, and from deep work- 
ing was brought into view. The apex of the trap cone might be 
from sixteen to eighteen feet below the surface of the highest bed. 
The Sidlaw hills, which form the northern boundary of the Carse 
of Gowrie, are a trap range, and bear in them evidences of having 
been lifted through the old red sandstone strata. In various parts 
at different elevations, portions of these are discovered, generally 
in great confusion, the lines of stratification being almost indiscer- 
nible ; and whenever they appear in contact with the trap they are 
highly indurated. In other parts along the base of the hills, the 
sandstone is found beneath the trap, the latter having manifestly 
flowed over it. The ridge of sandstone already referred to, which 
runs nearly parallel to the Sidlaws from the west side of this pa- 
rish to the east of the village of Errol, in all probability owed its 
elevation to the same agency by which the adjacent trap-hills were 
heaved up. From the circumstance however, distinctly ascertain- 
ed, that the strata to the south of the Tay have .their dip and in- 
clination in a south-eastern direction, while generally those to the 
north of the Tay have their dip and inclination in an opposite di- 
rection, the great axis of elevation applicable to both must be sought 
for about the line of the present estuary of the Tay. 

Organic Remains. — Various kinds of these, some of them high- 
ly interesting, have been found in both of the fore-mentioned quar- 
ries. In them, as in all of the old red sandstone quarries of the 
district, there may be perceived multitudes of circular spots, vary- 
ing in diameter from one to eight or ten inches, distinguished by

their dull yellowish colour. On investigation, each of them is found 
to derive its circularity from being the section of a sphere, and not 
to be only a thin superficial lamina. Moreover, at the centre of 
the sphere, there is generally to be discerned a speck differing in 
appearance from what surrounds it, and lately, I have found num- 
bers of these spheres formed around a very small portion of a scaly 
substance, so that there can be little doubt they have originated 
from the influence of organic matter. 

In both quarries, scales of fishes exist in great quantities ; the 
deeper the beds, the more abundant are they, particularly in those 
of a brecciated character. There is one variety very prevalent. 
Specimens of this may be picked up at any time. Their ordinary 
size is about an inch and a half in diameter, and a sixteenth of an 
inch in thickness ; but they have been found as large as three 
inches in diameter, and a tenth of an inch in thickness. Besides 
this variety, which is the only one that hitherto has been publicly 
noticed, I have discovered other five, which are obviously distinct, 
three of them in Clashbennie, and two in Cot-town quarry. All 
of these are of rare occurrence. Some of them are large scales, 
being from two to three inches in diameter ; one has a strong re- 
semblance to those of the Megalychthys Hibberti. Besides scales, 
the teeth, spines, jaw-bones, and other bones of fishes are some- 
times to be met with ; portions of rays and fins, more rarely ; co- 
prolites frequently ; and I have in my possession the eye of a fish, 
with its pupil, lid, and other appendages imbedded in a piece of 
sandstone, all as vividly exhibiting the external organization, as 
though it had immediately fallen from its original position. 

Considering the quantity of scales with which the strata abound, 
it is to be wondered at, that only a very few- specimens have been 
found, exhibiting either complete impressions, or impressions of 
any large or important parts of fishes. A good many years ago, 
a specimen which now belongs to the Antiquarian Society of Perth, 
and which is obviously the fossilized portion of a fish, extending 
from the shoulders to the tail, was found in Clashbennie quarry ; 
it is seven inches long, two inches in depth, and about three quar- 
ters of an inch thick. Although their beds are marked, there are 
now no scales upon it, neither are there any traces of fins to be 
discovered. This fossil has, by M. Agassiz, been set down to the 
genus Palceoniscus. It was not, however, till July 1836 that any 
specimen was discovered, which could serve to determine to what 
genus of fishes those scales, so abundantly distributed throughout 



ST MADOES. 



615 



the rock, both at Cot-town and Clashbennie, had belonged. Then 
an uncommonly beautiful and complete one was found, covered 
with scales similar to those prevailing in the rock, few of them being 
disturbed from their original regularity. To the general descrip- 
tion which has already been given of this fossil fish in the Statis- 
tical Account of the parish of Enrol pp. 374—376, there may 
be added some particulars of importance. As there stated, its 
length is 27 inches, and breadth 13 inches across the shoulders. 
It is proper further to mention that the length of its head, which 
has no scales like those on the body, but a uniform shagreen- 
looking covering, is four inches, and its breadth seven inches. From 
the circumstance of the adherence of its back to a mass of sand- 
stone, it is difficult to determine accurately its depth, but it may 
be something more than four inches, so that it is decidedly a flat 
fish. Taking into account the size of the scales,— which is pretty 
uniform about two inches diameter, excepting that of those to- 
wards the caudal extremities, which all at once dwindle into three- 
fourths of an inch in diameter, — and the tabular extent of sandstone 
which this fossil covers, it is perhaps one of the finest ichthyolites 
that has yet been brought to view. Being anxious to make it sub- 
servient to the interests of science, the author of this Account, to 
whom it belongs, has subjected it to the inspection of the most 
eminent of our geologists, and it has already proved useful. M. 
Agassiz, to whom a drawing of it was sent by R. Murchison, Esq. 
had previously supposed the prevalent Cot-town and Clashbennie 
scales to belong to a species of fish which he named Gyrolepes 
giganteus. Having described that species, however, from a defec 
tive specimen, he had committed a generic mistake, which, from 
the completeness of my specimen, he has now been enabled to 
rectify, and instead of being, as his remarks in his great work v. 
liv. p. 172 erroneously indicated — a Gyrolepes giganteus, it proves 
to be a new species of the genus Holoptychus, which he has named 
Holoptychus nobilissimus. Other species of the same genus have 
been found in the limestone of Burdie-House Edinburgh, and in 
the Gamrie deposit Banffshire; but " this individual," Agassiz 
writes, M will enable me at length to define precisely the charac- 
ters of the genus which I named Holoptychus from the folds of the 
scales." The Holoptychus nobilissimus, Agass. is figured and mi- 
nutely described in " The Silurian System of Rocks," a large 
work just published by R. J. Murchison, Esq. F. R. S., V. P. G. S. } 
&amp;c. in which all the ancient formations between the coal measures 



\ \ I'

and the slaty rocks are classified according to their stratigraphical 
and zoological characters. 

There has not been found any other specimen of a complete 
fossil fish, as far as is known to the writer. Several interesting 
fragments or portions, such as heads with the shoulders, and 
tails with the fins, are possessed by different individuals ; but there 
is not any of these calculated to throw light on the character of 
those fishes to which the other scales I have discovered had 
belonged. They are all of them clearly of the genus Ho- 
loptychus. There is one specimen, however, in the possession of 
Miss Craigie of Glendoick, consisting of the head and shoulders 
of a fish, worthy of special notice,— for, though it be manifestly a 
portion of one of the genus Holoptyclms, it is marked by some ob- 
vious characteristics of a distinctive species. If complete, it would 
probably have been about a foot long, and three and a-half inches 
broad. Its scales are proportionally smaller than those on the large 
specimen already referred to, but instead of having ten rows of these 
like that specimen, running from the neck towards the caudal fins, 
it has only six. Organic remains of a different class have also been 
found in the old red sandstone. These are the more interesting, 
that they appear not only to belong to anew species, but to be the 
nrst, I believe, of the genus, that have as yet been discovered in 
any of the members of the carboniferous system. The first frag- 
ments of this class that were found are noticed in the Statistical 
Account of Errol parish, p. 376. They consisted of a consider- 
able number of pieces, of various, but principally of vandyked shapes, 
of sizes from 2 to 10 inches long. They had every appearance 
of organisms, being very distinct in their outlines, having the up- 
per surface divided into rectangular compartments, and their edges 
turned under like a scroll ; but so strange was their aspect— so 
utterly unlike any known appendages of organized creation— and 
so difficult was it to conceive any purpose which they could have 
served to a living creature, that the geologists who examined them 
were completely non-plussed. Few, however, doubted that they 
had belonged to some animal species of another age. Two speci- 
mens have since been obtained, which render it probable, that these 
extraordinary organisms had been owned by creatures of the reptile 
tribe. The first of these specimens to which I refer consists of a 
slab of sandstone five feet by two, which was accidentally discover- 
ed by the writer, having been bought as a cover for a drain. In 
this are imbedded a great number of angulated organisms similar 



ST MADOES. 



617 



to those above referred to, and from having combined with them 
very vivid impressions of what strongly resemble [thighs or legs, 
they had most probably pertained to the swimming apparatus of 
' some creature of the Saurian genus, which indeed had greatly dif- 
fered from any of that tribe that has hitherto been discovered, 
either in the new red sandstone or oolitic rocks. The slab now 
referred to, I may mention, was found in a different part of the 
quarry from that in which the organic remains, previously noticed, 
were found ; and, moreover, when I went to the quarry, after dis- 
covering the impressions on the slab, to make inquiries about the 
locality from which it had been taken, I saw a mass of smashed 
fragments containing similar impressions, which, had it been pos- 
sible to collect them, I have no doubt, would have covered a super- 
ficies six times the size of the slab. The other specimen of the 
same class was discovered a few weeks ago, and while it posses- 
ses all the distinguishing characteristics of the former one, the or- 
ganisms contained in it had clearly belonged to a much younger 
creature, being but a-sixth part of the size of the former, and much 
more delicately formed, both as to outline and covering. From 
the size of the specimen, or pieces which form it, this creature, 
though young, could not have been less than five or six feet long. 
Whatever on more minute comparison and investigation, by M. 
Agassiz, for he alone of living men is qualified to give a correct 
judgment regarding these fossil remains, they may turn out to 
be, they are exceedingly important, if, as supposed, they exhibit 
organisms of a class of creatures apparently higher in the scale of 
organization than any that has as yet come to light from the old 
red sandstone, or its associate formations. 

With a single exception, there has no specimen been discover- 
ed of organic remains belonging to the vegetable kingdom. That 
exception affords partial impressions of a plant seemingly of the 
equisetaceous class. It was found in the Cot-town quarry, and 
is now in the possession of Sir John S. Richardson, Bart. 

Deposits. — In as far as there have been any opportunities afford- 
ed of judging, the deposits considered as underlying the cultivat- 
ed soil, are, over the whole extent of the parish, alluvial, differ- 
ing in character according to the positions which they occupy. In 
the level parts, on the south and north, where what is termed Carse 
soil forms the surface, they consist of an adhesive clay, sometimes 
assuming a stratified aspect, but generally the contrary, with here 
and there a bed of fine whitish-coloured sand. It is but seldom 



618 PERTHSHIRE. 



that any fragments of rocks are to be seen either in this clay or 
sand, and no remains of animals or plants have been noticed in 
them. In the higher parts of the parish the alluvium is more vari- 
ed in its character. In some places it consists of a species of clay, 
or, as it is called, mortar, peculiarly tough, and containing a consider- 
able portion of calcareous matter, but altogether destitute of stones 
or pebbles. In other places it consists of a clayey earth mingled 
with quantities of the debris of the old red sand-stone and masses 
of the trap rocks ; most commonly it consists of a soft brownish 
sand, in which the layers of deposition are apparent when a per- 
pendicular section is made, and in which rounded water-worn boul- 
ders of gneiss, greenstone, &amp;c. sometimes occur. 

Soils.— In order to give any thing like a correct account of these, 
it is necessary to divide the parish into three parts. The highest 
part, which comprises about one-third of the whole, is a rich brown 
loam, mostly incumbent on the soft brownish sand above referred 
to, but partly on clay. That which lies on sand is deep, varying 
from 1| to 3 feet, and consequently dry and very rich; that on 
clay is not so deep nor dry, though in other respects similar. In 
depth it varies from 10 to 20 inches. The next division extends 
along the south, west, and north sides of the former, being nar- 
row on the north, but of considerable breadth on the south and 
west sides. The part of this division which lies farthest south 
has been reclaimed from the Tay at no very distant date, being but 
little elevated above high water-mark, and considerably below the 
height of spring tides. It is composed of a rich alluvial clayey 
loam, fitted for the production of every kind of crop in large re- 
turns. The remaining portion of this division consists of a strong 
adhesive, but fertile clay, with the exception of a small part on the 
south-east side of it, which is of a much less adhesive and less 
fertile nature. It is what is called « end clay," i. e. clay standing 
m vertical layers. Being easily acted on by the weather,— frost 
quickly pulverizing it,— rain, again, running it into a solid body,— 
drought, as suddenly separating it into flakes— the roots of plants 
are thus so exposed to extremes, that they are prevented from de- 
riving the nourishment needful for the promotion of their health 
and vigour. The third division consists of 80 acres imperial, ex- 
clusive of embankments, reclaimed since 1826 from the Tay. 
The soil is a very rich alluvial loam, producing heavy crops of all" 
kinds without manure. 

Boulders.— There are but few of these now to be seen; but 



ST MADOES. 



619 



some fifty or sixty years ago, there were many of various sizes scat- 
tered over the surface, or slightly penetrating the soil in the higher 
part of the parish. In the progress of cultivation they have been 
removed, and are now to be seen about the foundations of farm- 
offices, &amp;c. They were invariably of the primitive rocks, most 
generally of granite, gneiss, and primitive greenstone. This is a 
striking fact when viewed in connection with another fact already 
stated, viz. that in that species of alluvium, which consists of a 
clayey earth, mingled with debris of the old red sandstone, there 
are also considerable fragments of the trap-rocks ; for it seems to 
intimate that, subsequent to that watery agency which had depo- 
sited the alluvium, or as geologists would perhaps term it, the di- 
luvium mentioned, there had been some tremendous torrent which 
had rolled the superincumbent boulders from the primitive mountains 
in the west, the nearest of which is upwards of twenty miles distant.

Of Insects the variety is great, particularly of the Lepidopterous 
class. They are only such, however, as are common in other parts 
of the country, and, excepting those that have lately proved inju- 
rious to the husbandman or the horticulturist, are scarcely worthy 
of being specified. Among these exceptions is the wheat-fly, a 
creature so tiny that its existence is endangered even by the com- 
motion caused among the stalks and leaves of wheat by a slight 
breeze. Yet, under particular circumstances, with all its apparent 
insignificance, it might in the course of a few days not only ma- 
terially abridge the farmer's wealth, but bring a nation to the verge 
of famine. This is not the place to enter into a minute history 
of its nature and habits, or to do any thing more than make a few 
general statements regarding it. The name of the wheat-fly has 
been given it on account of its affection for the wheat-plant, for 
though when under necessity it will betake itself to barley, to most 
if not to all the varieties of the Triticum genus iwdiscovers a 
peculiar attachment. It is not, however, as a devourer of food 
for its own sustenance, but as a foreseeing provider of it for its 
progeny, that it seeks the wheat-plant. Depositing its eggs within 
the glumes of the wheat about the time when it comes in ear, 
these speedily are transformed into living worms, in various num- 
bers, from one to six. These worms fix upon the vessels intend- 
ed to carry the juices of the plant to the point where the grain is 
formed and nourished, and, cutting off the communication between 
the sap-channels and the embryo corn, they appropriate for their 
own aliment what in due time would have swelled and hardened 
into good fruit. At the time that the worms or maggots come 
to maturity, being then about one-tenth of an inch in length, the 
ears of wheat may be seen covered with multitudes of a small in- 
sect call the Tipula Tritici. This is a blind, but in its own pe- 
culiar way, an active and ardent destroyer of the wheat-fly. It 
watches the maggots, supplying its defect of sight by incessant

movements to and fro as they are ready to be , ejec ed from , tte 
glumes, which expand under the influence of a bright sun and de 
votes them to the use of its future progeny,-piercing heir body as 
a nidus for its eggs,- and these being hatched, their place of shel- 
ter is converted into nourishment for the young brood. 11 tne 
maggots escape this enemy, they spring downwards, and soon pe- 
netrate from half to three quarters of an inch under the surface of 
the soil, where, if undisturbed, they remain till a suitable tempe- 
rature produces a transformation, and brings them from the tor- 
pidity of the chrysalis into the activity of the fly-state. 1 he sate- 
ty of the wheat crop from their ravages, seems in a great mea- 
sure, to depend upon the period at which this temperature occurs. 
If it take place about the time when the wheat comes in the ear, 
and the weather be quiet, mild, and favourable for laying eggs, the 
race is perpetuated in perilous multitudes ; but if the temperature 
occur too early or too late for wheat-earing, or should it be ac- 
companied with strong sunshine and a sharp breeze, their num- 
bers are proportionally diminished. The havoc which the wheat- 
fly made in the Carse of Gowrie district of the crops of 1927, 
1828, 1829, and 1830 is almost incredible. It has been com- 
puted, that during those four years, little less a sum than L.100,000 
Sterling was, through its instrumentality, lost to the tenantry. 
This loss was felt the more that the wheat crop is that on which 
they mainlv count to meet the rent-day. Many of them had a 
sore wrestle ere they could rise above it, and there are some who 
have not yet been able to overcome the difficulties which it gene- 
rated. Had the landlords not been patient and indulgent, as ge- 
nerally they were,— though only in a few cases to the extent which 
a just view of their own interest, as well as of the comfort of their 
tenantry, should have dictated,— perhaps half the number of these, 
or even more, would have been compelled to abandon what then- 
industry and frugality entitled them to cherish,— the hope of a com- 
fortable subsistence for their families, and on the wreck of their 
property to embark in doubtful speculation for some distant coun- 
try. During the seasons that the wheat-fly committed such de- 
predations, many remedies were proposed for the purpose of pre- 
venting future injury from its attacks,— some founded on the idea 
of its possible extirpation or subjugation, others on the alleged ex- 
istence of one or more species of wheat which it refuses to employ 
as a residuum for its eggs. No attempt, however, of any conse- 
quence was made to apply these remedies. Before they had been 



622 



PERTHSHIRE. 



well proposed, indeed, the evil was abated; the fly, by a higher than 
human agency, had been checked in its destructive powers. The 
wheat crop of 1831 generally escaped its ravages, and though here 
and there, as has doubtless been always the case, in that year and 
those that have succeeded it, a field might be found in which 
partial damage was induced by its appearance, it has not proved a 
prevalent destroyer. May the search for remedies to prevent 
its injurious effects long continue to be as needless as in these 
latter years  

The re are several insects which molest and prove injurious to 
our fruit-trees. The common aphis or green fly annually attacks 
the peach, nectarine, and plum-trees, and sometimes it descends 
even to the gooseberry-bushes. This insect is easily destroyed 
by the application of tobacco-juice, or of soap mixed with water. 
The iveb-apple caterpillars, which are very destructive if they be 
allowed to remain undisturbed, may also be easily subdued if care 
be taken to pick them off before they have separated from the 
web, and been distributed over the tree. The Aphis lanigera or 
woolly bug, has been gradually extending itself for the last thirty 
years; and although it does not seem to have infested the orchards 
in any great measure, there is scarcely a garden to be found in the 
district into which it has not been introduced. It is by far the 
most mischievous of all the insects that infest the apple-tree, to 
which its attacks are confined. Numbers of it cluster together 
and digging into the bark, they abstract the sap in its progress, 
produce excrescences in the branches, and thus render the tree 
sickly, while the fruit is crined. They know well, moreover, how 
to choose the best, for if there be a Ribston Pippin, a Cornish 
Jellyflower, or a Margile in the garden, they are almost sure to 
give them the preference. Various methods, such as clotting 
with oil and immersing in hot water, have been tried to eradicate 
them, but I have never known a single instance of their effectual 
removal from a tree when they had once fairly established them- 
selves upon it. After some experience, and with a full sympathy 
with the reluctance which every one has to adopt such a course, 
I have arrived at the conviction, that the only certain way of get- 
ting rid of the Aphis lanigera is to root out and commit to the 
flames every tree infested with it. Every year I believe that this 
mode of procedure is delayed, will only afford new and most vexa- 
tious evidence of the necessity of adopting it, adding, in all pro- 
bability, to the number of its victims.

Botany.— There is very little that is worthy of remark in the 
botanical productions of this parish. The plants that abound are 
those well known as invariably existing in deep loamy soils, or in 
alluvial clay. Though a considerable number of the rarest num- 
bered in the Scotica Flora, are to be found in the neighbouring 
braes and glens, there are not any here that can well be called un- 
common. Approaching to such may be mentioned the Typhi an- 
gustifolia, and the Listera ovata, the former of which has its habi- 
tat in a mill-dam at Cairnie, and the latter in a belt of wood, on 
moist soil, to the south of Pitfour Castle. 

Plantations.— The extent of land under wood is about 33 imperial 
acres ;— the whole has been planted. About one-third of the plan- 
tations is from seventy to eighty, nearly another third, forty to for- 
ty-five, and the remainder from twelve to seventeen years old, with 
the exception of a few standard and hedge-row trees, which have 
reached to ages of from one hundred and twenty to one hundred 
and thirty years. Some of these, particularly the planes and elms, 
are of large dimensions, and of excellent quality of timber. Planes 
of size suitable for beetling beams and other mechanical purposes 
were sold in the end of 1 837 at 3s. per cubic foot. 

Almost every species of forest tree cultivated in this country 
has been planted in the parish ; but the sorts most general are, the 
oak, elm, ash, plane, beech, lime, Spanish chestnut, horse-chest- 
nut, the three latter being principally for ornament, larch, Scots 
fir, spruce, and silver fir. On the higher grounds all these kinds 
of trees grow luxuriantly, but elm and ash manifest symptoms of 
decay at an earlier period than any of the others ; indeed, they 
are the only trees of deciduous character which show any tenden- 
cy to disease in that part of the parish. This tendency, however, 
is not general, but in particular trees, and it is more frequently 
found on the slope than the summit. Most probably it arises 
from the roots penetrating into strata of the subsoil, through which 
the water from the higher ground descends. On the lower grounds, 
where the soil is strong clay, several sorts of trees do not thrive, 
particularly ash, elm, plane, and lime. Oak and Scots fir, how- 
ever, attain great age, with rapidity of growth, and vigorous health. 
About twelve acres of poor clay soil were planted seventy years ago 
with Scots fir, which is still in good health. Larch and spruce 
planted at the same time, have for the last twenty years been in a 
state of internal decay. A very convincing proof of a fact, which, 
till within the last six or seven years, had escaped the notice of

arboriculturists—viz. a tendency in larch to disease when planted 
where Scots fir has grown— was afforded by a plantation in this 
part of the parish. The proprietor, fifteen years ago, having oc- 
casion for a considerable quantity of timber for the repair of stead- 
ings, &amp;c. cleared off about two acres of Scots fir, and replanted 
the ground with oaks and larches, both of which throve to all ap- 
pearance with great vigour ; but in thinning out some of the 
larches, which were only intended as nurses for the oaks, they 
were found, though only six years planted, to be in a state of dis- 
ease. The whole have since been cut out, and although external- 
ly they looked healthy, not an individual plant was sound ; from 
the root even to the point of the smallest branch, the core was ra- 
pidly decaying. The plantations in the parish are kept in good 
order as to thinning and pruning. No periodical felling is adopt- 
ed ; but occasional cuttings of oak and other hard-wood take place. 

II. — Civil History. 
Traditionary Account— There is a vague popular tradition, 
that, at a remote period, this parish formed a portion of the parish 
of Rhind. Connected with this tradition it is alleged, that the 
Tay, which now divides them, instead of joining the Earn where 
it now does, took its course from somewhere about Inchyra, along 
the braes of the Carse to Invergowrie, where it formed a junction 
with the Earn. The only proof that believers in this tradition 
have to urge in behalf of its truth, is derived from the words of an 
ancient ballad— no great authority certainly — which speaks of 

" The stannin stanes o' Semmiedores, 
" Be sou the river Tay" 

Present circumstances and appearances are entirely at variance 
with the main fact which is alleged in this tradition. The exist- 
ing levels are so utterly and obviously incompatible with the idea 
of the Tay having run by the bottom of the Carse braes, that any 
one who looks at them must at once dismiss it from his mind. 
That, at a period perhaps not very remote, a fresh water lake ex- 
tended a considerable way along the braes of Carse, is indicated 
not only by soils, which have all the characteristics of lacustrine 
deposits, but also by beds of the Arundo phragmites, which pre- 
sent themselves in various places, and still more decidedly by a 
well-defined horizontal ledge or beach, with all the appearance of 
having been produced by the mechanical action of water. This 
ledge is peculiarly distinct along the whole of the north side of St 
Madoes parish. It is not unlikely that the tradition regarding 



ST MADOES. 



625 



the former course of the Tay, owes its origin to the existence of 
such a lake as that just referred to. 

Parochial Registers. — The existing parochial records, which con - 
tain the transactions of the kirk-session and registers of baptisms 
and marriages, consist of six volumes. The oldest of these is a 
curious one. It is entitled " The Book of the Assembly of 
St Madoss," and is partly in the handwriting of the famous Alex- 
ander Lindsay, who was afterwards Bishop of Dunkeld. It com- 
mences with a minute of the 7th September 1591, in which 
there is contained an account of the nomination of elders and 
deacons, by commissioners from the presbytery of Perth, among 
whom were some of the most celebrated men of that period, viz. 
Patrick Galloway, William Rhind, Henry Guthrie, and Archibald 
Moncrieff. In this volume there is abundant evidence of a strict 
and faithful administration of the discipline of the church during 
the period to which it refers. There is also a variety of circum- 
stances, incidentally stated, of an interesting character. The ac- 
counts, for instance, of collections made for harbours and bridges 
in different parts of the country, attest the interest then taken by 
the church in the civil prosperity of the people ; and the names of 
witnesses at baptisms, with their designations, throw light upon the 
division of property at that period. This volume closes with a mi- 
nute of the 30th of April 1615. The next existing volume com- 
mences with a minute of October 2, 1659, from which date to the 
present time, the session records are complete. 

State of property, ancient and modern. — Sir John Stuart Richard- 
son, Bart, of Pitfour, is the sole proprietor of the parish. It may be 
worthy of notice, that property here and in the neighbourhood is in a 
strikingly different position as to ownership, from what it was in for- 
mer times. From the old session record just referred to, it appears 
that, 250 years back, there were in this parish four distinct laird- 
ships, Pitfour, Pitcog, Cairnie, and Dumgreen ; and from the same 
source it may be gathered, that the neighbouring district had been 
divided into small lairdships, four or five then existing for one that 
now exists. The principal land- owner in this parish, in 1 592, was 
a man of high lineage, being one of the Cochranes of Dundonald. 
The lands of Pitfour, soon after that year, were sold by him to the 
Hays of Megginch ; but he continued to reside here till his death ; 
and his descendants, reduced to the humble condition of cottars, 
were to be found in the neighbouring parish of Errol, about a ge- 
neration back, when the last of them died. 

Antiquities.— Druldlcd circles had abounded in this part of the

country, the remains of some seven or eight of them still existing 
between Perth and Dundee. Of these, one is in this parish. There 
is also a stone of some historical note here, viz. that stone on which, 
as tradition bears, the falcon alighted which measured out the 
territory awarded to Hay by Kenneth III. for his intrepid conduct 
at the battle of Luncarty. By some the whole of this tradition has 
been treated as fabulous, and, undoubtedly, there are portions of it 
not easily reconcilable with what are considered to be well-esta- 
blished facts ; but, however that may be, the stone referred to has 
beyond all question been denominated the Hawk's Stone for many 
centuries past, the most ancient charters and historical records re- 
ferring to it as Saxum Falconis : and one fact in favour of the tra- 
ditionary account connected with it is, that it does certainly lie upon 
the very westmost verge of what is known to have been the origi- 
nal property of the Hays of Errol. 

In the churchyard there is a very beautiful specimen of that 
class of monuments, called Runic, from their imagined Norse or 
Danish origin. They are somewhat prevalent in this part of Scot- 
land, other specimens being found at Abernethy, Mugdrum, Dup- 
plin, Fowlis Wester, and Dunkeld. There is not any thing au- 
thentic known about their history, origin, or object ; and although 
they were long supposed to have some connection with events that 
took place during Danish incursions, those who have lately been 
comparing them and investigating their characters, begin to think 
that there is more reason for linking them with the introduction of 
Christianity into this country. The St Madoes' stone is about 7 
feet in length, and in width about 3 at bottom, and 2 at top. Its 
thickness is 8 inches. It is composed of gray sandstone, similar to 
that which is found at Murray's Hall, fully six miles off. On the 
one side the sculpture is divided into five compartments, right 
under each other, and nearly equal in size. Each of the upper- 
most three is occupied by the figure of a man on horseback, the 
horse and rider being of the most grotesque form and unseemly 
proportions. The bridle, reins, bit, rings, and buckles, are mi- 
nutely though rudely cut, and are in perfect preservation. The 
rider wears a cloak or mantle, somewhat like the short water-proof 
cloaks of our time, but with a flat crowned head piece, which leaves 
only a small portion of the face to be seen. In the fourth com- 
partment is a serpent-shaped figure, with fretted ornaments, and 
something like a double-headed broken sceptre, both of which or- 
naments are to be found on most stones of the same class. Still

lower down, is the figure of a goat, a good deal defaced, and ad- 
joining this, various sculptures almost obliterated. This side of the 
stone, though minutely carved, does not seem to have been squared 
or dressed beforehand. It bears no tool marks, and has several 
warts, as if just newly taken from the quarry. The side opposite 
is by far the richer and more beautiful. Its lines are as clear as 
if just from the hand of the artist. The principal figure is that of 
a cross, the upright portion of which occupies the whole length of 
the stone. The shaft and transept are beautifully enriched with 
very complicated tracery ; both, round the point where they cross, 
are wreathed with a carved circle or halo. On each side of the 
shaft of the cross, beneath its transept, is a monstrous lizard-like 
figure, apparently in the agonies of death, from being crunshed 
through at the loins by a savage-looking creature with a head like 
a wolf, body like a dog, and a thick curled tail. The two com- 
partments adjoining the top of the cross are occupied by nonde- 
scripts, with monstrous and diminutive bodies, apparently gnawing 
their own backs. On the top, equally visible from both sides of the 
stone, are lizard-like figures couchant, facing each other. 

Modern Buildings. — Pitfour Castle, the residence of the sole 
proprietor of the parish, is a large quadrangular building, standing 
on an artificial terrace, affording every species of accommodation 
befitting the rank and fortune of its possessor. It was principally 
erected by John Richardson, Esq. grandfather of the present pro- 
prietor, though the latter has made considerable additions to it. It 
is surrounded by a fine demesne, studded with every variety of 
trees in the most thriving condition, and ornamented by a flower- 
garden, beautifully situated, and tastefully laid out. Viewed in 
connection with its park, gardens, shrubberies, &amp;c. there are few 
finer places to be seen in this part of the country. 

Eminent Men and Ministers.— Alexander Lindsay, who was or- 
dained minister of this parish in 159 J, was a man of some note in 
his own times ; and his name has come down to us in connection 
with a most interesting portion of our church's history, viz. the 
proceedings of the General Assembly of 1638. Himself a man 
of property, and one of a family of considerable influence in for- 
mer days,— the Lindsays of Evelick,— he had easy access to court, 
where he soon became a favourite ; and entering into its schemes 
for the establishment of Episcopacy in Scotland, he was in the 
year 1607 appointed Bishop of Dunkeld. For nearly thirty-two 
years, he discharged the duties of that office with a diligence and 



628 



PERTHSHIRE. 



moderation rare enough in those times, while he also retained the 
pastoral charge of St Madoes. From the records of the Presby- 
tery of Perth, it is evident that he bestowed considerable pains in 
the management of that part of his diocese. As perpetual mode- 
rator, he appears down to the year 1632 to have been a very re- 
gular attender of the meetings of Presbytery, which were then of 
almost weekly occurrence. Like the other bishops of that period, 
when the power of Presbytery became again ascendant, Lindsay 
bad complaints lodged against him for his prelutic conduct. These, 
as the record bears, were brought forward by the " Laird of Mon- 
crieff and Mr William Row, in the name of the gentrie and bur- 
gesses of the Presbyterie," and the bishop was called upon to an- 
swer them before the General Assembly of 1638. The Assem- 
bly found him guilty " of receiving consecration to the office of 
Episcopacie condemned by the Confession of Faith ; of pressing 
the, kirk with novations in the worship of God," &amp;c. ; and while 
he was " deposed from the pretended Episcopall function, and sus- 
■pendedfrom all ministerial function,'" it was provided, that, " if he 
should acknowledge that Assembly, reverence its constitutions, and 
make his repentance conforme to the order prescribed, he should 
be continued in the ministrie of St Madoes." On the 30th of Ja- 
nuary 1639, he gave in his declaration of repentance to the Pres- 
bytery of Perth, and became again the humble minister of St Ma- 
does, where he continued till his death, which happened soon after. 

Archibald Stevenson, minister of this parish from 1747 to 1784, 
was a man of great talents, learning and piety. He was one of the 
leaders of the popular party in the Church, and in point ofa know- 
ledge of her constitution and laws, he was regarded as superior to 
them all. The late Dr Inglis of Edinburgh, who remembered his 
appearances in church courts, always spoke of him as second to no 
man in his day in the management of church matters. He left no 
token of his powers behind him, but what is to be found in a speech 
on Catholic Emancipation, now very rare, in the General As- 
sembly, 1779, distinguished by extraordinary sagacity, and great 
power of diction and of argument.

III. — Population. 
Although there are not any data by which the amount of the 
population in ancient times can be correctly determined, there can 
be no doubt that, looking at its present state, it has rather dimi- 
nished than increased ; for, from a roll of examinable persons, re- 
gularly kept from 1596 to 1617, it is evident that during that pe- 
riod they were considerably more numerous than they now are. 
Then, it appears, a large proportion of the people were huddled 
together in five or six hamlets or villages, each family having a 
few acres of land attached to their house. The majority of these 
hamlets has long since disappeared ; the land attached to them 
having been thrown into large farms. For the last hundred years, 
the population has varied but little in amount, rating from 320 to 
350, which latter is exactly its present number.

Character of the People. — It has often been remarked, that the 
inhabitants of the Carse of Gowrie are rather of a phlegmatic 
temperament, and somewhat wanting in quickness of apprehen- 
sion. In as far as the people of this parish are concerned, the writer 
of this account has formed a very different opinion. Though a 
stranger might be ready to mistake a coolness and deliberation of 
manner by which they are characterized for constitutional heavi- 
ness, or a little reserve for lack of intelligence, he who comes into 
close and familiar intercourse with them in the ordinary matters of 
life, will soon discover, that while they are as much alive as men in 
general to what is going on in the world, they are shrewd, sensi-

ble, and calculating. In their worldly callings they are indus- 
trious; in their mode of life, frugal and provident; in their gene- 
ral conduct, sober and orderly, just and upright. They, as their 
fathers for generations past have been, are distinguished for their 
regularity and decorum in attending on divine ordinances, an ob- 
vious consequence of which is to be seen in their comparative ex- 
emption from flagrant immoralities. 

IV. Industry. 

Agriculture— The parish, as previously stated, contains 1152£ 
acres standard Imperial measure, the whole of which, with the 
exception of 33 acres under wood, are arable. About 60 acres 
are laid out in permanent pasture, the remaining 1059 are regu- 
larly cultivated. 

Bents.— The rents are fixed in grain, with a very trivial excep- 
tion, paid at the rate of the highest fiars' prices of the county 
They average about 3£ bolls per Scots acre, in equal portions of 
wbeat, barley, and oats. The average price by the highest fiars 
for the county for the last seven years for the 3 bolls i. e. 4 
bushels of wheat, 6 bushels of barley, and 6 bushels of oats is 
L.3, 2s., making the average rent per Scots acre L. 3, 7s. 2d., or 
L. 2, ] 3s. 8d. per acre Imperial. As to Wages, Live-Stock, and 
Husbandry, the remarks made in the account of the parish of 
Errol are entirely applicable to this parish, and therefore it is un- 
necessary to do more than refer to these remarks. 

Draining.— The system of wedge or furrow-draining first in- 
troduced to this district sixteen years ago, and first practised on 
the farm of Pitfour Mains by Mr R. W. Rannie, has been adopt 
ed to a considerable extent by all the tenants in the parish ; the 
result has been a great improvement, especially in the more re- 
tentive clays. Different materials have been used in the forma- 
tion of these drains. When they were first introduced, turf was very 
generally used, but was found not to endure many years, particular- 
ly in clays much impregnated with ferruginous matter. Wood cut 
into boards four and a half inches broad by one inch or three quar- 
ters of an inch thick, was then adopted and found to answer well 
m tenacious clay; in more friable soils, stones broken to the size 
of road metal were preferred. Within the last five years, tiles have 
come into very general use for draining, but have not till the pre- 
sent year been introduced to this parish. The spirited proprietor, 
Sir John S. Richardson, having lately erected at a considerable 
expense an extensive range of buildings, consisting of drying sheds, 



ST MA DOES. 



631 



engine and moulding sheds, and kilns, for the purpose of manu- 
facturing drain tiles by machinery, they are now within easy reach 
of the tenantry, who are. beginning to employ them to a consider- 
able extent. It cannot be doubted that much benefit will accrue 
to the surrounding district, as well as to Sir John's own property, 
from this manufactory. An article admirably adapted for drain- 
ing will thus be brought within the reach of many, who, from the 
expense incurred by the purchase and carriage of wood and stones, 
which are with difficulty procured here, have hitherto been de- 
terred from draining to any extent. Such, indeed, has been the 
demand for tiles since last spring, when their manufacture com- 
menced, that Sir John has resolved to double the size of his sheds, 
&amp;c, and to work the machinery by a steam-engine. Such too is 
the feeling towards him among the agriculturists not only in the 
Carse of Gowrie, but also in Strathearn and the Stormont, on 
account of his spirited conduct in setting agoing, solely at his own 
risk, this tile manufactory, that, while I am now writing, he is un- 
der an invitation by some three hundred of them to a public din- 
ner, in which, I may be permitted to add, they are joined by a 
number of the inhabitants of Perth, from a sense of the obliga- 
tions under which they lie to him for his attention to their com- 
mercial interests. 

Embankments. — About 68 Scots acres of land have been here 
at different times reclaimed from the Tay by embankments. In 
1826, in consequence of an arrangement between the proprietor 
and Mr R. W. Rannie, tenant Pitfour Mains, by which the latter 
agreed to raise an embankment at his own expense, and after being- 
allowed to take the first crop rent free, to pay L. 4, 10s. annually 
per Scots acre for the reclaimed land during a lease of nineteen 
years, operations were commenced which resulted in the complete 
reclamation of fifty acres during the autumn of that year. The 
whole expense of embankment, sluices, levelling, water-cuts, and 
trenching amounted to L. 1 530. So productive, however, did the 
new soil turn out, that Mr Rannie has been amply rewarded for his 
enterprise. According to his own account, he has had, before lim- 
ing and manuring, on some parts of a field about 60 bolls of pota- 
toes per acre, the average produce being from 40 to 50 bolls. 
After liming and manuring he has had on some parts of a field 
70 bolls per acre, the average from 50 to 60 bolls of 32 stones 
Dutch to the boll. He has had of oats, before liming and manur- 
ing, from 10 to 11, after liming and manuring from 12 to 13 quar- 



6,32 PERTHSHIRE, 



ters per acre, and of wheat from six to seven quarters per acre. 
He .com fenced hmmgin 1829 and manuring in 1835, the rota- 

t T P lit being P ° tat0es ' and wheat or oa 's alternate- 

pJnP fr v ° hn Richardson reclaimed 18 acres more at an 
expense of L. 1200; and by means of head-dikes, breakwaters, 
c, which he is from time to time throwing out in the river for the 
purpose of accumulating silt, upwards of 150 acres more may ul- 
timately be added to the parish; of these from 15 to 20 may be 
banked off in the course of two years. It is worthy of being men- 
boned here that Sir John, in a paper on his Embankments, read 
before the Highland Society, and for which he received the So- 
ciety s medal states, « that if various conflicting interests could be 
reconciled, there would be added to the Carse of Gowrie a tract 
of land equally rich with that which has been described, and extend- 
ing to many thousands of acres." He adds, « This scheme was ori- 
ginally suggested by my grandfather forty years ago, and I trust 
that before another forty years are gone, the now barren sand-banks 
of the estuary of the Tay may be converted into fertile fields." 

zs,ungs -The only fishing carried on here is the salmon, the 
right to which belongs solely to Sir John Richardson. The an-

The valued rent of the parish is L. 1300 Scots. The real rent 
is about L. 4000 Sterling. 

Manufactures.-The only branch of manufacture carried on in 
the parish is that of linen and coarse canvass, the flax and hemp 
being supplied to hand-loom weavers by Dundee merchants, who 
pay so much per web for weaving. The number of these weavers 
does not exceed a dozen, and their labours at the loom are con- 
fined to the winter months, as they prefer being employed at ho 
salmon-fishery during the rest of the year.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town— The nearest market-town is Perth, six miles 
distant, where the produce of the parish is principally disposed of, 
and from which the inhabitants receive their supplies. 

Villages. — There are two small villages, named Hawkstone and 
Cot-town, with a population of 50 and 67 respectively. 

Means of Communication.— The post-town is Perth, with which 
by coaches and carriers there are daily opportunities of intercourse. 
The great north road from Perth to Aberdeen by Dundee runs 
along the northern boundary of the parish, and the road from 
Perth to Errol passes through its northern parts. Various roads 
intersect it, affording easy access from all the farm-steadings to the 
turnpike-road from Perth to Dundee. 

New Pier—A pier and shorehouse were erected about seven 
years ago by the proprietor on his reclaimed land, nearly opposite 
to the junction of the rivers Tay and Earn. There has thus 
been provided an excellent and most convenient shipping-place, 
very advantageous to the inhabitants of the parish. Large quan- 
tities of potatoes are here shipped annually for the London mar- 
ket, while coals, lime, manure, &amp;c. are received. The shore-dues 
are at the rate of ld. per ton. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Sir John Stuart Richardson is the patron. 
The parish church, although situated near the northern boundary 
of the parish, cannot be said to be inconveniently distant from any 
of the inhabitants, as there are not any of them farther from it 
than two miles. The old church was taken down, and the present 
one built in 1798. It is in good repair, and in every way comfor- 
table, having lately had attached to it a stove for warming it with 
heated air. 

The number of sittings in the church is 410, a number fitted to 
accommodate nearly twice the examinable inhabitants of the pa- 
rish. A considerable portion of them, however, are occupied by 
persons from the neighbouring parishes of Kinnoul, Kinfauns, and 
Errol, who are from two and a-half to six miles distant from their 
own parish churches, while they are quite close to St Madoes' 
church ; so that there is not a sitting that is not appropriated and 
occupied. There are no seat-rents exacted, the proprietor per- 
mitting even those persons who are in the habit of coming from 
the fore-mentioned parishes to have free sittings. 

The only benefaction on record is one of 200 merks left by Mr 
Campbell, minister of the parish in 1676, which, with good manage- 
ment, and savings from the weekly contributions added to it, from 



634 



PERTHSHIRE. 



time to time, by the kirk-session, has accumulated to a considerable 
sum, the interest of which is employed for the support of the poor. 

The manse was built in 1804, and repaired in 1829. The 
glebe consists of between 22 and 23 acres Scots, exclusive of gar- 
den, orchard, shrubberies, &amp;c. which may contain two acres more. 
The soil is generally of excellent quality. Having lately been 
subjected to thorough draining, its productive powers have been 
much increased, especially in reference to green crops. Accord- 
ing to the mode in which land is let in the parish, the glebe would 
draw an annual rent of three bolls of grain per acre, i. e. 4 
bushels of wheat, 6 of oats, and 6 of barley, which, according to 
the average of the fiars prices of the county for the last five years, 
would amount to between L. 70 and L. 80. The present stipend is 
14 chalders, half meal, half barley, the average amount of which for 
the last five years, inclusive of an allowance of L. 8, 6s. 8d. for 
communion elements, is L. 208, 10s. 5d. The last augmentation 
took place in 1818. The number of families in the parish who 
attend the Established Church is 62, and the number of persons 
of all ages belonging to it is 335. The number of families not in 
the parish, but who regularly attend the church of St Madoes, 
is 34, these affording upwards of 100 church-goers. There are 
4 families in the parish belonging to the Dissenters, containing 15 
persons of all ages. Divine service at the Established Church is 
attended by all classes with the greatest regularity. The sa- 
crament of the Lord's Supper is dispensed twice a year, in Fe- 
bruary and in August ; at the former time the average number of 
communicants is 225, at the latter 245 j of these from 70 to 80 
come from the neighbouring parishes. 

There is a society for religious purposes in the parish. Its 
members all belong to the Established Church, and its funds are 
mainly appropriated to the advancement of the Church of Scot- 
land's four great schemes. The average amount of these for the 
last ten years is L. 25 annually, this partly obtained by private sub- 
scriptions, and partly by public collections. 

Education. — There is no week-day school in the parish but the 
parochial, in which English reading and grammar, writing, arith- 
metic, book-keeping, practical mathematics, and geography, with 
Latin and Greek, if required, are taught. The schoolmaster has 
the legal accommodation and the maximum salary. The school 
fees are small and ill paid, the whole sum realized from them not 
exceeding L. 10 Sterling annually, although the average num- 



ST MADOES. 99B 

ber of scholars throughout the year be nearly 50. It appears 
from one of the old session-records that, upwards of 100 years ago, 
the then Laird of Pitfour set apart two acres of land for the be- 
nefit of the schoolmaster in all time coming; but somehow or an- 
other they have since been swallowed up, and even tradition does 
not very clearly mark their locality. 

There is a Sabbath school taught by the minister and school- 
master, which is pretty numerously attended not only by children 
belonging to the parish, but also by those of the parents from 
neighbouring parishes who attend the church of St Madoes, and 
even by some children of Dissenting parents. It numbers at pre- 
sent 51. 

Literature.— There is a religious library which was instituted 
in 1836, by the liberality of Lady Richardson, to which all the 
people who are in the habit of attending the church, as well as the 
parishioners of St Madoes, have access for the small sum of 4d. 
per quarter. It now consists of 200 volumes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
for the last ten years, who have received parochial aid in one form 
or another, is ten. Of these four have been regularly on the 
poor's roll, three of whom received from 5s. to 7s. a month each, 
besides a free house and two bolls of coals. The fourth is a fatu- 
ous person, who is boarded at the expense of the parish, and whose 
maintenance and clothing amount to between L. 16 and L. 17 a- 
year. The annual amount of collections in church averages about 
L. 30 ; and from other sources, as money lent on hand, mortcloth 
dues, &amp;c there is an additional sum of L. 23, available for the be- 
nefit of the poor. It ought to be mentioned here, that, besides the 
allowance of two bolls of coals by the kirk-session, to each pauper 
annually, Sir John and Lady Richardson are in the habit of send- 
ing them firewood and coals. There yet remains among the poor 
a good deal of that spirit which recoils at the idea of parochial re- 
lief ; and although they will readily enough receive what is offer- 
ed as private charity, they are not only reluctant to apply for, but 
unwilling to take aid from the session funds. 

Inns and Ale-houses. — There is but one in the parish, situated 
on the pier. It is a necessary convenience not only to those who 
may have to transact business in shipping their farm produce, but 
to the traveller who has to cross the ferry, which is here establish- 
ed between this part of the Carse of Gowrie district and the op- 
posite districts of Fife and Strathearn. Being well conducted, it 



636 



PERTHSHIRE. 



cannot be said to have any evil effect upon the morals of the 
people. 

Fuel— Among the poorer classes a good deal of wood is used, 
which is procured from the periodical thinnings and fellings in the 
parish and neighbourhood. Coal, however, is generally used, part- 
ly from the south coast of Fife, and partly from Newcastle, and 
being landed at the parish pier, is secured at a moderate rate— 
15s. per ton for Scots, and 16s. 6d. per ton for English. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the pa- 
rish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count are, its enlargement by the making up and embanking of 
new lands on the river side,— its more complete drainage, the 
fields in general not only being pervaded by furrow drains, but 
every bog and morass being dried, so that there is not a single fall of 
ground in the parish, with the exception of what is under wood, 
that is not fitted for bearinggrain,— and the improved means of com- 
munication from one part of it to another by good roads. The 
feeling among the farmers with regard to the adoption of new 
modes of cultivation, and supposed improvements in agriculture, 
has also considerably changed. Prejudices in behalf of the olden 
ways and plans have greatly abated, and whether it be by giving a 
fair trial to methods of culture, which would in former times have 
been despised, or to new varieties of grain, which once would have 
been rejected, the farmers are now showing that they have sense, 
and are reaping their reward. With regard to the improvements 
of which the parish is still susceptible by a better system of hus- 
bandry, there cannot be much said ; but certainly for many years 
past there has been a far larger proportion of wheat sown than is 
consistent with justice to the soil ; and the writer of this account 
is persuaded, from his own observation and experience, that, if the 
agriculturists of this parish and of the Carse of Gowrie in general, 
would adopt a system of cropping by which they should not have 
wheat oftener than once every four years, they would be gainers 
in the end.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. DUNCAN CAMPBELL, MINISTER. 



I.—T/OPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HlSTORY. 

Name.— A stranger alive to the sublime and beautiful m na- 
ture's works, in coming to this district would be immediately 
struck with the aspect of five elevated and singularly commanding 
eminences which bound the horizon to the north of the village oi 
Moulin. In the vernacular language they are called Mill-Uaine, 
green mountains, and it is supposed that the greenish appearance 
of these commanding eminences may have given the name both to 
the village and the parish. Others suggest that the Gaelic for 
the English word Mill, viz. Mullionn, is sufficient to account for 
the name, more especially as the fertile How, so called, was 
known, in olden times, to have been famous for its mill. Those, 
however, who would thus derive the name, must be strangers to 
the manner in which the natives pronounce Moulin, which is very 
different from that given to the Gaelic of Mill. In the former 
Statistical Account its etymology is thus resolved: " A small lake 
once stood in the neighbourhood of the village, and has been con- 
verted by means of draining into meadow ground. The word 
Moulin seems to have some reference to this lake ; perhaps it may 
be maoth-linne, a smooth pool, or magh-linne, pool field." 

Extenf, Boundaries, and Topographical Appearances.— Owing to 
its mountainous character, the extent of the parish is not correctly 
ascertained. Its length diagonally from the south-west to the north- 
east boundary may be 15 or 16 miles. As the parish of Logierait 
projects considerably into it on the south-east, and that of Blair 
Atholl into the north-west, its figure is extremely irregular. It has 
been divided into two districts, the Atholl and the Strathardle district. 
A hill of from three to four miles divides them. The Strathardle 
section extends in length about 8 miles north-west to south-east, 



638 



PERTIISIIIIi E. 



and in breadth 7 miles. The length of the Atholl division from 
north-west to south-east is 7, its breadth varies from 5 to 7 miles. 
It is bounded on the north-east, by the parish of Kirkmichael; on the 
south-east, by Logierait j on the south-west, by Dull ; and on the 
west and north-west, by Blair Atholl. The Atholl division of the 
parish is bisected by the Garry and the Tummel. It lies princi- 
pally, however, to the north of these rivers. The arable land rises 
in some places more gradually, in others with greater acclivity from 
their banks. The only striking mountain is Beinvrackie, Beinn 
Bhreacaidh, a " spreckled mountain,"— a mountain which forms a 
prominent feature in the scenery of the whole surrounding country, 
and, from whatever situation viewed, is always graceful, and 
grand. The prospect from it is remarkably fine, and abundantly 
compensates the trouble of ascending it. Its elevation above the 
level of the sea is nearly 3000 feet. In the Strathardle district 
the general appearance is bleak and mountainous. The rich green 
hills of Glenfarnate stand, however, in pleasant contrast to the 
sombre and sterile aspect of the surrounding mountains ; and the 
young and rising plantations of Kindrogan and Dirnanaen give a 
clad-like appearance to the eastern extremity of the valley. The 
Strath is watered by the Briarachan and the Ardle, and is brought 
into a state ofgood cultivation through the persevering exertions of 
its industrious tenantry. 

Meteorology.— The climate varies considerably in different parts 
of the parish. The Strathardle district is often clothed in the white 
robe of winter, while in the Atholl division there is not a particle 
of snow. And it has often been remarked, that the tempera- 
ture is very different from what it was some sixty or seventy years 
ago. In exchange for the great and long-continued heat of sum- 
mer and the excessive cold of winter which was then experienced, 
we have now very little of fine summer weather, and, with few ex- 
ceptions, the winters are generally mild and temperate. Winter 
1838 was one of these exceptions. In February of that year the 
cold was intense, the thermometer stood at 3° of Fahrenheit ; and 
on the 5th January 1839, the barometer stood 27 inches, a de- 
gree of depression never before witnessed here. Of late, during 
the summer months the thermometer ranged from 45° to 75°, and 
in winter from '20° to 50°. Situated nearly in the centre betwixt 
the Atlantic and German Oceans, the air here is not so humid 
as it is, a little more to the south-west. Our geographical posi- 



MOULIN.

tion may also account for other unexpected and sudden varia- 
tions to which we are liable. The prevailing winds are south-west 
and north-west, and east and south-east ; and it is no uncommon 
phenomenon to observe the clouds travelling northward, while 
the wind on the surface of the earth blows in the opposite direc- 
tion. . . „ 

As a proof that we breathe the wholesome and bracing air ot a 
highly salubrious climate, we may mention that, according to a 
census taken in December 1838, and January 1839, there were 
112 individuals in the parish above the age of seventy; of whom 
29 were above eighty, and 2 above ninety years of age. 

Distempers.— Rheumatism is the most common complaint, after 
which comes the whole class of inflammatory ailments, those of 
the chest occurring most frequently. Typhus or infectious fevers 
scarce ever prevail, and only exist when persons labouring under 
them are brought into the parish. Hooping-cough, measles, scar- 
let fever, &amp;c. visit the district occasionally— and also small-pox, 
but it is generally modified and seldom fatal, from the prevalent 
adoption of vaccination. This operation, however, is not always 
left to our eminently skilful and much esteemed practitioner, Dr 
Irvine, and in consequence is less efficacious than it ought to be, 
on account of its being often performed by unqualified persons. 

Hydrography. — The only lake is Lochbroom, Loch Bhraoin, 
the lake of showers, situated in a hill on the confines of the pa- 
rish of Moulin and Logierait ; well known for the abundance and 
fine quality of its fish, and therefore often frequented by anglers 
during the summer months. 

Rivers. — The rivers are the Briarachan, Arnate, Ardale, Gar- 
ry and the Tummel. The Briarachan, rising in the north of the 
parish, and after changing its name four different times, mingles 
its waters with the Tay above Kinclavin. The Arnate, " Fearn- 
aite, the alder district" takes its rise from Lochloch in the north- 
east of the parish, and runs through Glenfarnate, and its junction 
with the Briarachan forms the Ardale. The Ardle or Arn- 
dale, " Fearn-dail" the Ardle-dale, is formed by the junction of 
the two preceding rivers, and after a course of ten miles, joins the 
Black-water. The principal rivers that wind their course through 

 There is a tradition that the Ardle received its name from that of a person of dis. 
tinction who was killed in an engagement fought between the Danes and the Cale- 
donians, on its banks, near to the place where it is formed by the Briarachan and Ar- 
nate. The name of this personage was Ardle, Ard-jhuil, noble blood, and hence the

the parish are the classic Garry and Tummel. The Garry, « Gath- 
ruith," the flight of the dart, or more probably " Garaidh," a den, 
takes its rise from a lake of the same name in the north-west of 
the parish of Blair Atholl. It is perhaps one of the most furious 
and impetuous rivers in Scotland ; and when flooded, the rapidi- 
ty of its stream, and the rumbling noise of its many waters, tear- 
ing up every thing that obstructs its progress, is terrifically grand. 
It has several striking cascades in its course, and its banks, after it 
enters this parish, are richly wooded. After flowing nearly thirty 
miles, and receiving in its course many tributary streams, it unites 
with the Tummel, near the celebrated falls of that name. 

The Tummel, teth-thuil, a hot or boiling flood, or rather tedmh- 
thuil, a dark flood, or perhaps tedmh-thuill, a gloomy den, issues 
from Loch Rannoch, in the parish of Fortingal. Its current is ra- 
pid and turbulent, until it unites with the Garry, after which it 
becomes a majestic stream meandering through a fine and fertile 
valley. The scenery of the Tummel in point of beauty and mag- 
nificence is seldom equalled. After running a course not exceed- 
ing twenty-five miles, " its name and its waters are alike swallow- 
ed up by the all-devouring Tay at Logierait." 

Cascades, — In a parish abounding in so many large streamlets 
rushing down with an impetuous current from mountains of conside- 
rable altitude, the formation of cascades is to be expected as a mat- 
ter of course. But, with the exception of the beautiful and pictu- 
resque cascades at Edradour, and at Urrard, and that of the Tum- 
mel, they are all, I believe, unsung and uncelebrated. « The fall 
of the Tummel is truly a fine object : whether to the mere admir- 
ers of waterfalls, or to those who know better in what the main me- 
rit of this class of scenery consists. It is a peculiar and rare 
merit in the cascade of the Tummel, that it is beautiful in itself, 
and almost without the aid of its accompaniments. Though the 
water breaks white almost throughout, the forms are so graceful, so 
varied, and so well marked, that we can look at it long without 

name of the river and of the district. The grave of Prince Ardle is still pointed out 
on the property of Dirnanaean in this parish. The Briarachan has an equally roman- 
tic origin, which will readily suggest itself to him who is conversant with Gaelic an- 
tiquarian lore. If he be at a loss, Ossian's characters will help him. The banks 
of the Arnate and Ardle are covered with alder or Scotch mahogany, and it issin«m. 
Jar enough that none of it grows upon the banks of the Briarachan. the only growth 
of the arboreous description which finds existence there is the brier, and that in great 
abundance. There is an obsolete Gaelic word Briar, a brier or thorn : does that 
word form any part of the composition of Briarachan  if so, it would not inapplica- 
bly represent what the district may have been at one time, — " fields of briers." 
 Edradour — eadar-da-dhohhar, between two waters — nrrard — ttr-ard, high heath.

beino wearied with monotony, and without attending to the surround- 
ing landscape. Whether low or full, whether the river glides 
transparent over the rocks to burst in foam below, or whether it 
descends like a torrent of snow from the very edge, this fall is al- 
ways various and always graceful. The immediate accompani- 
ments are, however, no less beautiful and appropriate, and the ge- 
neral landscape is, at the same time, rich and romantic, nothing 
being left to desire to render this one of the most brilliant scenes 
which our country produces." 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The rocks of which our mountains 
are composed are chiefly the mica slate, which is penetrated 
in every direction by veins of quartz. This rock contains schorll, 
both the common and tourmaline, and also common and precious 
garnets, which may be considered as forming an essential component 
part of mica-slate. To form a correct idea of the geological and 
mineralogical character of the parish, it may be best to begin in 
the south-east extremity, and travel northward. At Aldour, on the 
north bank of the Tummel, the bed there consists of micaceous 
granular quartz. This rock has the peculiarity, that its dip is to 
the north-east, at an angle of from 15 to 20°, whereas the inclina- 
tion of all the other seams is in a different direction. It is of a 
cream or buff colour, well adapted for architectural purposes, and 
has been wrought for building the House of Faskally. A little far- 
ther north, the stratum is hornblende slate dipping north-west. 
The next deposit consists of primitive limestone, which traverses the 
parish, as all the other strata do, in a north-east and south-west di- 
rection. Its dip is at an angle which varies from 45° to 60° north- 
west, its general thickness is about 60 feet ; it is extremely hard, 
and of a light blue colour. It is so intermixed with sandy particles, 
that it is scarcely ever used for other than agricultural purposes. 
The mountains to the north-west and the whole of the Pass of Kil- 
liecrankie, are composed of mica-slate orquartzose mica-slate. The 
strata in Killiecrankie are nearly vertical. At the Girnag the dip 
is south east, at an angle of 60° to 70°, so that the conformation 
of the strata within the parish resembles very much an arch. In 
the How of Moulin, there are scattered large masses of primitive 
limestone or marble, of a beautiful crystalline texture, and of a 

 If it be true, that the falls of Bruar had their petition granted in consequence of 
Burn's poetical effusion in their behalf, would that a Burns undertook to plead the 
cause of the Tummel. Its cause is not less urgent, and the theme not less poetical.

much richer quality than the limestone in their immediate neigh- 
bourhood. The great limestone bed which commences in the 
south-west of Perthshire, and terminates in the north-east in Aber- 
deenshire, intersects a portion of the parish, and these boulders, al- 
though lying several miles off the line of this great deposit, still 
appear to belong to it. Granite and quartz are found only in de- 
tached pieces. Fragments of fluor-spar may be met with in several 
parts, and rock crystal is found in Beinvrackie. 

Soils. — The soil, in a parish consisting of so much hill and dale, 
must be extremely various. Along the banks of the rivers it is 
light and sandy. In some elevated situations it consists of till. It 
is to be found of a deep rich loam, but the general character is gra- 
velly. The subsoil is also found of all varieties, of hard mortar, 
scarcely pervious to water, of gravel, of which there is a great pro- 
portion, and some of the soil is recumbent upon lime. In the 
How of Moulin there is perhaps the richest soil in the Highlands 
of Perthshire. Fine black loam is the prevailing character, and in 
the vicinity of the old castle, which was surrounded with water, it 
consists of a bed of alluvial deposits, composed of gravel, sand, and 
clay. It rests on peat, of a soft porous consistence, and much im- 
pregnated with sulphurous matter. Underneath the peat, there is 
a layer of marl, from a foot to three feet in thickness, but it is found 
not to repay the expense of casting. Lime is found to be less 
costly, and is more generally used. The How of Moulin, from 
the richness of its soil, yields grain of superior quality. Hence it 
is called " The Garden of Atholl." Here agricultural operations 
are conducted on the most approved principles. The distilleries, 
with which so many of the farmers are connected, afford great fa- 
cilities for enriching their lands, and farms are now known to yield 
double the crops which they were wont to bear. 

Extraneous Fossils. — In the former Account, mention is made of 
the skull of a large horned animal, found imbedded in a marl pit in 
the neighbourhood, and supposed to have belonged to one of those 
animals, which Caesar calls Uri, and which were found in the Her- 
cynian forest in Germany. In 1816 other two skulls, of nearly si- 
milar dimensions with the above, were found in the same pit. As 
in the former instance, so in these, the horns were lost, but the 
pith was entire, and the greatest circumference of one of them was 
15 inches. One of these skulls was presented to the British Mu- 
seum, London ; and the other two to the late Duke of Atholl,

which are to be seen among those of other animals in Blair 
Castle. 

Animals. — " The quadrupeds are horses, cows, sheep, goats, 
swine, dogs, cats, wild cats, polecats, weasels, martins, foxes, bad- 
gers, rabbits, roes, deer, hares in abundance, a species of hare of a 
light-blue colour in summer, and perfectly white in winter. The 
fowls are, common hens, geese, ducks, pigeons, wood-pigeons, jays, 
wood-cocks,f magpies, rails, plovers, herons, owls, partridges, 
muir-fowls, blackcocks, crows, hawks, ravens, kites, eagles." To 
this enumeration there are now to be added the otter, the hedge- 
hog, the squirrel, the rat, the turkey, and the pheasant. The 
snipe and ptarmigan, and many other Alpine birds, not mentioned 
above, are found in our hills. Among the smaller birds we have 
the blackbird, the mavis, the lark, the linnet, and the thrush, to de- 
light us with the sweet variety of their melodies; and in their sea- 
son the cuckoo and other migratory birds make their appearance. 

Fishes. — There is abundance of common river trout found in the 
Garry and Tummel, and in their season salmon, grilse, and sea- 
trout. The salmon begin to arrive in March, grilse and sea-trout 
in June. They return again from January to April. 

Botany. — This, like every other Highland parish, affords an 
interesting field to the botanist. The following plants are found 



here : 



Aira flexuosa Carex intermedia 

Alchemilla alpina ovalis 

Alnus glutinosa pallescens

I am not aware of the disappearance of any animal that formerly existed here ex- 
cept the goat, and if it is now at any time seen, it is only as an occasional visitor from 
higher and wilder regions.

Forests, c. — There are several kinds of plantations in the pa- 
rish. The sorts of timber to which the soil appears most conge- 
nial are, oak, ash, Scotch fir, spruce, birch, and larch. There is 
a considerable extent of natural wood, consisting of oak and birch. 
The highly picturesque and romantic pass of Killiecrankie  is 
clothed chiefly with the latter. All species of fruit trees and all 
varieties of shrubs and roses, are to be found in our orchards, 
shrubberies, and flower-gardens. 

 It was, I think, Dr M'Culloch who says, that Killiecrankie derived its name 
from the site of a chapel recently existing there. The Gaelic of the word is coile- 
chrionaich, decayed brushwood, and in contradistinction to which there is in the 
neighbourhood " Orchil" urchoille, young wood ; " Faskally" fas-choille, a young 
thriving wood. It is true this latter word may also mean " a desert wood." There 
can be no doubt, however, as to the meaning of Killiecrankie. The old Gaelic pro- 
verb explains it : " Cha chuirinn mo thuagh Bhearnach ann do choilte-chrionaich." "I 
would not put my chipped axe in your ■withered brushwood." For many a year sub- 
sequent to 1689, Killiecrankie was an object of dread to the regularly disciplined 
soldier. Such was the impression which the Hessian troops entertained of this pass, 
that, in 1746, no argument could prevail upon them to approach it. In their imari- 
nations, it was the ultima thule of a civilized country.

There is a sprinkling of evidently old trees round the mansion- 
houses of the present proprietors ; a few also point out the re- 
sidences of several families now extinct, and consist for the most 
part of Scotch fir, ash, plane, elm, and oak. I am not aware that 
anv of the trees of this parish deserve particular notice, with the 
exception, perhaps, of the geen tree at Edradour, which at thirty 
inches above the surface of the ground, is 1 1 feet in circumference,- 
and the memorable ash in the church -yard, which at the ground is 
17 feet, 5 inches, and 13 feet, 3 inches in circumference at six feet 
above ground,-the Weymouth pines at Faskally are reckoned 
among the finest in Scotland,— and the two magnificent oaks which 
stand in all the pride of "monarchical" independence in the lawn 
of Urrard,— the largest measuring at the base, 17 feet, and at 
eight feet above the earth, 13 feet in circumference. Its stem 
contains 298 cubic feet of timber, and the lateral branches cover 
a space of ground nearly 80 feet in diameter. The late Major 
Alston Stewart is said to have refused L. 70 for it. At the same 
place, there are also two fine larches, the largest measuring 9 feet, 
4 inches, and the other 8 feet, 9 inches in circumference, at 3 
feet above ground. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events.— The parish has been the scene of two his- 
torical events of considerable importance in different points of view : 
the one, as it secured, at the time, the stability of the Protestant 
succession ; the other, as it afforded a striking manifestation of the 
power of Protestant Christianity on the soul of man. 

On the 27th July 1689, the celebrated battle of Killiecrankie 
was fought in this parish, between the forces of General M'Kay, 
Commander of the government troops, for the protection of the 
Revolution settlement, and the Highlanders, who flocked round 
the standard of Graham, Viscount of Dundee, in behalf of King- 
James VII. Of this engagement, many interesting accounts have 
been written. Chalmers, in his History of the Rebellions, Browne, 
in his History of the Highlands, and M'Kay of Rockfield in 
his Life of General M'Kay, have detailed every circumstance 
connected with this battle, with a degree of minuteness which 
leaves nothing for future historians to supply. In a Memoir of 
Lord Viscount Dundee, by an officer of the army, printed in Lon- 
don in 1714, we have the following appalling picture of the savage 
and unrelenting ferocity with which, on that memorable occasion, 
the Highlanders, with their claymores and Lochaber axes, attack-

ed M'Kay's men : « The clans earnestly entreated Dundee not 
to engage in person, on the ground that their method of fighting 
was quite different from that of regular troops, and if he should be 
Killed, King James's interest would be lost in Scotland. But no 
argument could dissuade him from engaging at the head of his 
troops. General M'Kay's army out-winged Dundee's near a 
quarter of a mile, which obliged the clans to leave large intervals 
between each clan, and by declining towards the wings, they want- 
ed troops to charge the centre, where a detachment of Lesly'sand 
Hastings English regiments were. The Highlanders threw away 
their plaids, haversacks, and all other utensils, and marched reso- 
lutely and deliberately in their shirts and doublets, with their fusils, 
swords, targets, and pistols ready, down the hill on the enemy, 
and received M'Kay's third fire before they pierced his line, in 
which many of the Highland army fell, particularly Lord Viscount 
Dundee, their general, the terror of the Whigs, the supporter of

landers fired threw down their fusils,. rushed in upon the enemy 
with sword, target, and pistol, who did not maintain the,r ground 
two minutes after the Highlanders were amongst them, and 1 dare 
be bold to say, there were scarce ever such strokes given in bu- 
Ipe as were given that day by the Highlanders Many of Geiie 
ral M'Kay's officers and soldiers were cut down through the skull 
and neck to the breasts ; others had their skulls cut above their 
ears like night-caps ; some soldiers had both their bodies and cross 
belts cut through at one blow; pikes and small swords were cm 
like willows, and whoever doubts of this may consult the witnesses 
of the tragedy." Victory declared on the side of Dundee. 1 he 
loss which his partv sustained is variously estimated ; that ot 
M'Kay's was dreadful, upwards of 2000 of his men were hewn 
down by the Highlanders. King William, who could not be ex- 
pected to recline on a bed of roses, when he heard of the utter dis- 
comfiture of his troops, and, at the same time, of the death of his 
victorious antagonist, is reported to have said, « Well, were it not 
so, Dundee would have been at my gates to tell it himself." On 
the other hand, the death of Claverhouse proved fatal to the pros- 
pects of King James ; his fall put an end for ever to the Stewart 
dynasty. Dundee was interred in the church of Blair- Atholl.  
" The other event to which we alluded is still fresh in the memory 
of many in the parish, and at the time created no small sensation

m tins country. We allude to the « religious revival" which took 
place here in 1800 under the ministration of Dr Stewart, who died 
minister of the Canongate, Edinburgh. The Rev. J. Sievwright 
ot Markinch, in his memoir of Dr Stewart, gives a full and de- 
tailed history of this remarkable awakening. To that memoir we 
would refer the reader, who may feel disposed to inquire further 
into the subject. A few even of those, who were in 1800 accounted 
subjects of conversion, are still living, and have uniformly through 
life, by the piety and consistency of their conduct, given proof of 
the reality of the saving change that had been effected on their 
heart. Dr Stewart's memory is highly revered and affectionately 
cherished by the older people in the parish.  

Eminent Characters.— It is an honour of which we have reason 
to be proud, that Moulin gave birth to Dr Duff, the Church of 
Scotland's first missionary to India. Dr Inglis, whose master- 
mind conceived the plan of evangelizing the millions of India by 
means of native teachers, was requested by the General Assembly 
to look out for a young man to whom the undertaking could be 
entrusted. Dr Duff, who was then a student at the University of 
St Andrews, and well known for his missionary spirit, was fixed 
upon as a person eminently qualified for carrying out the views of 
the Church in regard to India. The services of a more suitable 
person could not be secured. Uniting genius, talents, and learn- 
ing, piety, zeal and energy, and withal an eloquence of the most un- 
fettered, commanding, and effective character, admirably adapted 
to demolish the strongholds of heathenism among the nations of 
the East, he left Britain in the Lady Holland in Oclober 1829, 
and, after suffering shipwreck and losing his all, he landed on the 
shores of India on the 30th May 1830, opened our Institution in 
Calcutta in the end of July following, and in the course of a short 
period had the happiness to see, that the realization of the origina- 
tor's fondest hopes was a matter that could no longer be considered 
problematical. Such, indeed, was the success which attended our 
Institution at Calcutta, that the Church was encouraged to open 
similar schools in the other Presidencies : and from time to time 
we receive the most cheering intelligence from these sister es- 
tablishments. Separated for a season from his coadjutors in this 
glorious cause, Dr Duff has for some time astonished his country-

men no less by his thrilling eloquence than by his soul-harrowing 
disclosures of Pagan barbarities. His late powerful and impres- 
sive appeals to the General Assembly, and in all parts of Scot- 
land, in behalf of the native outcasts of that country, excited an 
interest towards them which, it is hoped, will never die away. 
With his heart in India, he is again preparing, with a constitution 
in some measure renovated, to join his able and efficient fellow - 
labourers there, in the work of infusing into the minds of the na- 
tive youth, principles which may eventually tend to subvert the 
whole fabric of Hinduism, and to erect, on its ruins, the pure, hu- 
manizing, and Heavenly system of Christianity.

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest entry is 1707. 
They have been kept pretty regularly since, and contain ample 
evidence of the troublous times in which our fathers lived. In 
1745-6, while the rebel army was in the country, it is stated that 
public worship was, in consequence, suspended for several Sab- 
baths. The clergyman of Moulin, at the time, was known to en- 
tertain hostile feelings towards the Prince's cause ; but the only 
loss he appears to have sustained was from a visit of Charles's 
followers, who, sans ceremonie, dismantled his kitchen of some 
nicely dried summer provisions. 

Antiquities, tyc. — The description given in the former Statisti- 
cal Account of the old ruin which stands in the neighbourhood of 
the village of Moulin, corresponds very much with the state of the 
building as it is at present ; the only difference is, that the area, 

 Donald M'Intosh, the eminent antiquarian, the compiler of the Gaelic Pro- 
verbs, the last priest of the Old Scots Episcopal Church, and the founder of the M'In- 
tosh Library, Dunkeld, was born in the year 1743, on the farm of Orcliilmore, in 
this parish.

which is considerable, has been planted with larch trees, which, m 
they now conceal some portion of the ruin, from whatever situation 
viewed, the effect of the whole is, in consequence, not so impos- 
ingly venerable. The names by which the ruin is known are, " An 
sean chaisteal," and « caisteal dubh Mhaothlinne," the former ex- 
pressive of its antiquity, and of the absence of all authentic infor- 
mation regarding its history, and the latter appears to be a name 
frequently given to such castellated buildings, as " Caisteal dubh 
Ghairt," the black castle of Garth. The epithet " dubh" literal- 
ly signifies black, but is occasionally applied to denote something 
of a sad or calamitous nature. It is impossible to say when or by 
whom this castle was erected. The style of architecture would as- 
sign to it the eleventh or twelfth century. 

Sir John Campbell of Moulin, who was created Earl of Atholl by 
his cousin, King David II. is the only person of distinction who is 
known to have taken his title from this district ; and hence it is sup- 
posed that he may have made it his place of residence. From Dou- 
glas's Peerage, we find that David de Strathbogie, eleventh Earl of 
Atholl, had the office of Constable of Scotland conferred upon him 
by King Robert Bruce, but soon after revolting against him, his 
estates in Scotland were forfeited, and these were granted to Sir Neil 
Campbell of Lochow and Mary, his spouse, sister to the King, and 
John their son. This son was Sir John Campbell of Moulin, after- 
wards Created Earl of Atholl, as appears from a charter of King 
David II. to Robert, Lord Erskine, of the customs of Dundee. 
He was killed in the battle of Halidon Hill, 1 9th July 1333, with- 
out issue, whereby the title reverted to the Crown. 

Of upright stones, which are generally honoured with the vene- 
rable name of Druidical remnants, there is no want in this parish ; 
and here and there large upright flags of considerable thickness, 
with a Roman cross cut upon them, point out what are considered 
to be sites of Roman Catholic places of worship. Specimens of an- 
cient round forts, which are absurdly attributed to the Danes, not 
only in Scotland, but throughout Britain generally, are also to be 



seen. 



Coins. — Coins have been dug up in different parts of the pa- 
rish. A few of Edward I. of England, and Alexander III. of 
Scotland were found several years ago, on the farm of Stroncha- 

 Among the charters of King Rohert Bruce is the following : " To Mary the 
King's sister, and John Campbell, her son, omnes terras et tenementa qua: ftieruiH 
Davidis Comilis Atholic, in comitatn Athole, quas idem David forisfecit."

vie in Glenbriarachan, and in digging the foundation of the recent- 
ly erected school-house at Aldgirnaig, coins were discovered, but, 
from the date of some of them, it is clear they must have been de- 
posited there subsequent to the battle of Killiecrankie. Of that 
battle, several relics were picked up. A broken Ferara, pieces of 
broken swords, and other memorials found where the action took 
place, may be seen in the House of Urrard. 

Modern Buildings.- The parish is beautifully studded with mo- 
dern buildings. Most of the proprietors have added greatly to the 
beauty of its natural scenery by their own elegant mansions, and 
the neat comfortable slated dwellings with which they have accom- 
modated their tenantry. There is an excellent corn-mill, a dyeing 
manufactory, and a saw-mill, recently erected in Pitlochry. There 
are five thrashing-mills in the parish, and of these, two were built 
lately.

We have no means of ascertaining correctly the average num- 
ber of deaths. The two last years, 1837 and 1838, in which a regu- 
lar register of deaths has been kept, can afford no proper criterion.

The difference in these two years arises chiefly from the great 
mortality in January 1837, occasioned by the influenza, which 
prevailed at the same time in almost every kingdom in Europe.

Fatal as was the Asiatic cholera of 1831-2, it was not a severer 
scourge than the fell epidemic of 1 837. From the ravages of the 
former we happily escaped, and those who were carried off by the 
latter were persons of consumptive and asthmatic habits ; or indivi- 
duals of extreme old age. Of the 24 who attained the age of 
seventy or upwards, 12 were eighty, and of these again, 4 were 
upwards of ninety years of age ; of the 24, there were 11 males, 
and 13 females, and their united ages amounted to 1908 years. 
J n January 1839, the number of persons under 7 years of age was, 316

women upwards of 45, . . 66

The number of inhabited houses is 412; the average number 
of persons in each family is nearly 5. There are 38 houses oc- 
cupied by single individuals, and 63 by two persons, and there 
are 281 hired servants; hence the average number of children 
in each family will be 3  3 T 9 T . There is 1 fatuous ; 1 blind ; 2 
dwarfs ; 2 insane persons confined in Murray's Asylum, Perth, and 
supported there by the parish. 

Illegitimate births in the course of the last three years 6. 
Language. — The language generally spoken is the Gaelic, and 
it is evident from a little intercourse with the people, that it has 
lost ground very considerably within the last fifty years. The 
older people of the parish speak it with classical correctness, 
whereas the rising generation intermixes it with many Anglicisms. 

Habits of the People, 8fc. — The population is composed princi - 
pally of respectable tenants and tradesmen. In their habits they 
are cleanly. Their dwellings are kept, for the most part, in good 
order ; they undergo more or less of daily purification ; and it is 
not unusual to see the most part of Saturday devoted to this healthy 
operation. Their style of dress is fast assimilating itself to that of 
their southern neighbours. Home made cloths are little worn. 
It were well, however, if some of our young people would find 
their way to the Pitlochry Saving's Bank, and not throw awav 
their scanty earnings on exterior personal embellishment. It is, no 
doubt, extremely pleasing and highly becoming, to see our youth 



MOULIN.  53 



decently attired, but really the privations wnich, in after life, many 
of them will have to endure, force one to deplore this extrava- 
gance of dress, as one of the follies of our age. Though there 
are bakers and butchers among us, the style of living is not 
materially altered from that of our forefathers. Meal, milk, and 
potatoes, are the staple articles of diet. Poor, indeed, is that fa- 
mily which does not rear a pig, and the more comfortably circum- 
stanced, in addition to bacon, provide themselves also with other 
dried meat. The consumption of butcher-meat, which is now very 
considerable, is chiefly by families of the higher rank, and by our 
respectable villagers. As " to tea, snuff, and tobacco," they appear 
to have become necessary luxuries with all classes, be they ever so 
poor. On the whole, the people may be said to enjoy in a reason- 
able degree, the comforts and advantages of society, and are in ge- 
neral contented with their situation and circumstances in life. 
They are a humane, social, moral, religious, and intelligent people. 
They are fond of reading, and inconveniently situated as they 
are in regard to any valuable circulating library, it is matter of 
astonishment and heartfelt gratification to find them in possession 
not only of the ephemeral and evanescent productions of the day, but 
of many of our standard works, historical, moral, and religious. 
Among the religious works, there is to be met a variety of com- 
mentaries — Henry's, Scott's, Brown's, Haweis, and others, — some 
of Henry's works, Scott's, Brown's, Baxter's, Booth's, Boston's, 
Bunyan's, Dolittle's, Doddridge's, Dwight's, Erskine's, Flavell's, 
Harvey's, Newton's, Owen's, Willison's, Watts, &amp;c. &amp;c. The 
intercourse between them is of that friendly and kindly nature, that, 
in as far as books are concerned, "mine and thine" are synonymous. 
If it be true, then, that the character of a district, often takes its tone 
from the authors read in it, it will be superfluous, after the preced- 
ing enumeration, to remark, that the inhabitants of this parish are 
distinguished for the high respect which they pay to religion and its 
ordinances. Many of them are not only well acquainted with the 
peculiar doctrines of Christianity, but deeply imbued with the spi- 
rit of genuine piety, and are living under the power of Divine truth. 
Spurious liberalism and soul-withering infidelity, have as yet 
made little progress among us. But it is much to be dreaded, 
that the never-ceasing intercourse with this district, and the large 
manufacturing towns in the south, may eventually lead to the in- 
troduction and diffusion of sentiments and opinions which tend 



654 



PERTHSHIRE. 



to poison the mind, and unhinge the better principles of the 
people. 

Poaching. — Poaching in game does not prevail to nearly the same 
extent, as in former periods. The salmon is now allowed to remain 
unmolested in our rivers during the close season ; and, at anv other 
time, little restriction is laid on those who may have a love for 
angling amusements. 

IV. — Industry. 
According to a late survey, there were in the parish, 7 resident 
proprietors, and 3 non-resident ; 1 clergyman, 1 medical practi-

twenty is 70, under twenty is 46 ; there are also many more of 
the children of farmers and of others who are in the capacity of 
servants to their own parents. 

Agriculture. — The number of acres, standard imperial measure, 
in the parish, which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, 
is about 2719. Of land in a state of undivided common there is 
none. 

It is impossible to say exactly what number of acres may be un- 
der wood. There will be at least 2000 acres, and more than the 
half have been planted within the last fifty years. The oak, birch, 
alder, aspen, and hazel are indigenous. The general kinds plant- 
ed are oak, ash, beech, spruce, and larch. As ornamental trees 
there are a few limes, sycamores, horse-chestnuts, poplars, silver- 
firs, and walnuts. The Scotch fir does not appear to come to any 
great size ; this, however, may be owing to the want of early atten- 
tion to thinning and pruning. These matters seem to be much 
better understood now, and more attention is paid to them. Of

late years larch is the species principally planted, but it is found 
in some situations to be liable to disease. 

Rent.— The valued rent of the parish is L. 4026, 3s. lOd. Scotch. 
The real rent is about L. 7300 Sterling, exclusive of that of the 
proprietors' residences. The rent of land per acre differs ac- 
cording to the locality. In the colder and more elevated parts, it 
varies from L. 1, 5s. to L. 2 ; and in the lower districts, from L. 2 
to L. 3. Land in the neighbourhood of the villages pays L. S. 

It is difficult to condescend on the average rent of grazing at the 
rate of per cow grazed, &amp;c. where the character of the pasture is 
so various. As an approximation, L. 1, 1 5s. may be stated to be 
the average rate per cow, and 3s. per full-grown sheep pastured 
for the year. 

Rate of Wages.— Ydii-m servants receive from L. 12 to L. 16 
a-year, and female servants from L. 5 to L. 7. Labourers with- 
out victuals, engaged by the day, receive in summer from Is. 6d. 
to 2s. In winter, thrashing is the principal employment, and the 
rate of per boll thrashed is Qd. or Is. 3d. per day. Masons re- 
ceive from 15s. to 18s.; and weavers make at the rate of 10s. or 
12s. a-week. The price of the common cart used is L. 6, 6s. ; of 
a pair of harrows, L. 1, 4s. 5 of a set of horse shoes, 4s ; of a pair 
of men's shoes, 9s. ; of women's, 6s. The making of a suit of 
clothes for every day wear, 6s. A tailor hired out, Is. a-day. 

For the last seven years, oatmeal averaged 16s. per boll; En- 
glish barley, L. 1 ; and potatoes per boll, old measure, 5s. Beef 
and mutton, of which the consumption is very considerable, 6d. per 
pound ; veal, 5d. ; and pork, 5d. Fresh butter from 7d. to 8d. 
per pound; cheese, 6s. 6d. to 7s. a stone. Eggs from 4d. to 
8d. a dozen. A hen from Is. to Is. 3d. ; chickens, 6d. ; a goose, 
Is. 6d. to 2s. ; and a turkey, from 4s. to 5s. 

Implements of Husbandry. — The old Scotch plough is almost 
entirely laid aside, and two horses are now universally employed 
instead of four. Iron drill harrows are also becoming common. A 
few farmers use the scythe for cutting down their corn. In several 
districts, they still use different kinds of carts for different kinds of

work. The number of ploughs in the parish is 121, and of carts, 
221. Of four-wheeled carriages, there are 10, and of gigs 4. 

Live-Stock.— The common breed of cattle is the Highland, and 
of sheep the black-faced. Of late, a number of other varieties has 
been introduced. The pure Ayr and Angus-shire breeds of cattle 
are reared by some of the gentlemen. A cross between the Ayrshire 
cow and the Highland bull is a common description. Of late years, 
also, great attention is paid to the improvement of horses, by cros- 
sing the native breed, which is Highland, with the Clydesdale 
horse. A few Leicester sheep may be seen as followers of the 
milch cows. 

Husbandry. — The system of agriculture pursued is far from uni- 
form. The mode in general application is that of the four years 
rotation, being successively, 1. oats, 2. green crop, 3. barley, 
4. hay. A few of the farmers are beginning to adopt the five- 
shift course. Bone manure is extensively used, and the turnips 
so raised are generally eat off by sheep. Great attention has 
been paid of late to the kind and quality of seed-corn.  The 
Hopetoun oat and the Chevalier barley were at one time like to 
have superseded all others, but little of either is now used. The 
early Essex has supplanted the Hopetoun oat, and the Dunlop 
barley has taken the place of the Chevalier, which is found to unite 
earliness with a very fine quality of seed, and suits a light soil and 
a late season. The general kinds of seed are the potato oat ; the 
Chester and the common English barley. The potatoes planted 
are chiefly the Perthshire " reds," a few of the Glasgow " buffs," 
and of the Aberdeen "blue-coats," and the variouskinds of "yams." 
Till 1838, we had nothing like a failure in our potato crop. In 
that year there appeared a few blanks in several fields. The 
causes assigned were extremely various, but in no one case satis- 
factory. The turnips are, the " red and white globe," the " green- 
top yellow," and a few " Swedish." Tares are getting common. 
There is very little lint now sown, except what is intended for fa- 
mily purposes. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is eleven and fifteen years. 
It would, doubtless, be advantageous both to proprietor and tenant 

 At the annual competition for grain and potatoes which took place at Pitlochry 
on the 14th of this month, the premiums were adjudged to the following samples : — 

Barley 1 quality weighed 56 pounds per bushel ; 2 ditto 56£ ditto ; 4 do. 55f 

do. ; 4 do. 554 do. ; 5 do. 55 do. 

Oats. — 1 quality weighed 45£ pounds per bushel ; 2 ditto 434 ditto ; 3 do. 45} do. 

Bear. 1 quality weighed 54£ pounds per bushel ; 2 ditto 53£ ditto.

to have the leases extended, were it not for the friendly understand- 
ing that subsists betwixt them, and which enables the latter to look 
forward with confidence to a renewal of his lease. It is not uncom- 
mon for several successive generations of the same family to occupy 
the same farm. Within the last two or three years most of the farms 
in the parish were re-let, and such is the activity with which the 
occupants commenced improving them, that, if the spirit at pre- 
sent manifested does not relax, a few years more will bring under 
cultivation every inch of waste land worth the reclaiming. 

Fisheries.— Salmon are caught in the Tummel and Garry, but 
not nearly in such abundance as at former periods. The rent is 
about L. 20. 

Rare Produce. — The following is the average gross amount of 
raw produce raised in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascer- 
tained :

It will be observed that the third only of the horses are stated 
as pastured in the parish. A few are summered in parks in the 
neighbouring parishes, and the rest may be said to be fed on hay, 
straw, the refuse of distilleries, clover, and vetches. It may be 
remarked also that the above averages may strike many as too low, 
and that is certainly the case in regard to the How of Moulin, 
where an acre of barley will bring L. 10 and L. 12, and horses L. 20 
and L. 25 and upwards. 

Manufactures. — Previous to the passing of the Distillery Act 

PERTH. T t 



658 



PERTHSHIRE. 



1. Geo. IV. chap. 74, there were but two licensed distilleries in 
this parish. From that period to the passing of the Act 4. Geo. 
IV. chap. 4. illicit distillation was carried on to a great extent. 
The lowering of the duty on spirits, together with several other 
salutary regulations embodied in the last act, encouraged a few 
of the more enterprising farmers to enter into partnership, and erect 
one or two legal distilleries on a small scale. A few others follow- 
ed their example, and in this way legal distilleries gained a foot- 
ing in the district. Illicit distillation began immediately to disap- 
pear, and it is believed there is now nothing of the kind carried on 
within the bounds of the parish. 

There are seven distilleries in that part of the Pitlochry excise 
district situate in this parish, working with little intermission through- 
out the year. There are two stills in each, for converting worts 
and wash into spirits, which are fit for immediate consumption, 
without any further rectification. The contents of the stills vary 
from 130 to 460 gallons each, with other utensils of proportional 
magnitude. . Till very recently, the various operations of pump- 
ing, removing worts, spirits, &amp;c. from one vessel to another, were 
performed by manual labour, and the malt mills were propelled 
by horses ; but now these operations are generally performed by 
machinery propelled by water, — a power for which the natural 
declivities of this country are peculiarly adapted. 

The whole of the spirits are extracted from malted barley, and are 
much esteemed for their strength and flavour. They are dispos- 
ed of in Dundee, Perth, and Edinburgh. The greater part, how- 
ever, is sent to Dundee ; some of them are exported to England — 
arrangements having been made recently by one of the distilleries 
for supplying regularly some of the London dealers. 

The quantity of spirits manufactured yearly may average 90,000 
gallons. To produce this quantity requires about 9000 bolls of 
barley. This parish yields about 2900 bolls. Deducting 3 bolls 
for the consumption of each family, there remains for the purposes 
of distillation about 1700, so that there is imported from the 
neighbouring parishes and from the low country about 6300 bolls 
of barley. The quantity of malt manufactured yearly in the pa- 
rish is about 24,000 bushels. A considerable portion, therefore, 
of the 6000 bolls of barley imported is brought into the parish in 
the state of malt. Calculating the spirits distilled at 7s. 6d. per 
imperial gallon, the whole whisky annually exported will amount to 

 Pitlochry is the seat of tlie periodica excise collections for the district. 



MOULIN.

L. 35,750. But the yearly amount of excise duty charged in re- 
spect of spirits and malt may be estimated at about L. 20,000. 
Deducting the price of the raw material at the rate of L. 1 per 
boll barley, there remains in the hand of the manufacturer a small 
sum, indeed, to indemnify him for his time, servants' wages, tear 
and wear of his utensils, and the losses to which he is necessarily 
exposed. 

One of the great advantages which the farmer derives from his 
connexion with these distilleries arises, as already stated, from the 
means which they afford for enriching his farm. And when it is 
considered that many of the partners are persons who were previ- 
ously engaged in the " duty free trade," certainly the most demo- 
ralizing scourge that ever visited the Highlands, it may be some 
consolation to our " temperance friends" to know, that the tempe- 
rate, industrious, and honest legal trader has been engrafted on 
the once intemperate, improvident, and lawless smuggler  

Public Associations. — The Atholl and Weem Agricultural Club 
meets once every year, either at Weem or Pitlochry. The liberal 
encouragement given in the way of premiums to the successful 
competitors has been the means of directing the attention of the 
tenantry to the improvement of their farms and stock of cattle. 
The beneficial influence which this Association has had on the 
farmer and on his farm has been very considerable. A spirit of 
laudable emulation is- excited, the farmer's own knowledge is en- 
creased, his farm is in consequence greatly improved, and his at- 
tention also is thereby directed to the proper breeds of cattle. 

Till within a few years, good ploughing was little thought of. 
The ploughing matches that have taken place of late, under the 
auspices of some of the country gentlemen, have been of great benefit 
in teaching the young men, and impressing the farmers in this re- 
spect with a just estimate of inferior and superior workmanship. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, 8fc. — Dunkeld is the nearest market-town, dis- 
tant nearly thirteen miles. The villages are Moulin and Pitlochry. 
The number of families in the former is 48, and the population 
] 85. The number of families in the latter is 67, and the popula- 
tion 321. Pitlochry is a remarkably thriving village. Its locality 
is favourable, as situated on the great north road. It supplies not 
only the immediate district with all kinds of mercantile goods, but 
its means of communication' enable it to extend its trade in va- 
rious directions, and to great distances. Till within a few years

ago, Dunkeld and Perth were the places with which this district of 
country used to transact its business; but of late, young men of in- 
telligence, enterprise, and capital, established themselves in Pitlo- 
chry, who have immediate connexion with the principal commer- 
cial cities in the south. The country, therefore, is now equally 
well served, and as moderately, with every article of merchandise, 
as in either of the above towns. One of the mercantile establish- 
ments is well lighted with gas, a novel spectacle in these quarters  
In 1834, a laboratory was opened in Pitlochry. In 1836, a branch 
of the Central Bank of Scotland, and also in the same year a branch 
of the Commercial Bank, were establishedthere. 

It had been often the subject of complaint that such a village 
should have been so long without a suitable inn. The want is now 
remedied. Mr Butter of Faskally has built a good commodious 
house, where the tourist will find himself comfortablv accom- 
modated ; and should he be a real admirer of nature's beauties, 
few districts there are, if there be indeed any in Great Britain, to 
equal it in the rich variety of its scenery. By adhering, however, 
to the high road, as the ordinary traveller can scarce avoid, he will 
lose the better part of what he might obtain, if, as the poet says, 
" he wooed nature in her coy retreats." — " He, then, who can com- 
mand, or borrow, or steal an hour from time, will be unpardonable 
if he does not linger at Pitlochry ; and he who can rob the day of 
two or three, will be still more so, if he does not diverge to visit the 
unexpected and strangely placed village of Moulin, a village than 
which it would be difficult to point out another more picturesque ; 
an irregular mixture of houses, and mills, and bridges, and falling 
waters, and noble trees ; a careless profusion of the elements of 
rustic landscape, to which is added a rich and singular surround- 
ing country, offering all the characters of ancient wealth and cul- 
tivation, backed, on the one hand, by the beautiful declivity of 
Beinvrackie, and extending its views over the magnificent ex- 
panded vale of the Tay." 

Post-Office. — The post-office is in Pitlochry, and yields to the 
revenue about L. 400 a-year. The Royal Mail commenced run- 
ning between Perth and Inverness on the 6th July 1836. It pas- 
ses through Pitlochry on its way north, about half-past one p. m., 
and on its way south about eleven o'clock a. m. It runs every 
dav. Rannoch, to which there is a runner three times a week, is a 
sub-office to Pitlochry. In the summer and autumn months, two

tage coaches run every lawful day between Perth and Blair Atholl. 
Durincr these months, our roads present a scene of the most live- 
ly description. Travellers from all parts of Britain, as well as 
from foreign countries, visit a place so rich in inspiring associa- 
tions, and so justly celebrated, for the beauty and sublimity ot its 
scenery. We are highly delighted to see them, but deeply regret 
that they could not find it convenient to avoid Sabbath-day tra- 
velling, which prevails to a great extent, and which is most offen- 
sive, and may prove injurious, to the religious feelings and religi- 
ous habits of our people. 

Turnpike.— The old military road was converted into a turnpike. 
There is a toll-bar about the middle of the pass of Killiecrankie. 
The present rent is L. 213. The length of the turnpike road m 
the parish is seven miles. 

Parish Roads.— Of late a very laudable spirit has been manifest- 
ed on the part of our road trustees. The improvements contem- 
plated, and now in a great measure completed, will add essential- 
ly to the comfort of travelling. The statute labour roads between 
Pitlochry and Kirkmichael and on boths sides of the Tummel, 
reflect great credit on the road trustees, and especially on those 
of them who have sacrificed much valuable property to accommo- 
date the public. These roads diverge in different directions from 
Pitlochry, and though not much frequented by strangers, are, in 
many respects, little inferior to the turnpike. They are necessari- 
ly in several parts steep ; but one can have no idea of the magni- 
ficent scenery of alpine character which, in every direction, is pre- 
sented to the eye. " Hills over hills, and alps on alps arise," to 
fill the mind with the loftiest conceptions, and to " raise it from 
viewing nature up to nature's God." 

Bridges.— In 1832, a substantial bridge of two large spans was 
built, by subscription, across the Tummel, nearly a mile west from 
Piltochry. An error, which is not likely soon to be remedied, 
was committed in the unfortunate locality in which this bridge was 
erected. Had it been built at Portnacraig, a spot which seems 
formed by nature for that purpose, it would have been found much 
more convenient. As it is, our present spirited road trustees might 
find it no unprofitable investment of capital, to open a turnpike 
between this district and Strathtay, beginning at the White-fall 
bridge, and ascending the " Monadh-meadhonach" — in a zig-zag 
direction, descending the south side of the hill by a westerly incli- 
nation, and leading to Weem, Aberfeldy, and Taymouth. As the

beauties and advantages of this line came to be appreciated, the 
outlay, which at first must be considerable, would be found to re- 
pay with interest. Travellers would prefer taking that route from 
Dunkeld to Kenmore, or vice versa, rather than the present. They 
would lose nothing, and be gainers to an agreeable amount. 

In 1833, another substantial bridge was built, by subscription, 
across the Garry, at the junction of the Girnaig with that river. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Lord Glenlyon is patron of the parish. 
The church is situated in the village of Moulin, and convenient 
for the greater part of the population. It is nine -miles from the 
north-east, and six from the north-west extremity. There are 
155 families more than two; 130 more than four, and 65 more 
than nine, miles from it by the nearest practicable route. It was 
built in 1830-1 ; the style of its architecture is the Gothic; the 
altitude of the tower is inconsiderable ; the windows are, however, 
of a small size, and, owing to the abutments between them, the 
light is greatly obstructed, and the church in consequence, un- 
comfortably dark. It is seated for 650 ; the sittings were allocated 
to the different heritors according to their valued rent, who divid- 
ed them among their respective tenantry free of rent. 

The manse was built in 1820. The glebe, including the gar- 
den and the ground occupied by the manse and offices, is about 
four acres and a half, worth L. 12. There is no grass glebe, but 
the minister receives in lieu thereof, L. 1, 13s. 4d. The stipend 
is the minimum. There are 73 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks, 1 lippy 
of victual, half meal, half barley, and L. 29, 7s. 6d. in money, and 
the deficiency made up by Government. 

Chapel of Ease. — In the neighbouring parish of Blair- Atholl, 
a chapel of ease, in connexion with the Church of Scotland, 
was opened in September 1836, to which a section of this pa- 
rish, containing a population of 269, was annexed. The whole 
population attached to the quoad spiritualia parish of Tenan- 
dry, from the three parishes of Dull, Blair, and Moulin, is about 
700. This church, though located in the parish of Blair, was 
erected chiefly to accommodate the people of Glenfincastle, who 
are fifteen miles from Dull, their parish church. It was built and 
endowed by Mr and Mrs Hay of Seggieden, and Miss Stewart of 
St Fort. The endowment is L. 85. The allowance for com- 
munion elements, L. 8, 6s. 8d., is from the Sunday collections. The 
appointment of the minister rests with the Founders and Endowers 
during their lifetime, and thereafter devolves on the Society for

Propagating Christian Knowledge. The present incumbent is the 
Rev. William Grant. 

At Strathloch, in the Strathardle district of the parish, the mi- 
nister officiates five or six times a- year. There is no church  The 
preaching is in the open air. The inhabitants of that territorial 
division of the parish are inconveniently situated in regard to the 
means of religious instruction and pastoral superintendence. Ac- 
cess to the church for 83 families, or 412 inhabitants, is impeded 
by a hill of from three to four miles in length. The nearest resi- 
dence is five miles from the parish church, and the eastern ex- 
tremity of the Strathardle district is about two miles from the 
church of Kirkmichael. 

The Church is generally well attended, and, notwithstanding the 
section of the parish, containing 269 souls, attached to the recent 
erection of the Tenandry, there are still great complaints of the want 
of comfortable family accommodation. The sacrament of our 
Lord's Supper is generally dispensed on the third Sabbath of June. 
The average number of communicants is 600, and of these, 200 
are entitled to exercise the " veto" in the settlement of a minister, 
according to the roll adjusted in November 1838. 

There are only seven Dissenting families in the parish ; three of 
these are Episcopalians, connected with the excise, who have late- 
ly come to reside within the bounds ; of the other four families, three 
are of the Baptist, and one of the Independent persuasion. There are 
also a few single persons. The whole number of Dissenters, reckon- 
ing the children of Dissenting families as such, is 58 ; of these, 22 
are Episcopalians. Their places of worship are in the adjoining 
parishes. It may here be remarked, that the children of some of 
the members of the Dissenting body are connecting themselves 
with the Established Church. Within a few years, the writer of 
this Account baptized two adults, one of whom was a married man, 
whose parents were Baptists. There seems to be no disposition 
on the part of the people to secede from the Established Church. 
On the contrary, they are deeply and ardently attached to the 
church of their fathers. 

Ministers of Moulin. — William Balneaves was minister of 
Moulin in 1643; died in March 1705. James Stewart was trans- 
lated from the parish of Scone, 1st October 1707. Adam Fer- 

 A subscription, amounting to L. 130, has been lately raised in the parish for 
the purpose of building a church at Strathloch, and it is hoped, that, ere long, with

effect so desirable an object.

Religious Societies. — There is no- regular organized religious as- 
sociation in the parish, but a subscription for religious and chari- 
table purposes, conducted by the ministers and members of ses- 
sion, has been made for the last two years, amounting in, 1837, to 
L.49, 17s. lid., and in 1838 to L. 52, 17s. 3d. 

Education.— There are 7 schools in the parish, one parochial, 
one connected with the General Assembly's Scheme ; and the rest 
on the teachers' own adventure. The branches of instruction ge- 
nerally taught are, Gaelic, English, English grammar, arithmetic, 
mathematics, book-keeping, geography and Latin. The parish 
schoolmaster has the legal accommodations except the garden, 
for which he receives the allowance which the act assigns. The 
salary is the maximum, L. 34, 4s. 4£d. 

In January 1839, the number of scholars in all the schools 
throughout the parish was 388, boys 234, girls 154. There were 
learning to read, 1 12 ; joined writing to their reading, 276, and of 
these again there were at arithmetic, 77 ; at English grammar, 31 ; 
at mathematics, 10; and at Latin, 6. 

In Pitlochry there is a sewing schoolmistress, who receives L. 5 
from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. 

Sabbath Schools. — There are six Sabbath evening schools in the 
parish, attended in January 1839 by upwards of 300 scholars. 

The people are in general fully alive to the benefits of educa- 
tion. Many of them are at such distances from school as to make 
it inconvenient for their children to attend regularly. The Strath- 
ardle district of the parish, I grieve to say, is very destitute of the 
means of education. There is truly no lack of teachers, but, from 
the encouragement given, they are necessarily of an inferior descrip- 
tion. An active, zealous, and intelligent teacher, such as might be 
expected from the General Assembly's Education Committee, 
would be an unspeakable blessing to the children of that remote 
portion of the parish. 

It is gratifying to observe the lively interest that is being taken of late in the 
educational prosperity of that section of the parish, and it is hoped that, ere long we 
shall see the Strathardle division enjoying the privileges of our more favoured localities

Libraries.— An attempt was made some years ago, to establish 
a circulating library in Moulin, but did not succeed. 

Friendly Societies.— There are none in the parish, but many of 
the parishioners are connected with the Atholl Wrights Brotherly 
Society, instituted at Logierait, 1st January 1812, and conformed .in 
1835 to the Friendly Society Acts of 10 Geo. IV. ch. 56, and 4 and 
5 Will. IV. ch. 40. During the twenty-three years of its existence 
prior to 1835, it is stated in the preamble of the rules and regu- 
lations of the society, that it had been of incalculable benefit to 
many individuals and families who had the misfortune to require 
its seasonable and effectual aid. In proof of the magnitude of the 
society's operations, and the extent of its utility, it is mentioned 
that it has already expended the sum of L. 2221, 0s. 9£d. in re- 
lieving the sick and distressed belonging to it, and that in 1835, 
its net stock was L. 1073, 12s. 4£d. The largest allowance to 
which a sick member is entitled is 4s. per week. If he continue 
unwell and unable to work, the sum is gradually reduced, and 
should he remain in that state for the period of a whole year, he is then 
put on a superannuation allowance of Is. 6d. a-week. The advan- 
tages of this society are great and obvious. Many, who, had they 
neglected to join it when in the possession of good health, would, 
on being overtaken by sickness or distress, be compelled to apply 
for parish aid. This last resource, so painfully degrading to an 
independent mind, is, however, happily avoided by being a mem- 
ber of this brotherly society. 

Savings Bank.— A branch of the National Security Savings 
Bank of Edinburgh was established in Pitlochry in December 
1836. Its business is conducted gratuitously by Mr Alexander 
M'Naughton, agent of the Commercial Bank. The following is 
a statement of the. first and second year of its operation ; 1st year, 
invested, L. 76, 3s.; withdrawn, L. 31, 15s. ; 2d year, invested, 
L. 117, 2s.; withdrawn, L. 50, 10s. The classes by which the 
investments are generally made are workmen and servants. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor at present 
on the roll is 39 ; of these 21 are ordinary, and 18 occasional poor. 
The sum generally allotted to each regular pauper, is L. 2, 8s. a- 
year. The allowance, however, depends entirely on the nature 
of each individual's case. The session clerk and precentor's, the 
synod and presbytery clerk's, and the church officer's dues, amount 
to L. 5, 19s. a-year. Our funds consist of L. 400, which yield 4

in the collections of 1837, there is included L. 6, 12s. 9±d., 
and in 1838, L. 4, 0s. 3d. received as our proportion of the collec- 
tions made in the church of Tenandry. 

It is still considered as degrading to receive aid from the poor's 
funds, but necessity has of late weakened that noble spirit of inde- 
pendence, with which our people used to view any connexion with 
the poor's revenues. Spinning, the occupation by which females 
were wont to live, has of late years completely failed, and there 
being no other suitable employment for them in the country, they 
are obliged in consequence to apply for parochial relief. 

Mendicity.— Really some measure should be adopted to sup- 
press the system of mendicity, which has lately prevailed to such 
an annoying extent in the district. To use a homely phrase, we 
are perfectly ate up with beggars. To supply from 8 to 12 a day 
is no uncommon call on our benevolence. This, surely, is a posi« 
tiye evil,— but an evil which, though we deprecate the system, is 
still encouraged, from a principle of false humanity. Nor is this 
the only ground of complaint ; mendicity often brings other evils 
in its train. Issuing from the unhealthy and thickly-peopled lanes 
and closses of our large manufacturing towns in the south, these 
mendicants, ill -fed and ill-clad,— being themselves the easy victims 
of infection,— carry all manner of contagion with them, either in 
their person or in their clothes. The consequence has too often 
been, that they leave, as a legacy behind them, the most loathsome 
diseases. Scarlet fever, hooping-cough, and small-pox are generally 
traced to them. Have we not, then, good reason to complain when 
our charity is thus frequently rewarded If, however, the statute, 
making every parish support its own poor, were in full force, then 
the sums expended in charity would be more profitably applied, 
the interests of morality and religion would be better secured, and 
the poor themselves would be far more adequately relieved. 

• It appears from our kirk session records, that the annual collections in this na 
nsh, including fines, &amp;c. were a century ago as follows : in 1736, L. 5, 6s 4d • in 177 
L 6, 16s. 8d. ; in 1733, L. 5, 16s. 8d. In 1735, a collection was'made for ttZSiSSl 
the ministry young men who knew the Gaelic language, which amounted tn T I 

£lV diStreS r d eongXgSonsin SuSlting 

to L. 9, 8s. 6d. Scots money. Comparing the amount of these collections with that of 
those recently made, the advancement which, in the last century, this Parish ha f 
made in industry and prosperity, clearly appears. V P b has

Prisms -There is no prison in the parish ; but it is said that the 
« New Prison Bill" provides Pitlochry with one,-for what pur- 
pose I am at a loss to conceive, if it be not to accommodate the 
law-violators of the neighbouring parishes, or to receive the swarms 
of idle vagrants and sturdy beggars that prowl among us from the 
south at different seasons of the year. For any other purpose, a 
prison in this parish will be a tenantless erection, and the office of 

a jailor a sinecure.  
Fairs.- At Moulin, there is a fair held on the first Tuesday of 
March, for the sale of horses and the purchase of seed-corn. At 
Pitlochry, there is a fair held for cattle and horses the Saturday 
before the Amulrie market, which is held first Tuesday of May ; 
and likewise in the same place, on the third Wednesday of Octo- 
ber, O. S., there is another for cattle and horses. 

Inns.— There are seven ale-houses in the parish, and, as for- 
merly stated, seven licensed distilleries. The influence of these 
on the morals of the people is far from being of so demoralizing a 
nature as one might be apt to imagine. That there are a few in- 
dividuals who are notorious tipplers will not detract from the ge- 
neral character of the people, which, in regard to high-toned mo- 
rality, may challenge comparison with any peasantry in Scotland. 

] ue l. A great quantity of wood is burned by the distillers and 

others. The consumption of coal is considerable, but the princi- 
pal fuel is peat, found in the neighbouring hills, and procured at 
a great expense. If it was dreaded fifty years ago, how much 
greater reason is there now, to apprehend a scarcity in this neces- 
sary article. In consequence of the immense quantity used by the 
numerous distilleries in the neighbourhood, it is feared that, unless 
a more judicious and economical system be adopted of cutting the 
mosses than is at present in operation, the peat will, ere long, be 
so exhausted as to add very considerably to the present outlay. 
Should the once-projected railroad betwixt Perth and Dunkeld 
go on, it will tend much to remove all grounds of fear, and to di- 
minish the expense to which, in the article of fuel, we are at pre- 
sent necessarily subjected. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
At the time of writing the former Statistical Report, the real 
rent of the parish was estimated at L. 3000 ; noiv,, it is upwards of 
L. 7000. Then, land in the neighbourhood of the villages paid 
from L. 1, 10s. to L. 1, 14s. ; noiv, the same land pays at the rate 
of L. 3 per acre. Then, some of the farms, were intermixed toge-

ther in the way called runrig ; now, there is no such thing : the 
land-owners have laid out their estates in farms of convenient size, 
which are subdivided by the farmer into four or five divisions, ac- 
cording to his rotation. Then, the ploughs were small and clumsy, 
drawn by four horses yoked abreast, and driven by a man who held 
the horses by the halters, and walked backwards ; wow;, the iron 
plough is universally used, and two horses instead of four. Then, 
turnips and clover with rye-grass were cultivated by a few gentle- 
men only; now, they form a part of the regular rotation, even of 
every one acre croft. TJien, there were no thrashing machines in 
the parish ; now, there are five thrashing mills, and two of them 
built within the last two years. Then, beef was 3d. per lb., but 
very seldom sold in the parish ; veal, 2d. ; mutton, 2d. ; and pork, 
4d. ; now, beef is 6d. ; veal, 6d. ; mutton, 6d. ; and pork, 5d. per 
lb., and of these, especially beef and mutton, a great quantity is 
consumed. Then, a man-servant's wages, employed in husbandry, 
were from L. 6, 15s. to L. 7, and a maid-servant's from L.2, 15s. 
to L. 3 a year; now, a man-servant receives from L.12 to L.16, 
and a maid-servant from L.5 to L.7 with victuals. Then, the 
yarn exported during the year brought a return in cash of about 
L. 2680 ; now, the return in cash will net amount to as many shil- 
lings. Then, a woman who was a good spinner and employed in 
nothing else would earn 3s. a week ; now, a spinner has enough to 
do to earn the fourth part of that sum  Then, there were 24 li- 
censed retailers of ale, beer, and other excisable liquors ; now, there 
are only 7  Then, there were two distilleries of 30 gallons each ; 
now, there are seven, varying from 130 to 460 gallons each. Then, 
there was no post-office ; now, the Royal Mail runs daily through 
the parish. Then, there were no bakers, no butchers, no bankers ; 
now, there are all 3, — no bad indication of the favourable change 
in the circumstances of the people. And a glance at the following 
tables will readily show the more striking variations, in the parti- 
culars of which they consist, betwixt the present state of the pa- 
rish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count : —

The preceding comparison will enable the reader to see the 
progress which this Highland parish made in the course of nearly 
the last half century. What farther improvements other fifty 
years may bring about, it is difficult to say. As matters now are, 
everything bears the marks of intelligence, industry, and prospe- 
rity. The aspect of the parish is greatly altered. Forests of trees 
have risen up. Gentlemen's grounds have been ornamentally laid 
out, to harmonize with their elegant mansions. The farmer's neat 
slated cottage now meets the eye in every direction. Instead of thorns 
and briars, and mosses and quagmires, we have everywhere beau- 
tiful fields of rich arable land. Our roads are also in the same 
proportion improved, and the " old military road" converted into 
turnpike. Trade of every description is keeping pace with the 
other improvements. The connexion which so many of the re- 
spectable farmers have with the numerous distilleries scattered over 
the district, gives to our roads the lively appearance of a city vici-

mty, rather than that of a quiet country parish. For the male 
part of the population, there is, therefore, no want of employment, 
but the female portion, it must be admitted, is not so fortunate. 
To ameliorate their condition is an object well worthy the con- 
sideration of the philanthropist. At the time of writing the 
former Account, females could not only largely contribute to 
the support of their respective establishments, but it is an ascer- 
tained fact, that in many instances, the whole rent, amounting to a 
considerable sum, was the earnings of the wife and her handmaidens. 
How altered, in this respect, the state of things  Spinning, except 
for family purposes, may be reckoned among the things that were. 
The very fact that, of the 39 paupers supported by the kirk-session, 
32 are old women, is sufficient to shew that the weaker sex, do what 
they will, if depending upon their own efforts for subsistence, must 
anticipate old age with feelings of the most painful solicitude  

" This is a sight for pity to peruse, 
Till she resemble faintly what she views, 
Till sympalhy contract a kindred pain, 
Pierc'd with the woes  these females feel in vain."

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER WILSON, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— It appears from our session records that formerly the 
name of this parish was variously spelt, Keapoch, or Kapoch,— - 
more commonly Capoch ; but for the last half century invariably 
Caputh. The origin or meaning of the term is entirely lost in ob- 
scurity. Keapoch in Gaelic signifies " a decayed wood," as I am 
told ; but how it applies to this parish I cannot discover. 

Situation.— It is situated in that district of Perthshire which is 
called the Stormont, and comprehends the greater part of the plain 
of the Stormont, which is just a continuation of the extensive vale 
of Strathmore, towards the foot of the Grampians. 



CAPUTH. 



671 



Boundaries.— Its figure is very irregular, save on the south, 
which is nearly a straight line for 10 miles, marked by the course 
of the Tay, from Dunkeld to the mouth of the Isla; which river 
forms the boundary for a considerable space on the east, viz. from 
where it receives the Lunan. This latter stream again separates 
it on the north-east from Blairgowrie. On the north it is bound- 
ed by Lethendy and Clunie; on the west, by Dunkeld and Dow- 
ally. Tt contains about 16,000 square acres, or 25 square miles. It 
is about 13 miles in length from west to east, and varying from 2 
to 7 miles in breadth. 

In the Lives of the Bishops of Dunkeld, a MS. written by Alex- 
ander Mylne, Canon of Dunkeld, it is related that Bishop Brown, 
in the year 1500, divided the parish of Little Dunkeld into the 
old parish of Little Dunkeld and the parish of Caputh ; and " at 
Caputh he built on his own charges, a quire, with painted ceiling 
and glazed windows. He gave for the support of the vicar, a vi- 
carage, which had been formerly united to his own see, four acres 
of fflebe-land, and the rising ground, called the Mute-hill, to build 

O 7 CO 

a church upon." 

From the same author, it appears that the parish of Dowally was 
originally a part of Caputh. " Upon information says Mylne, 
that the Irish was spoken in the Highland parts of the parish of 
Caputh, the Bishop Brown built and endowed a church in ho- 
nour of the blessed Mother, St Anne, among the woods of the 
church lands of Dowally."y 

 Alexander Mylne lived in the times of George Brown, Bishop of Dunkeld, from 
1484 to 1514, and of his successor, the celebrated Gavin Douglas, to whom his work 
is dedicated. The original MS. in Latin, was presented by the late Duke of Atholl to 
the Antiquarian Society of Perth, and printed in a/volume of their Transactions. A 
MS. translation of it is in possession of a gentleman in Dunkeld, who kindly favour- 
ed me with a perusal of it- 

+ There has been, for a considerable time past, a good deal of discussion as to the 
precise boundary between Caputh and Dunkeld. The small burn of Ketlochy, which 
rises in Craigie- Barns, and which runs through the eastern part of Dunkeld into the 
Tay, a little above the bridge, was the ancient boundary. But this boundary is no 
longer visible, the water being conveyed by a conduit beneath the houses on the west 
side of Atholl Street, so that all of the town on the east side is in Caputh parish. The 
cause of this singularity will appear from the following extract taken from the Statis- 
tical Account of Dunkeld and Dowally, written by Principal Baird in 1798 : " The 
boundaries of Dunkeld, viewed as a parish, are not extensive, but they are not hitherto 
distinctly ascertained. As it was the seat of the .Bishop, and the service of the cathe- 
dral was performed either by his chaplain, or by some of the clergy who had fixed 
benefices in other quarters of the diocese, it was not necessary at that time to consti- 
tute it formally a parish, or to mark its limits. 1 n fact, it does not appear that this 
was ever done. It is not entered as a parish in the cess-books of the county, and 
none of the old title-deeds of the proprietors describe the property as lying within the 
parish, but within the city of Dunkeld. What is now, therefore, the parish, includes 
only what was formerly within the boundaries of the city. These, in the course of the 
present eighteenth century, have been considerably altered ; for during the commo- 
tions of 1689 the greatest part of the houses were burnt by an irritated and licentious 



672 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Besides what is contained within the extensive boundaries al- 
ready described, there are several detached portions scattered 
throughout the counties of Perth and Forfar, viz. Balholmie, lying 
within the parish of Cargill; West and Middle Gormack, in Kin- 
loch ; East and West Logie, Cairns, Chapelton, Meadows and 
Crofty, in Clunie ; and Craigtown of Dalrulzian, in Kirkmichael, 
all in Perthshire. Also, South Bandirran, in Collace ; Balbeuch- 
ly, through which the Newtyle Railway passes, in Auchterhouse ; 
Broughtay Castle and fishings, and a small piece of ground at 
Mylnefield, near Dundee ; and Fofarty in Kinnettles ; all in For- 
farshire. In Fofarty there is a field of about four acres, called, 
from time immemorial, " the minister of Caputh's glebe," and 
which was believed to belong to him, though unoccupied by any 
person. On being claimed, however, a number of years ago, by 
the late incumbent, the Rev. W. Innerarity, he was opposed by the 
Trustees of the Earl of Strathmore, and the Court of Session de- 
cerned in their favour. 

Surface and Climate. — Its surface is very diversified. To the 
south-east, stretching towards Strathmore, it is almost a perfect 
level, and presents a rich and beautifully cultivated champaign. 
To the north and west it partakes of much of the grandeur of 
Highland scenery, without its wildness, being an agreeable succes- 
sion of hill and dale, and pleasant little valleys opening their 
bosoms to the sun, enlivened by lakes or rippling streams. The 
temperature accordingly varies with the situation, being more keen 
in the higher parts, but the climate is everywhere genial and salu- 
brious. There are no prevalent distempers, and longevity is very 
common. At present there are several persons on the verge of 
ninety years, and two or three advanced beyond that period. 

Hydrography. — There is no stream of any consequence flowing 
directly through this parish. But the Tay, which forms its southern 
boundary for ten miles, from the bridge of Dunkeld to its junction 
with the Isla, is a splendid river, from 150 to 200 yards in width, and 

soldiery, and such of them as had stood to the west and north-west of the cathedral 
were not rebuilt. The ground which they, and the gardens which had lain inter- 
mixed with them, occupied, is supposed to have extended to about five acres, and this 
space now forms a part of the Duke of Atholl's lawn and policy. But as the boun- 
daries of the town receded on one quarter, they stretched out in another. Several 
new houses were built on the slope of the eminence which rises to the eastward of 
the town. These are uniformly described in the title-deeds as lying in the parish of 
Caputh. That parish, indeed, completely surrounds Dunkeld, except where it is 
skirted on the south by the Tay, and in former times had reached, it thus appears 
close to the site of the buildings. Stipend is paid to the minister of Caputh from a 
piece of ground lying but a few yards from the cathedral." — Vol. xx. pp. 412 413.

nothing can be more lovely or picturesque than the scenery upon 
either side. On the north there is a chain of lochs, formed and 
connected by the burn of Lunan, which rises in the Grampians, 
and first passing through Loch Ordie, a most romantic and much 
visited sheet of water at the base of Duchray, a lofty conical moun- 
tain in the parish of Dowally, soon after enters the parish of Ca- 
puth, and rapidly descending a deep wooded glen of two or three 
miles in length, in which are situated Birken Burn, Hatton, and 
Calley, at the latter of which are an ornamental loch and garden 
belonging to the Duke of Atholl, it reaches the loch of Craig- 
lush, immediately adjoining which is the beautiful loch of Lows, 
about two miles north-east of Dunkeld ; a little to the eastward is 
Butterstone Loch, all of which are in this parish. Leaving the last 
mentioned, the Lunan runs eastward to the loch of Clunie, in that 
parish, famed for its ancient castle, situated upon an island, once 
occupied by the Admirable Crichton, now possessed by the Earl 
of Airly. Emerging thence it pursues its course to the loch of 
Drumellie, both stream and loch forming for a considerable dis- 
tance the northern limit of this parish. From Drumellie it con- 
tinues its former direction, separating the parishes of Lethendy and 
Blairgowrie, till it reaches Littleour, where it forms the boundary 
between Caputh and Blairgowrie, till it falls into the Isla, about 
three miles west from Coupar Angus, and seven miles east from 
Caputh church. 

Soil. — The surface being so extensive and diversified, the soil 
must also greatly vary according to the locality. In the higher 
parts it is cold and wet, though yielding excellent crops. In the 
lower grounds it is light and dry, and along the bank of the Tay 
and Isla it is a rich loam. Much of the soil is alluvial ; these ri- 
vers often overflowing their banks, though now more carefully con- 
fined within their proper channels by strong embankments. 

Mineralogy.— There is a great abundance of clay-slate and lime- 
stone. At Newtyle, a little to the east of Dunkeld, the clay- 
slate is extensively quarried, the slates are in great request 

200,000 being often disposed of in a month. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is no historical record of this parish, but in Milne's His- 
tory of the Bishops of Dunkeld, already noticed, Caputh is fre- 
quently mentioned as being one of the mensal parishes belonging 
to the cathedral. 

Proprietors.— There are 30 heritors and portioners. Thir-

teen of these stand in the cess-book at upwards of L. 100 Scots 
valued rent. The principal heritors are, Sir John Muir Macken- 
zie, Bart, of Delvine; Lady Keith, or Countess Flahault of 
Meikleour ; the Duke of Atholl ; Keay of Snaigow ; Menzies of 
Culdares; Sir William Drummond Stewart, Bart, of Murthly ; 
' Kinloch of Gourdie ; Haggart of Glendelvine ; and Murray of 
Kincairney. The whole ancient valued rent of the parish is 
L. 9369 Scots, being the highest in the county save Errol. The 
valued rent of Delvine is L. 3144 Scots, being one-third of the 
whole. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of baptisms and marriages, 
and records of session, commence with'the year 1671, and are 
continued without intermission till the present date, though some 
of the books are greatly worn and decayed. The insertion of 
births appears to have been omitted till a recent period. A re- 
gister of deaths has been twice attempted, but left off after a few 
years' trial, owing, no doubt, to the want of fees to the clerk, and 
there being no proper authority to enforce the registration, as in 
the case of baptisms and marriages. 

The ministers of this parish in succession were, Robert Gordon, 
admitted 12th March 1682; James Crockat, 16th December 
1688; James Hogg, 2lst September 1721; James Bisset, 30th 
August 1753; William Innerarity, 11th December 1783; Alex- 
ander Wilson, the present incumbent, was ordained assistant and 
successor, 4th August 1835, and succeeded Mr Innerarity, 17th 
March 1837. 

Antiquities. — With regard to the antiquities of this parish, there 
are but few objects of that nature deserving notice, and of these 
little can be said with certainty. Of cairns, Druidical stones, 
Pictish forts, and Roman encampments, not a few traces are to 
be found, but their history is almost entirely lost, and the vulgar 
conjectures regarding them are too vague for being recorded. 
The only truly classical ground is that of Inchtuthil, which is 
allowed, by the best antiquarians who have examined it, to have 
been the station in medio mentioned by Tacitus in his Life of 
Agricola, and to which the Roman general led his troops after the 
celebrated battle with Galgacus. Inchtuthil, signifying " the 
island in the flooded stream," lies about two and a- half miles east 
of the church, on the north bank of the Tay. It is a singular 
piece of flat oblong table-land, with a steep declivity on all sides. 
On the north extremity of this table- land, stands Delvine House ; 



CAPUTH. 



675 



on the south extremity, overlooking the Tay, are the distinct re- 
mains of what is supposed originally to have been a Pictish fort, 
and latterly a Roman encampment. It is evident that it must 
have been a place of great strength, giving the command of the 
whole district to the person who held it. It is particularly de- 
scribed by Mr Pennant in his Tour. 

The following information respecting Inchtuthil is from the 
Statistical Account by Mr Innerarity in 1792: " It is a flat of 
1 60 Scotch acres, regularly steep on every side, and in every part 
of equal height, that is, about 60 feet above the great plain of the 
Stormont, on which it stands. Here the Picts had a town, which 
must have been a place of great strength, and of which the ves- 
tiges may be discerned at the south-west corner of this singular 
elevation. Boetius calls it Tuline or Tulina, and says that it was 
populous and well fortified, but deserted and burned by the Picts, 
on the approach of the Romans under Agricola. He adds, as 
translated by Holinshed, " the Scottishmen in our time call the 
place Inchtuthil." The Romans also availed themselves of this 
situation. Their camp stood on the north-east border, and com- 
manded an extensive view of the plain. It is 500 yards square ; 
the walls to a considerable height were strongly built, 9 feet 
thick, with stones brought from a quarry two miles distant ; the 
stones have been gradually removed, and the walls are now almost 
levelled by the plough. In the course of ploughing, fragments 
of weapons, and some entire utensils, were formerly found. There 
are two tumuli or barroivs, and a redoubt, on the south-east side 
of the camp. A few years ago, the largest of these barrows was 
opened, and consisted of a rich black mould, possibly composed 
of the ashes of the funeral pyres that had been consumed there. 
It is now distinguished by a clump of trees. Inchtuthil is likewise 
believed to have been part of the land granted by Kenneth III. 
who began his reign in 977, to Hay, for his bravery in the 
battle of Luncarty ; and his descendants possessed it till the be- 
ginning of the seventeenth century. William, Fifth Earl of Er- 
rol, who succeeded in 1506, was in his father's lifetime designed 
William of Caputh, and Master of Errol." 

Cairnmure, or the Big Cairn, is about a mile and a-half north- 
east of the church, and is the largest in the county, being 456 feet 
in circumference, and 14 feet in height. It formerly gave name 
to the property in that district, but its origin and use are quite 
unknown. At some distance to the south-west, stands another, 



676 



PERTHSHIRE. 



357 feet in circumference, and 14 feet high. In a line with these 
two, and at the same distance, there is a third of a smaller size. 
Near the burying ground there are the remains of a cairn, where 
probably a cross had once been erected in Popish times, as the 
place is still called Crosscairn. Near the top of the craig of Sten- 
ton, a remarkable detached conical hill, about a mile west from 
the church, is a place called Kemp's Hold, or the Soldier's Fast- 
ness, bearing evident marks of having been a fortified spot. About 
two miles north of the church, in a very elevated situation, between 
the farms of East and West Cuilt, there is a small Druidical circle. 
Beside it are two larger stones, deeply sunk in the ground ; the 
top of the lowest is artificially formed into an inclined plane, facing 
the south, and contains a number of small cavities, which may 
have been used by the Druids in the performance of religious rites. 

Mansion- Houses. — The principal residences of proprietors are, 
Delvine House, the seat of Sir John Muir Mackenzie, Bart., a 
plain, but commodious building, and placed in a most beautiful 
and sheltered situation, on the extremity of the remarkable table- 
land before-mentioned. Meikleour House, the seat of Lady 
Keith, on the north bank of the Tay, a little above its junction 
with the Isla, and opposite Kinclaven Church. Snaigow House, 
the seat of the late James Keay, Esq. Advocate, recently erected, 
upon the model of the English baronial style of building, about 
two miles north of the church. A little to the north of Snaigow 
is Kincairney House, the seat of Mungo Murray, Esq. Glen- 
delvine House, the seat of James Valentine Haggart, Esq. S.S.C. 
is at present erecting 1839, on a similar style with Snaigow, 
about a mile north-east of the church. Stenton House, belonging 
to Captain Beaumont, opposite to Murthly Castle, on the Dun- 
keld road, one mile west of the church. Hillhead, belonging to 
Dr Henry Fisher, an elegant building, on the summit of the brae, 
on the east of Dunkeld, romantically overlooking the town, the 
river, the bridge, and ducal palace, and commanding a panoramic 
view of the adjacent scenery. 

Manufactures. — Happily for the peace and purity of our quiet 
rural population, no spinning mills have yet been erected ; neither 
is any great public work going on at present in this parish. 

III. — Population. 
The population does not appear to have varied much during the 
last half century, and for the last twenty years has been nearly 
stationary. This is owing to the absence of all feus, and the se-

vcral villages being the properties of the respective land-owners, 
which they have built chiefly for the accommodation of their own 
labourers and tradesmen.

There are several villages in the parish, containing from 10 to 
60 families. The largest is Spittalfield, upwards of a mile east- 
ward of the church, in which is the parish school. It is entirely 
the property of Sir John M. Mackenzie, and contains nearly 300 
inhabitants. The next in size is Caputh, including all the houses 
adjacent to the church, occupied by 250 persons. The next is 
Meikleour, the property of Lady Keith, five miles east of the 
church, containing nearly 200.

The principal, and almost sole permanently resident heritor, is 
Sir John M. Mackenzie of Delvine ; of the others, a few reside only 
during the summer months ; and the rest are scarcely ever seen 
on their properties, or care to be kept in remembrance by any 
good deed done in the parish. 

Language. — The Stormont dialect, of course, prevails, in which 
the chief peculiarity that strikes a stranger is the pronunciation 
of the Scotch oo as ee, poor being pronounced peer, moon meen, 
aboon abeen, &amp;c. The Gaelic is not spoken by any of the natives ; 
but not a few Highland servants have of late been engaged by 
farmers and others who understand the English or Scotch very 
imperfectly, and who thereby occasion some annoyance to the mi- 
nister in his parochial rounds of visitation and examination. 

Habits. — The people are quiet and industrious, remarkable for 
their kind and benevolent disposition towards one another, and re- 
taining much of the old rural simplicity and frankness in their 
manners. In general they are sober, temperate, and exemplary 
in their habits; and were it not for the very culpable conduct of 
those in authority licensing so many public houses, intemperance 
would be unknown among them. But so long as a license is granted 
to every man who takes it into his head to sell whisky, and rob 
thoughtless tradesmen and labourers of their hard-won earnings, 
dissipation and immorality must spread and prevail among the lower 
classes, and the country become the haunts of vice as much as the

towns. A road extends straight through the heart of this parish, 
of eleven miles in length, from Dunkeld to the Bridge of Isla. On 
that line of road there are seven and were lately eight public- 
houses  Can all these be necessary  or is it possible for servants 
driving their master's horses along this road to resist these seven 
temptations, if they have a sixpence in their pockets  

IV. — Industry. 

There is now very little undivided common in the parish. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of the arable land ranges from about 
L. 1 to L. 3 per imperial acre. The average rent of land in the 
parish is probably about L. 1, 15s. The best soil, and conse- 
quently the highest rented, lies along the north bank of the Tay. 

Husbandry. — In no part of the surrounding country has the 
style of husbandry more rapidly advanced. All the recent im- 
provements have been eagerly adopted, and are generally practised. 
Ground bones have been largely applied ever since they were first 
introduced as a manure into Scotland ; it is of the greatest advan- 
tage, on account of the distance from the weightier manures, as it 
enables the farmer to pursue a more extensive system of green 
cropping, and consequently of keeping and feeding more sheep 
and cattle on the farm. This, as well as common manure, has 
been applied at Delvine as a top-dressing to the pasture grass with 
the most beneficial effect ; bone dust, at the rate of 20 bushels 
per acre, and common manure at the rate of 15 tons per ditto. 

Mr James Liston, Hallhole, in this parish, some years ago, in- 
vented a very efficient and economical apparatus for dibbling bone 
manure, which he attached both to double and single turnip 
sowing machines. A great many of these have now been made, 
and old machines altered agreeable to Liston's plan, and found to 
answer well. These divide the bone manure most equally, at any 
rate from 7 to 20 bushels or even upwards per acre, and in small 
quantities at any given number of inches apart. See Quarterly 
Journal of Agriculture. 

Draining. — Smith's of Deanston Works method of frequent 
draining and deep ploughing is yet but partially known in the dis- 
trict ; but will unquestionably in a few years be generally and pro- 
fitably applied, especially in the higher parts of the parish, where 
the subsoil is close and retentive, and the harvests generally late. 
From the results already experienced of this system in those places 
where it has been adopted, it seems the best calculated to effect a

Tina.

great improvement, not only in the labouring of the soil, but also 
in the quantity and quality of the crops ; and it is presumed that 
proprietors can in no way more effectively and permanently pro- 
mote at once their own, and the interest of the tenant, than by 
giving liberal encouragement to carry it into full operation. 

Embanking.— After sudden thaws or heavy rains the Tay fre- 
quently rises to a great height, and is therefore liable to inundate 
the low grounds along its sides. At Del vine it rose in 1831 fifteen 
feet above the lowest mark there in 1826. The late Sir Alexander 
Muir Mackenzie, and Lady Keith, raised embankments to a great 
extent, and on the most scientific principles ; these, with self-acting 
flood valves on the drains, &amp;c. now completely protect these estates 
from all ordinary inundations of the river. 

Live-Stock.— The cattle are of a mixed breed. The larger and 
finer breeds of Teeswater short-horned and Ayrshire being intro- 
duced among the original stock, which were principally of the 
Angus-shire dodded cattle, have much improved it. They grow to 
a good size, are early fattened, and are generally sold in Blair- 
gowrie, for supplying the London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh mar- 
kets. 

Horses. — The local agricultural associations have done much 
for the improvement of the breed of horses for agricultural pur- 
poses, by awarding high premiums for the best Clydesdale horses 
to travel the district. 

Sheep. — Many of the farmers are getting into the way of keep- 
ing a few Leicester sheep, which, from the high price of wool, and 
the beneft these are to the land, are rather a profitable stock. 
Others of them purchase what is termed a flying stock in the 
autumn. These are in general three year old wethers, which they 
feed off on their turnip, and sell them the following spring; but 
what is more general, the farmers let their turnip with fodder, to 
graziers and others, to be eaten down by sheep. The sheep 
husbandry is much approved of, and found very profitable on dry 
soil. 

Swine. — There is a great variety of breeds of swine. However, 
the large mill swine are most sought after from the great size they 
grow to, but the American and the original Highland breed are 
of much better quality. 

Wages. — The wages of a common farm-servant vary from 
L. 12 to L. 14, with board and lodging ; and those of women ser- 
vants from L. 5 to L. 7 for the year ; labourers from 8s. to 10s.

per week ; women employed in field-work, from 8d. to lOd. per 
day ; carpenters and masons from 12s. to 18s. per week. 

Leases and Farm Buildings. — The leases on farms of mode- 
rate size are generally for nineteen years. The farm buildings 
have been much improved of late, and are now good and commo- 
dious. 

Quarries. — At Newtyle, on the Dunkeld or Atholl estate, and 
about two miles to the eastward of Dunkeld, a slate quarry has 
been extensively wrought for many years. The colour is a beau- 
tiful dark blue, and the quality durable. There is abundance of 
good limestone in many parts of the parish. On the Gourdie 
estate limestone has been most extensively burnt, to the great ad- 
vantage of the adjoining country. The quality is good, and lime 
might be sold at a moderate price, but for the expense of the coal, 
which hitherto has been carted from Perth, a distance of seventeen 
miles; however, coal may now be procured at Cupar Angus, which 
will shorten the carriage about one-half. The construction of the 
kilns is such that the manager of the works, some years ago, ob- 
tained a premium from the Highland Society. 

Fisheries. — There are several fishing stations on the Tay and 
also on the Isla. However, I am sorry to say, that the farm-ser- 
vants in the parish may now safely omit a clause in their engage- 
ments, in former days regularly inserted, namely, that they were 
not to be offered fish oftener than three times a-week. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — There is no market- town in the parish. The 
nearest are, Dunkeld, five miles west from the church j Blairgowrie, 
seven miles north-east ; Coupar- Angus, ten miles east; and Perth, 
the county town, twelve miles south. 

Means of Communication, Sfc. — Dunkeld is the post-town, and 
a daily runner between that and Del vine House accommodates all 
within the intermediate distance. 

The only turnpike road in the parish is that between the boat 
of Caputh and Dunkeld, a distance of five miles, which is beauti- 
fully Macadamized, and is allowed to be the finest approach to 
the splendid scenery of Dunkeld. There is an excellent statute- 
labour road from the church to the bridge of Isla, six miles in 
length, another branching off northward to Clunie, and a third, 
branching off the latter, by Snaigow and Loch of the Lows, to 
Dunkeld, all kept in constant and thorough repair, so that every part 
of this extensive parish is easy of access. There is no coach or public

conveyance, that runs through any part of this parish,-which 
is a source of inconvenience to travellers. About four years ago a 
a U wis projected between Perth and Dunkeld, wb.h wouU 
have assedby Stanley .ills, and then have -ssed he Ta y 
and run westward through a great part of Caputh. But upon a 
survey being made, the estimated expense was found far to exceed 
any profits ever likely to be realized by it, and the scheme has 
therefore been dropt. Had it succeeded it would have been of 
very great advantage, not only to this part of the Stormont, but 
to a great part of the Highlands, by saving carnage and cheapen- 

rtte S Boats, c.-The Tay, bounding the parish entirely 
upon the south, and the Isla on the east, must have presented a 
areat obstacle to traffic in former times, when there were no bridges, 
and but very indifferent boats. Now that obstacle is greatly reme- 
died, if not entirely removed. Since the last Account was written 
two splendid bridges have been built, and two boats of a novel and 
ingenious construction have been erected, at the most suitable 
places on these rivers. The elegant and spacious bridge of Dun- 
keld, erected by the late Duke of Atholl in 1809, supplies the 
place of a dangerous ferrv, which long existed a little to the east 
of it, called Eastferry. Nearly about the time that this commo- 
dious outlet was formed, at the west end of the parish, another was 
opened at the eastern extremity, by a bridge thrown over the Isla, 
a little above its junction with the Tay, and which connects the 
Perth and Blairgowrie roads. Again, at Caputh Ferry, opposite 
the church, in the centre between these two extremes, in place of 
the common chain-boat which formerly plied there, in 1834, a 
boat was erected, under the superintendence of the late Sir Alex- 
ander Muir Mackenzie of Delvine, consisting of a large platform 
placed upon two long narrow-pointed boats lying parallel to each 
other and at several feet distant, which, by a simple machinery, are 
made to present their sides to the action of the stream, and are 
thus propelled to either side of the river, and the greater the 
strength of the current, the more rapid the conveyance across. A 
chain is also stretched across the river, and which, passing over a 
fly-wheel fixed to the side of the platform, keeps the boat in a 
straight course. It is capable of taking in four loaded carts at one 
time, without unyoking the horses, and the passage is performed 
in five minutes. By this ferry access is obtained to Perth by 
Stanley, the former being distant from the boat eleven miles and 



682

three-quarters, and the latter, four miles and a-half. Another 
boat after the same model has been very recently placed on the 
ferry at Meikleour, five miles below Caputh boat, by which the 
Blairgowrie and Staniey roads are joined. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stands on a commanding emi- 
nence about 400 yards due north of the boat. Though placed near 
the south border of the parish, and above eight miles from the 
northern extremity, it could not have been situated more conve- 
niently, being in the heart of the population, and nearly equidis- 
tant from the west and eastern extremities. It was built in 1708, 
and is a plain and commodious structure, seated for 800, but easilv 
containing 1000. It has at this present date Oct. 1839 under- 
gone considerable repairs and improvements, both internally and 
externally, and has received a new porch at each end, by which it 
is rendered more comfortable. The old church stood on the ris- 
ing ground, called the Mute-hill, about 600 yards west of the pre- 
sent, and where the burying-ground still is, around which a most 
substantial new wall is just now building and nearly completed. 
The ground on which the present church is built was given by the 
late Sir Alexander M. Mackenzie, on condition that no interment 
should take place within the new enclosure. There are no seats 
let, save two or three pews, belonging to a property attached, 
quoad sacra, to another parish, let on behoof of the poor at a very 
low rate. The heritors subdivide their respective portions among 
their tenants. But while the farmers have accommodation for 
their families, many of the villagers have no family seats, and are 
obliged to press into any empty space they can find. 

Manse. — The manse was built in 1803, and last year was re- 
paired and considerably enlarged, and is now a commodious and 
comfortable habitation. It is situated in a most choice and shel- 
tered spot, having the little wooded brae, on the top of which the old 
church stood, immediately at its back, concealing it from the Dun • 
keid road, and the glebe in front stretching down to the river, 
which is about 200 yards south of it, and the splendid new castle 
of Murthly, rising among the gigantic trees on the further bank, 
and the classic Birnam hill, towering in majestic grandeur in the 
distance. The offices were built in 1818, and are in excellent 
order. The glebe consists of 10 Scotch acres of superior 
arable land contiguous to the Tay, of the yearly value of L. 27. 

 The inventor and fabricator of this boat was Mr James Fraser of Dowally, who 
had shortly before constructed a similar one to ply upon the Tummel at Loier'ait.

In 1807, an excambion was made of 16 acres of hill common be- 
longing to the minister for 8} acres, lying before the manse, and 
now annexed to the east side of the glebe. The stipend was last 
modified in 1824 to 255 bolls, 1 firlot, 3} lippies, two-thirds meal, 
and one-third barley, with L. 12, 3s. lOd. in money, including 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There is no chapel of ease, nor Dissenting meeting-house of any 
description within the parish. The whole population belongs to 
the Established Church, save nearly 30 Seceders, and 5 or 6 
Independents, and as many Episcopalians ; the latter, and some 
of the former, usually attending the parish church. 

The Lord's Supper is dispensed twice a-year, in June and Oc- 
tober, the number of communicants at the former occasion averag- 
ing 800, and at the latter, 600. There are upwards of 1 000 com - 

municants altogether. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The church-door collections for 
the last seven years have averaged L. 80 per annum, exclusive of 
several very liberal collections for extra purposes, and dues arising 
from hearse, mortcloth, &amp;c. Happily as yet no assessment for 
the poor has been needed ; though the increasing list of paupers 
may render this unpleasant mode of raising funds for their support 
ere long indispensable. There are at present 29 regular paupers 
receiving from 4s. to L. 1 per month, besides some who receive 
occasional aid. 

The only mortification in behoof of the poor was that of Mrs 
Steel at Ruffel, who, in the year 1536, bequeathed the sum of 
L. 200 to the kirk-session, the interest of which only is allowed to 
be used. The capital is at present in the Edinburgh National Se- 
curity Savings Bank, and, with the consent of the session, the in- 
terest is chiefly applied to the education of poor children. 

Education. — There are 5 schools. The parochial school in 
Spittalfield is well situated, and well attended. The salary is the 
maximum. The house and garden are good. The school-fees 
are, 2s. 6d. for reading; 3s. for reading and writing; 3s. 6d. for 
arithmetic, &amp;c. ; and 5s. for the higher branches of education. 
The total amount of fees received by him per annum is about 
L. 18. There is a school in Meikleour, with a house and salary 
of L. 5, 5s. from Lady Keith. The three others are in Caputh 
village, Snaigow, and Butterston, and one on the teacher's own 
adventure. The means of education are well supplied, and there 
are few, if any, who cannot read, and most can write. Beside the 



684 



PERTHSHIRE. 



day schools there are 5 Sabbath schools at the above places re- 
spectively, attended by upwards of 300 scholars, and which un- 
doubtedly are instrumental in promoting the religious knowledge 
and morals of the young. 

Libraries. — There is also a Sabbath school library on the iti- 
nerating principle, having a press with books at each school, which 
are given out to the scholars only on the Sabbath, when the class 
is dismissing. Once a year the presses are arranged, and moved 
forward to the next station or school ; and thus one library is sub- 
divided into five, and a constant interest kept up bv the annual 
change of books. There are at present about 600 volumes alto- 
gether, and the number is from time to time increased, by means 
of occasional collections and donations. There are also small vil- 
lage libraries for more general reading in Caputh, Spittalfield and 
Meikleour respectively ; but they are now nearly superseded by 
the Sabbath school library. 

Savings Banks. — A Savings Bank was established in 1815, but 
the number of depositors is not great. The young men seem more 
disposed to become members of friendly societies, of which there are 
several; and a good many persons are members of two or three of 
these at once, and thus, in case of sickness or infirmity, are able to 
draw from several sources a tolerable support. These societies 
are well conducted, and are of incalculable advantage to the work- 
ing classes. 

Fair. — The only fairs held in the parish are at Meikleour in 
the months of June, August, and October, for cattle. 

Public Houses. — There are 9 public-houses in the parish, and 3 
in the immediate vicinity of it  — the one-half of which are a nui- 
sance. There are also two distilleries, one at Stralochie, and the 
other at Haughend. 

Fuel. — Coals, carted from Perth, are almost the only fuel that 
can be procured. Sales of oakwood and thinnings of plantations 
frequently take place, which are eagerly looked after by the work- 
ing classes, as coals are very expensive. There are no peats to be 
found, save at a moss beyond Reimore, a distance of nine miles 
from the church, and therefore of no service to the parish in ge- 
neral. The scarcity of fuel is, perhaps, the greatest hardship to 
which the poor in this quarter are subjected. The session endea- 
vours so far to remedy this evil by annually distributing a certain 
quantity of coals among the more needy, and which are generous- 
ly carted by the farmers gratis.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF WEEM, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. SAMUEL CAMERON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The parish is never spoken of by the Gaelic inhabit- 
ants but by the name of Laggan. In old authors, we find " Logie 
iu Athole" mentioned. It would appear, therefore, that Rait is a 
modern affix to Laggan or Logie, — the name by which the parish 
or district was originally known, and which means a holloiv. Per- 
haps Rait was added to distinguish it from the parish of Laggan 
in Badenoch, which was anciently within the same regality, under 
the " Lords of Badenoch and Athole," who were princes of the 
Royal family of Scotland. Rait is supposed to be the same word 
with reite, which means arbitration or settlement of differences. 
Logierait is, therefore, the hollow of arbitration, — very descriptive 
of its situation and character as the seat of a court of regality. 
It must, however, be observed, that, according to the usual un- 
certainty of Gaelic etymology, Rait is a syllable to which several 
different meanings may be given. 

Extent, Boundaries, Appearance, 8fc. — The figure and locality 
of the parish are both very irregular, on account of its occasional 
dispersion, by detached and sometimes distant parts, into other pa- 
rishes. On the north side of the river Tummel it has for its east- 
ern, northern, and western boundaries the parishes of Dunkeld, 
Kirkmichael, and Moulin, — the first and last of which, however, 
insert themselves into it respectively, in considerable portions, at 
some distance from the boundaries. Its southern boundary is 
the Tay until it crosses that river near Aberfeldy, and introduces 
itself in a detached fragment between the parishes of Dull and 
Fortingall. The portion of it which lies between the Tay and the 
Tummel has for its eastern boundary these two rivers at their 
junction, and is bounded on the west by Moulin, Dull, and Weem. 
This part of the parish receives two different insertions from the 

 Drawn up by the Rev. Thomas Buchanan, now Minister of Methven. 



686 



PERTHSHIRE. 



parish of Dull, forming the estates of two proprietors. The pa- 
nsh then takes a bound of twenty miles and upwards over the pa- 
rishes of Weem, Dull, and Fortingall, and is found, in two sepa- 
rate portions, in the district of Rannoch. Its extent must be esti- 
mated rather from the particulars of its statistics than from any 
statement of its length or breadth in miles, since there are so many 
interruptions to its contiguity. The greatest length may be stated 
at probably 12 miles, and the mean breadth at 5. 

This parish, and, in particular, the larger division of it, which 
lies between the Tay and the Tummel, is very remarkable for 
beauty. Washed by these, among the most romantic of the 
Scoto-Celtic streams; formed by them into two straths, which a 
sloping ridge of hill divides and commands, Strathtay on the one 
side, Slisbeg, or the narrow country, on the other; — cultivated as 
if by the gardener ; or varying its beauty by wood and pasture, and 
living water; with many a fair residence ranged along both slopes 
of the hill as along a gallery,— it would be difficult, in any country, 
to point out a scene of more perfect amenity. It is relieved from 
the character of tameness by the frowning features of rocks and 
mountains which overlook it from the neighbouring parishes. 

Climate. — The air is here pure and dry, — qualities which it pro- 
bably owes to the light sandy character of the soil, the infrequency 
of marshes, the comparative distance of very high mountains, and 
the remoteness of the situation from either ocean. Fevers and 
small-pox are rare, except when imported by vagrants, when they 
are sometimes very difficult to expel from the poorer hamlets and 
cottages. The aged suffer from rheumatism, and the young are 
somewhat liable to consumptive disorders. There is reason to 
believe in the extensive prevalence of scrofula; dropsy is also 
common, and what are called nervous disorders. 

Hydrography. — We have no lakes, unless one or two small 
pieces of water on the summit of mountainous ridges deserve the 
name. The only rivers are the Tay and the Tummel. The 
falls of Moness are formed by the stream which divides Logie- 
rait from Dull, near Aberfeldy. 

Soil — The soil is of a light and pervious nature, consisting of 
gravel, with a mixture of alluvial soil from the higher grounds. 
This description applies to the haughs or low lands. On the slope 
the soil is deeper, and of a thick substantial loamy quality. But, 

 The most distant part of the parish, indeed, skirts Loch Rannoch for about three 
miles. 



LOGIERAIT. 



€87 



in the district north of the Tummel, as you ascend the slope, the 
soil is apt to be cold and spouty, as they call it, or abounding in 
springs, with a subsoil of retentive clay. 

Mineralogy. — Useful quarries, for common purposes, are occa- 
sionally opened on almost every estate ; but, except some strata of 
limestone, which cross the parish in one or two places, there are, 
as I am given to understand, no mineralogical phenomena of which 
it is worth while to give a detail. 

Botany. — The plants are such as are common to the other lo- 
calities, of which the haughs stretch along the banks of the Tay 
and Tummel. The mountain district of the parish on the north 
of Tummel is, in its character, identical with the other elevated 
parts of Athole, full lists of whose natural productions, in the de- 
partment of Botany, occur in the articles of Blair- Athole and 
Moulin, already contributed to this work. The trees, to the 
growth of which the soil and climate are most propitious, are, the 
larch, with the different varieties of fir cultivated in Scotland, the 
oak, the ash, the elm, the beech, the poplar, and the plane. In 
some situations, the alder seems, at one time, to have grown very 
plentifully. In pleasure grounds and gardens, trees and plants of 
considerable delicacy are found in a thriving state. There are 
many specimens of the Acacia. Walnuts frequently ripen ; and 
a vine, on the southern wall of one of the residences in Strathtay, 
has been known to yield ripe fruit. There is a remarkable ash- 
tree in the innkeeper's garden, near the village of Logierait. It 
measures at the ground 53 feet in circumference, at three feet 
from the ground 40 feet, and at eleven feet from the ground 22 
feet. The height is 60 feet ; but the upper part of the stem ap- 
pears to have been carried away. The height is said to have 
been, at one time, nearly 90 feet. The trunk is hollow from the 
base, and can contain a large party. This venerable stem is sur- 
mounted by a profusion of foliage, which, even in the advanced 
age of the tree, attracts the eye at a distance to its uncommon 
proportions. An old man of the age of one hundred is at pre- 
sent in the habit of taking his seat daily within the hollow formed 
by its three surviving sides,— no unsuitable companion to the ve- 
getable relic  

Zoology — The animals are such as are common to the neigh- 
bourhood. Squirrels are extremely numerous in the woods and 
plantations.

II. — Civil History. 

This parish does not appear to have been the scene of any 
event of historical importance. The people, however, seem to 
have taken much interest, and commonly to have taken a part 
in transactions which have made Athole, as a province, so cele- 
brated in Scottish history. The names of Stewart, Robertson, 
and Murray, are very frequent, and speak to the part which the 
natives must be supposed to have acted in times of commotion, and 
more particularly in the Jacobite wars. There were 600 prisoners 
sent hither from the battle of Gladsmuir by Lord George Mur- 
ray. Stewart of Ballechin, chamberlain to the Marquis of Athole, 
took possession of the Castle of Blair- Athole at the beginning of 
Viscount Dundee's insurrection, and fortified it for King James. 
He rendered completely abortive a mission of the Marquis's eldest 
son to his father's tenants, for the purpose of securing their neu- 
trality, and. refusing the young nobleman admission to his own fa- 
ther's house. In the battle of Killiecrankie, a son or nephew of 
this person, who is said to have been a clergyman, distinguished 
himself by prodigies of strength. He cut down as tradition says 
Brigadier Balfour with an enormous two-handed sword, which he 
used with such vigour and application throughout the day that, it 
is said, his hand could only be extricated from the basket-hilt by 
cutting away the net-work. 

Court of Regality at Logierait. — The jurisdictions of the House 
of Athole were very extensive down to late times. They were ad- 
ministered by a commissary and other officers. Logierait was the 
seat of court. And there are scattered around the neighbourhood 
a variety of memorials of the formidable power exercised under 
their authority, in the names of Bal-na-Maoir, " the town of the 
rogue-takers ;" Tom-na-Croich, " the gallows-hill," &amp;c. There 
are, I am sorry to understand, no records extant of the procedure 
of the Court, although there is a record, in good preservation, of 
the jurisdiction of the same family in their barony of Hunting- 
tower. Justice — such justice as was then current — seems to 
have been dispensed with much energy by the Lords of Athole 
within their Regality Court of Logierait, down to the farthest 
date at which such power could be exercised with any safety, and 
that at least, if there be truth in the following anecdote : — Some- 
where about the year 1745, Lord President Forbes happening to 
be on a visit at Blair Castle, was told by the Duke of an applica- 
tion, strongly backed, for mercy to a poor fellow whom his Com- 



LOGIERAIT. 



€89 



missary at Logierait had sentenced to be hanged. « But you 
know," said the President, « that mercy belongs to the King, and 
cannot be extended by a judge after sentence." To which the 
Duke's answer is said to have been a peremptory express ordered 
within hearing of the Lord President to his commissary, to set 
the criminal immediately at liberty. But by this time we suppose 
the Regality of Athole had sunk into a plain Court of Barony, 
where law was statedly administered by a bailie and commissary 
within memory. I find in the session records some strange in- 
stances of application, on the part of the session, to the commis- 
sary, to grant warrant against and imprison parties under scandal 
for refusing to delate or compear, e. g., 24th February 1717. 
"The minister reported he frequently conversed with Elspet 
Kennedie to no purpose; that she continued stubborn and unruly, 
until that he procured a warrant from his Grace the Duke of 
Athole to incarcerate her in the common jail of Logierait; and 
after she was brought by a party to the place, finding no relief, 
she procured James Stewart, miller in Pitnacre, to bail for her 
submission to the session," &amp;c. 

There was here a court-house of such ample proportions, that 
the pnncipal hall is said to have been the noblest apartment in 
Perthshire in its time. The building, in a ruinous state, is still well 
remembered; and the justiciary hall is said to have been upwards 
of seventy feet in length, with galleries at the- ends. The powers 
possessed by Courts of Regality, which, as the name denotes, was 
royal, and almost unbounded, must have been sufficiently terrible, 
in such hands, for example, as those of the famous Wolf of Badel 
noch, whose legal reign embraced the lordship of Athole and 
Badenoch, and extended from Strathspey to Loch Katrine. 

Antiquities.— In the neighbourhood of the village, there are the 
ruins of an ancient building, said to have been a castle or hunting- 
seat of King Robert III. The royal residence may be traced in 
the names of Bal-na-gard, « the guard's town ;" King's Stables- 
Glaic-an-righ, or « King's hollow," which are names of places in 
the neighbourhood. King's Stables is the name of a spot about 
800 yards to the west of the ruin. In digging into a hollow for 
so.l and decayed vegetable matter near the place, the tenant, some 
years ago, found a causewayed floor, at the depth of several feet 
below the surface, from which he picked up the iron of a small 
pitchfork of antique appearance. The place is again filled up,

coins are in the same person's possession, and bearing apparently 
the date 1070. They were found in the field between the King's 
Stables and the ruins of King Robert's castle. Glaic-an-righ is 
a hollow way, cut through the side of a steep eminence, which 
forms part of the glebe. This is supposed to have been the ac- 
cess to the royal residence, and must have been a work of im- 
mense labour. 

There are, near Middlehaugh, the lines of an encampment, 
such as are so frequently met with in Perthshire; and there is, 
near Aberfeldy, in the parish, an eminence called the Torr or battle- 
hill, surrounded with similar lines. We have many stones, either 
single or ranged in circles, and 'burial-grounds of great antiquity ; 
but" I have discovered nothing remarkable except the stone of 
Dunfallandy, which was long the object of much superstitious at- 
tention to the natives. The part of it above ground, for it is 
much sunk, discovers the grotesque figures of several animals. 

On one side there is some ambitious tracery and fretted work. 
The animals are of nondescript appearance and proportions. The 
figures are indeed partly decayed or effaced. The human forms 
bear an awkward resemblance to the knave on a pack of cards. 
On the other side, are two sitting figures, attired, as seems, in 
priestly vestments, with a tall cross between them. Below is an 
armed figure on horseback— most probably some military saint or 
knight-errant. 

Such stones are frequently met with, as at Abernethy, St Ma- 
does, Dunkeld, &amp;c. and are very improperly regarded as Runic 
monuments. They are in fact rude samples of the Popish rage 
for sculpture, being always found in connection with the ruins of 

chapels. „ _ , 

There is, at Dunfallandy, another stone still more celebrated, 
though presenting nothing to the eye but a rude block, marking 
the bloody eminence from which the locality derives its name— the 
scene of a dreadful scene of murder and usurpation. 

A medal, supposed of Trajan, was found in this neighbourhood, 
and presented to the late Professor Fergusson of Edinburgh. 

Eminent Characters.— Adam Fergusson was the son of the 
Rev. Adam Fergusson, minister of the parish of Logierait. Au- 
thentic particulars of his life, from information partly collected in 
this place of his nativity, will be found in the Supplement to the 
fifth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Of course nothing 
can now be added to the well-known particulars of the life of so 
eminent a public character.

Robert Bissett, LL.D., author of a Life of Edmund Burke, and 
of some other publications, was the son of the Rev. Dr Bissett, 
minister of this parish. 

Dr William Dick, of Tullymet, was, during many years, a phy- 
sician of great eminence in the East India establishment. It ap- 
pears by the following notice of this excellent individual, that he 
on one occasion laid his country under obligations of no ordinary 
nature. In a letter to Mrs M'Lean Clephane, Sir Walter Scott 
writes, in 1819, when his life was in danger, " My health, how- 
ever, seems in a fair way of being perfectly restored." After 
noticing his regimen, « Dr Dick of the East India Company's 
Service has put me on the course of cure, and says he never knew 
it fail, unless when the liver was irreparably injured." Lockhart's 
Life of Sir Walter Scott, Vol. iv. p. 281. Sir Walter considered 
Dr Dick as the preserver of his life ; and has recorded his sense 
of obligation on a valuable silver inkstand, suitably inscribed, now 
in possession of the family.

Ministers of the Parish — Mr James Moray was admitted 1650, 
and filled the charge with much acceptance, per varios sui tempo- 
ms motus, as his epitaph says, till 1695. This respectable clergy- 
man was the second son of Patrick Morav of Ochtertyre; and his 
eldest brother was the first Baronet of that family, created 1673. 
He was succeeded in the parochial charge by his son, Mr Muno-'o 
Moray, who died in 1714; and was succeeded by Mr Adam Fer- 
gusson, ordained minister of Crathie and Braemar in 1702, and 
admitted to Logierait in 1715.

A variety of procedure occurs in the Presbytery records in 
relation to this settlement ; as, a counter-presentation by Lord 
Stormont, claiming to be patron of the parish, in favour of Mr 
Moncrieff, minister of Methven, " a person ignorant of the Irish 
language ;" and a complaint against Mr George " Robertson, for in- 
truding upon the paroch of Logierait, and kirk thereof, praying in 
express terms for the Pretender," &amp;c. This person's proceedings 
seem to have originated in the authority which he conceived him- 
self to have received from the following strange document, of 
which I have the original before me : — 

« By William Marquess of Tullibardine, 

« These are ordering and empowering you to preach every Lord's 
day, and other solemn occasions, in the church of Logiereat, and 
to exercise all the other parts of the ministerial functions within 
that parish, as you'll be answerable at your peril ; ffor doing of 
•which this shall be to you a sufficient warrant. Given at Logy- 
reat the 12th of December 1715 years, 

 Signed Tulltb ardj ne." 

Annexed is the solemn seal of that Noble person. 

Mr Adam Fergusson officiated in the ministry at Logierait till 
1754; when Dr Thomas Bissett was admitted, who died in 1800; 
and was succeeded by Mr Thomas Menzies, who died in 1831 ; 
he was succeeded by Mr Thomas Buchanan, admitted minister 
of Methven in November 1841 ; and he by the present incum- 
bent, inducted Angust 1842. 

Parochial Registers.— The most complete the volume com- 
mencing with Mr Menzies's ministry excepted is a volume con- 
taining minutes from 1639 to 1664. This volume was reco- 
vered and restored to the kirk-session by Principal Lee in 1819. 

The volume had been, it seems, advertised for sale in Mr Con- 
stable's catalogue, several years before the title attracted Principal 
Lee's notice ; and when he inquired at Mr Constable how he might 
be able to trace it, he found that Mr Constable had transferred it 
from his stock in trade to his own private collection, whence he with- 
drew it that he might present it to Principal Lee. Shortly there- 
after, Principal Lee took occasion to replace it in the custody of 
the kirk-session, in whose records the fact is very properly and grate- 
fully acknowledged, " 1 considered it at the time when it came 
into my hands," the Principal observes, " as a curious memorial of 
the state of the country in the time of the Covenanters, and still 
look upon it as an important document, though I have examined 



LOGIERAIT.

many others which enter into much more minute details. The 
parts of the volume which appeared to me most interesting related 
to the schools. I have reason to believe that the state of educa- 
tion in Perthshire was much better from the year 1640 to 1700, 
than it was from 1740 to 1800." The remaining fragments are 
from 1672 to 1682, and thereafter with many breaks and lost leaves 
down to 1714, after which the record is continued with rather 
more regularity down to the beginning of this century, when it be- 
comes in all respects more regular and complete. The tempta- 
tion to abstract the lost volume seems to have been the curious 
elegance of the penmanship in which the entries are generally 
made. 

I T I. — Population. 
The population has, during several years, remained nearly sta- 
tionary. There are very few villages in the parish, and the 
change in the agricultural system pursued by the landlords has 
not been so great as to make any observable difference in the 



number of the rural population. 

The population of the parish in 1831 was . 3138 

Males, . . .1483 

Females, . . 1655 

The number of inhabited houses is, . . 683 

Average number of persons in each family from . 4 to 5 

The number of houses uninhabited or building, . . 32 

Population in 1841, . . 2774 



There are 4 insane, 5 fatuous, 2 deaf and dumb, 2 blind. 

Yearly average of births during the last seven years, about 70 
marriages when both parties are in the parish, 9 
the man only was in the parish, 5 
the woman only in the parish, 4 

There is no register of deaths, and it would be exceedingly fal- 
lacious and unsafe to offer any conjecture on that subject from the 
mere amount of mortcloth dues, on account of the number of pa- 
rishioners, who bury in other parishes, and of extra-parochial per- 
sons, who bury here. It is to be regretted that parents are care- 
less in the extreme of the privileges and duty of registering the 
names of their children. 

The language generally spoken is the Gaelic. It cannot be 
said to be getting into disuse as the language of the fireside among 
the common people; but it is falling into manifest decline as a 
branch of school education.

The larch plantations of the Duke of Athole cover the greater 
part of the ground which is described as under wood. In this 
situation, they are in the highest degree healthy and thriving ; al- 
though I should judge from appearance, that thinning is in some 
cases not sufficiently attended to. In woods of such immense ex- 
tent, this object is perhaps scarcely attainable, and the thinnings 
are in some degree according to the demand for materials for 
fences, &amp;c. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of arable land in the parish varies 
from L.l, 5s. to L.2, 10s. per acre. The haugh lands, on the 
banks of the Tay and Tummel, give the highest rent, although 
by no means formed of the richest soil in the parish, which is 
commonly found on the slope ascending above the haughs. The 
haughs have of course the advantage in point of dryness, easy cul- 
tivation, and early ripening ; and, when enriched by strong dis- 
tillery manure, are usually distinguished in the award of premiums 
for crop. 

Live Stock. — The breeds of horses and cattle are too generally 
of the mixed and rion-descript character, long established in the 
district. Spirited examples of a better and more improved style 
of breeding have been set, however, of late, both by some of the 
proprietors and tenants. Horses for improving the breed have 
been introduced under the auspices of the Weem and Athole Agri- 
cultural Club. Leicester sheep have, in some instances, replaced 
the more ordinary breeds with great success. The Ayrshire 
breed of cattle is preferred on the best farms. An attempt 
has been made this year to improve in feeding qualities the 
Ayrshire breeds, by crossing them with a short-horn bull ; 
but of course nothing can be said decisively as to the result in so 
short a time. 

A cow may be grazed at from L.l, 5s. to L.l, 15s. ; a ewe in 
the parks, at 5s., and on the hill, at 3s. per year. 

The following may be given as a specimen of the prices of la- 
bour. Farm-servant's wages, L.l 4; maid-servant's do., L.6 per 
year; day labourer without victuals, Is. 6d. ; with, Is. 2d. ; fe-

Improvements. — Embanking and draining have been carried on 
to a great extent in certain situations of late. There are on the 
banks of the Tay and Tummel, about 6400 roods of embank- 
ment. Waste land is in course of being reclaimed with great 
activity and skill in almost every district of the parish. In this 
parish some attention has been paid of late to the improvement 
of lands under wood. The ground on which the experiments have 
been made, was formerly planted, for the most part, with Scots 
fir and oak. The results are said to be, in a considerable degree, 
promising, and it is possible, that, as the value of coppice has been 
declining from a variety of causes, there may be inducements 
elsewhere to the adoption of a similar practice where the soil chan- 
ces to be worthy of redemption. 

The method adopted is to contract in the month of August to 
trench such a portion of waste and woodland as may be deter- 
mined on. The trenching is performed to the depth of fourteen 
inches. The operation is finished about December, so as to give 
the benefit of the winter frost, to break the rough clods. Early 
in the ensuing spring, the land is thoroughly drained ; the large 
stones blasted out; the drains are then filled with the small stones, 
and the remainder removed to the boundaries of the field for 
fencing. 

The land is subsequently twice ploughed, and then drilled for 
turnips, which are dibbled in with bone-dust at the rate of sixteen 
bushels per acre. ' In ordinary seasons, the result is a fair crop of 
turnips, which are eaten off the ground by a flock of Leicester 
sheep. The following year, the land is limed with twenty bushels 
of the best lime per acre, and sown with potato oats and the finest 
mixed perennial natural grass-seeds. The after-math is then pas- 
tured with sheep, and the parks, subsequently depastured with that 
stock, for at least three years before it is broken up for tillage. 
By this mode of management, it has been found, in some cases, 
that the capital expended on each field has been redeemed in five 
years or crops. 

Obstacles to Improvement. — The only obstacles to the improve- 
ment of agriculture that I am aware of in this parish are, first, the 
prevalence of small holdings, and, second, the consequent want of 
capital to be expended on improvement by that class of agricultu- 
rists. In many situations, the land islet in little patches, varying 



696 



PERTHSHIRE. 



from one acre to fifteen, to the inhabitants of the neighbouring villa- 
ges or hamlets. The disadvantages of this system are to the land- 
lord over- cropping, expense in buildings and repairs, sometimes to 
the amount of five or six years' rent at the commencement of a 
lease, and the neglect of any improved system of tillage ; and to 
the tenant, a frequent struggle with difficulties in keeping up the 
skeleton of a little farming establishment, in paying for smith and 
wright work, and in combining with the labour of his own land 
extra jobs as a labourer. This and similar depressing concomi- 
tants would seem to point out the advantage of a gradual change 
of system to all parties. 1 am, however, no friend to the expul- 
sion of any part of the community not chargeable with crime, and 
would humbly suggest, that caution, tenderness, and time be used 
and allowed in the treatment of the hamlet population, and in. the 
alteration of their circumstances. The remedy, I should hope, 
may in part be left with themselves, as 1 observe in this class a 
growing anxiety to educate their children, and to send them from 
home for improvement and employment— a practice which in many 
individual cases has resulted in raising their children far above the 
depressing circumstances in which they began life. 

Farm-houses and offices are of a very inferior description, as 
might be expected, unless of very recent erection. But of late 
great attention has been paid to the improvement of this depart- 
ment ; and in two or three instances, resident owners of estates 
have set an example of the most perfect kind of accommodation 
suitable to a large farm, by the erection of home steadings, or of- 
fices on the most improved principles, with saw-mills and other fa- 
cilities for fences and enclosures. The duration of leases is nine, 
thirteen, and fifteen years. 

The five-shift rotation of crops is generally adopted by the te- 
nants of farms, and the four-shift by the cottars. A very few of 
the farmers practise the six-shift rotation. 

Produce. — The crops raised are, wheat, producing 9 bolls per 
Scots acre ; oats, from 5 to 8 do. ; barley, from 5 to 9 do. ; po- 
tatoes, from 40 to 50 do. ; rye, 9 do. Rye is sown in small patches 
by the tenantry for their own use; as is also lint, which, forty year s 
ago, occupied perhaps every fourth arable acre in the parish. Tur- 
nips are extending in breadth every year. The only other crop 
is clover, the average yield of which may be stated at 200 stones 
of 22 pounds per acre. This crop will, in all probability, soon 
cease to form part of this rotation, as its produce is rapidly de-

creasino- every vear. When first introduced, the second cutting- 

to •  

was much more luxuriant than the first at present, and even a 
third cutting was on good land often obtained. 

Distilleries. — There are six distilleries at work in the parish. 
The consumption is about 32,565 bushels of malt yearly, from 
which there are distilled 65,087 gallons of spirits, paying a net 
duty to Government before the late addition of L.8678, 5s. 4d. 
It deserves to be stated, in fairness, that the result of late inqui- 
ries as to the interference of these distilleries with the sanctification 
of the Sabbath, was very creditable to the Christian feeling of the 
several partners ; and that the near neighbourhood of distilleries 
does slightly affect the morals of the parish, but, owing to some 
regulation, less, on the whole, than might have been supposed. 
Edinburgh and Dundee, and occasionally Glasgow, are the markets 
to which the spirits are chiefly sent ; but an increasing quantity is 
now consumed in Perth and Perthshire. The duty on malt is 
not included in the above estimate of the revenue paid to Govern- 
ment. At the time when the inquiries were directed to the dis- 
tilleries, the duty on malt was 2s. 7d. per bushel, and on spirits 
2s. 8d. per gallon. The whole malt is distilled within the parish, 
and the malt duty is to be estimated with the drawback. About 
one- third of the barley consumed is the produce of the parish. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages. — The village of Logierait, near the church, contains 
a population of about ] 50 persons, and the portion of Aberfeldy 
which belongs to this parish may contain nearly 300. The village 
of Logierait is almost ruinous, and the only relic of its former very 
considerable importance is an annual fair on the 22d of August. 
Wester Aberfeldy is improved with a number of excellent new 
houses and shops. 

Means of Communication. — Strathtay has the convenience of 
an excellent turnpike road. At Logierait, the communication with 
this road is by two ferries, one on the Tay, and the other on the 
Tummel. These ferries connect the Strathtay road with the great 
road to Inverness on the north, and with that to Breadalbane 
from Dunkeld on the south. There are good ferry-boats. That 
on the Tummel is of novel construction, adapted by the artist and 
inventor, Mr James Frazer, mill-wright, Dowally, to the charac- 
ter of the river. It is a fly-bridge, consisting of two boats placed 
along-side of each other, at the distance of a few feet, and con- 
necting amid-ships by a platform, moveable on pivots, placed over 



698 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the centre of each boat, and by a connecting moveable rod fas- 
tened to the stern heads. The vessel is slipped across on a chain, 
— there being a suitable apparatus for changing the relative posi- 
tions of the boats and platform. The main improvement on the 
action of the common ferry-boat is, by setting the boats below in 
an oblique position to the stream, when, if the boats are placed so 
as to receive the impulse of the current on the larboard bows, they 
will be moved gently to the starboard across the river, and, by 
shifting their position till the stream impinges on the starboard 
bows, the bridge will return to the point from whence it started, 
and that without any assistance of manual labour. There is a 
swing-boat on another part of the river; but the near vicinity of 
a bridge lately erected has caused it to be, in a great measure, dis- 
used. There is a fourth regular ferry in the parish. There is a 
post daily, with the exception of Tuesday. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church I regard as, under pre- 
sent circumstances, conveniently situated. It is within half a mile 
of the junction of the Tay and the Tummel, and within a few 
hundred yards of the two principal ferries. As about a third of 
the population is located on the farther side of the Tummel ferry, 
and as a considerable number of the parishioners of Little Dunkeld 
are located in a parallel situation to this parish on the south side 
of the Tay ferry, there can be no doubt of the convenience of the 
situation of the church, in so far as they are concerned. On the 
other hand, the length of Strathtay, at nearly the extreme end of 
which the church is placed, renders the situation, in some respects, 
inconvenient to the inhabitants of that district, who, in conse- 
quence, are partly driven to seek such accommodation as they can 
find in the parish church of Weem and the chapel of Grandtully. 
Frequent interruption to regularity of attendance occurs in winter 
from the swollen state of the rivers, by which the ferries are ren- 
dered impracticable. Otherwise, there is a very commendable at- 
tention paid by all classes, and, I may add, by all religious deno- 
minations in the district to sacred ordinances. The church was 
finished in 1806, and is in a good state of repair. It accommo- 
dates 1000 persons. The manse was built in 1804; it has since 
received, extensive additions in the kitchen and servants' depart- 
ment. In 1833, sufficient and substantial offices were built. The 
glebe consists of four acres and a half Scots, exclusive of grass for 
two cows. The stipend amounts to sixteen chalders, half meal and 
half barley, at the highest fiars prices for the county, with L.10

for communion elements. The Parliamentary church of Rannocb 
embraces, quoad sacra, the part of the parish which is situated in 
that remote district. There is no chapel of ease, missionary, or 
catechist. There is an Episcopal chapel, and also a Baptist 
meeting-house. There are in this parish 50 Episcopalians, 30 
Baptists, 10 Independents, and 2 Roman Catholics. There were 
distributed this year the following sums for religious and charita- 
ble objects, and I consider the amount as fairly proportionate to 
the resources of the parish, as well as an average specimen of what 
is done in this department: Perth Infirmary, L.8; India Mis- 
sion, L.5 ; Assembly's Schools, L.5 ; Church Extension, L.4 ; 
Colonial Churches, L.4 ; parish Sabbath schools, L.5 ; circula- 
tion of missionary intelligence, L.2 ; total, L.33. There have 
also been collected among different denominations for the Branch 
Bible Society at Dunkeld sums ranging from L.10 to L.16 per 
annum, during a number of years. The provision and outlay for 
the poor is, on an average, as follows : Collections, L.50, 6s. 4d. ; 
interest of stock of L. 150, L.6 ; church dues, mortcloth, dona- 
tions, &amp;c, L.32, 1 4s. 2£d. ; extraordinary provision for idiot poor, 
L.18. At present none is supported in any asylum. 

There are on the poor's roll commonly about 32 persons, ex- 
clusive of Parliamentary district ; and the number of persons oc- 
casionally relieved is about 12. The monthly allowance varies 
from 2s. 6d. to 4s. A very few cases are relieved to the amount 
of 6s. monthly. 

Education. — There is one parish school, one free or endowed 
school, and there are eight adventure schools ; total number of 
scholars receiving the benefit of a common education, 634. The 
parish school is endowed with the maximum salary, and L.5 yearly 
from the rents of the bishoprick of Dunkeld. 

Stewart's Free School, Strathtay. — David Stewart was a native 
of Strathtay. Removing to Edinburgh in early life, a poor lad, 
he found employment in the family of one of the Barons of Ex- 
chequer, and subsequently became a macer in that court. Be- 
sides leaving funds, which are soon to become available for the 
endowment of an hospital in Edinburgh, he left a sum for the 
purchase of six acres of land, and the erection of a school-house, 
for the encouragement of education in his native district, with the 
interest of L.2500 for the support of a master and assistant, and 
the supply of stationery and prizes. The duties of the trustees 
and masters are ascertained by the contents of a deed containing 



700

a variety of useful instructions. Here nearly 200 scholars annually 
receive, gratis, the benefit of a most excellent education in the 
ordinary branches. A similar endowment, that should put the 
northern wing of the parish on a footing with Strath tay, would, 
in addition to the parochial school, form an ample provision for 
the educational necessities of this wide-spread parochial charge. 
The scholars throughout the parish are in the proportion of 360 
 males to 270 females. Persons that cannot read, above fifteen 
years of age, 50. There are two sewing-schools on a Society sa- 
lary. About 50 girls attend. There are six Sabbath schools, 
which are taught gratis, either by the ordinary teachers, by mem- 
bers of the kirk-session, or other qualified individuals. It is 
deemed advisable to teach them on a uniform and very simple 
system. Each teacher is provided with a small manuscript book, 
prepared by the minister, in which are marked, under several pe- 
riods, a series of Scripture lessons, adapted to give a general and 
consecutive view of the Bible history. The principal dates, with 
numeral references to the chapters or parts of chapters illustrative 
of each period, as also to the prophecies delivered under each, 
are alone entered in the manuscript. A rigorous, patient, and 
minute examination on each portion of Scripture read forms the 
chief exercise, and is entrusted to the teachers under the occa- 
sional and periodical supervision of the minister. The Shorter 
Catechism is gone over, by very minute portions at a time, in 
the same way. Memory-work is in a great measure dispensed 
with, except as connected with intellection and reference ; the 
first end in view being to lead the young to a habit of reading the 
Scriptures with attention and understanding. There are 230 
scholars"in attendance on six Sabbath schools. 

Friendly Societies. — The Strathtay Farmers' Friendly Society 
commenced in January 1826. Since that time, 620 members 
have been entered in their books, including about 50 honorary 
members, who derive no benefit from it. It has paid upwards of 
L.1000 to the objects of its institution, and has about as much 
more at interest. It allows 4s. a-week for the first sixteen weeks 
of a member's illness, 3s. for the next like period, and 2s. so long 
as he may continue on the invalid list. 

The Athole Wrights' Brotherly Society was instituted at Logie- 
rait in 1812. 676 members have since been entered on the books. 
Expended L.2568. Present stock at interest, L.1148. There 
are at present 13 men and 4 widows receiving seasonable support 
from the fund.

Savings' Bank.— At Aberfeldy there is a Savings' bank. It 
was instituted in 1833. There is but a small portion of this pa- 
rish which has the privilege of depositing, by which nearly L.200 
have been deposited and about L.70 withdrawn. 

Inns and Ale-houses.— There are two inns and seven ale-houses ; 
of the latter description certainly by far too many. The FeilU 
ma-choit, Sacred festival of St Machutus  was once a very con- 
siderable market ; and there is a small cattle-market at Pitnacree 
in spring. 

Fuel— Fuel is scarce and expensive. It consists of oak-cut- 
tings, at about 5s. ; peat, at 3s.; coal from Perth, at about L.l, 
5s. a cart, including carriage. 

There are eight meal-mills, two flax, two saw-mills, and one 
for the manufacture of potato-starch. 

General Observations. 
The march of learning, and, in some respects, of real im- 
provement, since the last Statistical Account was published, is 
very noticeable. Then, linen yarn was the staple article of ex- 
port and manufacture, bringing into the parish yearly nearly 
L.3000 Sterling. Now, there is no reason to suppose that a 
single stone of lint is in any shape exported from the parish. 
Then, the philabeg and tartan hose were commonly worn. 
Now, this dress is almost never seen. Many of the young 
women," says the former statist, " had printed cotton gowns 
and duffle cloaks." Now, silks and cloth pelisses are, I sus- 
pect, as common as those luxuries of dress then were. Seve- 
ral of the farmers and handicraftsmen had then clocks in their 
houses, and many of the young men wore watches. Now, the 
rarity would be to find a house without a clock, and a young 
man without a watch. Then, there were 3000 arable acres in 
the parish ; now, the number is 5000. Then, the rents amounted 
to less than L.3000 ; now, these amount to about upwards of 
L.8000, exclusive of land in the hands of proprietors. Then, 
the fields, whether in crop or in pasture, were generally open ; 
now, there is hardly an arable field that is not inclosed. Then, 
the people were praised for their aversion to litigations : now, no 
dispute can be adjusted out of the legal courts. But why pursue 
the parallel  Since the result of such comparisons is ever the 
same, indicating a regular progression in physical and economical 
amelioration, with the drawback of a too certain retrogression 

from the blessings of contentment and simplicity.

PRESBYTERY OF WEEM, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER CAMPBELL, MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— The name of this parish must undoubtedly have been 
derived from the Gaelic word, uamh or uamha, signifying a cave. 
But of the cave, which was the origin of the name, and is said to 
have afforded frequent shelter to the lawless and oppressed, no 
trace whatever is now to be found. 

Extent, &amp;fc.—It would be difficult to give any thing like an ac- 
curate account of the extent of this parish, from the manner in 
which it is disjoined and intersected by others. The following 
remarks on the separate parts may, however, be suitably in- 
troduced. 

Glenlochay. — Several extensive farms of this parish are in this 
glen, which runs north-west of the village of Killin, and is thinly 

hcil tod fo Rn extent ofeilit miles ; and even these farms are 
disjoined and intermixed with other parishes. There is here a 
considerable quantity of good arable land, but the whole district 
is chiefly pastoral. The grazings are excellent ; and some of the 
stocks of sheep reared in it are said to be seldom equalled, and 
scarcely surpassed, in the prices which they bring in the markets of 
the south. The intersecting and bounding parishes are those of 
Kenmore and Killin. 

Achmore. — This district, of which the eastern boundary is 
nearly in a straight line south from the parish church of Killin, 
extends more than two miles eastward, first for a short way on the 
south bank of the river Dochart, and then of Lochtay. It also is 
chiefly pastoral. A considerable part is wooded, and the greater 
part is in the possession of the proprietor. The parishes which 
bound it are the preceding. 

Crannich. — This district extends about two miles on the north 

side of Lochtay, somewhat nearer the west end of it, and is bound- 

3 



WEEM.

ed, east and west, by the parish of Kenmore. It now belongs to 
the Marquis of Breadalbane, but once belonged to the family of 
Menzies ; as it appears, from the history of that family, that in 
the fourteenth century, Sir Robert de Maynoers or Meyners got 
« from David de Strathbolgy, Earl of Athole, and Constable of 
Scotland, the lands of the Thanage of Cranach in Desewer in 
vice de Perth;" and this, with other similar facts, may furnish an 
explanation of the disjoined state and great distance of several 

parts of this parish. 

Glenlyon.—K continuous district of this glen, of some miles in 
extent, under the general name of the Roros, is in the parish of 
Weem, besides some other extensive farms, which are detached, 
and somewhat distant from this larger part. The whole is inter- 
sected and bounded by parts of the parish of Fortingal. 

NeivhalL— Newhall and Sticks, on the south side of the river 
Tay, and between the villages of Kenmore and Aberfeldy, may be 
said to be all included in the grounds of Taymouth Castle. There 
is, however, a considerable population here, consisting wholly of the 
work people employed by the proprietor. These parts are inter- 
sected and bounded by the parishes of Dull and Kenmore. 

Comrie. The ancient barony of Comrie, hitherto consisting of 

several small farms and holdings, and lying on the south side of the 
river Lyon, near the point at which it falls into the Tay, is now 
becoming the chief agricultural farm of the proprietor, the Mar- 
quis of Breadalbane. The ruins of the old family castle stand on 
the banks of the river, in a state of considerable preservation. 
This part is bounded by the parishes of Kenmore and Fortin- 
gal 1. 

Glenquaich. — There is a district of considerable extent and po- 
pulation belonging to the parish of Weem, on both sides of the 
river in this glen, through which the road from Kenmore to Crieff, 
the market-town of all that district, passes. Here are supposed 
to be some of the highest cultivated lands in Perthshire, which 
produce little else than straw in very late seasons, but which are 
not deficient in early harvests, either in quantity or quality of 
grain. This glen is always bleak, and often exceedingly stormy 
in winter, and almost all ingress and egress is sometimes cut off by 
snow ; but at other seasons, it presents to the lover of pure natu-

nil scenery, no unintereresting appearance. Descending, at the 
west end of it, from the heights of the Kenmore road, towards the 
end of summer or begining of autumn, and looking eastward on its 
lake, its green meadows, its fields beginning to take their yellow 
tinge, and its sloping sides in many places clothed in green grass 
to the top, unwooded as it is, he will find much to admire. A re- 
markable feature in the scene is, a ridge of hills at the lower end, 
stretching from north to south, and appearing to be so united to the 
sides, like the base of a triangle, that the eye would seem to look 
in vain for a tract by which the waters could escape, or where 
roads could be found ; and hence must have arisen its name of 
Glenquaich, from the resemblance which it bears to a basin or cup, 
to which Cunch and Quaich are the corresponding terms in Gaelic 
and in Scotch. 

Murthly, on the south bank of the Tay, and near "a mile east 
from Aberfeldy, is bounded, east and west, by the parish of Dull. 

Weem.-— This part, by much the most populous, extends about 
a mile and a half on the north bank of the Tay, and is bounded 
by the parishes of Logierait and Dull. 

The only probable reason which can be assigned for this dis- 
joined and intersected state of the parish of Weem, and of several 
neighbouring parishes, has been already given, and will further ap- 
pear from an account of the Menzies family, to have been the de- 
sire of proprietors to connect their properties with their own parish 
church ; but all the disadvantages which might be apprehended 
have not arisen from this inconvenient arrangement, as it has been 
and continues to be, the practice of ministers to perform many, 
and in some instances all, of the ministerial duties among those 
who are near them, though they be not their parishioners. 

Mountains. — The greater part of the south side of Benlawers 
is in Crannich Lochtayside, and all the north side is in Roro 
Glenlyon. This mountain, which is 4015 feet above the level of 
the sea, is the highest in Perthshire, and among the highest in Scot- 
land. Though all the divisions of the parish are hilly, no other 
part requires particular notice except the rock of Weem. It is 
at least 600 feet above the low grounds around Castle Menzies at 
the foot of it, is beautifully wooded, and in some places rises up 
so steep, as to be almost perpendicular.f It may safely be pro- 

 In a small publication, called the Geography of the Holy Land, by the Rev. 
David Esdaile, it is stated that some travellers compare the scenery of Amulree, iii 
Glenquaich, to the locality of Jerusalem.

great part of Lochtay, and the towering summits of Benlawers and 
Benmore, the highest points of that line of the Grampians, are the 
most striking objects on the west side ; Aberfeldy with the wooded 
den of Moness, and the rich and beautiful valley of Strathtay, with 
its circle of hills behind, and a higher and more extended circle 
of Atholl hills beyond them, on the east side ; while the windings 
of the Tay, from west to east, enliven the whole of this interest- 
ing scene. 

Hydrography. — There is a fine spring about the middle of the 
rock of Weem, with which the superstitious notion had been once 
connected, that St David, the patron of it, on receiving a suitable 
offering, would grant such wishes as were preferred to him. The 
spring was cleaned out a few years back, and several proofs of 
wishes preferred were found in it, from a half-crown piece down to 
far more humble offerings. Tradition relates of this guardian 
saint, that he was one of the lairds of the place who had turned 
monk, and that he had a chapel on a shelf of the rock, still called 
Craig an-t' shea pail, or the chapel rock. 

Loch Tay is the principal lake connected with this parish, but 
there are two hill lakes of considerable size on an extensive farm, 
called Lochs in Glenlyon. The, river Dochart rises on the borders 
of Argyleshire, and receives the waters of the Lochay, which 
rises in the western hills of the glen of that name, very near the 
west end of Loch Tay, into which it flows. The river, on issuino- 
from the east end of the lake, takes the name of Tay, receives the 
Lyon between Taymouth and Castle Menzies, and the Quaich after 
taking the name of Bran, a little above Dunkeld. The name both 
of the river and of the lake has most probably been derived from 
the Gaelic word Teth, which may signify either hot or warm ; and 
the well-known fact, that Loch Tay is never known to freeze during 
coldest winter, must have procured this name for it, and for the 
river after issuing from it.

The rapids of a fine cascade in Glenlochay are in this parish, 
but the description belongs to Killin. 

Soils. — The character of the soil is almost as various as the di- 
visions of the parish are numerous. In a few places, it is wet and 
marshy, in the highest parts light and gravelly, and much of it, 
especially in the district of Weem, is loamy, with a strength and 
exposure capable of bearing wheat or any kind of crop, were it not 
for the frequent overflowing of the Tay, which would be difficult 
in any circumstances to prevent, and to which the interfering rights 
of proprietors are an additional obstacle. 

Zoology. — Besides the species of quadrupeds common to many dis- 
tricts in Scotland, there are in this parish, roe and fallow deer, 
mountain hares, which are dun in summer, but turn white in winter, 
and are smaller and more fleet than the common hares; and a few 
bisons, which are to be found only in the parks of Taymouth. The 
rarer species of birds are eagles, black-game, and pheasants; the 
beautiful ptarmigan, which occupies a still higher region than the 
mountain hare, and like it becomes whiter in winter ; and a few 
capercailzies on the grounds of the Marquis of Breadalbane. 

The principal fishes are, salmon, trout, and pike ; and anglers 
from various places resort to parts of this parish, and the districts 
in which they lie, especially to Glenquaich, not only for the sport 
of angling which loch Freuchie, and the streams that fall into it af- 
ford, but also for en joying the pure and bracing air of this quarter. 

Botany. — The full account from the parish of Kenmore on this 
subject renders it inexpedient to offer an inferior one from an ad- 
joining parish. 

The dimensions of the following trees in the lawn of Castle 
Menzies, some of which have been measured several years back, and 
others just now, are worthy of being given : — 

1. Solid contents of a plane, 1132 feet; extreme height, 77§ ; 
girth at the ground, 23, at four feet high, 16, and at six feet high, 
15. 2. Contents of a second plane, 957 feet; girth at four feet 
high, 18, and at seven feet and a half, 15. 3. Of a third plane,

14. Of an elm at base, 15 feet 11 inches; and at six feet high, 
10 feet 9 inches. 15. Of a second elm at base, 15 feet 3 inches; 
and at six feet high, 12 feet 1 inch. 16. Of an ash at base, 16 
feet 4 inches; and at five feet high, 11 feet 3 inches. 17. Of a 
second ash at base, 16 feet. 18 and 19. Two beech trees; girth 
of the one at base, 17 feet 2 inches, and of the other, 19 feet. 

Many other trees in the same place nearly equal these dimen- 
sions; and an. ash was blown down two years ago of the girth at 
base of 20 feet. There is a remarkable beech that separates near 
the ground into two branches, which again unite about four feet 
above the point of separation, and have an opening between them 
through which a person of ordinary size might pass. 

There are also many large old trees, chiefly of oak, both at 
Achmore and Newhall. 

II. — Civil History. 
Family of Meizies— The ancient history of this family is in- 
volved in considerable obscurity, from the burning of the family 
castle in the sixteenth century, when many of their private papers 
were consumed. They are generally supposed to have come first 
to England with William the Conqueror, to have been the same 
with the Maners, from which the Rutland family is descended, 
and to have settled in Scotland soon after the Conquest, in the 
reign of Malcolm Canmore. They became connected by mar- 
riage with many of the greatest and noblest families of the'land. 

1. The first who is specially mentioned in any records, and ap- 
pears to have been of considerable consequence, is Anketillus de 
Maynoers, who lived in the reign of William the Lion, which 
commenced in 1165. 

2. Robert de Meyners, Knight, supposed to have been his son, 
lived in the reigns of Alexander II. and III., was Lord High 
Chamberlain of Scotland, one of the barons called Magnates Sco- 
tia, and frequently employed in embassies to England, « which 
he discharged with great honour and commendation." His im- 
mediate connection with this country, with his power and posses- 
sions in it, is proved by the grant of a charter of the lands of Cul- 
dares, « Matthaeo de Moncrief pro homagio et servitio suo." 

' Chiefly abridged from Nisbet's Heraldry.

PERTHSHIRE. 



3. Sir Alexander de Meyners, Knight, was one of the patriots 
who stood firm to the interests of their country against the oppres- 
sions of Edward I. of England, for which he was imprisoned by 
that Monarch. He is specially stated to have got the lands of 
Weem and Aberfeldy, in vice de Perth ; and as he signed as wit- 
ness to a charter by Robert L before the Marischal of Scotland, 
it mav be inferred from this preference that he then held a pub- 
lie place of considerable rank. 

4. Sir Robert de Meyners, in his father's lifetime, got several 
lands in the Abathnage or Lordship of Dull, from Robert de 
Bruce, besides Cranach, as already described, with Edramuckie 
and Morinch in Deserver, also explained. 

5. John succeeded his father, Sir Robert. 

6. Robert de Meyners must have had great influence with the 
sovereign, as he got charters of several lands in Dumfries, Edin- 
burgh, Lanark, and Fifeshires, from Robert II. 

7. Sir David de Meyners succeeded his father. He was one of 
the hostages for King James I.'s ransom, was employed in seve- 
ral embassies to the Court of Denmark, and made Governor of 
the Orkneys, then belonging to the King of Denmark. He after- 
wards became " a monk of the Sestertian order in the monastery 
of Melross," and made many extensive and valuable donations of 
land to religious houses. 

8. John de Meyners succeeded his father, Sir David. 

9. Sir Robert succeeded his father in 1487. " It was in his 
time that the mansion-house of the family was burnt, which in- 
duced the sovereign to give him a new grant of his whole lands 
and estate, and to erect all of them into a free barony, to be cal- 
led the barony of Menzies." Roro, in Glenlyon, also belonged 
to him. 

10. Sir Robert succeeded his father in 1520. 

11. Sir Alexander succeeded his father, Sir Robert, in 1557. 

12. James succeeded Alexander, his father. 

13. Sir Alexander succeeded his father James in 1588. 

14. Duncan succeeded his father in 1624. 

15. Sir Alexander succeeded his father Duncan, and was created 
a Knight- Baronet, 2d September 1665. His eldest son, Robert, 
who predeceased him, married the eldest grand-daughter of Vis- 
count Canada, and the issue of that marriage are said to be the 
heirs of the territorial possessions of the first Earl of Stirling, and 
of the hereditary lieutenantship of Nova Scotia. His second son, 



WE EM. 



709 



Captain James Menzies, bad Comrie, and lived in the castle, of 
which the ruins are still standing-. 

16. Sir Alexander, son of the said Robert, succeeded his grand- 
father. 

17. Sir Robert succeeded his father. 

18. Sir John succeeded his cousin, Sir Robert. 

19. Sir Robert succeeded his cousin, Sir John. 

20. Sir Neil succeeded his father, and is now in possession of 
the estate of his ancestors. He resides constantly on his proper- 
ty, is a spirited improver of his estates, and a practical farmer to 
a great extent. He has lately been elected Honorary Secretary 
of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, a merited 
reward for his attention to the objects of that distinguished and 
useful association. 

Land-ovmers. — These are, Sir Neil Menzies of Menzies, the 
patron of the parish ; the Marquis of Breadalbane ; and to a com- 
paratively small extent, Ranald Menzies, Esq. of Culdares. 

Parochial Registers. — The first entry in the parish registers was 
in 1692 ; but they do not appear to have been kept with much 
regularity till 1741, and at no period have the names of all the 
children been inserted. 

Antiquities. — There are two upright crosses, close to each 
other, in the district of Newhall, said to have been the sides of a 
gateway to a Druidical place of worship at no great distance, but 
in a neighbouring parish. Here must have been anciently the 
business village of the surrounding district, as a fair called Feill 
Ddidh, or St David's, had been held at it, which was removed to 
the village of Kenmore, where it is now one of the principal fairs, 
and is held in March. There was a burying-ground, also, with a 
similar name, Cill Ddidh, but no tradition exists concerning this 
guardian saint. 

In the east end of the old church of Weem, which is still 
standing, and is now altogether the property of Sir Neil Menzies, 
there is a monument of very curious and varied sculpture, well-wor- 
thy of the minute examination of an antiquary, bearing, by a Latin 
inscription upon it, to be to the memory of Sir Alexander Men- 
zies, the thirteenth in order of the family, and of his spouse, Mar- 
jory Campbell, and others. 

Castle Menzies, the chief seat of Sir Neil Menzies of Men- 
zies, Baronet, and where he generally resides, stands in the midst 
of a rich, beautiful, and extensive lawn, finely interspersed with 



710 



PERTHSHIRE. 



large trees, of various kinds, such as oak, plane, and chestnut, at 
the foot of the rock of Weem, hy which it is effectually sheltered 
on the north side, and greatly ornamented. The level of the 
grounds being less than 300 feet above the sea, their favourable 
exposure, and their sheltered state, render them capable of pro- 
ducing all the fruits which can be reared in the open air, in the 
highest state of perfection ; and the Castle Menzies gean, espe- 
cially, has been celebrated all over the country. The castle, 
which appear, from a date upon it, to have been built in J 571, is 
a fine old building, with several turrets, but it is now in the act of 
receiving a very large addition, quite in character with the for- 
mer part, which will render it one of the most striking mansions 
in the north, and likely to be equalled by few in its suit of public 
apartments. 

The House of Auchmore, originally a small old building, but 
now modernized and greatly enlarged, stands in a park of consi- 
derable extent, separated on the west from the parish of Killin by 
a lively stream shaded with wood, washed on the north-west 
and north by the Dochart, the Dochart and Lochay united, and 
Lochtay, and wooded on the south and south-east. The present 
Marquis of Breadalbane resided here a considerable time before 
his accession. 

III. — Population. 

The population of this parish was, by Dr Webster's report, . 1295 

in 1811, .... 1372 

1821, . . . 1354 

1831, . 1209 

1841, ... 890 

Except in the district of Weem, where there is a small increase, 
the population has considerably decreased since the last census, 
and is continuing to decrease, partly by emigration from the coun- 
try, and partly by removal from the parish to other places, arising 
from the enlargement of farms on the estate of Breadalbane. 

The people may be all said to reside in the country, as the vil- 
lage of Weem, the principal one in the parish, is small, and most 
of its inhabitants are occupiers of land. 

The average number of births for the last seven years was . 28 

of deaths, . . .19 

of marriages, . . 9 

The number of persons under 15 years of age is, . 265 

betwixt 15 and 30, . 242 

30 and 50, . 239 

50 and 70, . 107 

upwards of 70, . 48 

The only family of independent fortune residing in the parish 



WE EM. 



711 



is that of Sir Neil Menzies. Each of the three heritors has land 
in it of more than the yearly value of L.50. 

There are 28 unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers, upwards 
of 50 years of age, and 45 unmarried women upwards of 45 years. 
The number of families is 190, and where there are children, they 
seem to average about 4. There is one fatuous person in the pa- 
rish. The language generally spoken is the Gaelic. 

IV. — Industry. 

The number of acres in cultivation, as nearly as can be as- 
certained, is about 1047. There may be about 300 more in grass, 
which were once in cultivation, partly in parks within the grounds 
of the two great heritors. No particular statement can be given 
of the number under wood; but there are in the rock of Weem 
alone 190, and there must be about four times that number over 
the whole parish. The kinds of trees that are planted are chiefly 
larch and oak, and next to these, ash, elm, and beech ; and those 
which are indigenous are the Scotch fir, birch, hazel, and moun- 
tain ash. There is much attention paid by the proprietors to the 
management of their woods. 

Rent. — The rent of arable land must be very doubtful, as it is 
almost always let with large portions of grazing; but ft may safe- 
ly be stated, that it differs in value so much as from 15s. to L.2, 
10s. an acre, according to soil, climate, and exposure. The rent 
of grazing a cow is from i8s. to L. 1, 10s., and from 3s. to 5s. for 
a sheep during the whole year. 

Wages. — A man-servant receives from L. 12 to L. 15 a-year, 
and a woman from L.4 to L.6. A day-labourer receives about 
Is. 3d. in winter, and from Is. 6d. to Is. 9d. in summer, without 
victuals. 

Live-Stock.— The sheep are almost all of the black-faced kind, 
and there are in Glenlochay alone, in this parish, from 3000 to 
4000 of them. The cattle are chiefly of the west Highland 
breed, but there are some Ayrshire cows in two places verv dis- 
tant from each other, at Castle Menzies, and in the braes of Glen- 
lochay. 

Husbandry. — The husbandry of this parish has been very much 
improved, but not to the same extent in every place. In the more 
favourable parts, the four or five-shift rotation is regularly adopted; 
and the young ploughmen in- this district would not be afraid of 
competing with the most skilful men of the south in performing 
their work, chiefly in consequence of annual ploughing-matches, 



712 



PERTHSHIRE. 



at which prizes are bestowed by Sir Neil Menzies on the success- 
ful competitors. A society, called the Atholl Club, for encou- 
raging improvements, both in husbandry and in the breeds of 
cattle have their meetings every third year in this village, for in- 
specting stock and adjudging their premiums. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is fifteen years, but 
there are several places where none appear to be given. 

V.— Pa rochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Dunkeld, at the distance of eighteen 
miles; but the chief business of this district is done in Perth. The 
village of Weem is small in respect of population, but other cir- 
cumstances render it of considerable importance. It is a polling- 
place for elections ; the" Atholl Club hold their triennial meeting 
in it; the Commissioners of Supply have their statutory road meet°- 
ings and others; the justices of the peace have monthly meetings 
for small debt cases, and occasional meetings for Excise purposes. 
These last are now a mere matter of form compared to the time 
when crowds of offenders against the Excise laws were called to- 
gether, to await with anxiety and dread the awarding of the pe- 
nalties to which their offences subjected them. It is also the seat 
of a Presbytery, erected by an act of the General Assembly, May 
24th 1836, "into a separate Presbytery, to be called the Presby- 
tery of Weem," and appointed to meet in October following. It 
consists of ten parishes, six original, three Government, and one 
chapel-of-ease, which were all disjoined from the Presbytery of 
Dunkeld. 

Means of Communication. —There is a post-office in the village 
of Aberfeldy, about a mile distant, and a penny-post from it passes 
through this village six days of the week. There are turnpike 
roads through the Weem, Murthly, Crannich, Newhall, and 
Sticks divisions ; and there are good roads in most of the other 
parts. The post drives a four-wheeled carriage for the convey- 
ance of passengers. There were two public coaches running 
through this parish during the last summer, from Dunkeld to 
Tarbet on Lochlomond side ; and there is a weekly carrier to the 
village, and others passing through it. 

The Bridge of Tay is a very fine building, of five large arches 
over the river of that name, between the village of Weem and that 
of Aberfeldy, and opening up the communication of all this north- 
ern district with the south. It was finished in the year 1733 un- 
der the direction of General Wade, Commander of the Forces in 
Scotland. 



WE EM. ' 10 

Near this bridge, the Forty- Second or Royal Highlanders, with 
which so many of our brave countrymen have been connected/and 
which has been concerned in so many of the gallant achievements 
of our army, was 6rst formally embodied into a regiment, exactly 
a hundred years since, under the name, Am Freiceadan Dubh, or 
the Black Watch. The seat of one of its distinguished officers, 
the late Colonel Alexander Stewart of Clochfoldich, who com- 
manded it at the battle of Alexandria after the senior command- 
inff officer had been wounded, is quite near this place of its first 
embodying. Another spot is pointed out, between the bridge and 
the village of Weem, where Sir John Cope's army is said to have 
encamped in 1745. There is a bridge over the Lochay near 
Killin ; and there had been one over the Lyon, close to the old 
Castle of Comrie, which has fallen down some years since, and 
has not been rebuilt, though much needed. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is con- 
venient for a much greater part of the population than any other 
place could be, but many are cut off from all access to it by their 
distance, which, in the case of some, is from twenty to thirty miles. 
It was built in 1835, affords comfortable accommodation for about 
600, and the sittings are all free. 

The manse was built in 1830. It has a neat external appear- 
ance, but its internal accommodation is very ordinary, as well as 
that of the outer buildings. The glebe is about five acres, and 
worth about L.10. The stipend is six chalders, half meal and 
half barley; and L.66, 13s. 4|d. including L.8, 6s. 8d. for com- 
munion elements. 

There is no chapel-of-ease in the parish, but parts of it are 
connected with the mission chapels of Lawers and Amulree. The 
Government church, or now quoad sacra parish of Glenlyon, is 
quoad civilia in the parish of Fortingall ; but a part of this parish 
is annexed to it. 

Ten individuals in the parish attend the chapels of Dissenters-. 
Divine service is very well attended at the Established Church, 
but a great part of the congregation is from contiguous parts of 
the parishes of Dull, Logierait, and Fortingall. The average 
number of communicants is about 650; but many of them, like 
the congregation, are from the preceding parishes. Besides the 
weekly collections for the poor, there is raised yearly, at an ave- 
rage, by church collections, for religious purposes, from L.8 to 
L. 10.

PERTHSHIRE. 



There is a Bible Society in the parish; and an account of its 
progress in distributing the Scriptures in a district, populous, in- 
deed, but by no means remarkable for its former want of the 
Bible, may show what can be done among our people when a fa- 
cility of supply is brought near them, and when this supply is 
offered at the reduced price of Bible Societies. In six years and 
a-half, the exact period which has elapsed since the Society has 
begun, there were sold 1855 copies of the Scriptures, 773 being 
the whole Bible, and 1082 being the New Testament only. In 
a district where English and Gaelic are both spoken, it may be 
interesting to state the numbers which were sold in these languages 
separately. There were in English, 1046; and in GaeliC809; 
but a fair inference cannot be drawn from this statement as to a 
preference for either language, until the books which have been 
required for schools, and which were almost all in English, be 
subtracted. Deducting these, which amount to 515, there remain 
569 in English, and 770 in Gaelic, thus showing a preference, in 
family and private reading, for the Gaelic. There is now reason 
to hope that all our families are well supplied with Bibles and 
Testaments, as 289 of the largest type have been sold ; and that 
the younger members have either pocket Bibles or Testaments, 
so that, such of them as may enter into service at a distance may 
not be liable to the complaint which has been often heard in pri- 
vate concerning this class of people, and which has sometimes 
been introduced at public meetings, that they neither know nor 
possess the Scriptures. A farther satisfaction has arisen from the 

SoCIGtV j ill at many of our emigrated country- 
men are now in possession of Bibles purchased here, several of 
them in the back-woods of Canada, and a few on the shores of 
Australia. The same Society has sold, at reduced prices, 219 of 
the London Tract Society's books, chiefly Doddridge's " Rise and 
Progress," and Baxter's " Call" and « Saint's -Rest," besides some 
of their smaller tracts. 

Education. — The schools in the parish are, the parochial, three 
others which are partly endowed, and one which is unendowed. 
Besides the ordinary branches taught in all the schools, geogra- 
phy, practical mathematics, and Latin are taught in some of them. 
The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommodations and the 

 L.148, Hs. lid. have been drawn from the sale of these Scriptures, and remit- 
ted, from time to time, to the Society which furnished them, besides occasional dona, 
tions, amounting in all to L.33, 8s. for the benefit of selling at the reduced prices.

maximum salary. The schoolmaster of each of the three schools 
which are partly endowed, receives about L.5, I Is., being the third 
of the interest of 5000 merks mortified for that purpose by Mr 
Archibald Campbell, who died minister of this place in 1740. 
The fees are extremely low in some of the schools ; but they are 
generally from Is. 6d. to 4s. per quarter, according to the branches 
in which instruction is received. There are L.8 yearly of a mor- 
tification for educating the poorer scholars at the parochial school. 
The people in general are very much alive to the benefits of edu- 
cation, and make great exertions to have them imparted to their 
children. A better encouragement to the schools which are poorly 
endowed, or not endowed at all, is more needful than the esta- 
blishment of new schools. There are no persons betwixt six and 
fifteen years of age who cannot read, and most of them can write; 
but there are seven above fifteen years who cannot read, and many 
more who cannot write. A Sabbath school has been taught in 
the church during the present incumbency, generally from the 
middle of March to the beginning of November, by the minister 
and one of the elders resident in the village ; and it has been at- 
tended by an average of about 50 scholars yearly. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number receiving 
parochial aid in the parish is IB, and the average sum allowed to 
each of them in the year is L.l, 8s. There are besides from 12 
to 14, in the contiguous sections of other parishes, who receive 
some aid from this fund. The average amount of contributions 
for their relief is, from church collections, L.29, 5s. 4d. ; from 
proclamation and mortcloth dues, L.4, 15s. 7d. j and from inte- 
rest of money, L.8, 8s. The disposition among the poor to re- 
frain from seeking parochial relief is by no means what it has for- 
merly been, and t hey cease, in too many instances, to consider an 
application degrading. 

Pairs. — Two annual fairs for general business, now very ill at- 
tended, were wont to be held in the village of Weem. 

Inns. — There is an inn at Weem, a second-rate one at the 
bridge of Lochay, and a small ale or whisky-house in Glenquaich ; 
but they do not appear to have any bad effect on the morals of 
the people. 

Fuel. — Peat is the common fuel of the country people, which is 
generally bad in quality. They sometimes burn wood with it. All 
who can afford, burn coals, brought at a great expense from Perth.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH AND 

STIRLING. 

THE REV. Dr JAMES RUSSELL, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries and Extent — The parish of Dunning is bounded 
on the east by Forteviot ; on the west, by Auchterarder ; on the 
south, by Fossaway ; and on the north, by Gask. It measures 
about 7 miles from north to south, and 4 from east to west, which, 
were the surface level, would give an extent of 28 square miles. 
About one-third of the whole is situated among the Ochil hills. 

Name. — There are two suppositions entertained regarding the 
origin of its name : one, that it is from the Gaelic term Dun, a hill 
or fort, the other that it is derived from Doucha, an abbot of 
Dunkeld, who is said to have fallen here in battle in the year 
964. 

Hydrography.— The inhabitants enjoy an abundant supply of 
excellent spring water. The rivulet, called Dunning Burn, rises 
among the Ochil hills, and, after a rather rapid descent over a bed 
of gravel, falls into the Earn. In the western division of the pa- 
rish, upon the property of Lord Rollo, is a lake called the 
" White Moss," covering about eleven acres of ground. It rests 
upon a bed of moss and gravel, contains a variety of small fish, 
and abounds with wild duck. 

Soil. — The soil along the banks of the Earn is light and sandy ; 
in other parts, it consists of clay or gravel ; and the Ochils afford 
excellent pasturage for sheep. 

Plantations. — There are many plantations in this parish, vary- 
ing in extent from three to twenty acres. These consist chiefly 
of oak, tir, ash, elm, and poplar. In the garden of Duncruib, the 
seat of Lord Rollo, is an old spruce, planted in 1707. Accord- 
ing to a measurement taken in the month of March 1838, its

height is 79 feet, circumference of the trunk at the ground 23 
feet; do. at 3 feet from the ground, 1 1 feet, 10 inches; diameter 
of the circle of ground covered by its branches, 60 feet. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events and Antiquities.— Colonel Miller, in a paper 
published in the fourth volume of the " Archaeologia Scotica," 
places the scene of the battle of Mons Grampius between the 
Ochil and the Lomond hills ; and, assuming Caerpow as the site of 
the city Victoria, founded by Agricola, and Castle Law at Colteu- 
cher, as Lindum, he traces a line of forts along the northern base 
of the Ochils to Ardoch; and from thence to the wall of Anto- 
ninus ; these he is inclined to attribute to Agricola, as a protection 
on the north to his newly acquired territory. Three of these forts are 
in the parish of Dunning, namely, Ardargie, Rossie Law called by 
Colonel Miller, Garrison Law, and Ternavie. The latter resem- 
bles the hull of a ship inverted ; hence, as is commonly supposed, 
its name terrae navis. Remains of ancient armour, with a great 
quantity of human bones, were dug up a few years ago, a little to 
the east of Ternavie, upon the farms of Rossie. Of these, two 
helmets, a small hatchet of yellow metal, and a finger ring, are 
preserved in Duncruib House. 

Subsequently to the time of the Romans, the parish must have 
often been the theatre of strife and bloodshed, from its proximity 
to Forteviot, the Pictish capital. There are vestiges of several 
camps and fortifications besides those already mentioned, and the 
discovery of urns and stone coffins is a matter of frequent occur- 
rence; but whether these are Roman or Pictish, it is impossible 
to determine, as the natives practised the Roman mode of sepul- 
ture, long after these invaders had left the country. 

The family of Lord Rollo is in possession of three banners : 
one measuring two feet two inches square, that belonged to a body 
of Perthshire militia, at the Revolution of 1688, which date it 
bears, commanded by the Lord Rollo of that period ; another that 
was wont to be unfurled at the head of a troop of horse, command- 
ed and maintained by Lord Rollo, for the protection of the coun- 
try in troublous times. It exhibits the figures of two armed men 
on horseback, with the family motto, " La fortune passe partout," 
measures 4 feet 7 inches, by 1 foot 8 inches, and is without a 
date ; to the third there attaches an importance, derived from his- 
torical associations, which will render it an object of interest so 
long as that hallowed fire of patriotism and piety which has 



718

burned with so pure a flame on many a hard contested field, shall 
continue to glow in the breasts of Scotsmen. This banner once 
waved over the heads of the Covenanters, and it beheld their dis- 
comfiture at the battle of Bothwell Bridge. There, standard and 
standard bearer were both captured by the Honourable Major Ar- 
chibald Rollo, second son of Lord Rollo. It has been perforated 
in seven different places by musket-balls, and has the following 
words inscribed upon it in gold letters, « Covenant. For Religion" 
Crown, and Kingdoms." It measures 2 feet, in length, by l°foot 
10 inches in breadth. 

The Earl of Marr, after the battle of Sheriffmuir, 12th No- 
vember 1715, withdrew his army into Angus, burning down as far 
as Perth, all the villages on his line of March, in order to retard 
the advance of the Royalist forces. Dunning, situated at the dis- 
tance of twelve miles from the scene of action, was, accordingly, 
burnt to the ground, with the exception of one house, said to bave 
been occupied by a miller. This man, by setting fire to wet straw 
within, induced the Highlanders to believe that the work of demo- 
lition was already begun. They accordingly abandoned it, as they 
conceived, to inevitable destruction. This house, or rather one 
erected upon its site, is still pointed out to strangers as an object 
of interest. The inhabitants, actuated by the same feeling that 
prompted the citizens of London to erect « the monument'' after 
the great fire in 1666, planted a thorn tree to commemorate the 
destruction of their village. This venerable thorn, although it 
has now braved the storms of a hundred and twenty-three win- 
ters, and has stood the silent witness of more than one chano-e in 
the entire population of the village, still promises fair to protract a 
green old age, and hand down the tale of its origin to other gene- 
rations that have not yet appeared on the stage of time. 

The two following entries occur in the session records of Dun- 
ning: the first dated nearly two months before the battle of She- 
riffmuir, the latter about a year subsequent to it.

were in the country, by reason of Marr's unnatural Rebellion

straits by their sufferings in the late Rebellion." 

Chief Land-owners.— The chief land-owners are, Lord Rollo ; 
Robert Graeme, Esq. of Garvock ; John Pitcairns, Esq. of Pit- 
cairns ; Lord Airlie ; and Alexander Belshes, Esq. of Invermay. 

The descent of the family of Rollo of Duncruib can be traced 
back in a direct line for a period of 1000 years, and can number 
at least one alliance by marriage with the royal family of France. 
The limits of this work will only permit a reference to a few of 
the names that occur in this long line of ancestry. 

Family of Rollo.— -Eric Rollo, the Dane, established himself in 
Normandy about the year 800 ; a lineal descendant of whom hav- 
ing conquered the country from the Crown of France, and mar- 
ried the King's daughter, became first Duke of Normandy. Pas- 
sing over several generations of this family, we come to William 
Duke of Normandy, commonly styled the Conqueror, who be- 
came King of England in 1066. Eric de Rollo, a descendant of 
a collateral branch of the first Duke, accompanied the Conqueror 
to England, in capacity of secretary ; a portrait of whom, taken 
in the 98th year of his age, is preserved in Duncruib House. 
Richard de Rollo, a son or grandson of the latter, came to Scot- 
land during the reign of David I., by whom he was graciously re- 
ceived, and who conferred on him houses and lands about Edin- 
burgh and elsewhere. He then settled in Perthshire, where the 
family, having obtained successive grants of land from the Crown, 
have remained ever since. 

Parochial Registers. — The first record of session begins 19th 
April 1691. The register of marriages begins 20th January 1709, 
and is discontinued after October 28th 1714. The register of 
baptisms begins May 16th 1708, and ends October 23d 1716. 
These registers have been resumed at different dates, but have not 
the appearance of having been accurately kept. Indeed, the re- 
gister of baptisms cannot be expected to be so, as few of the Dis- 
senters record their baptisms, at least with the parochial clerk. 
Some improvement, however, particularly in the registration of 
banns, has taken place since 1783.

There are three families of independent fortune who generally 
reside in the parish, and about ten proprietors of land above the 
yearly value of L.50. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of acres under tillage is not ascer- 
tained, and there is no land in undivided common. There are at 
least 200 acres planted, and the average rent of land is about L.2 per 
acre. Grazing is at the rate of L.4 per ox or cow for the summer 
half -year. Good labourers generally receive 10s. per week; 
wrights, 12s. Masons and other artisans are paid at the rates 
current in Glasgow and Perth. The system of raising white and 
green crops alternately is adopted, and the most skilful farmers 
interpose pasture between their rotations to insure a better return. 
The leases are generally for nineteen years. The farm-houses 
are substantial and commodious stone and lime buildings, roofed 
with slate. 

Di •aining. — Draining has been extensively practised in this pa- 
rish. The richest soils have been brought into cultivation by 
means of it. Upon the estate of Lord Rollo alone eighty acres 
of very superior land have been reclaimed by this process, which, 
if let, would bring a rent of L.7 or L.8 per acre. The draining 
of this marsh land, which consisted originally of four separate and 
detached portions, containing about twenty acres each, was lono-

deemed impracticable, from the want of sufficient declivity to 
carry off the water. The mode in which this was effected upon 
one of these swamps, called the White Bog", was as follows : The 
morass was intersected longitudinally by a drain eight feet deep, 
which collected and discharged the water into the channel of a 
neighbouring rivulet, about 80 yards distant. This apparently 
simple process was attended with difficulties. The bed of the 
stream, having a greater elevation than the marsh itself, required 
to be greatly deepened. In consequence, it was found necessary 
to underbuild the foundation of a bridge five feet, where a public 
road crossed the stream. Again, at a point considerably above, 
the brook had formerly given off a supply of water to turn machi- 
nery, but which, by the deepening of the channel, was now cut 
off. Hence, one of two things became necessary, either to relin- 
quish the use of the water for driving the mills, or to carry it for- 
ward at the same level as formerly by means of an aqueduct. The 
latter was preferred, care being taken to coat the bottom and 
sides of the aqueduct with clay, to render it impervious to the 
water. Thus terminated the labour of draining the White Bog. 
The substances composing the marsh were vegetable mould, clay, 
&amp;c. and were found to rest on a bed of sand. The channel cut 
for the water was 14 inches deep in this sandy stratum. The 
water everywhere flowed gently from the sand. The White l}og 
vanished, and in about one month from the time when the opera- 
tions were brought to a close, the boggy materials had shrunk se- 
veral feet, exhibiting upon their surface cracks and fissures in all 
directions. This now valuable land was sown with oats the fol- 
lowing spring, 1820, and the produce of about three acres being 
sold brought L.57, 10s. The remainder not being offered for 
sale was estimated at L.20 per acre. The whole was planned and 
brought to a successful conclusion by Dr Martin, then factor to 
Lord Rollo ; and it is a proud monument to the ingenuity and 
skill of that gentleman, that, in place of a dreary swamp, pro- 
ducing only what is noxious, there is now a smiling and luxuriant 
meadow, enlivening the landscape by its beauty, and yielding a 
liberal return to enlightened and well-directed enterprise. 

Quarries, — There are several quarries of durable stone in the 
parish ; and an extensive liver formation of white freestone has 
recently been discovered on the estate of Balquhandy, the pro- 
perty of Major J. G. Drummond. The Ochils abound with

whinstone, and in the beds of the streams are found boulders and 
pieces of quartz. 

Manufactures — This parish contains three corn-mills, one 
flour-mill, a saw-mill, and a wool-mill, at which a considerable 
woollen manufactory is carried on, two malt-mills, a distillery, and 
a brewery. A great proportion of the inhabitants are weavers, 
and are supplied with work from Glasgow. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The village of Dunning contains many substantial houses, and 
is held in feu from the Right Hon. Lord Rollo. It is placed 
under the superintendence of a baron-bailie, and enjoys the ad- 
vantages of a post-office and a reading-room for newspapers. Of 
the latter there are 110 delivered weekly at the post-office. So 
lately as the year 1764, there was only one newspaper read in the 
whole parish. It was received by the family of Lord Rollo, who 
are still in possession of the first number ordered, and is entitled 
"The Craftsman, or Say's Weekly Journal." It sold at 2d. in- 
cluding a halfpenny for duty. There is no jail, but in lieu of it 
there is that old-fashioned instrument of punishment called the 
jougs. The only other village in the parish is the new town of 
Pitcairns. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church stands in the village, 
ang affords accommodation for 1000 persons, — the sittings all free. 
It was rebuilt and enlarged in 1810, is in a state of proper repair, 
and convenient for the greater part of the population, being situat- 
ed at the distance of one mile from the east boundary of the pa- 
rish, two from the north, three from the west, and five from the 
south. The patron is Lord Kinnoull. 

The extent of the glebe is eight acres and a quarter ; its annual 
value, L.20 Sterling. The amount of the stipend is 16 chalders, 
half meal and half barley, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. 

There are four Dissenting chapels in the parish, two belonging 
to the United Associate Synod, one to the Associate Synod of 
Original Seceders, and one to the Relief. Divine service at the 
Established Church is generally well attended, as it also is at the 
several chapels, with the exception of the Relief, which has had 
no stated minister for the last nine years. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish, the paro- 
chial and four unendowed schools. The branches of education 
generally taught, are English, writing, arithmetic, and Latin. The

salary of the parochial teacher is the maximum. The fees are as 
under : for reading, 2s. ; reading and writing, 2s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 
3s. ; Latin, 5s. The parochial teacher has the legal accommo- 
dation. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 20. The average sum allotted to each 
is 5s. per month. To meet this demand there are annual contri- 
butions, amounting to betwixt L.60 and L.70 ; church collections, 
averaging L.20 ; and assessments, L.40 ; with L.9 of interest from 
a sum of money. 

Fairs. — Alehouses. — Fuel. — Dunning "has 3 annual fairs. There 
are 13 alehouses in the parish. The inhabitants are supplied with 
coal from Blairingone, thirteen miles distant ; and from Tillicoul- 
try, sixteen miles distant. The price of a single-horse cart-load is 
at present 1 4s.

PRESBYTERY OF AUCHTERARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH AND 

STIRLING. 

THE REV. JOHN FERGUSON, MINISTER. 



L— Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The parishes of Monivaird and Strowan were origin- 
ally distinct, but have been united for about two centuries. " The 
modern name, Monivaird, is a corruption of the ancient, which 
was Moivard, as appears from a grant made by the Earl of Strath- 
erne, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, of the church of 
Saint Servanus, or Serf of Moivard, to the monastery of Inchaf- 
frey." It is derived from the Gaelic words moi-vard or mon-vard, 
signifying the hill of the bards. The pronunciation, Moivard, Is 
still retained by those inhabitants of the parish who use the Gae- 
lic language. 

" In the former Statistical Account, the word Moivard is interpreted as signifying 
"the plain of the bards;" but " hill of the bards" agrees more closely with the Gae- 
lic and the nature of the locality. 



724 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Strowan is a corruption of &amp; Rowen, Rowan, or Ronan, the tu- 
telar saint of Strowan parish. St Rowen is said to have lived 
about A, d. 660, was a clergyman, and proprietor of the estate 
now called Strowan. He was famous for his learning, travelled 
through France and Italy, and became a professor in one of the 
German universities. According to Bede, he engaged with Finan, 
Bishop of Lindisferne or Holy Island, in a protracted controversy 
respecting the day on which Easter should be observed ; the 
Bishop and all the British churches contending for one day ; the 
Pope and Church of Rome, supported by Rowen, for another. 
Many names in the neighbourhood derive their origin from St 
Rowen. Thus, Pol-Ronan, or the Pool of St Ronan, is a deep 
linn in the river Earn, about 100 yards above the bridge of 
Strowan ; Fil-Ronan, i. e. " the festival of St Ronan," is the 
Gaelic name given to Strowan fair or market, formerly held on 
the site of the present mansion-house of Strowan, close by the 
pool above-mentioned. The name Rowan was also given to a 
spring of fine water adjoining the mansion-house of Strowan, and 
to a dam-dike across the river, where the Saint had a cruive which 
supplied him with fish on his fasting days. 

Extent, Boundaries, and Figure. — These united parishes, of 
which Monivaird forms the northern, and Strowan the southern 
division, are situated in the upper part of Strathearn, and are 
bounded by the parish of Monzie on the north, by the parishes of 
Monzie and Crieff on the east, by that of Muthil on the south, 
and by that of Comrie on the west. In figure, they may be said 
to approach nearest to an irregular ellipse or oval, of which the 
transverse or longer axis extends in length about 9 miles from 
north to south ; and the conjugate, about 6 miles from east to 
west in breadth. Two arms of the parish, however, project be- 
yond this general outline into the adjacent parish of Comrie, and 
are annexed to it quoad sacra, viz. one on the south-west, in the 
direction of Glenartney, comprehending the farms of Easter and 
Wester Meiggar, Findoglen, Auchnashelloch, Colnacarry, Trian, 
Drumchork, Dunivarran, and Milnmaik; and the other up Glen- 

 He left three acres of ground to the bellman of Strowan, requiring in the char- 
ter which accompanied the grant, as the service to be rendered in return, that the 
bellman and his heirs should ring the holy bell of St Rowan under his gown when 
mass was said. The name Dewar in Gaelic signifies a bellman ; and a family of 
Dewars, some of whom still survive, occupied a piece of ground at Strowan for seve- 
ral generations u;.der this grant, and until within these few years. The bell, appa- 
rently made of brass and iron, but wanting the tongue, is in the possession of the 
present proprietor of Strowan, Thomas Graham Stirling, Esq.

lednock, towards the north or north-west, comprehending Carro- 
glen, Balmuicks, Laggan, and Lurg. The superficial extent of 
the parish, making allowance for irregularities, may thus be com- 
puted at or about 35 square miles, and may contain about 22,000 
imperial acres. 

Mountain Ranges, c— A ridge of the Grampian mountains, 
running from east to west, forms the north boundary of the parish. 
The highest mountain of this part of the range is Benchonzie, i. e. 
the mossy mountain there being about 40 acres on its summit 
covered with a species of whitish moss, on the northern extremity 
of the parish. Its elevation above the level of the sea is 2922 
feet. Turleum, a hill on the south-east extremity of the parish, 
is about 1400 feet above the level of the sea. Betwixt the lower 
hills which skirt the base of the Grampian range on the north, 
and Turleum on the south-east, Laggan, Druromachargan, and 
Tom-a-chastel, a connected series of picturesque, conical hills, 
stretch on the east side of the parish in an oblique direction south, 
or rather south-west, across the valley of the Earn. These beau- 
tiful knolls, closely clad with copse, and o'ertopped with stately firs 
planted along their summits, present a fine contrast to the bold, 
craggy face of the higher surrounding mountains, and a scene of 
great romantic beauty to the eye of the traveller. They are sepa- 
rated from the lower ridge of the Grampian hills on the north, by 
a pass through which the northern branch of the Lochearn turn- 
pike road leads from Crieff, along the finely wooded margin of the 
Loch of Monivaird, by Comrie to Lochearnhead, and they ter- 
minate on the south, with Tom-a-chastel already mentioned. At 
this point, through a pass or defile still narrower, the Earn flows 
in a swift strong but smooth current, and along its south bank the 
other branch of the Lochearnhead road leads to Comrie, where it 
joins the northern branch, and also the Glenlichorn road from 
Comrie to Stirling. 

Emerging from either of the passes just noticed, the valley 
again opens up on the west towards Comrie, and exhibits to the 
eye a delightful amphitheatre, richly diversified with every variety 
of natural beauty, wood, and water, hill and dale, and surrounded 
by lofty mountains on every side, over which Benchonzie, Ben- 
voirlich, and Benmore, are seen towering in the distance, — 
now raising their green summits to the skies, — now enveloped in 
robes of cloud and mist, — and again crowned with their diadems 
of snow. On the north, the lower ridges of the Grampians, co-

vered with extensive plantations of stately forest trees, except where 
here and there a rugged precipice advances its bare craggy front, 
decline into the Strath, — sometimes with a gradual and pleasing 
slope, — sometimes with an abrupt irregular descent, — and form a 
fine contrast alike to the bold, bleak mountain scenery above, and 
to the rich valley and meandering river below. Along the banks 
of the Earn, which intersects the valley, elegant mansions, spaci- 
ous lawns, extensive plantations, fertile corn and pasture fields 
in a high state of cultivation, increase the beauty and variety 
of the scene. So beautiful and varied, indeed, is the aspect of the 
country, that travellers have been often struck with its great re- 
semblance to some of the most delightful and romantic scenes in 
Switzerland. Another narrower valley, but of equal diversity of 
natural aspect, is situated on the banks of the Turret, which, on 
the north-east, partly divides Monivaird from the parishes of Mon- 
zie and CrierT. The scenery of Glenturret, at the head of this 
valley, presents a fine contrast to that of the lower district, being 
wild and grand in a very high degree. 

Meteorology. — An estimate of the atmospheric pressure and 
temperature may be formed from the fact, ascertained by a rain- 
guage kept for a period of several years at Dunira, in the im- 
mediate neighbourhood, where the vapours exhaled from Loch 
Earn are more subject to be intercepted by the closely surrounding 
hills, and condensed by their attraction, — that the quantity of rain 
which fell at Dunira was very nearly the same as at the obser- 
vatory in Edinburgh. 

Climate. — The climate is one of the least variable in Scotland, 
and, on account of its salubrity, the parish is more exempted from 
epidemic distempers than almost any other district in Scotland. 

Hydrography. — There are several small lakes in the parish, 
the largest of which, Loch-turret, lies in the bosom of Glenturret, 
at the foot of Benchonzie, surrounded by bold craggy mountains, 
and abounds with trout, pike, and perch. It is about a mile long, 
and a-quarterof a mile broad, and covers about 113 Scotch acres. 

Loch-Ouan, a small lake in the same glen, and about a mile 
north from the former, is remarkable for the great number of 
trouts which are collected in a small opening in the middle of it, 
the only place which is free from weeds. In the lower part of 
the parish there are three small lakes, well-stocked with pike, 
perch, trout, carp, tench, and eel. The largest of these, the 
Loch of Monivaird, already noticed, covers about 30 Scotch acres.

It is situated at the base of a fine banging wood, having a southern 
exposure, in the midst of which stands the mansion-house of 
Ochtertyre. The lake is surrounded by the pleasure-grounds 
and plantations, and the scenery around it is equal to any in 
Scotland. For many years up to 1814, shell-marl was dragged 
from the bottom of this lake by means of a floating-machine, in 
many places from a depth of 25 feet, which was sold at or about 
Is. Id. per boll. In the year 1809, no less a quantity than 10,585 
bolls were raised, and sold for L.573, 7s. 7±d. This manure was 
very extensively used in the district, and with great utility, espe- 
cially in the cultivation of waste land. It was also particularly 
adapted for producing fine grass, and contributed much to raise 
the beautiful pastures with which the parish is clothed. 

The principal river is the Earn, already mentioned,issuing 
from Loch Earn, in the adjacent parish of Comrie, which, with 
many windings in its progress, flows in a direction nearly east from 
its source for about thirty-six miles, and falls into the Tay  at 
Rhynd. The Turret, issuing from the loch of that name, pre- 
viously noticed, rushes with a more precipitous current, affording, 
in its course of nearly six miles southerly, many falls capable of 
impelling the heaviest machinery, and unites with the Earn near 
Crieff. A dike having been built within these few years across 
the mouth of the lake, an ample supply of water can be com- 
manded even in seasons of the greatest drought. 

At the falls of Ochtertyre, on the Turret, about a mile north 
from the mansion house of Ochtertyre, and in the bosom of a 
deep and thickly planted dell, where this stream, as if struggling 
to find a passage, has worn a chasm in the opposing and nearly 
meeting rocks, a beautiful cascade is formed, of the height of thirty 
feet, over which the water, when swollen with rain, rushes with a 
deafening roar. A bridge has been thrown across the stream a 
little below, and opposite the fall, a grotto has been cut out of the 
rock by the late proprietor, and seated for the accommodation of 
those who visit this enchanting spot. Along the north-east boun- 
dary of the parish, flows the rapid stream of the Barvic, dividing 
Monzie and Monivaird, and falling, after a headlong course of four 
miles, into the Turret. Immediately before its junction with the 
Turret, the Barvic runs through a very rugged and romantic ra- 

 Buchanan, in his History of Scotland, lib. ii. c. 36, arguing that the Gaels 
carae originally from Spain, notices the existence of many similar names of places, 
&amp;c. in both countries ; and among these, Ieme, the name of a river in Gallicia, and 
of a river in Strathearn.

vine, where it forms a series of beautiful cascades, and falls 500 
or 600 feet in the distance of an eighth of a mile. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — This department of the subject will 
be best illustrated by the following communication from the pen 
of Dr Thomas Thomson, the distinguished Professor of Che- 
mistry in the College of Glasgow, with which the writer has been 
very kindly favoured. 

" The parish of Monivaird is situated chiefly in the range of 
low hills that skirt the Grampians, upon the south east side, in 
Perthshire. 

" The Grampians constitute a range of primary mountains, 
which begin a little to the south of Aberdeen, and pass in a south- 
westerly direction across the whole of Scotland, till they termi- 
nate in the sea at the Mull of Cantyre. The portion of the 
Grampians connected with Monivaird consists of clay-slate moun- 
tains, containing here and there thin beds of quartz and limestone. 
No veins have been discovered, and clay-slate rocks are usually 
poor in extraneous minerals. 

" Separated from the Gramp : ans by intervening vallies, there 
is a range of picturesque hills connected with the parish of Mo- 
nivaird, which form a kind of amphitheatre round Crieff; these 
are Cnock Mary, Turleum, Lochlin, Tom-o-Chastel, Lao-cram 
Cnock, Glower-o'er-him. They are very varied in appearance and 
form, — are all richly covered with wood, and it is to them chiefly 
that the beautiful landscape to the south-west of Crieff, stretching 
through Monivaird onward by Comrie — scarcely equalled in any 
part of Great Britain — is owing. These hills are composed of grey- 
wacke rocks, which assume various appearance ; sometimes old red- 
sandstone, in beds very nearly perpendicular ; sometimes a very 
coarse red conglomerate, composed chiefly of hornblende-porphyry, 
very like the rocks at Glenco, but sometimes very nearly like com- 
mon greywacke. 

" The cement of the old red sandstone is sometimes clay, some- 
times clay-slate. The grains are free, and it contains much 
mica. Quarries of it may be seen in the hill of Laggan. It is 
frequently employed as a building stone. The veins of lead-ore, 
which have been so long wrought at Leadhills and Wanlockhead, 
occur in a rock of the same nature as the one here described ; but 
no metallic veins of any kind have been detected in the transition 
rocks of Perthshire. 

" The flat country constituting Strathearn is composed of beds 



MONIVAIRD AND STilOWAN. 



729 



of fine-grained red sandstone, very nearly horizontal. I could no- 
where observe the junction of these beds with the greywacke beds. 
But, from the difference of the position, it is evident that the two 
are unconformable. Hence I conclude that the Strath consists of 
beds of new red sandstone. 

" Between the greywacke rocks and the new red sandstone, the 
coal-beds are usually interposed. In Strathearn, these beds are 
either wanting, or buried so deep under the new red sandstone as 
to be unavailable. 

« Dikes of trap-rock traverse the low country in various places. 
There is one of greenstone at Monzie, of which materials for 
mending the roads are taken. The dike at Concraig crosses the 
road between Muthil and Crieff. It is a kind of greenstone, and 
is said to have been traced for thirty miles. 

" Many boulders of granite may be seen upon the greywacke 
hills, and in the low country. They are all water-worn, and must 
have been brought from the north-west from a distance of not less 
than fifty or sixty miles. The largest of these boulders lies upon 
the south-west shoulder of the Cnock of Crieff, and is called the 
" Cradle stone." It is a mass of sienitic granite, nearly spherical, 
and about 9 feet in diameter. It weighs about 30 tons. It has 
been split in two by lightning, and the greater fragment has made 
nearly a revolution down the hill. 

" Few countries are less rich in minerals than the parish of 
Monivaird. Except the rocks just described, and the alluvial soil 
of which the carses are composed, we saw no mineral of any im- 
portance whatever." 

In connection with this subject, although not strictly within the 
limits assigned to this Account, it may be mentioned, that a no- 
tion very generally prevails in Strathearn, that the appearances on 
the surface afford, in several places, strong indications of the pre- 
sence of coal, and repeated attempts at discovery have, at different 
periods, been made to the eastward of the parish. In the year 
1792, a subscription was raised to defray the expense of a search 
in the property of Lord Perth, on the moor of Tullibardine, near 
Auchterarder, and, from appearances then judged favourable, per- 
sons acquainted with the business maintained the opinion, that, if 
a thorough search should be made by boring, no doubt could be 
entertained of coal being found in that moor. The undertaking, 
however, was not long persevered in at that time, and a very general 
opinion, whether well or ill-founded, prevailed in the district, that 



730 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the professional persons employed to conduct the search were 
bribed by proprietors of coal mines in the south to abandon the 
undertaking. 

A similar experiment was made within these few years on the 
estate of Anthony Maxtone, Esq. of Cultoquhey, about two miles 
to the eastward of Crieff, and it was at first attended with seem- 
ing indications of a favourable result. Another trial was recently 
made, and boring carried on by practical persons, on their own 
responsibility, for a considerable time on the lands of Lord Rollo, 
near Dunning, where it is also said favourable indications were 
discovered; but, it is understood, the projectors did not receive 
encouragement sufficient to induce them to continue their opera- 
tions. In 1837, nearly L.800 were raised in Strathearn for the 
purpose of making another trial at Tullibardine, and a bore was 
made to the depth of 40 feet ; but, from present appearances, the 
undertaking is likely to share the fate of its predecessors. It must 
be observed, however, that Dr Thomson, in the previous article, 
states, that coal-beds are either awanting or buried at such a depth 
as to be unavailing, and other eminent professional men coincide 
in this opinion. But still the object is, in every point of view, of 
such importance, as to merit a more combined effort upon the part 
of the landed proprietors, and of the inhabitants of the country 
generally. 

Soil. — The soil is various. On the low ground, it is in general 
light and gravelly, and the greater part of it, on both sides of the 
Earn, may be said to be of a free generous quality, admitting of be- 
ing easily pulverized. The haughs or holms, provincially termed 
carses, on the banks of the river, which are of considerable extent, 
are enriched by alluvial deposits formed by frequent inundations, 
and produce excellent crops, particularly of barley. The rocks 
are generally covered with peat, turf, or moss. There is an ex- 
tensive peat-moss in Glenturret, on the estate of Ochtertyre, the 
digging of which is limited to the consumption of the tenantry. 

Zoology — Quadrupeds. — The sportsman will here meet with all 
the varieties of game common to those districts in the north of 
Scotland which present similar topographical appearances of moun- 
tain and dale, woodland and lake. But there are no wild ani- 
mals of a rare species peculiarly calculated to attract the curiosity 
or attention of the zoologist, if we except the Alpine hare, which 
is sometimes seen on the more elevated points of the parish ; it is 

of a bluish colour in summer, and white in winter. The roe fre-

quents the neighbourhood of the extensive plantations in the dis- 
trict, and often, during severe winter storms, visits the low grounds 
in quest of food. In 1805, the late Sir P. Murray introduced the 
spotted Asiatic or Manilla deer into the pleasure-grounds of Och- 
tertyre, — the only pure stock of the kind then in Scotland. The 
low grounds abound with hares and rabbits ; and the usual descrip- 
tions of vermin, such as foxes, martens, wild-cats, weasels, bad- 
gers, &amp;c. are occasionally to be met with. In dredging the loch 
of Ochtertyre for marl, stag horns of great size and dimensions 
have been frequently found. In former times, Glenturret was 
kept as a forest for red-deer; but the foiest was broken up up- 
wards of a century ago. In the Account of the Rev. Mr Porteous 
afterwards referred to, it is stated, that, about the middle of the 
seventeenth century, two wolves, the last seen in Scotland, were 
chased from the wood of Trowan, and followed by their pursuers 
into the Highlands; where they were killed. 

Of the feathered tribes, the birds of prey chiefly entitled to con- 
sideration are, the black eagle, various species of the falcon, the 
raven, the carrion-crow, and the hooded-crow. The eagle hatches 
annually in the stupendous cliffs of Glenturret, on the east side of 
Benchonzie; and to secure the young, which is generally accomplish- 
ed by a person armed with a fowling-piece, and let down by means 
of ropes from the rocks above, forms an enterprise, which, whilst 
it affords considerable amusement, is not altogether unattended 
with danger. This glen, we are informed, was also noted, in for- 
mer ages, for producing falcons of a superior breed, which were 
eagerly sought after when hawking formed aTavourite, if not the 
principal, amusement amongst the field sports of the country; — 
and it is remarked, in the former Account of this parish, that the 
pair which were presented to George III. at his coronation by the 
then Duke of Atholl, as a symbol of the tenure by which he held 
the Isle of Man, of the Crown of England, were procured from 
Glenturret. The eagles commit great depredations upon the 
sheep-flocks during the scarcity of game, frequently carrying 
off lambs in their talons to feed their nestlings ; and the raven 
and crow are also destructive when they find sheep entangled in 
bushes, or lambs straggling from their mothers, or unable to fol- 
low them closely by reason of weakness or cold. They commence 
their attack by picking out the eyes, and afterwards feed upon the 
carcase ; but, by a wise provision of nature, restricting all noxious 



732

or ravenous animals to a small brood, combined with the vigilanca 
of the shepherds, their numbers are kept within limits. 

The ptarmigan, which frequents only the highest hills, is found 
on the top of Benchonzie. The moors abound in black and red 
grouse, plover and dotterel. The woodcock and snipe are fre- 
quently shot. Partridges are plentiful on the low grounds, and 
the plantations are well stocked with pheasants, which were intro- 
duced at a comparatively late period. Of the aquatic birds which 
visit the parish in the course of their migrations, the principal are, 
wild geese, wild ducks, teals, widgeons, gulls, herons, &amp;c. The 
plantations are enlivened by the melody of the various species of 
birds of song ; and the other varieties of the winged tribe, which 
usually breed in a well-wooded district, are common. 

Botany. — The following more rare plants have been found in 
this parish by Lady Keith Murray : 

Lycopus Europaeus Stellaria nemorum Hieraciumaurantiacum 

Ca'amagrostis Epigejos Reseda lutea Habenaria viridis 

Solanum nigrum Rosa sabini albida 

— Dulcamara Tormentilla reptans Listera nidus avis 

Juncus big'umis Scutellaria galericulata Veronica scntellata 

Epilobium angustifolium Teesdalia nudicaulis Vicia sylvatica 

Adoxa moschatellina Malva moschata Potamogeton luceus, varie- 

Chrysopleniumalternifolium Astragalus hypoglottis ty prajlongus. 

Dianthus deltoides Ornithopus perpusillus 

This curious variety of Potamogeton, or pondweed, has not been 
before observed in this country, until found by Lady Keith Mur- 
ray, in Monivaird Loch, near Ochtertyre. 

The following plants have also been found in the parish, chief- 
ly near to the House of Burn : — Chelidonium majus, Erysimum 
alliaria, Enothera biennis, Oxalis corniculata, Trollius Euro- 
pceus. 

Horticulture. — From the encouragement given, and example 
shewn, by the landed proprietors, horticulture has of late made 
very considerable progress, and the several kinds of pot-herbs and 
roots, confined at a former period to the gardens of gentlemen, 
are now raised by all classes. Along the north side of the Earn, 
from Comrie eastward through this parish, the rays of the sun are 
powerfully reflected from the hills on the north, and the fine slop- 
ing banks are favourable to the growth of fruits of various kinds. 
The farmers have accordingly of late years evinced a laudable taste 
for improvement, by planting in their gardens fruit trees of various 
kinds ; and as apples, pears, plums, and cherries of different sorts 



MONIVAIRD AND RTROWAN. 



733 



are thus more generally produced in the district, fruit is abun- 
dant in quantity, and reasonable in price. 

Forests— The locality is very rich in wood, and much of the 
natural copse in this and the neighbouring parishes is supposed to 
be the remains of the Caledonian forest, which extended from 
Callander to Dunkeld, a distance of nearly fifty miles. The soil 
is well adapted for the growth and nourishment of all descriptions 
of forest trees reared in Scotland, which thrive here uncommonly 
well, more pasticularly the oak, to which the soil seems peculiarly 
congenial. Immediately around the mansion-house of Ochtertyre, 
there is a very splendid collection of old oaks, and on the estate of 
Lawers are some remarkably fine specimens of Scotch fir, and 
other kinds of wood. The whole district, indeed, is most taste- 
fully and finely wooded, and the oak, ash, elm, plane, pine, 
birch, laburnum, and other different kkds of hardwood inter- 
mixed in the older plantations, produce, while in leaf, the finest 
effect, and gratify the eye in a very high degree. Within 
the last thirty years, extensive tracts have been laid out by the 
late Sir Patrick Murray, on the estate of Ochtertyre, by the late 
Lord Balgray on Lawers, and by the late Thomas Graham 
Stirling, Esq. on Strowan, in plantations of Scotch fir, larch, 
and spruce, having hardwood, chiefly oak, intermixed, with the 
view ultimately, when the purpose of shelter shall have been 
served, of clearing out the soft wood, and leaving the oak for 
copse. Innumerable clumps and belts have also been planted in 
suitable spots, and hedge- rows of all the varieties of hardwood 
everywhere appear ; — improvements which, whilst they are con- 
ducive to ornament and shelter, afford a ready supply of all that 
the country demands for purposes of utility, and insure a profita- 
ble return for the public spirit manifested by the proprietors. The 
utmost attention is paid to thinning and pruning, and the manage- 
ment is of the first order. 

II. — Civil History. 
An account, illustrative of the history of these parishes, drawn 
up by the Rev. Mr Porteous, formerly minister of Monivaird, will 
be found in Part I. Vol. II. of the Transactions of the Society of 
Antiquaries. From this compilation, the writer of the present 
Account has derived various points of interesting information. It 
is there stated, that the plague ravaged Monivaird in the reign of 
Charles I. " An old man," says the writer, " informed me that 
his father, having recovered at that time, was a cleanser; and 



734 



PERTHSHIRE. 



told him, that, when this fatal disease was raging in the parish, our 
gentlemen caused many huts to be built, and ordered all who per- 
ceived that they were infected, immediately to repair unto them. 
That particularly, the family of Ochtertyre caused observation be 
made every morning whether the wind blew from the east or west. 
That they sent provisions of all kinds to them, but gave their ser- 
vants strict orders, if the wind blew from the east, to lay them 
down a good way to the east of them ; and to the west, if it blew 
from the west ; and that, some time after they were gone, the 
cleansers took them up, and carried them to the diseased." The 
graves of those who then died of the pestilence were still visible 
to the west of the Loch of Monivaird when this account was 
compiled. 

According to Chalmers, who derives his authority from Fordun 
and others, Kenneth IV., King of Scotland, was slain in battle in 
1003 in the plain of Monivaird, now forming part of the park of 
Ochtertyre. In the former Statistical Account it is stated that 
the register of St Andrews informs us, " that Kenneth was slain at 
Moieghvard, in 1001 and that the spot where he died is point- 
ed at in the line of our oldest chronicles : 

" Quo truncatus erat, Bardorum campus habetur." 

The highest neighbouring mountain, which overlooks the plain 
of Monivaird, is called Cairn-chainachan, or " Kenneth's cairn," 
— a name probably derived from this event. 

The residence of a princely family, long highly distinguished 
in the annals of early Scottish history, the Malises or Grahams, 
Earls of Strathearn, wassituated in the parish of Monivaird. 
Their castle was raised on the summit of Tom-a-chastel, or castle- 
hill, — a position at onee commanding the most romantic prospects, 
and presenting the greatest capabilities of defence, in ages when 
the use of fire-arms was unknown. The foundations of this castle 
were still visible in 1832, when they were removed to make way 
for the erection of a monument to General Sir David Baird, to be 
afterwards noticed. According to tradition, this stronghold of the 
Earls of Strathearn was burnt down, and some noble ladies con- 
fined in it perished amid the flames. The burning of the castle 
seems certain, but who these sufferers were is a question of more 
difficult solution. There appears some ground to believe that one 
of them may have been Joanna, the daughter of Malise, Earl of 
Strathearn, and of the Princess of the Orkneys, and the wife of 

 Caledonia, Vol. i. p. 397, note i. 



MONIVAIRD AND STROWAN.

the Eavl de Warenne. Our old historians inform us, that this 
lady having, with many others, been guilty of treasonable practices 
against King Robert I., was, by the Black Parliament held at 
Scone, August 1320, condemned to perpetual imprisonment; and 
it has been conjectured, not without probability, that the dungeon- 
keep on Tom-a-chastel was the scene of her durance and miserable 
death. The tradition of the country favours this supposition ; and 
remains lately found among the ruins on the " Castle hill" seem 
to corroborate it. A native of the parish, who lately died at the 
age of eighty, informed the writer that, with a view to discover if 
the ruins of the " Earl's Castle" still concealed any relics of for- 
mer days, he proceeded, about the beginning of this century, to 
explore an excavation regarded as the dungeon; and after digging 
to a considerable depth, there discovered fragments of jars and 
pieces of metal, which appeared to have undergone the action of 
fire. 

In 1831, when preparations were making for the erection of 
Sir David Baird's monument on the site of the old castle, the 
workmen discovered the remains of an extensive edifice intermixed 
with a blackish mould, in which human bones frequently occurred, 
with stirrups, buckles, and other decayed fragments of ancient ar- 
mour. In the old dungeon-keep were found a quantity of black 
earth, apparently the debris of animal matter, a bracelet, a consi- 
derable portion of charcoal, and some human bones. When the 
traditions of the district are viewed in connection with these facts, 
it appears probable that Tom-a-chastel was not only the scene 
where the Earls of Strathearn dwelt in the season of their prospe- 
rity and power, but also the spot where the last of their race, the 
noble but worthless Joanna, the wife of De Warenne, expiated 
her treacherous practices against her king and country, and ended 
her unhappy days amid the burning ruins of the castle of her 
ancestors. 

The old church of Monivaird, on the site of which now stands 
the Mausoleum of the family of Ochtertyre, was, in 1511, during 
the reign of James IV., the scene of a bloody tragedy of the feu- 
dal times, in which the clans of the Murrays and the Drummonds 
were the actors. A feud having obtained between these two clans, 
a party of the Murrays proceeded to exact tithes and carry off 
spoil from the neighbouring lands of the Drummonds ; and having 
defeated their enemies at Cnoc-Mary, in the parish of Muthil, 

See Hailes's Annals, Vol. ii. p. 95; and Miss Porter's Scottish Chiefs.

and succeeded in their object, were returning in triumph to their 
homes. At this juncture, Duncan Campbell of Dunstaffnage, at- 
tended by a body of his followers, arrived from Argyleshire, bent 
on avenging the "death of his father-in-law, Drummond of Monzie, 
who, with his two sons, had recently before been killed by some 
of the Murrays. The Campbells and Drummonds united their 
respective parties, and the Murrays being now out-numbered, were 
in their turn forced to retreat, and take refuge within the walls of 
the church of Monivaird. There, for a time, they eluded the 
search of "the avengers;" and the Master of Drummond was at 
length about to give up the quest, when, unfortunately, one of the 
Murravs observing a Highlander within musket-shot of the church, 
and unable, even in such perilous circumstances, to restrain his 
thirst for blood, fired upon him, and thus at once attracted the 
notice of their pursuers, and increased their appetite for revenge. 
The sacredness of the place afforded no protection to its inmates, 
but for a while its natural advantages promised to stand them in 
better stead. To the summons of surrender the Murrays returned 
a haughty defiance, and for a time repelled all the assaults of 
their foes. At length the Drummonds, unable to draw them 
from their retreat, or to force its defences, called for fire, and in- 
stantly the heath-covered church was enveloped in flames. No 
quarter was given by the infuriated Drummonds, and all within 
the church perished on the spot. James IV. administered the 
laws of the kingdom too firmly and impartially to allow this bloody 
massacre to pass unpunished ; and William, the Master of Drum- 
mond, son of John, first Lord Drummoud, was immediately ap- 
prehended, and conveyed to Stirling, where he, with several of 
his followers, was tried, condemned, and beheaded. 

Families. From Knox's History of the Reformation it ap- 
pears that Colonel Campbell of Lawers commanded a regiment 
of Reformers, and contributed considerably by his good services 
to the success of the great cause of civil and religious liberty in 
Scotland. His successor was created Earl of Loudoun, having 

 According to our traditions, twenty- three men perished in this scene of outrage. 
In the Rev. Mr Porteous's account, it is more generally stated, that " a great num- 
ber were burned to death;" while Sir Walter Scott, in the introduction to the " Le- 
gend of Montrose"  Waverley Novels, Vol. xv., makes the number " eight score of 
the Murrays, with their wives and children ;" and adds, that one of the Murrays 
was permitted to escape from the burning kirk by a Drummond, upon whom he had 
formerly conferred a favour. The fact of such a scene having occurred on this spot 
is beyond a doubt. In 1809, on laying the foundation of the mausoleum on the site 
of the old " heath-covered kirk," a quantity of charred wood was found, supposed to 
be the remains of part of the timber burned in 1511.

married the Countess and heiress of Loudoun, and Chancellor 
of Scotland. His brother, -who succeeded to the estate, raised a 
regiment during the civil wars, encountered the Protector at In- 
verkeithing, but was signally defeated. In the history of the son 
of this last-mentioned individual, we find another incident strik- 
ingly illustrative of the character of the times. Dwelling on the 
borders of the Highlands, he was appointed to the command of a 
company of soldiers, and invested with authority to restrain the 
freebooters of the surrounding district, or to bring the refractory 
to justice. In the discharge of his commission he apprehended 
a number of the Macgregors, who were subsequently executed. 
This roused against him the vengeful passions of the clan, and 
they resolved to accomplish his destruction. They accordingly 
assailed the house of Lawers by night, forced their way to his 
bed-chamber, and were about to put him to death there even in 
the presence of his lady. With difficulty they were prevailed 
upon to allow him time to commend himself to God, by offering 
up prayer in the chapel adjoining ere they took his life. On 
their way thither, he employed his time so well, and appealed so 
successfully to their love of gain, which they were as eager to 
gratify as their revenge, that they agreed to spare his life on con- 
dition of his paying a ransom of 10,000 merks on the following 
Monday, at a tavern in the neighbourhood. Faithful to his agree- 
ment, Lawers proceeded to raise the sum,— no inconsiderable 
amount at the time;— the greatest part was collected in halfpence, 
and carried on horseback to the place appointed. But whilst he 
thus fulfilled the letter of his covenant, he also performed more 
than he had promised, or his captors expected. While the 
money was being paid, a troop of military surrounded the house, • 
and made the freebooters with their chieftain, Captain Oig Mac- 
gregor, prisoners. Perhaps profiting by the example of ingenuity 
lately exhibited, they offered a ransom in their turn j if so, their 
captor, profiting also by the experience of the past, resolved to 
trust no longer to their tender mercies, but conveyed them to 
Edinburgh, where they were condemned and publicly executed. 

The Ochtertyre family is the oldest resident in these parishes. 
The founder of the family was Patrick, third son of Sir David 
Murray, sixth Baron of Tullibardine, ancestor of the Athole fa- 
mily, who died in 1476. The present Sir W. Keith Murray is the 
fourteenth in the line of descent from the founder ; and it is a 
singular fact, that throughout the thirteen preceding generation,

the father has been regularly succeeded by his eldest son, without 
any collateral descent; and of the fourteen, the first four heads 
of the family were Patrick and David alternately, and the re- 
maining- ten have been Patrick and William alternately. 

The late Honourable Sir Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre, Bart., 
was born in the year 1771, was twice elected to represent the 
city of Edinburgh in Parliament; was appointed, in 1810, Se- 
cretary to the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India ; 
and, from 1820 to 1837, discharged the duties of a Baron of the 
Exchequer Court in Scotland. While his talents and attainments 
enabled him to hold these public offices with advantage to the 
community, and with honour, to himself, it was especially in the 
character of a country gentleman that Sir P. Murray shone con- 
spicuous. There his active and intelligent mind sought and found 
full scope for its exercise; and the judgment and taste with which 
he improved and adorned his own property— the attention which 
he bestowed on all the public interests of the neighbourhood— and 
the kindly and highly honourable feelings with which he dis- 
charged the public duties of his situation, will long perpetuate 
his name, and preserve the remembrance of his worth in the dis- 
trict in which he lived. To him, chiefly, Perthshire is indebted 
for many of the splendid lines of road which now intersect and 
adorn its rugged and formerly inaccessible districts, and to his 
example mus in no small degree, be traced the rise of that spirit 
and taste with which the landed proprietors of the county have 
improved and embellished their domains. He closed his highly 
honourable and useful life on 1st June 1837. 
The Right Honourable Sif George Murray, brother of Sir P. Mur- 
- ray, was born at Ochtertyre in 1772, entered the army as an en- 
sign in 1788, rose rapidly, by his distinguished talents and bra- 
very, to the highest posts, and after having served in Europe, 
Africa, and America,— discharged various important diplomatic 
missions,— acted as Quartermaster- General to the English Army 
during the whole of the contest in the Peninsula and south of 
France, and been engaged in most of the eventful scenes and con- 
flicts of the last war, he obtained, at its close, the rank of Lieu- 
tenant- General in the British Army, and the order of a Knight 
of the Bath, in addition to many honours conferred upon him by 
foreign prince. Sir G. Murray then proceeded as Governor- 
General to Canada, and returning to Europe in July 1815, was 
appointed Chief of the General Staff of the Allied Army of Oc-

cupation in France, consisting of 150,000 men, commanded by 
the Duke of Wellington. In 1824, he was made Lieutenant- 
General of the Ordnance, and in 1825 was appointed to the chief 
command of the troops in Ireland. In May 1828, Sir G. Mur- 
ray was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonial Depart- 
ment, with a seat in the Cabinet, which offices he continued to 
hold till the resignation of the Duke of Wellington in 1830. He 
came again into office in 1834 with Sir R. Peel, as Master- Ge- 
neral of the Ordnance, retired with Sir R. Peel in 1835, and was 
again appointed Master- General of the Ordnance on the change 
of Ministry in 1841. He has been six times elected to represent 
the county of Perth in the House of Commons.

Parochial Registers.— Up to 1835, the parochial registers con- 
sist of six volumes, commencing with September 9th 1685, but 
are not very perfect. Money transactions, proclamations, and 
baptisms, with occasional minutes of discipline, are all blended to- 
gether. Separate registers for baptisms, marriages, burials, money 
transactions, and minutes of discipline, have been regularly kept 
since 1835. 

Antiquities — Several Roman antiquities have been found in 
these parishes, as might be expected from their vicinity to the sta- 
tions of the Roman camps at Ardoch, Dalginross, and Strageath. 
In 1783, a bronze vessel, resembling a coffee-pot in shape, was 
found near a spring called St Serf's in the plain of Monivaird. 
In 1805, a bronze head of a spear was raised from the lake of 
Ochtertyre; and in 1808, three similar heads of spears were 
found near the new church of Monivaird. All these pieces are 
undoubtedly Roman relics, and are in the possession of Sir W 
Keith Murray, Bart.

PERTHSHIRE. 



In the year 17—, there was found, about one hundredyards to 
the westward of the old church of Monivaird, a barrow contain- 
ing a stone-coffin, in which were inclosed two coarse earthen urns, 
the one filled with burnt bones, the other containing the bones of 
the head. Of these, the under jaw-bone and the teeth were 
very entire. In the stone-coffin was also found a stone-hatchet, 
bluish-coloured, very hard, about four inches long, and of a trian- 
gular shape,—a remain which proves the barrow of very remote 
antiquity— prior to the use of iron. The stone-hatchet is pre- 
served at Ochtertyre. A barrow was discovered some years ago 
ai Balmuicks, on the estate of Lawers, at the north-west extre- 
mity of the parish, but has never been opened or examined. 

Throughout the parish several other barrows have been found, 
but they have been removed for the purpose of building stone 
fences, and no memorial now remains of the illustrious dead whom 

they once covered. 

A cross, bearing the initials of Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaio- 
rum, still stands, a little to the south-west of the present mansion- 
house of Strovvan, on a spot where the market of Strowan was 
formerly held. The ruins of an old chapel are still discernible to 
the south of the house of Lawers. 

The most remarkable ruin presently existing in these parishes 
is an old castle, situated on the north of the Loch of Monivaird, 
on a peninsula, which, being separated from the mainland by a 
very narrow isthmus, must in former times have been often con- 
verted into an island, and approached only by a drawbridge, for 
the purposes of strength and security. The building, which is 
now reduced to a square tower of about 17 by 18 feet within walls, 
had formerly been more extensive. The walls are about five or 
six feet in thickness, and still hard as adamant. There is a vague 
tradition that this castle belonged to the Red Cumin, Bruce's an- 
tagonist and rival for the throne of Scotland. And in the charter 
by which the lands of Ochtertyre came into the family of the pre- 
sent proprietor, and which is dated 1467, it receives the appella- 
tion of antiquum fortalicium, from which it appears, that, even at 
the distance of 400 years, it was regarded as an old building. 
The proper name of 'it is Castle Cluggy. Sir William Murray, 
first Baronet of Ochtertyre, inhabited this castle for some time 
about 1650, during the usurpation of Cromwell ; and the spot on 
which it stood, then received the name of the Dry Isle. In the 
lake of Ochtertyre, about 80 yards distant from the Dry Isle, is 



MONIVAIRD AND STROWAN. 



741 



an artificial island, formed of stones, supported by oak trees, which 
tradition represents to have been a sort of prison attached to the 
castle. 

Modern Buildings. — Ochtertyre, the residence of Sir William 
Keith Murray, Bart, is a modern structure, most delightfully si- 
tuated on a richly wooded terrace sloping southward to the banks 
of the lake, and, from position and prospect, is one of the finest 
sites in the country. The views from various neighbouring points 
are exceedingly interesting and rich. The mausoleum of the fa- 
mily of Ochtertyre is an elegant Gothic building, with stained- 
glass windows, erected on the site of the old church of Monivaird. 

Lowers, the seat of Mrs Robertson Williamson, is also a very 
beautiful and romantic residence, surrounded with very fine wood, 
and having in the distance a great resemblance to an Italian cas- 
tellated villa. A magnificent avenue of old trees stretches to the 
distance of a mile directly in front of the house and lawn. 

Strowan, the residence of T. Graham Stirling, Esq. and Cla- 
thick, the mansion of W. L. Colquhoun, Esq. are modern and com- 
modious buildings, erected on very pleasing sites. 

One of the most interesting structures in this scene, especially 
arresting the attention, from its own elegance and the romantic 
beauty of its site, as well as from the varied ancient and modern as- 
sociations connected with the spot, is the monument recently erect- 
ed on Tom-a-ehastel to the memory of General Sir David Baird, 
late of Ferntower, Bart., the Hero of Seringapatam. This monu- 
ment is an obelisk built of beautiful Aberdeen granite, some of the 
stones weighing five tons. It is 82 feet 4 inches in height, and is 
an exact fac- simile of, and of the same dimensions with, Cleopat ra's 
needle, — most fitting model for the monument of the gallant Sol- 
dier, who was the first with an European army to ascend the Red 
Sea, cross the Desart, descend the Nile, and display the united 
standards of Britain and Brama on the shores of Alexandria. 

III. — Population. 

The population of these united parishes in 1755 amounted to 1460 

1793, . 1025 
1833, . 610" 

From this statement it appears that the population has decreas- 
ed upwards of one-half during the last eighty years. Between 
1755 and 1793, a space of thirty-eight years, the decrease was 
435; between 1793 and 1833, a space of forty years, the de-

crease was 415, exhibiting a total decrease of 850 from 1755 to 
1833, or during seventy-eight years. This extraordinary de- 
crease of population is to be ascribed, in a great measure, to thc- 
extent to which the practice of consolidating the pendicles of cot- 
tars and small farms into larger ones, has prevailed in these as in 
many other parishes, during that period. 

There are in these parishes only two small hamlets, each con- 
taining about half a dozen houses, and the rest of the population 
is considerably scattered.

the yearly value of upwards of L.50, being the heritors previously 
mentioned, of whom, the four principal, the proprietors of Ochter- 
tyre, Lawers, Strowan and Clathick, reside in the parish.

Bents, Wages, fyc. — The average rent of arable land per acre is 
about L.l, 15s. ; grazing an ox for summer, L. 2, 2s., for winter, 
18s., for a whole year, L. 3; cow for summer, L.2, 10s., for win-

Live-stock.— Horses.— About thirty or forty years ago, the de- 
scription of horses reared and used in the district consisted of what 
were provincially styled garrons, being introduced from the North 
or West Highlands, and were supposed to have been originally a 
cross breed betwixt the Spanish Jennet, numbers of which were 
cast on the shores of Britain upon the dispersion of the Spanish 
Armada, and the Scotch pony. They were not very handsome, 
being long eared, and long shanked, in proportion to the size of 
the body, but were reckoned very hardy animals. Within the last 
twenty-five years, the breed of agricultural horses in particular has 
been very much improved, — attributable principally to the laudable 
spirit of emulation introduced in consequence of premiums distri- 
buted yearly by the Strathearn Agricultural Society, instituted 
on 20th November 1809, by the late Sir P. Murray, Bart. The 
Clydesdale breed is now the favourite horse for agricultural pur- 
poses. 

The common breed of sheep in this parish is the black-faced or 
mountain sheep. In gentlemen's inclosures, there is also the 
Leicester breed. In the hill district, Highland cattle are found ; 
in low grounds, crosses from the Teeswater, short-horned, and 
Ayrshire breeds. 

Husbandry. — The general rotation in husbandry is the follow- 
ing : at first breaking up from lea, oats are sown for one, or occa- 
sionally two years ; then turnips or potatoes drilled ; next white 
crop with grass seeds ; then a crop of hay ; and the two following 
years, pasture. Sometimes when the land has remained in pas- 
ture for fifteen or twenty years, two or more crops of oats are taken 
in succession after the lea is broken up. The kinds of turnips 
cultivated here are chiefly the yellow, a proportion of the white 
globe being also sown to be first consumed, as they do not stand 
the frost well. The potatoes cultivated are chiefly the red, but 
buffs are also becoming common, and a new species of American 
white is now in much request. The grains usually sown, accord- 
ing to the quality of the soil — if best, potato or Flemish oats ; — 



744 



PERTHSHIRE. 



if elayish, generally Angus-shire oats ; and if very inferior, Irish 
oats. The English barley is generally sown. 

Draining has been carried on to a considerable extent, but em- 
bankment might still be prosecuted in the western district of the 
parish to much advantage. The state of farm buildings and en- 
closures has extremely improved within the last thirty or forty 
vears : but there is still considerable room for further advances in 
these respects, in some parts of the parish. The general duration 
of leases is nineteen years. On the whole, these parishes are in a 
very thriving state as regards agricultural interests and operations, 
and this must certainly be ascribed in a great degree to the en- 
couragement afforded, and the example exhibited by the landed 
proprietors of the district. 

Quarries. — There is one quarry of excellent gray freestone, 
not, however, easily wrought, but admitting a fine polish. There 
are several other quarries of freestone, but fit only for rubble work. 
A slate quarry has been recently opened on Clathick property. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — There is no market-town or any village in these pa- 
rishes. But at Crieff there is a market held every Thursday, 
which is within half a mile of the east end of Monivaird; and an- 
other every Wednesday at Comrie, which is within a few hundred 
yards of the west end. 

Means of Communication. — Two excellent turnpike roads run 
through these parishes between Crieff and Comrie, each about 
six miles in length, the one line through Monivaird parish on the 
north side of the Earn, the other through Strowan parish, on the 
south side of the same river. No mail or stage-coaches travel on 
these roads. A runner carrying the mail passes every morning 
along the north line from Crieff to Comrie, and returns every af- 
ternoon. Two or three carriers also pass through, three or four 
times every week, on their way to or from Crieff, Perth, &amp;c. 
There are five or six stone bridges in these parishes, or connect- 
ing them with the adjoining, all of which, with the fences, are in 
good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Little is known regarding the ancient ec- 
clesiastical state of these parishes. During the prevalence of Po- 
pery in Scotland, it would appear that Monivaird and Strowan 
were separate and distinct parishes, as it is stated in the former 
Statistical Account that the Earl of Strathearn, in the beginning 
of the thirteenth century, made a grant of the Church of St Ser- 



M0N1VAIRD AND STROWAN. 



745 



vanus, or Serf of Moivard, to the monastery of Ihchaffray. 
Whereas, on the other hand, Keith, in his " History of the 
Church and State in Scotland" B. iii. App. p. 191, includes 
Strowan in the list of the parsonages or parochial churches in 
Scotland remaining unappropriated to bishops or religious houses 
at the time of the Reformation. The exact period at which Mo- 
nivaird and Strowan were united, is involved in obscurity, but it is 
evident, from the reports of the Commissioners of Teinds from 
1661 to 1673, that the union had taken place previous to the year 
1662. Each parish had its own church, in which Divine worship 
was observed every alternate Sabbath, and the communion dispens- 
ed every alternate year, until 1804, when a new church was erected 
in a central situation, equally convenient for both parishes. The 
population being considerably scattered, the majority are from one 
to two miles from the place of public worship, while very few in- 
dividuals are distant above three miles. The church is in good 
repair, and affords accommodation for 600 persons. All the sit- 
tings are free. It is a remarkable fact, that the incumbency of 
the two last ministers extended over the long period of 105 years ; 
the Rev. James Porteous having been ordained 4th August 1730, 
died 25th November 1780; the Rev. Colin Baxter, ordained 23d 
August 1781, died 5th January 1835. The present incumbent 
was ordained 9th June 1835. The manse is distant a quar- 
ter of a mile from the church 1837. It is an excellent and 
commodious house, and regarded as the best planned and finished 
manse in this district of the country. The glebe contains twelve 
acres, and is worth about L.0 a-year. The amount of the sti- 
pend is 16 chalders not quite fully realized, the teinds being ex- 
hausted, two-thirds meal, one-third barley, with L.32, 10s. 7|d. 
in money. 

There are no Dissenting or Seceding chapels in the parish. 

The number of families belonging to the Establishment is 128. 
In these there are 569 individuals of all ages. The number of 
Dissenting or Seceding families is 14; viz. 4 Episcopalian, in which 
there are 10 individuals; 10 Seceding, in which there are 31 in- 
dividuals. 

That the great body of the people is warmly attached to the 
Church of Scotland is clearly proved by the fact, that, when peti- 
tions in favour of Church Establishments were forwarded to Par- 
liament in 1835, every male person above the age of fourteen, with 
the exception of eleven, adhibited his signature. Divine service 
is generally well attended; and the average number of commit uh 



746 



PERTHSHIRE 



cants is about 300. A Parochial Church Association, having for 
its object the extension, defence, and reformation of the Church 
of Scotland, was formed in 1835. During the two last years, the 
period of the incumbency of the present minister, the congrega- 
tional collections for religious purposes amounted to L.58, 7s. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in these pa- 
rishes. The branches of instruction generally taught are, Eng- 
lish reading, writing, and arithmetic. The school and dwelling- 
houses are in good repair, and the teacher has the legal accom- 
modation. The salary is the maximum, L.34, 4s. 4d. The 
school-fees average about L.15, and the emoluments, arising from 
session clerkship, &amp;c. amount to about L.7 per annum. The ex- 
pense of education per quarter is, for English, 2s. 6d. ; writing 
and arithmetic, 4s. All the young betwixt six and fifteen 
years of age are taught to read and write. A considerable num- 
ber of individuals above that age may be unable to write ; but 
there are only two or three who cannot read. The school is si- 
tuated in the centre of the two parishes. The average attendance 
of children at school is about 40, — a very small proportion, which 
may be partly accounted for by the fact, that the most populous 
parts of the parish are adjacent to the schools in the neighbour- 
ing parishes. The people are generally alive to the benefits of 
education ; but it is to be regretted that the attendance of many 
of the children is not so very regular or long-continued as it ought 
to be. There is one Sabbath school in these parishes. 

Literature. — In 1831, a parochial library was begun to be form- 
ed, in which there are now upwards of 250 volumes, chiefly reli- 
gious works. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving regular parochial aid is 11, being at the rate of about 
one in 55 of the whole population. The average weekly allow- 
ance to each is about Is. Id. Besides these 8 persons receive 
occasional assistance. In 1837, the sum of L.72, 19s. 3d. was 
contributed for the relief of the poor, of which L.47, 19s. 3d. 
arose from church collections, proclamation and mortcloth dues, 
L.20 from legacies, and L.5 from interest on two sums, each of 
L.50, bequeathed to the poor by William Toshach, Esq. of Ja- 
maica, and Alexander Riddoch, Esq. merchant in Dundee, both 
natives of the parish of Monivaird. Unless in cases of extreme 
exigency, there is a reluctance to accept parochial aid. 

Fairs. — Three fairs were formerly held in Monivaird and 
Strowan ; but they are now transferred to Crieff. 



MONIVAIRD AND STROWAN.

Alekouses.—Unt\\ lately there were four public-houses in these 
parishes, but now only two exist ; and with these also we would 
cheerfully dispense, for in this as in most districts they have in 
various instances been the cause of great immorality and wretch- 
edness. 

Fuel Peats procured from the moss at Loch Turret are much 

used for fuel, the cart costing about 8s. or 4s. Goal is now also pretty 
generally burnt; but as it is conveyed from Bannockburn, a dis- 
tance of twenty-five mile, it is a very expensive fuel, the cwt. 
costing about Is. when brought thither. Barked oak is also not 
unfrequently used for fire-wood. 

Drawn up April 1838. 
Revised December 1842. 

Since the preceding Account was drawn up, this parish and 
neighbourhood have been visited by many smart shocks of earth- 
quake, originating in the adjacent parish of Comrie. These 
earthquakes were first felt about fifty years ago, when they are 
said to have been pretty violent ; but they seem subsequently to 
have become less alarming, until the autumn of 1839. At this 
time, however, they began again to be frequently felt, nearly 
twenty shocks being occasionally experienced in twenty-four hours. 
The most violent one happened about 10 o'clock on the evening 
of "23d October 1839. The shock seemed to pass along through 
the parish of Monivaird, from the north-west to the south-east. 
For a second or two, every house for miles around the village of 
Comrie was shaken from top to bottom ; and while the motion 
was passing away to the eastward, it was accompanied with a tre- 
mendous subterranean noise, like the roar of a hundred pieces of 
ordnance discharged at once, and gradually dying away in the 
distance. This earthquake was partially felt throughout a great 
part of Scotland, as far as Inverness, Dunbar, Berwick, and the 
banks of Lochawe. In this neighbourhood, it was very alarming. 
Several individuals fainted, and most of the inhabitants of the 
village of Comrie spent the whole night in the streets, or in the 
churches, which were very properly opened for prayer. Many 
stone-dikes were thrown down, walls of houses rent, and chimney 
stalks shattered, the stones being frequently shifted from their 
places, but no serious damage was sustained. The shocks have 
again diminished, both in frequency and violence, since the au- 
tumn of 1839.

STIRLING. 

THE REV. WILLIAM STODDART, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation. — This parish is situated on the western boundaries 
of the parishes of Gask and Trinity- Gask, and on the eastern of 
Crieff. It has Fowlis on the north, and part of Trinity-Gask on 
the south. The climate is rather wet and cold. 

Hydrography. — The only water or rivulet worth notice in the 
parish is the Pow, which, for a long way, is confined in a canal or 
cut dug to straighten its course nearly a century ago. This cut is 
about 24 feet in width, and 6 in depth. The Pow rises from 
the red moss about a mile eastward of the parish ; one part runs 
eastward, and empties itself into the river Almond, and the other 
part runs westward, and empties itself into the Erne at Innerpef- 
fray. The descent of the part that runs westward is so very 
gradual, that the water appears generally stagnant. The lands ad- 
jacent are low and flat ; which, with other circumstances, exposes 
them to frequent inundations. This would certainly have a ten- 
dency to enrich and fertilize the lands, could these floodings be 
kept under control. Embankments and sluices may to a very con- 
siderable extent, but cannot altogether, prevent the damage sus- 
tained by these floodings. At present, from the want of sufficient- 
ly high embankments, a very heavy loss is frequently sustained.

Mansion- Houses.— The only mansion-houses in the parish are 
those of Dollerie and Woodend. 

Antiquities— Abbey of Incheffray.— This religious house was 
founded in the year 1200 by Gilbert Earl of Strathearn, and his 
Countess Matilda. It was dedicated to the honour of God, the 
Virgin Mary, and John the Apostle and Evangelist. The site of 
this famous "abbey is on a small rising ground, which seems, from 
its situation and name, to have once been an island surrounded by 
the water of the Pow. In Latin, it is denominated Insula Missa- 
rum, which is said to be a literal translation of its common name, 
Inch-effray, for Inch-peffray, the Island of Masses, or the island 
where mass is said. It was endowed with many privileges and im- 
munities by David and Alexander, Kings of Scotland. The edi- 
fices of this abbey, which were once extensive, are now in ruins, 
and have, on several occasions, supplied abundance of stones for 
building houses and making roads in the neighbourhood. The 
few remains of this ancient abbey, with six or seven acres of land 
in the immediate vicinity, belong to the Earl of Kinnoul, who, in 
consequence of this comparatively small possession, is patron of 
about twelve parishes that formerly were attached to the abbey. 
Mauritius, abbot of this place, was present with Robert the Bruce 
at the battle of Bannockburn, and is reported to have had brought 
alontr with him the arm of St Fillan. This relic might, indeed, 
have given some encouragement to the superstitious ; but one arm 
of a brave Scotsman, fighting in earnest for the liberty of his coun- 
try, had more effect in obtaining that memorable victory than 
could have been produced by the innate virtue of all the relics of 
the dead that could have been collected. " James Drummond, a 
younger son of David Lord Drummond, and his lady, a daughter 
of William Lord Ruthven, was first styled Lord Inchafry, being 
Commendator of that Abbacy, and afterwards created Lord Mad- 
derty by King James VI. in the year 1607. He married Jean, 
daughter to Sir James Chisholme of Cromlicks, and with her got 
the lands of Innerpefry, which were her mother's portion, being 
heiress of Sir John Drummond of Innerpefry. He had, by his 
said lady, two sons, John Lord Madderty, and Sir James, the

Rent. — Average rent per acre, about L.l, 12s.; valued rent of 
the parish, L.3472, Is. 8d.; real rental of the parish, about 
L.4600. 

Draining is the most important agricultural improvement, which 
of late years has been carried on to a considerable extent in the 
parish. 

Agriculture is in as high a state of improvement as in the neigh- 
bouring parishes. The farms are in general of moderate size. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

A turnpike road now runs through the parish, and the paro- 
chial roads are in tolerably good condition. 

The village of Craig may now be said to be almost extinct, 
and in its place is substituted the new and thriving village of St 
David's, consisting of about thirteen or fourteen feus. At the 
village of St David's, there has also been erected, within the last 
seven years, by Lady Preston Baird, an elegant and commodious 
school and school -house, both highly ornamental and useful. 
The school was principally designed by her Ladyship for sewing 
and knitting, and children there also receive the first rudiments 
of education before they are able to attend the parochial school. 
The female teacher has from her Ladyship an annual salary of 
L.10, free house, and several other perquisites. This, if properly 
conducted, will be a most useful and efficient institution. The 
estate of Craig of Maderty, upon which St David's is built, the 
property of Lady Preston Baird, enjoys the peculiar privilege and 
advantage of having been erected, in 1626, into a free burgh of 
barony, by the late Lord John Maderty, in virtue of a charter 
under the Great Seal, which was ratified and confirmed in the 
Scottish Parliament. 



MADDEUTY. 



751 



By that charter, the privileges are extensive. It is declared 
thereby, that the said burgh shall have the haill privileges, com- 
modities, and immunities of a free burgh of barony ; italso 
gives special power to the proprietrix for choosing, constituting 
and creating bailies, burgesses, officers, sergeants, and haill other 
officers necessary within the burgh for the government thereof, 
and the said bailies and other officers are thereby authorized to 
elect yearly and empower as to them shall seem expedient, with 
full and special power also to the burgesses of the said burgh, 
present and to come, to peck and peat, and to buy and sell wine, 
wax, linen, and woollen cloths, broad and narrow, and all other 
merchandise and staple goods, and to have a weekly market every 
Friday, with four free fairs yearly. There have been, of late, 
courts held occasionally at the village of St David's, within the 
barony, for settling disputes which may arise in the barony, and 
also for the internal peace and good government thereof. 

Ecclesiastical State. — 100 families belong to the Established 
Church, and there are 13 or 14 Dissenting families. 

The stipend is 15 chalders, payable half in meal and half in 
barley. 

The extent of the glebe is about nine acres, value about L.13 
or L.14. The manse is at present in a tolerably good state of 
repair. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, and also a 
school for sewing and knitting, under the superintendence of a 
female. The parochial teacher's salary is the maximum. Probable 
amount of fees paid to parochial teacher, from L. 10 to L.12. 
The parochial teacher holds the situation of session-clerk, for 
which he receives a salary of L.3 ; and other perquisites therewith 
connected may amount to L.3. 

Savings'' Bank. — There is a savings' bank in the parish. For 
the last three years, the average sum deposited was L.43; sum 
withdrawn, L.90. 

Poor. — Average number receiving parochial aid, from 10 to 
12. The average annual amount of contributions for their relief 
from L.40 to L.50; whereof, from church collections, L.lOj 
from voluntary assessment, L.30 ; legacies, L.3 or L.4.

PRESBYTERY OF WEEM, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. DUNCAN DEWAR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — This parish derives its name from the district of coun- 
try in which the parish church is situated, being in the fertile and 
beautiful vale of Appin of Dull, or, as it is sometimes written in 
old records, " Apnadull." This term is evidently of Gaelic ori- 
gin, and may be thus analyzed, Abna daily " Abbot of the Plain," 
or, by transposition, Dail na h-Aha, may either mean " the Ab- 
bot's Plain," or " the Water's Plain," the obsolete ab signifying 
also water in Gaelic. That the former is the true derivation, there 
can be little or no doubt, from the recorded fact, that an abbey or 
monastery existed here, probably in the eleventh or twelfth cen- 
tury. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The quoad civilia boundaries of this 
parish extend from the parish of Crieff on the south to the parish 
of Blair in Athole on the north, — a distance of not less than thirty 
miles. But it is so completely intersected with other parishes, that 
its breadth is not proportionate, varying from four to twelve miles, 
and averaging about seven miles, so that its extent is about 210 
square miles, or 134,400 imperial acres, including roads, rivers, 
and lakes. It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Blair 
Athole and Moulin ; on the west by Fortingall, Weem, and Ken- 
more; on the south by Comrie, Crieff, and Monzie ; and on the 
east by the parishes of Foul is- Wester, Little Dunkeld, Weem, 
and Logierait ; and is situated between 56° 25' 20", and 56° 45' 
north latitude, and 3° 45' 15", and 4° 1' west longitude of Green- 
wich. 

Topography. — The general aspect of the parish is varied and 
uneven. A series of parallel hills, forming a part of the Gram- 
pian range, runs through its whole length and breadth from south- 
west to north-east, diminishing in height as they approach their 
eastern termination. Between these hills lie the valleys or straths 



DULL. 



753 



of Glenquaich, Appin, Foss, and Fincastle, each strath having its 
own respective river flowing gently or rapidly along; and its sides 
interspersed with cultivated, and in many places wooded braes, 
waving downwards in rich luxuriance to the plain below, or inter- 
sected by occasional deep and romantic ravines, through which the 
mountain torrents force their turbulent way to the principal and 
more gentle streams in the lower vales. 

Lying among the Grampians, and consisting, as we have said, 
of hill and dale, this parish comprehends scenery of every class of 
excellence, from the sublime and picturesque to the beautiful and 
comparatively champaign. By far the finest of its vales is Appin, 
of which Strathtay and Grandtully form a continuation. 

Some of the hilly ridges above-mentioned rise gradually from 
the base, others abruptly, with majestic boldness ; some are of a 
conical, others of an elliptical shape, while the whole is everywhere 
divided by deep gullys formed by innumerable brooks, or inter- 
spersed with swelling eminences, fine mossy levels, and sloping 
open dales, yielding pasture for numerous flocks of sheep and 
herds of cattle, as well as shelter and sustenance for game. The 
highest of these ridges is the middle one, rising from the vale of 
Appin towards the north, and separating it from that of Foss ; and 
the most elevated points within its range are, Schiehallion, partly 
in the parish of Fortingall, and Farragon, wholly in this parish,— 
the former rising to an elevation of 3,513, and the latter to 2,535 
feet above the level of the sea, from whose lofty summits the pro- 
spect, on a clear day, is various and extensive, though rather of a 
wild and mountainous character. The most imposing and pictu- 
resque view, however, in the whole parish, is from the top of the 
rock of Dull, immediately behind the manse. From this eminence, 
the eye of the spectator is gratified with every thing beautiful and 
sublime,— woods, waters, hills, edifices, and fertile fields. Imme- 
diately to the west is seen the contracted but rich vale of Fortin- 
gall, with its green sloping hills; to the south-west appears Loch- 
tay, as far as the promontory of Acharn, reclining in calm repose; 
the Bridge of Kenmore spanning the pellucid and new-born stream 
with its church nestling among the neighbouring trees ; and a little 
nearer the princely mansion of Taymouth, with its noble-wooded 
environs luxuriantly blooming with ever-varying vegetation ; to the 
east, again, the eye surveys Strathtay with its inclined banks taste- 
fully adorned with variegated plantations ; and beyond it the Braes 
of Tullymet and St Columba's farm are seen classically diversify-

ing the landscape, distinct as in a map ; while directly in the fore- 
ground the whole level expanse of the richly cultivated Appin is 
spread out before the eye like a well-watered garden, headed by 
the bluff-looking Hill of Drummond, having its southern base 
washed by the gentle Tay gliding between its sylvan banks, and its 
northern by the furious Lyon pouring down its rocky channel, un- 
til it joins the former meandering gently along the southern 
boundary of the vale below,— presenting an agricultural panorama, 
perhaps, without a parallel in the Highlands of Scotland. Con- 
trasted with this lowland scenery appear to the north-east the 
Sidlaw Hills facing the celebrated Hill of Birnam, proudly rising 
its head above its fellows in the south-east ; immediately in the 
north-west boundary of the parish the huge Schiehallion rears its 
lofty head, while the wild summits of the still loftier Benlawers 
rise upon the view to the west, and, stretching away in a long 
vista, the conical Benmore recedes gradually in the distant haze, 
furnishing a termination of awful grandeur to the scene. 

Caves.— High up the Cliff, and on the north-west side of the 
principal Fall of the Tummel, a gloomy cave, accessible only by 
clambering along the face of the impending rock, is pointed out 
where a party of the clan Alpin sought an asylum from the cruel 
persecutions to which they and their proscribed race were then 
continually exposed. Here, however, they enjoyed neither safety 
nor repose of any duration ere they were detected by some of 
their numerous and unrelenting pursuers, led hither by their blood- 
hounds. The unhappy outlaws defended for a time their rocky 
domicile, with their wonted fortitude, but, being at last overpower- 
ed by superior force, the remaining few, at one desperate effort, 
broke through their implacable foes, and, with amazing agility, 
sprung into a tree which overhung the lofty and giddy precipice. 
Thither their enraged persecutors had not the courage to follow 
them, but they instantly commenced to cut down the tree with 
their heavy claymores, and never ceased until they hurled both it 
and the unfortunate Macgregors into the gulf below. 

Meteorology. — The most marked trait in the meteorology of 
this parish, is the dense masses of fog or mist to which its straths 
are subject in spring and autumn, with the exception, perhaps, of 
Glenfincastle, which is considerably elevated above the bed of 
the river, and has no remarkable stream of its own to attract 
them. 

Climate.— While in the lower grounds of Appin, the crops are 



DULL. 



755 



ripe and secure as early as in any part of Midlothian, in Foss, 
Glenfincastle, and especially in Glenquaich again, they are gene- 
rally a fortnight, and, in backward seasons, sometimes a month 
later in being secured. In these districts, the comparative absence 
of plantations, the great masses of peat marshy soil which shed 
an unhappy influence over the arable land, and the greater ele- 
vation of the ground, in connection with the increased rarity and 
coldness of the atmosphere, combine to render the general aspect 
of the country bleaker and more barren, the winter frosts more in- 
tense, and the falls of snow heavier, and of longer continuance. 
As instances of longevity, it may be mentioned that there are at 
present living within four miles of the parish church, four indivi- 
duals, whose united ages amount to 364. A woman of the name 
of Lilias Clark died some years ago, at the advanced age of 107; 
and what is still more deserving of being recorded, a person well 
known in this part of the country by the appellation of the "Aber- 
berfeldy tinker," or the more gallant title of " the colonel," made 
his exit at the extraordinary age of 1 12, after having lived in three 
centuries, a term of life which few have been permitted to enjoy 
since the patriarchal age. 

Hydrography — Perennial springs everywhere abound through- 
out its numerous hills and dales. St Ninian's Well, situated at 
the back of the village of Dull, is said to have been much fre- 
quented at one time, by invalids both from far and near, on ac- 
count of the healing virtues supposed to be communicated to its 
otherwise salubrious waters, by the abbey's tutelary saint, whose 
name it bears : but this well's imaginary virtues have long since 
ceased, and with them its deluded votaries. 

Lochs. — There are no less than twenty- one lochs either situat- 
ed within this parish, or connected with it. Our limits, however, 
will only permit us to notice two or three of the most remarkable. 
Loch Fraochy lies in Glenquaich, the most southern district of 
this parish, and is partly also in the parish of Kenmore. It is about 
two and a half miles in length, and half a mile in breadth, and 
abounds in trouts, which, though small, are highly esteemed both 
for their colour and flavour, and afford excellent sport to the an- 
gler. The south bank is graced by a shooting-lodge, belonging 
to the noble proprietor, the Marquis of Breadalbane, skirted to the 
eastward with a few indigenous trees of birch and alder ; and ad- 
jacent to it, in the south-west corner of the lake, stands a small 
island, with a tuft of growing larches, famed in ancient Celtic son 



756 



PERTHSHIRE. 



as the scene of an interesting legend.  The rest of this valley 
has a bleak and sterile aspect, having little arable land, and less 
plantation. Its surface throughout is covered with marshy mea- 
dow soil, and chiefly adapted for pasture. But cold and exposed 
though it be, still in summer it is not devoid of natural beauty. 
On the one hand, the neighbouring mountains, in some places 
rising rocky, lofty, and precipitous, and in others, diversified with 
dells, passes and ravines, give a sort of rude grandeur to the sur- 
rounding scenery; while, on the other hand, the loch imparts a 
lively character to the bare and barren tract by which it is encom- 
passed at their base. There is now, at Amulree, a distance of 
little more than a mile from the east end of the lake, a new, hand- 
some, and commodious inn, much resorted to in summer and au- 
tumn by parties of pleasure from Crieff, Perth, and Dunkeld, 
partly on account of the salubrity of the climate, and partly to en- 
joy the fishing of Loch Fraochy. The accommodations are ex- 
cellent, and such as suit every class of society from the bustling 
statesman down to the humble cottager. 

Loch Ceannard is situated in the hill of Grandtully, about two 
miles to the south of the ancient baronial residence of the Grand- 
tully family, and, but for the assistance of art, would have rather 
an uninteresting appearance. It is nearly a mile in length, and 
about one-fourth of a mile in breadth, and is hemmed in upon all 
sides with bleak and barren mountains. Towards the middle of 
the loch there is an islet supporting the ruins of an ancient shoot- 
ing-lodge, formerly overshadowed by a few, but now decaying 
willows. It is all but surrounded with a belt of larch plantation, 
affording cover to numerous flocks of black game, and its north 
bank is beautified with a neat modern villa in the cottage style, 
altogether giving it a lively and cheerful aspect. It is in the vi- 
cinity of several other minor lochs, all of which abound with 
excellent trout, pike, or perch, and which tend not a little to give 
this spot of retirement and seclusion an additional charm in the 
estimation of the enthusiastic sportsman. 

By far the most picturesque and interesting of the whole is 

 The legend above alluded to is described in a beautiful poem entitled " Duan 
Fraoich," and published in " Gillies's Collection of Gaelic Songs." Its beauty at- 
tracted the notice of Mr Jerome Stone, a native of Fifeshire, but then schoolmaster 
of Dunkeld, by whom it was translated into English, and sent for publication to the 
editor of the Scots Magazine.

Loch Tummel. It is mostly situated within the quoad sacra pa- 
rish of Foss, now disjoined from this the original parish, and is 
also connected with the parish of Blair- Athole. It is about four 
miles in length, and one in breadth. Its lower end is gradually 
filling up with the alluvial deposits of its parent stream ; but ope - 
rations are in progress for clearing away the debris so accumulat- 
ing, whereby upwards of 200 acres of arable and meadow land will 
be very greatly improved. It is much frequented in winter by 
great numbers and variety of water fowls, but chiefly swans, where- 
of there were at one time in the winter of 1840 thirty-six, and a 
flock of twelve remained for nearly three months. Salmon occa- 
sionally get up into it; but the Fall at Fascally prevents them, 
excepting in certain states of the river. It abounds, however, 
with trout and pike, some of the former weighing fourteen pounds, 
while those of the latter have been known to weigh upwards of 
thirty pounds. Its shores throughout, beautifully diversified with 
woods and rocks, here presenting bold projecting promontories, 
and there long retiring bays, along with the noble outline of the 
surrounding rugged mountains, interspersed lowards their base with 
patches, of wild cultivation, form a picture of peculiar and surpassing 
beautv. Towards the north-west end of the lake, there is an ar- 
tificial island covered with wood, where the ruins of a castle are 
still to be seen, and which is said to be one of the many fastnesses 
of Robertson of Struan, the chief of the " Clan Donnachie;" and 
upon either side there is a good road, from which the surrounding 
scenery is seen under entirely different but ever-beautiful aspects. 

Rivers. — The principal rivers connected with the parish are, the 
Tay, the Lyon, the Quaich, the Tummel, and the Garry, besides 
a great number of mountain-streams which cannot be particular- 
ized. The Tay enters this parish two miles below Kenmore, and 
continues to meander along it for the space of ten miles, intersect- 
ing it in some parts, and forming the boundary line betwixt it and 
some of the adjoining parishes in other places. At some remote 
period, it had here altered its course in several places, ere it formed 
its present channel, and it still overflows its banks when flooded by 
westerly winds and rain, which is often the case, especially in win- 
ter. Upon these occasions, a great part of the valley of Appin ac- 
tually becomes a lake, so that the thoroughfare at Taybridge is, 
perhaps, interrupted for several days together. Generally speak- 
ing, however, it only averages from 250 to 300 feet in breadth, 
and from 2 to 14 feet in depth, and in this neighbourhood is in many

places easily forded. Its general velocity along Appin may be 
estimated at the rate of four miles an hour ; but after it passes 
Aberfeldy, its acceleration is increased by the greater declivity of 
the ground, and the roughness of its channel. At Logierait it 
takes a south-east direction, and passing Dunkeld, receives the 
Airdle, the Isla, the Almond, and various minor streams. Hav- 
ing passed Perth, it is joined by the Earn, its last great tributary, 
and forms a spacious estuary from two to three miles in breadth, 
which is partially contracted again at Dundee, but anon widens, 
and gradually expands into the bay of St Andrews and the Ger- 
man Ocean. 

The Lvon takes its rise from a loch of the same name in the 
parish of Fortingall, and, after having received great accessions on 
either side by innumerable streams and rivulets, enters this parish 
at Coshieville; when, after pouring in a south-easterly direction, 
and forming the march betwixt this parish and that of Weem on 
the south-west, it falls into the Tay at the east point of Drum- 
mond hill. In this part of the Lyon, fresh water mussels are to be 
found, as there are also in the Tummel. The Lyon mussels are 
highly prized for their pearls, some of which being as large as a 
common pea. 

The Quaich rises amongst the hills in the south of the parish 
of Kenmore. About eight miles from its source, it spreads out 
into Loch Fraochy, already described. On emerging thence it 
proceeds eastward to Amulree, where it turns towards the north- 
east, and assumes the name of the Bran. There its velocity con- 
siderably increases, and, pursuing its brawling course for eight 
miles along Strathbran, to which it gives name, and forming seve- 
ral cascades, discharges itself in the Tay. a short way below the 
village of Inver, in the environs of Dunkeld. 

The Tummel issues from Loch Rannoch, in the parish of Fort- 
ingall. The impetus of its waters is very variable. At its entrance 
into this parish, a short distance west of Tummel Bridge Inn, its 
course is rather rapid ; but ere it reaches Loch Tummel it be- 
comes almost stagnant, meandering amidst broad rich meadows, 
and forming many beautiful curves, in miniature intimately re- 
sembling the windings of the Forth below Stirling. Upon issuing 
from the lake, it becomes rapid and furious, rolling and tumbling 
through a rocky, narrow, wooded channel, until it mingles its wa- 
ters with the Garry, when it becomes more gentle and steady;

and, proceeding in a south-easterly course, falls into the Tay on 
its left bank, at the south-east extremity of Logierait. 

The Garry has its rise from a loch of that name in the parish 
of Blair- Athole. In its course it is greatly augmented by the 
Bruar, the Tilt, and other mountain torrents. Besides partially 
intersecting this parish, and forming the boundary line betwixt it- 
self and the former parish at Shierglass, it again wholly intersects 
the north-east corner of Dull, a little below the pass of Killiecran- 
kie, and, sweeping through it in a southerly direction, joins the 
Tummel in the neighbourhood of Fascally, amidst lovely and im- 
posing scenery. 

Cascades. — The cascades which chiefly claim attention are, the 
Falls of Keltnie, Camserny, Tummel, and Moness. The first of 
these is in the vicinity of Coshieville inn, and forms the march 
betwixt this parish and the adjoining parish of Fortingall on the 
west. The Keltnie here forms a series of beautiful cataracts, the 
highest of which issues from a dark narrow opening, and, precipi- 
tated in one foaming torrent over a pile of perpendicular rocks 
into the deep and gloomy dell below, makes a fall of sixty feet. 
There is a footpath leading to them on this side, from which they 
appear to better advantage ; and the traveller who rests at the inn, 
and is in search of the picturesque and beautiful, will find ample 
gratification and reward in visiting them. 

About half-wav between Coshieville and Weem is the Fall of 
Camserny. It is higher than the former, but more broken and 
tortuous, which, however, tends to give it an additional charm. 
As the tourist approaches Camserny bridge from the west, a beau- 
tiful, though somewhat distant, view is presented to his eye, on 
the left hand, of its foaming sinuosities struggling and dashing in 
milky whiteness over its precipitous and rugged channel, until it 
is swallowed up by the woody and rocky bank bounding it on either 
side. 

The principal fall of the Tummel is situated near its junction 
with the Garry. It is inferior to the two preceding falls in point 
of altitude, but superior as to the quantity of water and sublimity 
of scenery. The roaring of the waters, rushing forward with heed- 
less impetuosity, and falling over a height of about 18 feet, in one 
continued sheet of white foam, fills the visitor with admiration, not 
unmingled with awe. 

The Falls of Moness are situated in the vicinity of the populous 
village of Aberfeldy, and have been celebrated by Burns's lively

muse, and characterized by Pennant as an " epitome of every thing 
that can be admired in waterfalls." The ascent is from the vil- 
lage, where a guide may be obtained, and romantic walks have 
been formed and seats erected, at every little interval, for the use 
and convenience of travellers. That the prospect may increase 
in interest and leave a deeper impression, the tourist should ascend 
by the west side, and return by the east side of the falls. On as- 
cending half-way up the dell, he comes to a scene of a very im- 
posing and picturesque character. A rugged precipice discovering 
here and there a naked crag, but mostly covered with coppice, 
weeping birches, and mountain ash, rears itself on his left ; and 
there is rising majestically towards his right hand a lofty, perpen- 
dicular, and larch-crowned rock, threatening destruction to those 
who approach its summit, having its bold front covered over with 
hoary lichens, and its crevices nestled with daws, wood-pigeons, 
and numerous flocks of other smaller birds ; while directly in the 
foreground, and over the thicket, there is an enchanting peep of 
the principal fall, fearlessly shooting forth from its dark lowering 
chasm in one impetuous torrent of foam, and immediately losing 
itself in the wood- covered abyss below. While advancing thence 
along the sylvan but giddy precipice, through which he hears the 
water rolling and tumbling far beneath, the rustic bridge thrown 
across the upper fall bursts all at once upon his view, whence the 
fall is seen to great advantage. If he would escape, however, be- 
ing drenched with showers of the dashing waters, let him hasten 
thence to a seat on the opposite bank, from which it appears to still 
greater advantage, and in a character of beauty and grandeur 
which it is unnecessary here to describe. Leaving this lovely 
spot, the traveller now wends his way downwards, and descends, 
not without difficulty, by a zig-zag path, railed at its farthest ex- 
tremity for the security and protection of the lover of the wild and 
romantic, into the bottom of the dell below, which he no sooner 
enters, under an overhanging cliff, than the principal fall bewilders 
and astonishes him with all its loveliness and grandeur. Far up 
the rocky den the water gushes out furiously from its gloomy con- 
tracted channel, and reels, and foams, and roars from precipice to 
precipice, now concealed by a projecting rock, and now flashing 
upon the sight, until at last its strength is quite exhausted, when, 
after enjoying a moment's breathing and again recruiting its fury, 
on a sudden it bolts with the thunder's distant roar into a black, 
narrow, and rock-bound chasm, where it swiftly glides out of sight.

Whichever way the spectator turns, nothing meets his enraptured 
view but the foaming torrent, in connection with overhanging woods 
and moss-covered rocks, rising on either side to the height of 300 
feet, supporting over-head a small speck of the blue-vaulted sky, 
and producing a dark and gloomy aspect even at noon-day. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks of this parish, like those 
of the Grampians generally, consist chiefly of mica-slate, occa- 
sionally interspersed with quartz, granite, chlorite, and hornblende 
slate, and, where stratified, the general direction appears to be from 
the south-west to the north-east ; but, from the various nature of the 
stratification, and the different degrees of disintegration it has un- 
dergone, the dip is so very unequal in different places, that it is very 
difficult, if not impossible, to state precisely the general angle. 
Boulders of whinstone, granite, and gneiss occur in almost every 
district of the parish, and are used by the inhabitants for the purpose 
of fences and architecture, as well as for Macadamizing the public 
roads. In the district of Foss, particularly, rolled blocks of gra- 
nite appear in vast quantities, and are piled upon each other in 
masses of wild confusion. A stratum of the same kind of rock, of 
which Taymouth Castle is built, and which is said to approximate 
" in character to chlorite and talc slate," occurs upon the Aird of 
Appin, immediately opposite to the quarry at Bolfracks, where 
most of the materials used in constructing that noble mansion were 
obtained. There are indications of slate at the base of Schiehal- 
lion, but its quality has not hitherto been ascertained, as no at- 
tempt has been made at working it. But by far the most import- 
ant rock in this parish, for economical purposes, is limestone. It 
occurs in the form of a bed, traversing the parish in a south- 
westerly direction, and appearing at intervals in different places 
of the adjacent districts. At Tomphobuil there is a limestone 
quarry, evidently situated in the bed of limestone which ranges 
through the parish. Marl, in small quantities, occurs in se- 
veral districts of the parish ; and, a little to the eastward of 
the village of Dull, a pit was opened at no distant period, whence 
it was dug and used by the inhabitants for manuring their farms; 
but the bed discovered was of such inconsiderable depth that 
it was soon exhausted. Small bivalve and spiral shells were here 
found intermingled with the marl. These, together with oak, fir, 
birch, and other indigenous trees found in the mosses with which 
our hills are replete, and occasionally deers' antlers, are the only 
organic remains generally discovered in this part of the countrv. 



162 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Hitherto no mines of any kind have been discovered. At one 
time, it was thought that a coal seam existed in the vicinity of the 
above limestone quarry, and such were the prospects held out to Sir 
Niel Menzies, the proprietor, of finding it, that he was induced to 
let the quarry to a practical miner, with the view of ultimately bor- 
ing for that useful mineral ; but somehow or other the attempt 
was never made. 

Soil. — In some places, it consists of a mixture of clay and 
loam, and in other places it is light and gravelly. In some dis- 
ricts, it partakes of a wet mossy nature, and in other districts, 
again, it consists chiefly of a thin mould, or a brownish loam 
mixed with sand. This last kind of soil predominates in the 
lower grounds of Appin, and is, in many places, incumbent upon 
coarse porous gravel and boulders of stone, evidently rounded 
and smoothed by the action of water. 

Woods. — A great part of the surface of this parish is beauti- 
fully diversified with clumps of trees, both natural and planted. 
The indigenous woods consist chiefly of birch, interspersed with 
oak, ash, hazel, willow, alder, and mountain-ash ; while the plan- 
tations are composed of beech, ash, plane, elm, oak, Scotch fir, 
spruce, and particularly larch. The former predominate in the 
district of Foss, especially on the north side of the river Tummel, 
towards Bonskeid, Fincastle, and the Pass of Killicrankie. Here 
indigenous birch constitutes almost the only wood. " So large 
and so perfect are these trees," says Dr M'Culloch, " that where 
they form continuous woods their effect on the landscape is equal 
in richness to that of oak forest, round, full, and swelling, and, 
from the shape of the land, thrown into broad masses of endless 
variety; while, where they are disposed in groups or in scattered 
clumps, or where they stand as solitary trees, their effects are even 
more beautiful, more airy, and more in character with that general 
lightness which here, as at Loch Catrine, forms so essential apart 
of the effect of the scenery." The clumps of planted wood seem 
to be well adapted to the soil, and are generally in a thriving con- 
dition, although they have not attained to any remarkable size or 
maturity, none of them exceeding seventy or eighty years of age, 
with the exception of numerous ancient standards of oak, ash, elm, 
plane, and beech, which are scattered in greater or less numbers 
and variety over the parish, many of which are much admired for

their size and symmetry, and all of which greatly add to the beauty 
of the general landscape. The largest of these known to the 
writer hereof are to be seen in the vicinity of Grandtully Castle, 
Moness House, and in the plain of Appin. In the lawn at Moness 
House, we meet with trees of the following girths at two feet from 
the ground : ash, 15 feet ; cedar of Lebanon, 13 feet ; larch, 11 
feet ; poplar, 9 feet. Some of these splendid trees may be seen 
towering above their less noted, but still magnificent, compeers of 
the forest, and raising their lofty heads to the height of 100 feet. 
Towards the east of Camserny Bridge, in Appin, there are three 
elms whose circumferences at two feet from the ground measure 
respectively 14 feet, 13 feet, and 1 1 feet. These trees are planted 
upon the south side of the road, in a line with the hedge, and, if 
coeval with it, cannot greatly exceed 100 years of age, as a person, 
who only died last year, recollected when the hedge was quite 
young, and guarded by a fence on either side. And last, though 
not least worthy of being noticed, are two golden willows in the 
manse garden. These beautiful willows were brought from Bol- 
fracks, as a riding switch, by the late incumbent, about thirty-six 
years ago ; and their respective girths at the same height with the 
above now measure 8 feet and 7 feet. The elms and willows are 
planted in soils equally congenial to the nature of both, and, if the age 
of the former be accurately ascertained, the mean annual growth of 
the willow will be found to correspond with that of the elm as 2 to 
1 nearly. The only kind of wood hitherto planted which seems 
not to thrive in this parish, excepting in low and very favourable 
situations, is the Scotch fir. The rock of Dull is almost exclu- 
sively covered with it, which gives it a sombre and uninteresting 
aspect in summer; but in winter, again, it has quite the appear- 
ance of an oasis amidst the bleak and leafless forests by which it 
is surrounded.

Land-owners. — There is no district, perhaps, in the Highlands 
of Perthshire where the tenure of property is so fluctuating as in 
this parish. In corroboration of this, it is sufficient to observe, 
that no fewer than thirteen estates, belonging thereto either in 
whole or in part, have passed by purchase into the hands of diffe- 
rent proprietors during the last fifty years. The following list com- 
prehends the names of the present land -owners connected with 
the parish, and the valuations of their respective properties situat- 
ed within the same :

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers consist of six vo- 
lumes, two of which contain entries of baptisms and proclamations 
of marriage banns, — other two, cases of church discipline, — and 
the remaining two exhibit transactions relative to the poor, and 
economics of the parish. The earliest entry is made in the year 
1703, during the incumbency of the Rev. John M'Kerchar, who 
appears to be a greater observer of discipline than of book-keep- 
ing. At that period, registration of births and marriage banns 
may not unfrequently be seen intermingled with minutes of ses- 
sion recording the compearance of persons guilty of moral delin- 
quency before the congregation upon twelve, and sometimes more, 
consecutive Sabbaths previously to their being absolved from scan- 
dal. Besides being thus irregularly kept, intervals of time, aud 
that at different periods, were allowed to elapse without any entries 
whatever being made in the earlier registers ; but, in the more re- 
cent ones, these faults have been, in a great measure, avoided. 

Antiquities. — Abbey. — At what period this abbey was first esta- 
blished, we have now no means of accurately ascertaining. But it 
appears from Scottish history, that an Abthanedum was attached 
to it at a very early period. This peculiar appellation existed no- 
where but in Scotland; and even there we read of only three, the 
Abthaneries of Dull, Kirkmichael, and Madderty. These three 
Abthanedums, from the earliest period to which they can be 
traced, held of the Crown, and the monks of Dunkeld had ancient 
rights vested in all of them. Crinan, Abbot of Dunkeld, who 
married Beatrice, daughter of Malcolm II., and who gave a long 
line of kings to Scotland, is denominated by Fordun " Abthanus 
de Dull ac Seneschallus insularum." But as the term Abthane 
is not so much a distinctive title as a modification of thane, which 
was only introduced into Scotland along with the Saxon policy, 
the title could not exist in the time of Crinan, but must have ori- 
ginated at a later period, most probably in the reign of Edgar. 
This sovereign conferred upon his youngest brother, Ethelred, 
who was Abbot of Dunkeld, the three Abthanedums above-men- 
tioned, under the peculiar appellation of Abthaneries ; and as he 
was the only Abbot of royal blood, to whom such a munificent gift 

 Rigid in matters of discipline as Mr M'Kerchar certainly was, one of his succes- 
sors in office, Mr M'Lea, was still a greater disciplinarian. It appears from the re- 
gister of discipline, that during the latter 's incumbency, offenders often appeared in 
sackcloth before the congregation for twenty-four consecutive Sabbaths ere they 
were absolved ; and, at one period, no less than three of the heritors made their com- 
pearance in a body, and were publicly and frequently reproved by the moderator for 
violating the seventh commandment of the decalogue. 



766

was appropriate, so these were the only Abthanedums in Scotland, 
and, at his death, they all reverted to the Crown. " This will 
likewise account," says Skene, " for the appellation given by For- 
dun to Crinan. At that period there was certainly no such title 
in Scotland; but it is equally certain that there were no char- 
ters ; and although Crinan had not the name, he may have been 
in fact the same thing. He was certainly Abbot of Dunkeld, and 
he may have likewise possessed that extensive territory, which, 
from the same circumstance, was afterwards called the Abthane- 
dum of Dull. Fordun certainly inspected the records of Dunkeld; 
and the circumstance can only be explained by supposing that 
Fordun may have seen the deed granting the Abthanedum of Dull 
to Ethelred, Abbot of Dunkeld, which would naturally state that 
it had been possessed by his proavus Crinan, and from which 
Fordun would conclude, that, as Crinan possessed the thing, he 
was also known by the name of ' Abthanus de Dull." 

The religious structure which thus gave the title of Abthane to 
a prince of the blood-royal of Scotland, we imagine to have been 
an abbey or monastery of a useful class of monks, being likely of 
the order of Tyronenses, who had here a college of industrious 
artisans, in which were to be found smiths, masons, joiners, &amp;c. 
This conjecture is not only borne out by the names of different lo- 
calities in and about the village of Dull, for which there existed 
no justifying cause from time immemorial, such as Sraid nan 
Gaibhnean, Sraid nan Clachairean, &amp;c. i. e. " the smith's street," 
" the mason's street," &amp;c. ; but there also existed, and still exists, 
a popular tradition in this country, that a college was established 
here at a very early period, but which was afterwards transferred 
to St Andrews, — a tradition which is so far founded upon fact that 
Hugh, Bishop of Dunkeld, granted the Monastery of Dull to the 
Priory of St Andrews by charter, upon condition of " Reditu vi- 
ginti solidorum qui nos et clericos nostros contingit de Abthania 
de Dull."f 

The church or chapel attached to this establishment was dedi- 
cated to St Ninians, the companion of St Columba, and one of 
the fathers of the Scottish Church, but there is not a vestige of 
it now to be seen. There is a heap of ruins in the field below 
Dull, which is said to be the remains of the abbey church, but 
whether it is that or the ruins of a pit or tolbooth which was

connected with the monastery, as was frequently the case in those 
times, is now entirely a matter of conjecture. The name of the 
locality tends to confirm the latter supposition, being still called 
Ach an Toll-bM, or the ; ' tolbooth's field." 

Dull had, and still has, what was then considered indispensable 
to all places of importance, a market cross. It is a tall time- 
worn stone, placed in a large round socket of the like material, 
and stands in the centre of the village. The most remarkable 
privilege attached to the monastery was, perhaps, connected with 
the erection of this obelisk or cross. A considerable part of the 
surrounding ground was constituted into a sanctuary, or sort of 
holy-rood, where debtors and offenders of all sorts were secured 
from molestation on fleeing to the above cross or its inviolable 
precincts, which were pointed out by three crosses of a somewhat 
similar description, — a large and two smaller ones, — running for 
half a mile in a direct line from south-west to north-east. The 
largest of these crosses was erected in the intermediate space be- 
twixt the other two, and the place where it is situated is still called 
Druimdiamhain, which is evidently a corruption of Druim an dion, 
" the centre of defence or safety." These ancient land-marks 
were, not many years ago, sacrilegiously removed, and, with a 
Goth-and- Vandal-like taste, erected to grace a neighbouring 
gateway; and now the only remaining evidence of the abbey's 
fallen greatness is the M Cross of Dull." 

Moat hills. — Towards the west end of the vale of Appin, and 
within half a mile of the junction of the Tay and Lyon, there 
are three apparently artificial mounds of earth, of a flattish conical 
shape, situated within a short distance of each other, and forming 
a quadrant of a circle. They are now covered with tall stately 
beech trees, which must have been planted long after the original 
purpose ceased for which the mounds were raised. 

Barrows or Tumuli. — It is recorded in ancient Scottish history, 
that in the eleventh or twelfth century, a keen contest took place 
betwixt the Fingalians and Picts, at the bridge of Keltnie in 
this parish, the former fiercely but vainly defending that pass 
against the inroads of the latter, by whom the last of Fingal's race 
was shortly afterwards killed. At the pass of Keltnie, according- 
ly, quite close to the present bridge, and on the south-east 
side thereof, there is a mound or hillock, now covered with 
birch and other indigenous trees, which, on the west side, has all 
the appearance of being artificial, and which still bears the traces

of a rampart or fortification illustrative of its name, being called 
" Tom an t-sdbhail" literally " the MM or mound of protection or 
safety" But this is not the only corroborative circumstance. In 
the winter of 1836, while Mr Menzies, the present innkeeper at 
Coshieville, was removing a large barrow of stones situated be- 
twixt his house and the river Lyon, and in the immediate vicinity 
of the scene of action already mentioned, the workmen discover- 
ed no less than ten or twelve sarcophagi above the ground and 
under the cairn, which was of a conical shape but flat in the top. 
They were composed of rough unhewn slabs of stone, set at right 
angles, and covered by a similar slab above. On the lid being 
removed, there were found in some of them urns of unerlazed argil- 
laceous substance containing black ashes, while the others con- 
tained ashes and pieces of bone, without any urns. In the conti- 
guous field, there are three or four other large barrows, but dif- 
ferently shaped from the former, being of an oblong form resem- 
bling the inverted hull of a ship. 

Forts. — The remains of several buildings of very great antiqui- 
ty are still to be seen in this district of country. These being of 
a circular form, are said by some to be of Danish origin, by others 
again they are ascribed to the Picts; and, from being generally 
within sight of each other, they are supposed to have been beacon 
or watch towers. It is evident, however, that some of them at 
least, from the art and labour bestowed upon them, could not 
have been mere watch-towers, but that they were built for strong- 
holds, and were probably constructed by the Caledonians, and 
used as places of defence and safety against the incursions of the 
Romans, when they penetrated into this part of the country under 
Agricola. The most remarkable of these buildings in this parish 
is in the wood above Moness House, and is called the Dun. It 
measures upwards of 50 yards in diameter within walls, and ap- 
pears to have been defended on all sides save the north-east, where 
the hill is very rugged and steep, with two concentric ramparts. 
On the south-west side, and close to the outer rampart or dike, 
there was a large artificial pond or well, which is now almost filled 
up with debris. The walls of the fort, which measured about six 
yards in thickness, and were built without either lime or mortar of 
any kind, were carried away several years ago, and appropriated to 
the building of a fence around the plantation with which the hill is 
covered, so that nothing beyond the vestiges of the foundation can 
now be traced of this ancient fortress. 



DULL.

Situated within sight of the above, on the north-east shoulder 
of Drummond Hill, and in the parish of Weem, is another for- 
tress, commanding an extensive prospect of the whole vale of Ap- 
pin, and part of Grandtully and Strathtay. But instead of being 
Circular as the former, it is in the form of a parallelogram, and is 
built upon the top of a rock measuring from 150 to 200 feet in 
height, so as to have its south and east sides naturally formed 
thereof. The wall on the west side measures about 60 yards in 
length, that on the north again is about 80 yards, and from near 
the east extremity thereof, another wall projects at an angle of 
about 30° towards the north-east, and as these sides were the most 
accessible, they were defended by trenchfes or some sort of an 
out-work, which can still be easily traced. There is a part of the 
building still standing, from which it appears that the stones were 
regularly coursed and banded. The walls are of similar thickness 
with those of the preceding, and like them too are void of either 
lime or mortar in the construction thereof. The principal access 
led from the north-east along the edge of the precipice, and it 
was covered on the north-west by the foresaid projecting wall. 
The rock forming the south and east sides of the garrison had its 
base defended by another rude but strongly built wall, through 
which a minor entrance led from the south to the fortress above. 

Druidical Temples. — The completest circle of this kind in this 
part of the country is to be seen in the park at Croftmoraig in 
this parish, a little to the east of the principal lodge leading to 
Taymouth Castle, and on the right hand as the traveller proceeds 
from Kenmore to Aberfeldy. Besides this, there are several 
standing stones to be met with in Appin, and elsewhere through 
the parish, both single and in groups ; but whether these are 
Druidical remains, or monuments of departed heroes, is now en- 
tirely a matter of conjecture. 

Mansion-Houses.— By far the most remarkable seat in the parish 
is Grandtully Castle, one of the family residences of an ancient 
branch of the Stewarts. It is a fine old baronial mansion. Un- 
til within these two years, its walls and turreted roof were mostly 
mantled over with ivy, but being found to have an injurious effect 
upon the building, it was pulled off, which greatly detracts from 
its former air of antiquity and grandeur. The other principal 
mansion-houses are those of Foss, Moness, Cluny, and Der- 
culich.

III. — Population. 

According to Dr Webster, the population of the original parish 

in 1775 amounted to . . . 4897 

15y former Statistical report, . . • 4676 

Bv Government census in 1811, . males, 2039, females, 2290 = 4329 

1821, . 2178 2330 = 4508 

1831, . 2225 23G5 = 4590 

1841, . 1806 2004 = 3810 

The above decrease is mostly owing to emigration, arising from 
the enlargement of farms. 

Besides the village of Dull, containing about 150 inhabitants, 
there are several other small ones, varying in population from 50 
to 1 40, and in the aggregate amounting to 860 ; but the only vil- 
lage of any note is Aberfeldy, and in that portion of it which be- 
longs to this parish, there is a population of 610 by last census. 
The rest of the population residing in the country amount to 
2190. 

The yearly average of births registered for the last seven years is, 66 
deaths, no register thereof kept.

There are eight families of independent fortune resident within 
the parish, of whom three are heritors and proprietors of land of 
the yearly value of L.50 and upwards. 

Although almost all the people can both speak and understand 
the English language, still the generality of them have a decided 
predilection for the Gaelic. This appears from the fact that it 
is the ordinary medium of their daily intercourse, but it nowhere 
appears so evident as during public worship in church on the Sab- 
bath. While the common classes are apparently indifferent and 
unconcerned during the English service, they are all eyes and at- 
tention during the Gaelic, and hanging with anxiety, as it were, 
on the lips of the preacher, thus indicating that it is by means of 
their vernacular tongue the voice of instruction can principally 
reach them " savingly and to profit."' 

The Highland garb, once the graceful costume of the peasantry, 
has fallen almost completely into desuetude ; and their once po- 
pular games and prevalent superstitions have vanished before the 
fairy wand of civilization. They enjoy an ordinary share of the 
comforts of life, and are apparently happy and contented with their 



DULL. 



771 



condition. To their superiors they are courteous and respectful ; 
in their intercourse with each other, social, peaceable, and friend- 
ly; and both kind and hospitable to strangers. With a few excep- 
tions, they are irreproachable in their moral character, sound in 
their religious principles, and regular and exemplary in their at- 
tendance upon the public ordinances of religion. 

IV. — Industry. 
By the Government census of 1841, there were 691 males 

employed in agriculture, including farmers, cottars, and farm-ser- 
vants ; and 282 males employed either in manufactures, retail 
trade, or in handicraft, masters and workmen included, viz. millers, 
8 ; bakers, 4 ; fleshers, 2 ; flax- dressers, 4 ; woollen-dyers, 4 ; 
hand-loom weavers, 44 ; stocking-weaver, 1 ; tailors, 34 ; shoe- 
makers, 35 ; saddlers, 2 ; masons, 27 ; slaters, 3 ; plasterers, 3 ; 
house- painters, 2 ; carpenters, 56 ; wheel-wrights, 3 ; turners, 3; 
coopers, 2 ; carriers, 3 ; blacksmiths, 18 ; coppersmiths, 2 ; 
shopkeepers, 12; hawkers, 6; clock|and watch-maker, I ; auc- 
tioneer and appraiser, 1 ; mole-catchers, 2.

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The parish contains about 
134,400 acres of standard imperial measure, which may be thus 
arranged : — 

Under cultivation or occasionally in tillage, say 8,500 imperial acres, 
pasture, . . 9,000 

meadow, . . 1,000 

wood, natural and planted, . 3,000 
moor and hill, . . 108,900 

roads, rivers, lakes, &amp;c. . 4,000 

134,400 

By dint of labour and considerable expense, about 600 acres 
might perhaps be reclaimed and brought under tillage ; but it is 
very doubtful if much more could be added to the cultivated land 
of the parish with a profitable application of capital, whether it 
were afterwards to be occasionally ploughed or permanently pas- 
tured. There are two pieces of undivided common in the parish. 
The one lies on the east shoulder of Schiehallion, and belono-s to 
the Marquis of Breadalbane, and Mr Garden Campbell of Troop; 
the other is the joint property of Mr Stewart of Derculich, and 
the neighbouring proprietors in the parish of Logierait. But their 



772 



PERTHSHIRE. 



extent is not known, as neither of them has ever been measured. 
The woods, both natural and planted, are carefully attended o, 
and regularly thinned. The thinnings are either given or sold to 
the tenants for their farm-steadings and implements of husbandry, 
and larch is purchased to a considerable extent, from the forests 
of Breadalbane, for sleepers to the rail- roads carrying on in the 
south. 

Husbandry.- The most approved method of husbandry is car- 
ried on in the district of Appin ; but in most of the other districts 
of the parish, the four rotation system is still adhered to. It must 
be admitted, however, that the patriotic efforts of the Highland 
Society have given a stimulus to agriculture all over the parish, 
perhaps unprecedented at any former period. These are now 
aided by other local Societies, so that, betwixt their united agency, 
and the facility and encouragement given by the heritors to every 
branch of agricultural improvement, not only the beautifying and 
fertilizing of the soil evince their beneficial effects, but also the 
rearing and symmetry of the cattle. 

Live-stock. — The principal stock of cattle reared is of the 
West Highland breed, with the exception of a few Ayrshires, in- 
troduced of late years for dairy use. On the lower grounds, there 
are some Cheviot or white-faced sheep kept, and a few Leicesters 
are there occasionally to be met with also ; but the common breed 
is of the black-faced kind, and to the rearing of these, as well as 
to the purity and improvement of the Highland cattk, the strictest 
attention is paid, particularly by graziers. Accordingly, their 
stock is of a superior description, and generally brings high prices. 
At sales effected within the last two years, on some of the prin- 
cipal farms in this neighbourhood, queys brought from L.16 to 
L.22 each ; and, on one farm, the wedder lambs are annually dis- 
posed of about Lammas, when they generally bring between 9s. 
and 10s. a-head. 

The average number and value of live-stock, young and old, 
■within the quoad civilia parish, may be thus stated, viz. 

Number of horses, say 770, at L.10 each, L. 7,700 
black-cattle, 4,600, at L.5, 23,000 
sheep, 18,160, at 12s. . 10,896 
swine, 650, at L.I, 10s. . 975 

L 42,571 

Bent, Sfc. In some districts, the arable land is let so low 

as 17s. per acre, and, in other districts, the same quantity 
brings about L.3 ; but the average rent per arable acre, of standard 
imperial measure, over the parish may be stated at L.l-jVlOs. It 



DULL. 



773 



may be proper to observe, that there is no separate rent laid upon 
the pasture, as it is commonly let with the arable ground ; but 
the hill grazing may perhaps be estimated at an average of Is. 6d. 
and in the inland or better sort of pasture, situated within the 
head dike, at 5s. 6d. per imperial acre. The summer grazing of 
a horse upon this latter sort of pasture is about L.2, 8s., and of a 
cow, L.I, 4s.; but their grazing in the hill or moor comes to 
little more than the half of these respective sums; and the annual 
grazing for a full-grown sheep is about 5s. Leases extend from 
seven to nineteen years' 1 duration. A great number of the small 
holders, however, have no leases, but are tenants at will, or occu- 
pants from year to year, which is alike disadvantageous to the te- 
nant, and unfavourable to improvement. 

Real Rental. — The real rental of the parish amounts in the 
aggregate to about L. 13,250. 

Prices of Implements of Husbandry, Sfc. — A full-mounted cart, 
with wheels and iron axletree, costs L.8 ; a pair of wooden har- 
rows, full-mounted, L.l, 5s.; a full-mounted wheelbarrow, 18s.; 
a peat-barrow, 8s. ; a full-mounted long cart, exclusive of wheels 
and axletree, L.3, 3s. ; an iron plough, full- mounted, L.4, 4s. ; 
a rood of mason work, containing 36 square yards, from 2 feet to 
2 feet 6 inches thick, exclusive of furnishing materials, about L.2; 
building dry stone dike of 5 feet high, 3s. per lineal rood ; drain- 
making varies, in proportion to depth and the nature of the ground, 
from 6d. to Is. per rood ; boring and blasting stones, including 
powder, costs 6d. per foot of three-fourths of an inch bore. Full- 
grown fir-wood is sold at Is. per cubic foot ; hard-wood, viz. oak, 
2s. 6d. ; ash and elm, Is. per do. ; sawing of fir-wood, at pit by 
hand-saw, costs 2s. per hundred feet ; larch, 2s. 6d. ; and hard- 
wood, 5s. per do. ; while again the price of sawing these at the 
mill is one-fourth less respectively. 

Prices of Provisions. — The price of provisions here as else- 
where, must necessarily vary according to the state of the market; 
but the current average price thereof may be thus stated : beef 
costs 6d. ; mutton, 7d. ; pork, 4d.; fresh butter, 8d. per lb. 
respectively; salted butter sells at 17s. per stone of 22 lbs. ; and 
cheese at 6s. per stone of same weight. Fowls bring Is. 2d. each ; 
eggs, 5d. per dozen ; quartern loaf costs 9d. ; oatmeal, per boll 
of 140 lbs., 19s.; barley-meal, per boll of same weight, 14s.; 
and potatoes, 5s. per old boll of four firlots or six bushels. 

Quarries — The only quarries of any consequence in the parish 



774 



PERTHSHIRE. 



are the lime quarry at Tomphobuil, and a sort of freestone quarry, 
of a bluish colour, upon the Aird of Appin. In order to accom- 
modate the tenants, the former is let at a nominal rent, and it 
supplies this and the neighbouring parishes with excellent lime, 
both for architectural and agricultural purposes ; and the latter 
furnished most of the hewn materials required by the recent ad- 
dition and improvements at Castle Menzies. 

Fisheries.— There are no fisheries in Dull, excepting what there 
is of salmon-fishing upon the river Tay, and that is retained by 
the heritors whose respective properties border therewith in their 
own hands. Of late years, they have been far from successful, in 
consequence, it is supposed, of the distance from the sea, and the 
many obstacles which the fish have to encounter in their progress 
thitherward. 

Raw Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce rais- 
ed in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, may be thus 
stated, viz. 

under oats, at 5 bolls of 6 bushel per acre, at 15s. 6d. per boll, L.8234 7 6 
2125 barley, do. at 18s. 6d. do. . 9828 2 6

Manufactures. — There was a carpet manufactory established 
some years ago at Camserney, by Sir Niel Menzies, Bart., a 
gentleman who deserves well of his country, and who cannot be 
too highly spoken of for his laudable and assiduous exertions in 
promoting every species of improvement connected with mecha- 
nics and agriculture. This manufactory has hitherto been attend- 
ed with considerable success. It affords employment to between 
20 and 30 hands, and has an annual consumption of about G00 
stones of wool. 

Situated near the above manufactory, and upon the same 
stream, there is a saw-mill, and a wheel- wright-mill, which has 
also a saw-mill conjoined therewith. At the former, a good deal 



DULL. 



775 



of wood is cut, and prepared for country use, as well as for 
barrel-staves and other cooper purposes ; and at the latter, besides 
wheel-making being carried on, quantities of bobbins are manu- 
factured ; and both bobbins and staves are regularly sent to the 
Dundee market, and other manufacturing towns. 

In addition to these, there is, at Aberfeldy, in this parish, a 
dye-mill, with carding and spinning machines. The woollen yarn 
here spun gives employment to a number of weavers, and the webs 
are afterwards dyed and milled, and then exposed for sale at the 
country fairs to the natives for wearing apparel. 

At the time of the former Statistical Account, linen yarn was 
spun to an extent more than sufficient to pay the rents ; but now 
this is almost wholly superseded by the manufacturing establish- 
ments of the south, so that scarcely any flax is either raised or 
spun, certainly not sufficient to meet the demands of home con- 
sumption. 

Distilleries. — Within the last fifteen years, there were three dis- 
tilleries in the district of Appin alone. The buildings were erect- 
ed, and all the necessary utensils and apparatus furnished and 
kept in repair, by Sir Niel Menzies, entirely at his own expense, 
for the sole accommodation of his tenants; but, owing to some 
mismanagement, they were not successful, and after a few years' ope- 
ration the buildings were either pulled down or converted to some 
other purpose. There are still two distilleries in active operation, 
and although not locally within the parish, they are yet intimately 
connected with it; in as much as more than two-thirds of the 
shareholders are parishioners of Dull. The one is situated at 
Blackhill, in the parish of Logierait, and the other at Pitilie 
Burn, in the parish of Weem. The former distills upwards of 
14,000 gallons of whisky, and pays about L.3080 of duty annual- 
ly ; and there are in the same space of time upwards of 6000 gal- 
lons distilled, and about L.1320 of duty paid by the latter. The 
spirit manufactured at these respective distilleries is universally 
prized for its fine flavour and superior quality, and is readily dis- 
posed of at the highest market price. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns. — The nearest market-towns, properly speaking, 
are Dunkeld, Perth, and Crieff, at the respective distances of 
nineteen, thirty-four, and twenty-six miles from the parish church. 
But all the necessaries and even some of the luxuries of life can 
be easily and moderately obtained by most of the parishioners at the 



776 



PERTHSHIRE. 



villages of Pitlochrie and Aberfeldy. The latter contains 2 sur- 
geons and laboratories ; 1 writer and notary-public; 1 printer, sta- 
tioner, and bookbinder ; 6 grocers; 4 haberdashers ; 2 clothiers or 
merchant tailors; 1 hardware and pottery retailer ; 2 bakers ; 2 
fleshers; 2 coppersmiths; 1 saddler; 2 dress-makers ; 3 milliners; 
2 female accoucheurs ; 3 shoemakers ; 1 sheriff-officer ; 1 consta- 
ble ; 2 appraisers and auctioneers ; I tallow-chandler ; 2 smiths ; 
and various other tradesmen and artisans. 

Means of Communication. — The parish is in the possession of 
ample and various means of communication. There is a regular 
post-office at Aberfeldy, through which the diligence, conveying the 
mail, and carrying three or four passengers, passes to and from Dun- 
keld everyday in the week, with the exception of Tuesday. From the 
same office, and upon the same days, the Dunkeld diligence runs 
through a detached district of this parish, on the south side of the 
Tay, to Kenmore, and another conveyance, of an inferior descrip- 
tion, but for similar purposes, branches off to the north, and passes 
through Appin to Fortingall, and both return the following morn- 
ing to Aberfeldy. The inhabitants of Glenquaich and neighbour- 
ing districts have their letters and parcels conveyed and dispatched 
four times a week by means of a runner betwixt Dunkeld and a 
sub-office stationed at Amulree ; and to accommodate the people 
of Foss and Fincastle, and places adjacent, a post-gig runs three 
times a-week to and from Pitlochrie, and another sub-office at 
Kinloch-rannoch. Besides the Dunkeld mail, a public coach was 
started, about three years ago, betwixt Dunkeld and Lochlomond, 
by some of the principal inn-keepers on that line of road, for the 
accommodation of tourists and travellers, and it still continues to 
run for three or four months in the summer. There are portions 
of three turnpike lines of road in the parish. Their aggregate 
length may be about thirty miles, having three toll-bars with- 
in the parish. On these roads, there are weekly carriers to 
and from Perth and Crieff. The rest of the parish is variously 
intersected with private roads. A bridge, however, is much wanted 
over the Lyon, to communicate with Kenmore. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the vil- 
lage of Dull. Considering the extent of the parish, the church 
could not have been placed originally, perhaps, in a more centri- 
cal situation ; but the inhabitants of several districts had to travel 
a great distance. Since that period, this has been, in a great 
measure remedied by the erection of additional places of worship. 



DULL. 



777 



The church is a long building, with a small belfry, and has a gal- 
lery at each end. The date of its erection is unknown. In 1840, 
it was completely gutted, and thoroughly floored and reseated, so 
that it is now, in a manner, comparatively comfortable. The area 
of the church is divided among the heritors in proportion to their 
respective valuations. It accommodates about 600 persons, and 
no seat-rents are exacted. 

A new and commodious manse, with a suitable range of offices, 
were this year built for the minister by the heritors, at an ex- 
pense of about L.940. 

Previous to the Reformation, the lands and immunities attached 
to the living of Dull were far superior to what they now are. It 
would appear that the then Popish vicar, a David Guthrie, wished 
to alienate, as was usual in the immediate prospect of the Refor- 
mation, the whole lands of his benefice, with the exception of what 
he considered a sufficient establishment for a minister of the pa- 
rish. Accordingly, in the year 1561, he granted a feu- right to 
George Johnston alias M'Gregor, and Janet Burgh, his spouse, 
and longest liver of them two, in liferent, and to the said George's 
heirs and assignees in fee, of all and singular the half of the kirk- 
lands of Dull, viz. " Omnes et singulas dimidietas terrarum ec-

date with the feu-right of the first half, the said David Guthrie 
vicar of Dull, with the consent of the commendator of the priory 
of St Andrews, granted another feu-right to Alexander Stewart, 
brother to Grandtully, and his spouse, of the other half of the 
said kirk-lands of Dull, viz. " Omnes et singulas dimidietates terra-

Such were the alienations suffered by, and the immunities re- 
served to, the benefice of Dull in 1561 ; and when an excambion 
had taken place during the incumbency of Mr Campbell in 1758, 
the same privileges were confirmed to the living by the deed of 
excambion betwixt the then Sir Robert Menzies of that Ilk and 
the presbytery. Accordingly, the minister still enjoys the privi- 
lege of casting peats, feal, and divot, and pasturing twelve soums 
of sheep or cattle over the church lands, in addition to the manse 
and glebe. The glebe contains about 11| acres, including site of 
manse, offices, and garden, and is capable of being much improv- 
ed. Within the last two years, the writer hereof has laid upwards 
of L.60 out in the way of draining and clearing it of stones, and 
when these improvements, which are still going on, and which will 
take L.80 or L.100 more to carry them into effect, are eventually 
completed, its yearly value, including the above immunities, may 
then be estimated at about L.40. The stipend consists of sixteen 
chalders of victual, half meal and half barley, payable in money, 
according to the highest fiar prices of the county, with L.8, 6s. 8d. 
for furnishing communion elements out of the teinds of the parish, 
together with 5 bolls of bear, and 18 bolls of black oats out of the 
teinds of the priory of St Andrews, conform to use and wont, and, 
in the aggregate, may have amounted to L.250 on an average of 
the last seven years. The benefice is in the gift of the Crown, 
and, according to the Royal Commissioners' Report of 1836, 
there are L.70, 18s. of unappropriated teinds.

cy, so far as that could have been ascertained : Duncan Maclag- 
gan, 1561-79; John Cunison, 1634; John M'Kerchar, 1699; 
Thomas Menzies, 1713; Duncan M' Lea presented de jure devo- 
lutoj, 1717; James Campbell, 1750; James Stewart, 1761; 
Alexander Campbell, 1769; Patrick M'Vean, 1771 ; Archibald 
Menzies, 1789; Duncan De'war, 1839. 

The district of Foss was disjoined from the original parish in 
1830, and annexed, quoad sacra to the Government church there 
erected; and in 1836, the district of Fincastle was similarly at- 
tached to the new erection at Tenandry, within the parish of 
Blair- Athole. 

There are two chapels in connection with the Established 
Church, and under the patronage of the General Aseembly's 
Committee for managing the Royal Bounty within the parish ; the 
one is at Amulree, and the other at Grandtully. The minister of 
the former has an annual salary of L. 65, including L. 5 for com- 
munion elements, and is paid entirely out of the royal bounty ; 
the salary of the latter again is L.90, including a similar sum for 
communion elements, of which L.40 are paid either by Sir Wil- 
liam D. Stewart of Grandtully or his tenants, and the remaining 
L.50 are paid by the Royal Bounty Committee. Besides, the 
ministers of these respective missions are accommodated with a 
house, garden, and four or five acres of arable land, rent-free, by 
the proprietors, and provided gratuitously with fuel by the tenants 
connected with their missions. 

There is a chapel at Tummel-bridge in connection with the 
Scottish Episcopal Church, where the minister of Strathtay offi- 
ciates once in the fortnight during summer, and who is paid, partly 
by the Episcopal Church Society and partly by members of the 
conoreo-ation. The average attendance does not exceed 15; and 
for four months in winter there is no service. 

An Independent congregation was established upwards of forty 
years ago in Aberfeldy ; and in 1817 a chapel and house to the 
minister were built, at an expense of about L.650. The chapel con- 
tains about 500 sittings, and, if not lately liquidated, it was burdened 
with considerable debt. Excepting in winter, perhaps, the attend- 
ance is generally but small, and the congregation is composed, not 
only of the parishioners of Dull, but also, in a great measure, of 
the people of the adjoining parishes. The minister's stipend is 
raised from the seat-rents and Sunday collections, and, with L.10 
paid by the Congregational Union of Scotland for itinerating, 
may average about L.50 annually.

There is no society established in the parish for religious pur- 
poses, but collections are almost annually made for the General 
Assembly's Schemes, and other religious and charitable objects, 
which may average about L.30.

Education. — There are at present nine schools in operation 
within the territorial boundaries of the parish, viz. the parochial 
school at Dull ; four schools supported by the Society for Propa- 
gating Christian Knowledge, whereof one is stationed at Aber- 
feldy, Amulree, Grandtully, and Foss, respectively; together with 
four schools taught by young men entirely on their own adventure; 
and the aggregate average attendance at these schools is about 
600. The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary of 
L.34, 4s. 4|d. ; his yearly receipt of school-fees may average 
L.18; and his other emoluments, as precentor and clerk to the 
heritors and kirk-session, may probably amount to L. 15, making 
an annual income of about L.67. He has besides the legal ac- 
commodation of house and garden ; but both dwelling-house and 
school-room are at present in a most wretched state of repair, and 
alike uncomfortable and incommodious. 

Libraries. — There are two libraries in the parish. The one is 
a subscription, and the other a circulating library. The former 
was established many years ago, and is denominated " The Aber- 
feldy Evangelical Library." Most of the books, consisting of 
nearly 400 volumes, are of a religious and moral character. The 
latter was only instituted about three years ago by Mr Cameron, 
bookseller at Aberfeldy. It contains about 250 volumes, consist- 
ing principally of fictitious works, travels, and voyages. 

Friendly Societies. — Many of the parishioners, especially in 



DULL. 



781 



the districts of Appin, Grandtully, and Strath tay, are members, 
either of " The Atholl Wrights' Brotherly Society," instituted at 
Logierait in 1812, or of the " Farmers' Friendly Society," insti- 
tuted at Pitnacree in 1826. The entry-money to these societies 
varies from 10s. to L.4, 18s. 6d., according to the age at which 
members are admitted, being from sixteen to forty years of age ; 
and the annual subscription towards the funds is 6s. Several of 
the parishioners are likewise brethren of the " Tay and Lyon 
Mason Lodge," whereof a branch was established some years ago 
in Aberfeldy. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was established in this parish at 
Aberfeldy in March 1833. 

The following is an abstract state of the funds of the institution 
since its commencement, showing the number of depositors, the 
amount of the sums lodged and drawn, together with the net ba-

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 100, and the aggregate amount of 
church collections at all the places of worship belonging to the 
Established Church within the original parish, including three- 
eighths of the collections of Tenandry, is about L. 56. There is 
also a sum of about L. 24 yearly realized from other sources, such 
as dues for proclamation of marriage banns, and use of mortcloth, 
fines, and occasional donations, amounting in all to about L. 80 
annually. This sum, with the exception of a few pounds which go 
to pay the clerks and officers of synod, presbytery, and kirk-ses- 
sions, is distributed among the above number of paupers, and the 
pecuniary assistance afforded to each yearly varies from 6s. to L.3, 
according to the recipient's respective necessities. The average 
amount of assessment levied upon the heritors during the last three 
years is about L. 120, being at the rate of nearly two and a-half 
per cent, upon their respective valuations. And, although it must 



782 



PERTHSHIRE. 



weigh heavily upon some of them, still, from an anxiety to ward off 
the burden otherwise imposed by statutory law upon the tenants, 
they have hitherto confined the assessment solely to themselves. 
Nor is this the only instance of liberality deserving of notice rela- 
tive to the poor. Through the active sympathy and generosity of 
the Most Noble the Marchioness of Breadalbane and the Honour- 
able Lady Menzies, not a few of our poor on the Breadalbane and 
Menzies' estates are often both clad and fed. Willingly would 
the writer hereof say, if he could, that the poor show no disposition 
to ask parochial aid ; but such is not the case.

Inns. — There are five inns in the parish and six ale-houses. The 
former are indispensable for the accommodation of travellers, but 
the latter may, with great propriety, be suppressed. 

Fuel — The fuel of the common people consists almost wholly 
of peats ; but, along with these, the better classes burn a good 
deal of coal and white-wood, or oak-copse. The coal is brought 
either from Perth or Crieff, and, in consequence of the long car- 
riage, costs between Is. 6d. and Is. 8d. per cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the former Statistical Report was published, the general 
aspect of the parish, both in a physical and moral point of view, 
has undergone a very manifest improvement. The real rental 
was then little more than L.4500, but now it is considerably up- 
wards of L. 13,000. Formerly, agriculture in all its branches was 



for which they are held.

at a very low ebb throughout the parish ; farms were not unfre- 
quently let on the monstrous principle of run-rig ; leases were 
seldom or ever given ; the system of rotation was all but un- 
known ; and even fields which were under the plough were not 
uufrequently broken and detached, either by banks, heaps of 
stones, or marshy meadows. Now farms are divided and inclosed ; 
green crops and rotation in cropping are generally introduced ; 
cattle and sheep are improving both in size and symmetry ; and 
the tenants are encouraged in draining, liming, and clearing their 
farms by getting leases, so that almost every district of the parish 
witnesses a yearly improvement in husbandry. The total want of 
turnpike roads, together with the shocking and all but impassable 
state of repair in which the parish roads were kept, were then a 
bar to the social and mercantile improvement of the parish ; but 
now the opening up of turnpike, and the regular repairing and 
macadamizing of private, roads ; the establishing of regular car- 
riers ; the letting of horses, post-chaises, and other vehicles for 
hire at most of the principal inns, united with the frequent and 
regular conveyance of letters and newspapers by means of the 
post-office system, are sufficient indications of the wonderful tran- 
sition experienced by the inhabitants of this district in their social 
and trafficking intercommunication with their more southern neigh- 
bours. Formerly, the tenants were restricted to particular millers 
and smiths, to whom they were obliged to pay certain heavy ser- 
vitudes ; but now they are happily relieved from these remains of 
feudal slavery, so that they may choose their smith and miller 
where they best can. Then,the old Scotch plough, which was 
universally used, was drawn by four Highland ponies yoked a- 
breast and led by a driver walking backwards ; the horses' harness 
were rudely made of tow ; sledges and creels were generally used 
instead of carts ; thrashing-mills had no existence ; and private 
gigs and carriages were exceedingly rare, if not unknown. Now, 
all the implements of husbandry are generally of the most im- 
proved and superior description ; thrashing mills are coming into 
use ; and private carriages are comparatively numerous. At the 
period above referred to, the common people's finest attire was 
made of coarse home -spun apparel. The men's only head-dress, 
both at church and market, was a common blue bonnet ; that of 
the matrons consisted of what was called the curch, made of linen, 
and tied under the chin, while the unmarried females, again, ap- 
peared bare-headed, with their hair tied up with a piece of ribbon

or fillet ; and neither male nor female had any other cover to 
screen them from sun or rain save their plaids, variously dyed and 
wrought. But now, most of the young men appear on public occa- 
sions dressed in West of England cloth, hats, stocks, or silk, hand- 
kerchiefs ; and while the matrons deck themselves in Merino and 
sombre- coloured cotton gowns, with straw and silk bonnets, the 
young unmarried females are gaudily dressed in fashionable prints, 
mousselines de laine, or silks, and caps with a profusion of gum- 
flowers, not unfrequently surmounted with Leghorn bonnets, having 
their full share of ribbon. At that time, the baneful and de- 
moralizing practice of smuggling was carried on in almost every 
hamlet throughout the parish. Now, these seminaries of im- 
piety and dissipation have almost all disappeared before the es- 
tablishment of legal distilleries, and the rigid observance of ex- 
cise laws. Then, many were the men who could neither write 
nor cypher, while none of the women could do so, and but few 
of these could perfectly read. Now, there is hardly a man 
under sixty years of age to be met with that is not ordinarily 
versed in these branches of education, and mostly all the young 
females can both read and write, and not a few of them can cast 
accounts. 

But, great, and manifest as these improvements are, others might 
still be effected with some trouble and expense. Ample as are 
the means of communication already enjoyed throughout the pa- 
rish, still the rebuilding of Comrie Bridge over the Lyon would 
greatly add thereto, and it were certainly desirable that those lo- 
cal and private interests which have hitherto opposed the erection 
thereof, would ere long give way to the far higher interests of the 
public necessity and welfare. The abolishing of servitude, still 
exacted by the proprietors from many of their tenants, in name of 
kain, — the building of more commodious and comfortable houses 
and steadings for the tenants, and neater cottages for the poor and 
labouring classes, — the planting of some of the knolls] presently 
lying waste and irreclaimable, but more especially, the planting of 
a belt along the head dike which separates the hill from the lower 
ground, with larch or some other wood congenial to the climate 
and nature of the soil, would also tend mightily to add to the per- 
sonal domestic comforts of the people, as well as to the sheltered 
and ornate appearance of the parish, — while the repressing of 
unnecessary ale-houses ; the encouragement of frugality and in- 
dustry, by means of subsidiary savings banks and friendly so -

cieties ; a greater facility in acquiring every branch of useful 
knowledge, by introducing more generally the most approved 
system of tuition and suitable class-books into all our schools, 
combined with a more extensive diffusion and higher standard of 
education, by establishing additional schools, and raising the en- 
dowments of such as are already established, — are means well cal- 
culated to advance the moral and spiritual improvement of the 
community, and which could not ultimately fail, by the blessing of 
Providence, to yield the peaceable fruits of 

" A virtuous populace to rise the while, 

And stand a wall of fire around our much-lov'd isle."

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. PETER DRUMMOND, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, fyc. — This parish is bounded by those of Logierait 
and Moulin on the west ; Braemar and Crathy on the north ; Glen- 
isla and Alyth on the east; and Blairgowrie, Kinloch, Cluny, and 
Caputh, on the south. It comprehends the greater part of Strath- 
ardle, the whole of Glenshee, and a district lying at the lower extre- 
mity of that, glen, on the west side of the river called Black Water. 
Strathardle is about 10 miles long, and from 1 to 2 miles broad, and 
includes part of the parishes of Moulin, Kirkmichael, Blairgowrie, 
Bendochy, and Kinloch. Glenshee is about 7 miles long, and 
less than a mile broad. At the head of this glen are two smaller 
ones, narrow, and about 3 miles long. The district bordering on 
the Black Water is of a form nearly circular, measuring somewhat 
more than 2 miles in diameter. Though this parish is pretty ex- 
tensive, there is no part of it detached. Its figure does not vary 
much from a parallelogram, being 17 miles long from north to 
south, and from 6 to 7 miles broad. 

According to tradition, Strathardle was anciently called in 
Gaelic Strath na muice brice, the strath of the spotted wild sow ; 

PERTH. 3 d 



786 



PERTHSHIRE. 



which name it is said to have" retained till the time of the Danish 
invasions, when, in a battle fought between the Danes and the 
Caledonians, at the head of the country, a chief, named Ard- 
fhuil, high, noble blood, was killed, whose grave is shown at this 
day. From him the country got the name of Srath Ard-fhuil, 
Strathardle. 

Hills, Lochs, Sfc. — A hill at the head of Glenshee, called 
Beinn-Ghulbhuinn, is distinguished by having been the scene of 
a hunting which proved fatal to Diarmid, one of the Fingalian 
heroes. Here are shown the den of the wild boar that was hunted, 
a spring called Tobar nam Fiann, the fountain of the Fingalians ; 
a small lake, called Loch an Tuirc, the boar's loch; also Diar- 
mid's grave, where he was buried by his comrades. The highest 
hill in the country is Mount Blair, which divides this parish from 
Glenisla. The only lochs of note are, Loch Sheshemich, and 
Loch nan ean, situated pretty high among the hills. These abound 
in excellent trout. There are one or two medicinal springs, which 
are believed to be of an antiscorbutic quality. 

Climate, Soil, Crop. — The country being more elevated than 
Athole on the one hand, and Marr on the other, and being in ge- 
neral open and unsheltered, the climate is colder than in either of 
these districts, and more exposed to the severity of a cold or stormy 
season. 

The soil on the banks of the Ardle is thin and dry, having a 
sandy bottom, and yields in general light crops. In the higher 
grounds it is wet and spongy, unfriendly to vegetation, except in 
dry warm seasons, when it yields a pretty good crop. The same 
description applies to the soil of Glenshee, and of the Black-water 
district. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities and Curiosities. — In the middle of a pretty exten- 
sive and elevated heathy moor, stands a large heap of stones or 
cairn, 90 yards in circumference, and about 25 feet in height, 
which are described particularly in the old Account. There can 
be little doubt that all these are relics of Druidism. 

About a mile north-east from the above-mentioned great cairn, 
on a flat- topped eminence, surrounded at some distance with rocky 
hills of considerable height, and steep ascent, stands one of those 
rocking-stones which the Druids are said to have employed as a 
kind of ordeal for detecting guilt in doubtful cases. This stone 
is placed on the plain surface of a rock level with the ground. Its

shape is quadrangular, approaching to the figure of a rhombus, of 
which the greater diagonal is 7 feet, and the lesser 5 feet. Its 
mean thickness is about 2 feet. Its solid contents are therefore 
about 51,075 cubical feet. 

On the north side of the stone, at the distance of 60 yards, on 
a small eminence, are two concentric circles, similar to that al- 
ready described, and a single circle adjoining to them on the east 
side. Beyond this, at thirty-seven yards distance, on another small 
eminence, is another pair of concentric circles, with a single one 
adjoining to them on the east side. Beyond these, at forty-five yards 
distance, is a third pair of concentric circles, with their adjacent 
circle on the east side. Farther on to the north-east, at the distance 
of 90 yards, is a single circle, and beside it, on the west side, two 
rectangular enclosures of 37 feet by 12 ; also a cairn 23 or 24 yards 
in circumference, and about 12 feet high in the centre. Several 
small cairns are scattered in the neighbourhood. One hundred 
and twenty yards west from the rocking-stone is a pair of concentric 
circles, with a small single circle beside them of 7 feet in diameter. 
All the pairs of concentric circles are of the same dimensions, the 
inner one being about 32 feet, and the outer about 45 or 46 feet 
in diameter; and all of them have a breach or doorway four or five 
feet wide on the south side. The single circles are, in general, 
from 32 to 36 feet in diameter, and have no breach. The vesti- 
ges of all these structures are perfectly distinct, and many of the 
stones still retain the erect posture in which all of them had pro- 
bably been placed at first. Cairns and circles similar to those de- 
scribed are to be seen in other hills of this parish, particularly be- 
tween Strathardle and Glenderby. There are likewise several tall 
erect stones, called here in Gaelic, Crom-leaca, or Clach-shleuch- 
da, stones of worship. —  Old Account

About 400 acres of waste land have, of late years, been brought 
into cultivation. Lime, of which there is abundance in the parish, 
is applied with great success as a stimulant. The modern system 
of husbandry in the low country has been introduced in all its de- 
partments. Most of the farmers have neat and comfortable houses, 
instead of the mean and unseemly hovels which they formerly oc- 
cupied. These improvements have been greatly facilitated and 
accelerated by the formation of good roads, and the erection of 
bridges. One of the most important of these, a handsome bridge 
of two arches, was built during last summer across the river 
Ardle at Kirkmichael, the expense of which, amounting to up- 
wards of L. 500, was raised by voluntary subscription among the 
public-spirited proprietors and inhabitants of the district. 

Manufactures. — There is one distillery on the property of Pa- 
trick Small Keir, Esq., conducted by Mr Alexander Fraser, Pit- 
car nuck. 

Fishings. — There are none except trout-fishing in the streams 
and lochs. Several of the proprietors have a grant of the right 
of salmon-fishing in their charters, thereby clearly demonstrat- 
ing that valuable fish at one time frequented the rivers of Ardle 
and Blackwater, which unite a little below the Bridge of Cally 
and form the Ericht ; but in consequence of a natural obstruction 
in the river last named near Blairgowrie, thirteen miles from Kirk- 
michael, advantage was taken of the circumstance, perhaps 150 
years ago, to raise an artificial barrier, which effectually intercepts 
the progress of the salmon upwards.

Education.— There are two parochial schools; one in the vil- 
lage of Kirkmichael, and the other in Glenshee. As the valleys 
of Strathardle and Glenshee, which run nearly parallel, compose 
the parish, and the parochial schools are situated at the west or 
upper end, an additional school is required near the eastern ex- 
tremity in Strathardle. The first teacher has the maximum sa- 
lary ; the second L. 15 yearly. The first has about L. 15, the 
second about L. 10 yearly of fees. The first has L. 15, the se- 
cond L. 2 a-year from other sources. 

iW.— The number on the roll is about 12, exclusive of two 
lunatics, whose maintenance requires about L.30 annually. They 
receive about 2s. per week. About L. 88 annually is the amount 
contributed for their relief; whereof about L. 42 is from church 
collections, and L.4 for mortcloth and hearse. The heritors have 
hitherto voluntarily contributed what is required in addition to the 
ordinary funds. There is a sum of L.8, 8s., being the interest of 
a capital sum of L.220, bequeathed by Messrs M'Dougall, Bruce, 
and Lyons ; also L.200, bequeathed by the late Patrick Dow to 
the poor not on the pauper- roll, to be under the management of 
the kirk-session. There are also two mortifications; one yielding 
L.17 a-year, bequeathed by a Mr Stewart, for the education of 
boys of the name of Stewart at the schools of Kirkmichael, Glen- 
shee, and Drumfork; and another, yielding about L. 20 a-year, 
mortified by the late Patrick Dow, Esq., for establishing bursaries 
in favour of young men educated at the parish school of Kirk- 
michael, failing which, at the adjoining parish school of Moulin. 
The University of St Andrews is directed to be preferred.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER CUMMING, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name — The name of this parish is written Dunbarnie, Dun- 
berny, Dumbarny, or Dumbarnie, In ancient times its usual 
orthography was Dunberny. It is supposed to be compound- 
ed of the two Celtic terms Dun, a hill, and Beam, or Beairn, 
or Beirn, which signifies a breach ovjissure. Accordingly, in for- 
mer times, the church, as well as the most considerable village in 
the parish, were situated on an eminence close to Dunbarny 
House, fronting the Craigend cottages, where a gap or aperture 
in a ridge of hills exists, through which the road between Edin- 
burgh and Perth now runs. 

Extent— The extreme length of this parish from east to west 
is 4 miles ; its greatest breadth, north to south, is 4 miles ; its 
average breadth, 1£ miles. Its superficial extent may be esti- 
mated at 5 square miles. 

Boundaries.— It is bounded on the north, by the parishes of 
Rhynd and Perth ; on the east, by the Rhynd and Abernethy ; on 
the south, by Abernethy and Dron ; on the west, by Dron, For- 
gandenny, and a detached part of Forteviot. Its form presents a 
very irregular and waving outline. 

Topographical Appearances.— This parish is intersected by the 
river Earn, which, though it pursues a winding course, upon the 
whole, rolls its current in a direction from east to west, and its ge- 
nerally level form is diversified by Moncrieff or Moredun Hill 
which towers to an altitude of 756 feet above the surface of the 

" It may excite the surprise of a reader not well acrmainf j- x •

sea The summit of this hill commands a view which has been 
termed by Pennant « the glory of Scotland." Towards the east 
the Carse of Gowrie, with its fertile and spacious plains, extends 
before the eye, with the Frith of Tay gradually widening, till at 
Dundee and Broughty Ferry, its waters swell to a majestic ex- 
panse. Towards the south and west, Strathearn spreads out its 
ample surface, being an irriguous and highly cultivated valley, 
richly adorned with wood, studded with gentlemen's seats, enliven- 
ed with the graceful and picturesque sweeps of the Earn, and bound- 
ed by the verdant and gently swelling Ochils. A curve made by 
these hills intercepts a view of Stirling, but the hills of Monteith 
may be seen stretching beyond it. The spectacle of mountainous 
grandeur towards the west and north-west is august and imposing. 
Benvoirlich, Benmore, and other hills frown with a commanding 
appearance. Two monuments or obelisks of granite, commemo- 
rating the achievements of illustrious men, may be seen beyond 
Crieff; that of Sir David Baird, the hero of Seringapatam, on the 
elegant and conical hill of Tomahastle, in the parish of Monzie- 
vard, and that of Lord Melville near Comrie. A spectator turn- 
ing toward the north will observe, in the distance, a considerable 
pa°rt of the alpine scenery of Perthshire, and other contiguous 
counties. At his feet is a romantic view of Perth, the Tay, Kin- 
noul Hill, and Kinftums Castle. Before the trees that crown 
Moredun top had shot up to their present stately growth, Perth and 
Dundee could be seen from the same spot on it. 

Moncrieffe-Hill forms one of the most imposing objects that 
beautify the scenery of this district. It is covered with a rich va- 
riety of wood, which, contrasted with the bold and craggy preci- 
pices which adorn its southern declivity, gives it an appearance 
strikingly picturesque. 

Hydrography. —The river Earn rolls through this parish. Its 
waters in this district have by no means the crystal transparency 
which distinguish them near Crieff and Comrie. After traversing 
the rich loamy soil, which extends several miles along its course 
above the Bridge of Earn, it becomes considerably tinged by the 
fertile banks through which it meanders. It is reported that for- 
merly its channel ran close to the bank on which the manse is 
built. A spectator stationing himself on the new bridge, and look- 
ing westwards, will perceive the banks along which it formerly 
winded, and which it has now deserted ; they are a little to the 
south of its present current. It is gradually shifting its channel 



tm 



792 



PERTHSHIRE. 



farther towards the north, in consequence of which it w a s found 
necessary, last century, to add an arch to the old bridge to span 
that part of it that was penetrating northward. Formerly, the 
Earn, after gliding along the bank close to the manse, rolled 
through what is now the garden attached to the inn. This will 
be easily understood by any individual who looks towards the old 
bridge. He will perceive it could only be by such a direction of 
its stream, that it could sweep in at right angles to that ancient 
structure. The current at present strikes that bridge obliquely, 
which could not have been the case when it was originally built, 
as bridges are placed at right angles to the current. It would have 
changed its bed much more, had not artificial embankments con- 
fined it ; and this accounts for the comparatively few deflexions it 
has made from its course since the fourteenth century, when the 
old bridge was reared. The velocity of the Earn is from one and 
a half to two miles an hour. 

The fish found in the Earn consists of salmon, salmon trout, 
whitings, and pike. The whitings are found from August to April, 
pike, chiefly after floods, being carried down by the impetuosity of 
the current. The salmon-fishing on the Earn has materially de- 
clined in value. The fisheries connected with MoncriefTe pro- 
perty yield only L.31 per annum ; at one period, they produced 
more. 

Pitkeathhj and Danbarny Mineral Waters. — There are two tra- 
ditions current in this quarter concerning these mineral waters. 
The first is, that the notice of the country people was first attracted 
to them by observing pigeons frequently resort to them. But the 
most prevalent tradition is, that their medicinal virtue was first 
discovered by reapers, who, when using them to quench their thirst 
at their mid-day meal, experienced their strong effects. The first 
authentic notice which is any where to be found concerning them 
is supplied by the session records of this parish. The followino- 
interesting extract from these documents bears the date 20th Sept 
tember 1711 : " Session met according to appointment, and took 
into consideration the profanation of the Sabbath by people fre- 
quenting the medicine well of Pitkeathly, whereupon some of the 
elders were desired to visit the well every Sabbath morning, and 
dehort the people from coming to it on the Lord's day, and in- 
quire what parishes they belong to, that word may be sent to their 
respective ministers to discharge them ; and John Vallance is 
♦ It has been already mentioned, that the principal village in this parish was si-

forbidden to give them passage at Dunberny boat, and Thomas 
Drutnmond desired to spread the report, that they are to be stop- 
ped by constables, by authority of the justices of the peace." 

About sixty years ago, great complaints were made that the 
waters were turbid and foul. This happened from a variety of 
causes, but principally from persons laving their distempered limbs 
in them. Subsequently, a building was erected on what is now 
the property of John Grant, Esq. of Kilgraston, in which the 
water might be dealt out, and hot baths furnished. Great num- 
bers of individuals crowd to this district every year for the benefit 
of the water. 

The following observations on the Pitkeathly waters are from 
the pen of Dr Edward, one of the medical practitioners at the 
Bridge of Earn. 

" The mineral water of Pitkeathly belongs to the class saline, as 
distinguished from the acidulous, chalybeate, and sulphureous. 
Along, hosvever, with the alkaline and earthy salts which form the 
basis of its constitution, it likewise contains a notable portion 
of carbonic acid, and it is the presence of this acid which gives to 
this mineral, when poured from one vessel to another, in a slight 
degree, the sparkling appearance so characteristic of water impreg- 
nated with this gas. 

When the Pitkeathly water is heated, its transparency is slightly 
affected, from the expulsion of the carbonic acid, and consequent 
deposition of carbonate of lime, which was held in solution by the 
gas, and this takes place in all mineral waters where carbonic acid 
and carbonate of lime exist together. There is also the escape 
of a quantity of atmospheric air, and an inconsiderable portion of 
nitrogen gas. 

Its other constituents are alkaline and earthy salts, and on these 
whatever medicinal properties it possesses altogether depend. 
The salt present in largest quantity is the muriate of lime, or, more 
properly speaking, chloride of calcium, and it is also the most im- 
portant in a medicinal point of view. 

There are different analyses of the Pitkeathly water, but they 
all nearly agree in the ultimate constitution of the mineral, although 
there is great disparity as regards their quantity, and state of 

tuated at Dunbarny. It would appear from this minute of session, that a boat was 
regularly connected with it, furnishing a more expeditious route to Perth than the 
circuitous one by the Bridge of Earn. The Dunbarny family have the privilege, 
when they choose to avail themselves of it, of going to Perth by a ferry-boat, and 
travelling through the fields on the opposite side, though belonging to a different 
proprietor.

combination. The following very nearly coincides with the 
analysis of Dr Murray, — the only difference being the exist- 
ence of a minute portion of nitrogen gas, which, however, 
might have been produced, during the analysis, from the decom- 
position of atmospheric air, as the mercury used in collecting the 
gaseous products was very impure. The temperature of the Pit- 
keathly spring was 49° at the time the trial was made July, be- 
ing 24° under the temperature of the air. 
Proportion of ingredients in a gallon : — 

Carbonic acid, 9.5 c. inches. Nitrogen, 1.5 c. inches. 

Carbonate of lime, . 5.7 grains. Sulphate of soda, . 6.3 grains. 

Chloride of calcium, . 170. Chloride of sodium, . 114.5 

The most delicate tests afforded no indication of either iron or 
hydriodic acid, which, by some, have been supposed to exist in the 
Pitkeathly mineral. The effects of mineral waters on the animal 
economy must not be supposed to coincide with the individu- 
al action of the substances composing them, — for not only do 
these exist in different states of chemical combination from what 
we would infer from analysis, but their action is considerably modi- 
fied by the manner in which they are admixed. 

Much has been said about the medicinal properties of the Pit- 
keathly mineral, and there are few diseases in which it has not 
been recommended and tried. Like many other minerals, too, it 
is considered by not a few to be a panacea for all disorders, — a sort 
of Paracelsian elixir, by which not only the sick may be restored, 
but even the constitution of the healthy sustained and invigorated. 

It is to be regretted that this belief in their universal efficacy is 
so prevalent, since it induces many to employ them in diseases 
where they cannot but be prejudicial ; and many, also, who enjoy 
the utmost health, to persevere in their continued use, very much 
to the derangement, and it may be ultimate hurt, of their consti- 
tutions. There is not the least doubt, too, that many of the cures 
effected during a course of mineral waters, and willingly ascribed 
by the patient to the potent virtues of his favourite mineral, are, 
with far greater truth, to be attributed to the less equivocal agen- 
cies of change of air, healthful exercise, and buoyancy of spirits, 
the usual concomitants of rustication. It must not be supposed 
that these remarks are intended to underrate the value of the Pit- 
keathly mineral ; for the benefit to be derived from its judicious 
use, in some forms of disease, is very great. Their only object 
is to guard against its inordinate and indiscriminate employment,

in many instances either aggravating the previous disorder, or in- 
ducing others equally hazardous. 

It would be useless to specify all the cases in which these waters 
might be advantageously used, as they should be employed in no 
one of any importance without the sanction and advice of the phy- 
sician. A few of the more decided, however, may be mentioned. 

In plethoric habits of the body, and where it is desirable to 
counteract such a tendency, they may be taken freely, provid- 
ed the presence of no other disease forbids their employment. 
If not sufficiently active, some saline purgative, such as the Ep- 
som or Rochelle salt, should be added. 

When this plethoric state of the body is accompanied with what 
is by no means uncommon, determination of blood to the head, 
threatening apoplexy, their continued use will be highly service- 
able, since there is no form of medicine better adapted for quickly 
lessening the amount of the circulating fluids than the saline, and 
in the state which nature has furnished, it is more likely to be 
perseveringly continued than would be the less palateable pre- 
scription of the physician. 

In some chronic diseases of the liver, particularly that form of 
liver disease induced by residence in tropical climates, the benefit 
to be received from them is in most cases very decided. They 
afford relief in such cases, by unloading the large vessels in the 
neighbourhood of the disease, and it may be also, in some degree, 
by acting as a counter-irritant. Other remedies should be con- 
joined ; but these, of course, it is the province of the medical 
attendant to regulate, as the quantity and extent to which they 
are necessary, must depend entirely upon the peculiarity of the 
particular case. 

The diuretic properties of these waters dependent on the large 
quantity of the chloride of calcium they contain is the subject of 
remark by most individuals who use them, and this peculiar pro- 
perty renders them useful in some forms of calculous disease. 
There is no good reason, however, to suppose looking at their 
constitution that they possess any specific control over the disease 
mentioned. Indeed, if such remedies are required, we possess 
them of far greater influence, and more to be depended on, than 
the one in question. 

Their alterative and diluent qualities render them of consider- 
able utility as an adjuvant in the treatment of some forms of sy- 
philitic complaint. 



796 



PERTHSHIRE. 



When the muriate of lime chloride of calcium was considered 
by physicians to be a remedy worthy of trial in the treatment of 
scrofula, these waters, from containing it in large quantity, were, 
of course, highly extolled. This remedy, however, has since 
fallen into merited disrepute, and it is now on all hands allowed 
to be of little or no service in checking the disease in question. 
The same remarks, of course, are applicable to the Pitkeathly 
water : in such cases it can be of no service ; and, by usurping 
the place of more active remedies, must be prejudicial, by incur- 
ring all the evils of procrastination. 

There is a vulgar notion abroad that these waters possess great 
efficacy as an external application, and poor people from all quar- 
ters may be seen every season with diseases which a little surgical 
skill and attention could easily have eradicated, daily performing 
the required ablutions, in the confirmed hope of an almost mira- 
culous cure : and this belief is not confined to that particular class, 
for it obtains also among those whose education would be a gua- 
rantee for their better judgment. 

It is a pity that such is the case, as most of the diseases allud- 
ed to are such as proper surgical treatment could soon overcome, 
whereas, the result of the treatment adopted is a degree of irrita- 
tion which renders the disease previously manageable, altogether 
incorrigible. 

Among diseases of this kind may be mentioned, chronic ab- 
scesses, ulcers, and some affections of the eye. 

The Pitkeathly warm-bath has been recommended in diseases of 
the skin, but on what grounds cannot be ascertained, as it con- 
tains no substance in its composition that can have the slightest 
specific action on the vessels of the skin. Of course it answers all 
the purposes of ordinary bathing, and may be used to the same ex- 
tent. 

In concluding these observations we cannot help remarking, that 
whatever may be said against the indiscriminate use of these wa- 
ters, they are at least valuable in so far, that they are generally 
taken cheerfully, and when other medicines would be refused or 
neglected ; the patient must undergo change of scene, salutary ex- 
ercise, and, in short, altogether be placed in the situation of all 
others most conducive to the speedy recovery of an invalid." 

The mineral water may be found in greater or less abundance 
over an expanse of from 10 to 12 acres, stretching over the Pit- 
keathly, Dunbarny, and Ballenderick properties. On one of the 

3 



DUNBARNY. 



797 



fields in the Ballenderick grounds, which is commonly designated 
the Nether Oxgang field, and is contiguous to the Pitkeathly and 
Dunbarny estates, the mineral water is so copious that when any 
part of the west end of it is dug to the depth of six or seven feet, 
it immediately accumulates in great profusion, and of the same 
quality as that diffused through the springs already mentioned. 

The new village of the Bridge of Earn was built for the accom- 
modation of strangers frequenting the wells. There the lodgings 
are good, cheap, and abundant. There are two inns or hotels in 
this parish intended for the entertainment of strangers, — one near 
the wells, and another at the Bridge of Earn. The former is the 
old mansion-house, formerly occupied by the proprietors of Pit- 
keathly. Of late it has undergone considerable repairs. 

But the hotel that is most resorted to, is that of the Moncreiffe 
Arms, at the Bridge of Earn. It is one of the most commodious 
inns in Scotland, finely situated on the banks of the river, and 
near the handsome bridge that has been erected over it. 

Mineralogy and Geology. — The rocks which occur in this pa- 
rish belong to the secondary formation ; a great part of it consists 
of secondary trap, commonly called whinstone, and the remainder 
of sandstone. Trap composes the whole of Moncrieffe Hill ; at the 
north of the parish, it extends over the greater part of Dunbarny 
property ; it may be seen to advantage in the whinstone quarries 
on that estate ; and at Glencairn cottage, in the vicinity of Mr 
Craigie's mansion house. The sandstone, which stretches through 
a part of the southern division of the parish, is that kind of sand- 
stone which lies below the coal formation, and which is supposed 
by some to be the old red sandstone. It is to be regretted that, 
though the trap and sandstone are found within a few hundred 
feet of each other, there is no place where their junction can be 
discerned. 

The trap of Moncrieffe Hill embraces the three different varie- 
ties of clinkstone, greenstone, and amygdaloid, which are frequently 
found in the same mountain. The amygdaloid occurs in various 
parts of the hill, but may be seen to the greatest advantage in the 
quarry near Easter Moncrieffe. The following contains an enu- 
meration of the various minerals imbedded in the amygdaloid 
found there, and in the amygdaloidal masses distributed through 
the other parts of the hill : barytes or heavy spar, calcareous spar, 
fibrous limestone, jasper, agate ; but the predominating mineral 
at that quarry, and one which, is frequently disseminated in the 



798 



PERTHSHIRE. 



amygdaloid of Scotland, is green earth, or compact chlorite. It is 
found in small globular pieces, and in such abundance, that it is 
scarcely possible to detach a fragment from the rock at the quarry 
without perceiving several specimens. This green earth is some- 
times used as a pigment in water-painting, and is the mountain- 
green of painters. 

Quarries. — There are five trap or whinstone quarries in this pa- 
rish, which are now, or have been wrought at other times. One 
of them is on the Kinmonth property, about two and a-half miles 
from the parish church ; two on the MoncriefFe property one at 
Craigend and the other at Easter MoncriefFe ; and two on the 
Dunbarny property, about a mile and a-half west from the church. 
The stones taken from these quarries are used for drains and road- 
metal. A few blocks are occasionally employed as materials for 
building; but from the copious masses of sandstone found in dif- 
ferent parts of the neighbourhood, little whinstone is required for 
this purpose. At Dunbarny and Pitkeathly, there are sandstone 
or freestone quarries of a dark-red hue. Both dip towards the 
south-east. The sandstone of Dunbarny is of a durable charac- 
ter, and from it great quantities of stones have been conveyed for 
building, not only to different parts of this parish, but also to 
Perth, Abernethy, and other places. It is wrought with iron 
wedges, the application of gunpowder being seldom resorted to 
as in whinstone quarries. Some of the strata are uncommonly 
hard, and to penetrate and detach them requires great labour on 
the part of the workmen. More than seventy years have elapsed 
since the Dunbarny quarry was opened. It yields an annual rent 
of L.17. 

The sandstone of Pitkeathly quarry is composed of softer ma- 
terials, and from this cause the working of it has been discontinued 
for several years. The mansion-house of Kilgraston was built, 
partly from the Dunbarny and partly from the Pitkeathly quarries. 

At Dunbarny quarry, stone for hewn work is sold at from 3d. 
to 5d. per foot; ruble or building stone at 6d. per cart-load.

heaths, Pelargoniums, and other natives of the Cape of Good 
Hope ; also a considerable number from New South Wales and 
other regions. 

Trees. — Till about eighty years ago, scarcely any trees grew in 
Strathearn, except a few sprinkled around gentlemen's seats. 
The whole valley is now studded with plantations ; one effect of 
which, according to the testimony of old people, has been to abate 
very sensibly the violence of the blasts. 

About forty years ago, Moncrieffe hill was overgrown with furze 
and broom ; it is now covered with thriving wood of various sorts. 
Around the house are some very fine trees : horse chestnuts, 
measuring eighteen feet round the stem ; walnuts, twelve ; ashes, 
ten ; and a willow, planted some years ago, is above ten feet in 
circumference. The number of acres in the parish under wood 
is 419. In the management of trees, there is a great improvement 
in the parish in comparison of former times. The trees which 
have been planted in the grounds of Moncrieffe are, oak, ash, elm, 
birch, beech, Spanish chestnut, silver' and spruce-firs ; and larch 
and Scotch firs are used for nurses ; but when it is intended to 
embellish any portion of the grounds, without reference to the 
profit to be ultimately derived from the wood, horse chestnut, 
lime, plane, and walnut, are interspersed amongst the former va- 
rieties.

rish is a tulip tree at Pitkeathly House, which is supposed to be 
above one hundred years old, and has been observed to flower for 
several seasons. It is perhaps the largest in this neighbourhood. 
It is generally supposed that the tulip-tree does not blossom in 
this part of the country until it is very old ; but there is one in 
the grounds of Sir Thomas Moncrieffe that flowered in 1836, and 
was planted by the late gardener in 1796. 

There is a stately and umbrageous Spanish chestnut-tree, near 
Old Kilgraston, which is said to have been planted on the day of 
the capitulation of Perth to Oliver Cromwell. 

II. — Civil History. 
The teinds connected with the parish of Dunbarny, and pa- 
tronage to the benefice, belonged formerly to the Town- Council 
of Edinburgh. The revenue of St Giles's Church in that city, 
which were administered by the Town- Council, arose from the 
teinds of several parishes scattered through Scotland, such as 
Eastern and Western Weems, Limpetlaw, Brotherstanes, Gogar, 
and, among the rest, Dunbarny. The charter of King James VI., 
given under the Great Seal of Scotland, and which confirms to 
the city of Edinburgh many former charters and privileges granted 
by previous monarchs, from Robert the Bruce downwards, desig- 
nated the Golden Charter, given at Holyroodhouse, 15th March 
1603, confirms a decree pronounced by the Lords of Council and 
Session, in 1583, " ordaining and declaring that the churches of 
Dunberny, Potty, and Moncrieffe do, and in all time coming 
shall belong to the aforesaid provosts, bailiffs, councils, and com- 
munity of the said town of Edinburgh, according to the tenor of 
the aforesaid infeftment, granted to them by our said dear mother, 
of all the benefices, prebendaries, and other foundations within 
the liberty of the said burgh, conform to the union and annexation 
of the tithe sheaves, and emoluments of the rectory of the afore- 
said church of Dunberny, whereof the said churches of Potty and 
Moncrieffe are appendages, and were anciently annexed to the 
collegiate church of St Giles, situated within the said town of 
Edinburgh, as is more fully contained in the said decreet ; the 

 St Giles, though before the Reformation only a parish church not being con- 
stituted into a cathedral till 1633 had attached to it a considerable religious body. 
It consisted of a provost, curate, sixteen prebendaries, a sacristan, bedall, minister of 
the choir, and four choristers or singing boys. The patronage of St Giles's was, in 
remote times, lodged in the hands of the bishop of Lindesfern, or Holy Island, in 
Northumberland, and subsequently transferred to the abbot and canons of Dunferm- 
line, with whom it continued till it was vested in the magistrates and council of 
Edinburgh. See Maitland's History of Edinburgh.

Several other documents, which might be quoted, bear a re- 
ference to the same right bestowed on the Town- Council of Edin- 
burgh. 

King James VI., by act of Parliament of this date, »'. e. 5th 
June 1592, " approves, and confirms, and annexes, to remain with 
the magistrates of Edinburgh, for maintaining the ministry and 
hospital, whereof they have now the property and superiority, as 
the Popish clergy had, to whom these lands and annualrents for- 
merly belonged, viz. the donations and mortifications granted by 
Queen Mary, his Majesty's mother, and himself at divers times, 
of the lands, benefices, and rents, which formerly pertained to any 
bishop, abbot, and prior, or other ecclesiastic, and the general 
annexation of the temporality of benefices, to the act of Parlia- 
ment, 29th July 1585, is dissolved, in so far as it may appear to 
extend to the premises, or to the annexations formerly made in 
favours of the college and hospital in Edinburgh, of the teinds of 
Dunberny, which pertained to the chapel of St Giles's kirk in 
Edinburgh, in the sheriffdom of Perth, whereof the kirks of Potty 
and Moncrieff are pendicles, the parsonage of Currie, and half 
the vicarage thereof, pertaining to the archdean of Lothian, the 
lands, annualrents, houses, yards, and biggings of the Trinity 
College, within Edinburgh, pertaining to the provost and pre- 
benders thereof, and common lands and annualrents of the same, 
which annexation, his Majesty, with advice of Parliament, ratifies 
and approves, as also of new annexes the other half of the vi- 
carage of Currie, to which no person is provided ; and the whole 
vicarage of the kirk of Dunberny, vacant by the deprivation of 
N. N. last possessor thereof, to remain with the council and com- 
munity of Edinburgh in all time coming, declaring that none of 
the particulars aforesaid before disponed, and newly annexed for 
the sustentation of the ministry within the burgh of Edinburgh, 
and entertaining the hospital thereof, are, and shall be compre- 
hended the general annexation of the ecclesiastical lands to the 
Crown." The patronage of Dunberny remained in the posses- 
sion of the town-council of Edinburgh till the year 1820, when it 
was sold to Mr William Anderson, Junior, merchant, Newburgh, 
for L.1400. It now belongs to Sir Thomas Moncrieffe, Bart.

The church of Potty continued an appendage to Dunbarny till 
1652, when, from the distance of its locality from the Dunbarny 
kirk, it was annexed to Dron quoad spiritualia ; but, for long 
after this date, it was connected with this parish quoad civilia. In 
the valuations of the county of Perth, taken in 1649 and 1667, 
part of Balmanno estate, Kirkpotta, Meikle Fielde, and Cloch- 
ridgestone, are marked as constituent parts of Dunbarny, though 
they now belong to Dron. 

It appears, that, in 1645, shortly before the battle of Kilsyth, 
the camp of the Covenanters was pitched at Kilgraston, in this 
parish.  Vide Wishart's Memoirs of Montrose. 

Eminent Men. — Robert Craigie of Glendoic, Lord President 
of the Court of Session. He was son of Laurence Craigie of 
Kilgraston, born in the year 1685, and admitted advocate Sd Ja- 
nuary 1710. " He was appointed Lord Advocate, in the room 
of Charles Erskine of Tinwald, 4th March 1742; and, on the 
death of Robert Dundas of Arniston, was promoted to be Presi- 
dent of the Court of Session, and took his seat on the 2d of Fe- 
bruary 1754. He was named by patent, 18th June 1755, one of 
the Commissioners for improving the fisheries and manufactures 
of Scotland. Of this judge Lord Woodhouselee observes, " He 
united, to a very profound knowledge of the laws, and an under- 
standing peculiarly turned to the unfolding of the systematic in- 
tricacies of the feudal doctrines, the most persevering industry, 
which, introducing him to notice in some remarkable cases where 
those talents are peculiarly requisite, were the foundation of a very 
extensive practice at the bar. His rise to eminence, however, was 
slow, as he had none of the exterior accomplishments that attract 
attention ; and, though an acute and able reasoner, his manner of 
pleading was dry, prolix, and deficient both in grace and energy. 
In the earlier part of his life, he had, for several years, given private 
lectures in his chambers to students of the law, before he had any 
considerable business as a barrister; but his industry, and the gra- 
dually prevailing opinion of his deep acquaintance with jurispru- 
dence, overcame at length every obstacle, and he rose to the first 
rank among the counsel who were his contemporaries. His Lord- 
ship died 10th March 1760

John Grant, Esq. who purchased Kilgraston in the year 1784. 
He was several years a Member of the Assembly and an Assist- 
ant Judge of the Supreme Court, in the Island of Jamaica, where 
he obtained the office of Chief Justice. He died at Edinburgh, 
the 29th of March 1793, and was interred in the West Church 
burying-ground, Edinburgh. He was connected with this parish 
only by the purchase of property. 

Mr John Bonar, minister of Torphichen. The session register 
bears, that he was born on the 16th January 1671, and baptized 
on the 18th January, by Mr John Wemyss, minister of Dunbarny. 
He presided over the spiritual welfare of the inhabitants of Tor- 
phichen from 1693 to 1747. He had the honour of being the 
last of the twelve « marrow men" to whom the twelve queries 
were sent by the Commission of the General Assembly of 1721; 
but, after the answers were returned to the transmitted queries by 
the eleven others, he was seized with indisposition, and unable to 
give his personal attendance. He was well known as a zealous 
and godly minister. Mr George Whitfield commends him for 
his ardent zeal in the cause of Christ. He published a sermon 
m 1719; and afterwards a large and interesting letter to a society 
of young men in Edinburgh, on prayer meeting. 

• He was father of the Rev. Mr Bonar of Fetlar, grandfather of Mr Bonar of 
Perth, great-grandfather of the eloquent and heavenly-minded Mr Archibald Bonar 
who was successively minister in Glasgow, Newburn, and Cramond, and the author 
of two volumes of sermons; the great-great-grandfather of the Bonars ministers in 
Larbert, Greenock, Kelso, and Collace. The family from which Mr Bonar sprung 
were portioners or small heritors in the parish of Dunbarny. 

In a statement of the families who possessed the lands of Kilgraston in 165 which 
we have seen, the following notice occurs :_« Johannes Bonnar, portionarius de 
Kilgnston, haeres Euphemiae Bonar, matris." About the year 1658, one of the Bo 
pars, who is described as being an heritor in this parish, is represented as applying: 
in that capacity for a seat in the church. This family are mentioned in a charter of 
James V extending as far back as 1540. Not one individual of that name now re- 
sides in this quarter.

Land-owners.— Sir Thomas Moncrieffe of Moncrieffe, Bart. 
The present family of Moncrieffe is a younger branch of the ori- 
ginal family of that name. Matthew de Moncrieffe, great-great - 
grandson of Ramerus de Moncrieffe, the founder of the family, 
and who was keeper of the wardrobe to King Alexander I., ob- 
tained a charter of the lands of Moncrieffe from Sir Roger de 
Mowbray, the superior of them. This charter has no date ; a cir- 
cumstance not uncommon at that period. Matthew got the same 
lands erected into a barony by Alexander II., February 1, 1248, 
therefore the charter must have been received previous to that 
date.  

His lineal descendant, Sir John Moncrieffe, the second baronet 
of the family, was obliged, from his extremely embarrassed circum- 
stances, to sell the estate of Moncrieffe, which was purchased in 
1666, by Mr Thomas Moncrieffe, his cousin, who was created a 
baronet by King James VII. of Scotland, by his royal letter pa- 
tent to him and his heirs male, dated the 30th of November 1685. 
He was clerk of the Exchequer and Treasury, and had realized 
great wealth by the situations he occupied. He was founder of 
that branch of the Moncrieffe family from which the present Sir 
Thomas Moncrieffe of Moncrieffe is descended. The mansion-house 
of Moncrieffe was erected by him in 1679. It is nearly of a square 
form, and resembles the structures of that period. The armorial 
bearings of Sir Thomas and his lady are cut in stone over the 
principal door ; the latter belonged to the family of Hamilton, and 
her armorial bearings are impaled with those of .the Moncrieffe fa- 
mily. It is to this lady that the parish is indebted for the two silver 
communion cups it at present possesses. The following inscription 
is engraved upon them : "Dam. Betha. Hamilton, Spouse to Sir 
Thomas Moncrieffe of that Ilk, left in legacy those two cups to the 

3. 1681. A charter was given to Mr David Oliphant of Colcuquhar, eldest son of 
Mr William Oliphant, under the Great Seal, at Hayston Court, to ratify to him and 
his heirs the barony of Forgandenny, and also, inter alia, " All and hail the two 
parts of the shady half of that oxgate land of Pitcaithlie, called the oxgate of Pitcaith- 
lie, with tennents, tennendries, service of free tennents thereof, lying betwixt the lands 
of Pitcaithlie and the lands of Kilgerstoun, within th eparochin of Dunbariiie, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
also the toun and lands of Ardargie, with the privilege of erecting a burgh of barony 
on the west end of the toun and lands of Forgandenny, or on any part adjacent thereto, 
with weekly mercats thereof, to be holden on Tuesday weekly, with the free fairs 
of the same twice in the year, one on the 10th June, the other the 20th October, 
yearly, with all the tolls and customs, casualties, and duties, of the said burgh of ba- 
rony, and as partially mentioned in the infcftment of the same granted by King 
Charles I. of ever-blessed memory, to Sir James Oliphant of Newton, of date, at 
Ha'yrude House, 23d June 1630." — See Acts of Parliament of Scotland.

2c. Sir Thomas dying without issue, his estate and title de- 
volved on his nephew, Thomas, who was the second baronet of 
this branch of the family. He married Margaret, daughter of 
David Smyth, Esq. of Methven. His second son, David, became 
Moncrieffe of Moredun, and was one of the Barons of Exchequer 
in Scotland. Sir Thomas died in 1738, and was succeeded by his 
eldest son, 

3d. Sir Thomas Moncrieffe of Moncrieffe, the third baronet, who 
married Catherine, daughter of Sir William Murray of Ochter- 
tyre, Bart. He died in 1739, and was succeeded by his eldest 
son, 

4th. Sir William Moncrieffe, the fourth baronet. He married 
Clara Guthrie, daughter of Guthrie of Craigs. He was succeed- 
ed by his son, 

5th. Sir Thomas Moncrieffe, the fifth baronet. He married 
Lady Elizabeth Ramsay, daughter of the Earl of Dalhousie, by 
whom he had one son, 

6th. Sir David, who was the sixth baronet, and father of the 
present, being the seventh baronet, and the fifteenth generation 
of this ancient family, in a direct male line, reckoning from Mat- 
thew de Moncrieffe. The mansion-house of Moncrieffe contains a 
number of paintings, the most valuable of which is a full-length 
portrait of Charles II. in his coronation robes. The ancient man- 
sion stood nearly half-way between the present house and the cha- 
pel. There is a tradition that a subterranean gallery communi- 
cated between this ancient building and the vault of the old cha- 
pel. It is now closed up. 

There are two bursaries, the patronage of which is vested in 
the family of Moncrieffe. The history of their origin may be 
comprised in a few sentences. Henry White, Dean of Brechin, 
in the year 1554, mortified 800 merks for the maintenance of two 
bursars, one in St Mary's College, and the other in St Salvator's. 
The right of presentation to these two bursaries was afterwards 
disponed to Sir John Moncrieffe of that Ilk. His descendant, Sir 
Thomas Moncrieffe, in order to afford a more liberal subsistence 
to the said bursars, mortified, in the year 1701, the sum of 4000 
merks, of which the one-half was allotted to the New or St Mary's 
College, and the other to St Salvator's or the United College. 
The bursar of St Mary's must be a regular student of divinity,

and is entitled to a seat at the College table, in lieu of which he 
now receives, along with the eight foundation bursars, an allowance 
amounting annually to two bolls of wheat, two of oats, and five of 
bear, and L. 1, 17s. Sd. Sterling, the victual to be converted 
every session at the Fife fiars prices for the crop immediately 
preceding. The annual allowance to each bursar from the United 
College for four years is L.5, 1 Is. 1 d. One of the colleges pur- 
chased from Mr Thomas Halyburton the lands of New Grange, 
in the parish of St Andrews, amounting to eleven and a-half acres, 
with the sum of 2000 merks left by Sir Thomas Moncrieffe, and 
some other monies added to it, composing altogether the sum of 
3750 merks. 

John Grant, Esq. of Kilgraston. . Mr Grant's family is that 
of the Grants of Glenlochy, lineally descended from the family 
of the Grants of Grant, the chiefs of the clan of that ancient 
name. Kilgraston was purchased towards the end of last century 
by John Grant, Esq., who was succeeded by his brother, Francis 
Grant, Esq., the father of the present proprietor. The mansion, 
which is large and commodious, is in the Grecian style of archi- 
tecture. It contains a collection of valuable pictures. Amongst 
ihese is an allegorical representation of a legend of St Louis by 
Guercino, measuring 12 feet by 9. It illustrates a story related 
of Louis IX., that, having been seized with a brain fever, he sent 
for his confessor, and vowed, in the event of recovery, his abdica- 
tion of the crown and assumption of the cowl. It is farther stated 
that, having been restored to health, his Queen induced him to 
believe, that a vow taken under these circumstances could not be 
binding, and that, as there were many religious monks and few 
religious kings, he was likely to do more for the glory of God in 
the latter than in the former capacity. The picture, which is one 
of Guercino's finest works, represents St Louis with his hair closely 
cut off, having assumed the surplice, with the crown of France and 
the Jleur-de-lis at his feet, presenting himself before the guardian 
angel of France, while a seraph is crowning him with a heavenly 
chaplet. A choir of angels heads the composition. There are 
likewise among the most remarkable pictures, a head of the Sa- 
viour and of the Virgin by Leonardo da Vinci ; a fine " Corona- 
tion with Thorns," by Schedoni ; a beautiful portrait of a child by 

 Evidence, oral and documentary, of the Royal Commissioners for St Andrews 
in 1827.

graston stands in a spacious and wooded park. 

George Clerk Craigie, Esq. of Dunbarny. Mr Craigie is a 
branch of the family of Craigies who possessed Kilgraston, and 
of whom several were elders in this parish. They were remark- 
able for the elegant improvements they made on their estates ; and 
it is to their public spirit that the community is indebted for seve- 
ral avenues of trees which adorn the roads in the parish. 

Small Keir, Esq. of Kinmonth, who has no place of residence 
in the parish. 

Alexander Stoddart, Esq. of Ballendrick. The House of 
Ballendrick, as well as all the buildings connected with it, was 
erected about seventeen years ago. The steading attached to it 
is most commodious and complete. There are on Mr Stoddart's 
property a few neat and substantial cottages, built with foreign 
wood, and slated ; they are occupied by labourers and artisans in 
his employment. 

Parochial Registers. — These compose eight volumes, viz. two 
in quarto and six in folio. The register of baptisms is comprised 
in the two quarto volumes, and commences in 1594. The session- 

 Ballendrick is a word of Gaelic etymology, and probably signifies " the town of 
the blae-berries" or bilberries. Baile in Gaelic means a city or village, lann, a house, 
repository, or church Shaw's Gaelic Dictionary , and dcarc or dearc roide a bil or 
blae-berry ; hence Ba/enderick or Baile-lunn dearc, as Ballendrick denotes " the town 
of the land" or " church of the bil-berries." " Hence," says the writer of the old Ac- 
count of the parish of Lanark, rt Lan dcareach signifies also bilberry-land or reposi- 
tory, pretty descriptive of all the Lanarks, such as Drumlanark, in Dumfries-shire, 
Lanark, in Stirlingshire," &amp;c. Most of the names of places in this district, as well as 
in Fife, Kinross, &amp;c. are of Celtic origin. This need not excite surprise when we 
remember, that the Gaelic language was spoken, even in the lowlantis of Scotland, 
from a. d. 843 to 1097, and to a considerably later period. Even so late as the be- 
ginning of the sixteenth century, Major the historian and Munster inform us, that 
one-half of the Scottish people spoke Gaelic. It can be proved, from many existing 
ancient charters, that, about the year 1130, in a controversy decided about the lands 
of Kirkness, near Loch Leven, where Constantine, the Earl of Fife, and Great Judge 
in Scotland, and Macbeth, Thane of Falkland, were present, as well as at a peram- 
bulation of land at the Mearns, and of other lands in Fife, about a d. 1190 and 
1231, the names of the persons who composed the jurymen were all Gaelic, e.g. 
Gillie Constantin, Gillicolm, Gillipatrick, &amp;c. An ecclesiastical council to reform 
abuses and novelties that had crept into the Scottish Church, was convened in a. n. 
1074. A difficulty soon occurred when the council met. The Scottish clergy could 
speak nothing but Gaelic; Margaret, the Queen, who was the principal prolocutor, 
could speak nothing but Saxon ; the King, Malcolm III., who understood the Eng- 
lish language from his long residence there as well as the Gaelic his native 
tongue, acted as interpreter, in imitation of Oswald the Northumbrian at a similar 
conference.

records or minutes of discipline begin at the date of April 27th, 
1657. In all probability two volumes of these records are lost, 
one embracing the occurrences of some years previous to 1 594, 
and the other commencing with that date. The volumes which 
are extant have been kept with great accuracy and minuteness, 
except a few chasms during the period of the Revolution in 1688, 
the Rebellions in 1715 and 1745, and for more than a year about 
1777 through the culpable negligence of the session-clerk, for 
which he was dismissed from his office, they are nearly entire, 
and exhibit an interesting and curious account of the fidelity and 
benevolence of the session, and the slate of education and manners 
among the population for nearly two centuries. 

The register of deaths, or, as it is entitled, " the names of the 
defunct persons," begins on December 1st 1598, and ends in Oc- 
tober 1615, after which there is merely a record of mortcloths. 
The register of proclamations of marriages dates from February 
1598, but a few blanks occur in it as well as in the register of 
baptisms. The register of collections for the poor, entitled " dis- 
tributions to the misterfull within ye parochin of Dunbarney," be- 
gins in November 1600. The poor were at that date carefully 
distributed into three classes. 

Antiquities. — Reference has been already made to the chapel 
of Moncreiffe, as constituting an appendage to the church of Dun- 

 The following entries occur in the session records. The first refers to a period 
during which the plague committed great ravages in this district. " September 25th 
1608, Thair is inteimission of 3 Sundays, and yat in respect of ye plague."—" The 
town of Perth being taken by Mar's rebel army, September 16th 1715, no sermon 
was here till February 12th 1716." Such was the disturbed and agitated state of this 
part of the country at that period, that for several months no public worship was per- 
formed in the parish church of Dunbarny. This may be easily understood by the 
following statement. When the Earl of Mar projected the scheme of his insurrection 
in favour or the Pretender, he found the disposition of the Highlanders most favour- 
able for his enterprise. After placing himself at the head of a formidable body of 
which the Highlanders composed the most effective portion he fixed his head quar- 
ters at Perth. After the battle of Sheriffniuir, the clans perceiving that they had 
gained no advantage, uttered murmurs of discontent, many of them returned home 
and some became mutinous, while the royal army received accessions by reinforce- 
ments from England. During this interval, the vicinity of Perth was in a state of 
turbulence from the swarms of Highlanders passing by the Bridge of Earn, some of 
whom committed acts of violence in the church and parish school- house ' In the

all the towns through which he passed, arrived at Scoon on the 7th of June Soon 
after this, the intelligence that the Duke of Argyle was in full march to attack him

barny. It stood about 300 yards south-east from the present 
mansion-house. Its dilapidated ruins still exist, though so deeply 
embosomed in wood, that a stranger may be near it without being 
aware of its existence, from the thick foliage of the trees and ever- 
greens by which it is surrounded. Bones occasionally dug up, 
and other appearances, as well as the uniform voice of tradition, 
concur in proving that the ground encircling it was used as a ce- 
metery. The interior of it is used as a burying-place by the fa- 
mily of Moncrieffe, where the ashes of many successive generations 
repose. The walls of the edifice are nearly entire, though not a 
vestige of the roof remains. It is 30 feet long, 18 broad, and the 
walls 10 feet high. It has a north aisle, containing a vault under- 
neath, and a small belfry at the east gable, the bell formerly be- 
longing to which is still preserved in the House of Moncrieffe. This 
ancient and venerable pile is thickly overgrown with mantling ivy, 
and has a solemn aspect suitable to the spot where the bones of 
so many illustrious men are mouldering to decay. Douglas states 
in his Baronage, that at so remote an era as 1357, Duncan Mon- 
creiffe of that Ilk and his lady were buried here. The families of 
the MoncriefTes of Tippermalach, and the Moncrieffes of Kin- 
month were at one time interred within the same chapel. The 
remains of an edifice which constituted the residence of the lat- 
ter family, may still be seen a little to the west of Easter Mon- 
crieffe; a part only of the walls have survived the ravages of time. 

 George Moncrieffe, son of Sir Malcolm Moncrieffe, who was appointed by King 
James II. one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Judicature, now called Lords 
of Session, was the ancestor of the old family of Tippermalach. His lineal descend- 
ants possessed the estate of Tippermalach from 1473 to 1664 or 1666. Matthew 
Moncrieffe, brother of the said George Moncrieffe, was ancestor of the family of East- 
er Moncrieffe. He married Christian Mauld, the heiress of Easter Moncrieffe, in 
1447, and had by her two sons, John and Archibald. John succeeded him, but died 
without issue in 1514; he was then represented by Archibald, who had two sons, 
John and James. The history of these two brothers is connected with some facts re- 
lative to the ancient property of the church. " Adam Foreman, the last prior of the 
charter-house near Perth, when his house was demolished by the Reformers, retired 
with his brethren to lirrol, of which church they were patrons, and there he let out, 
with consent of those who staid at home, to John Foreman, son and heir to Robert 
Foreman of Luthrie, for a sum of money, — Terras suas de sacello beatte Marine 
Magdalenae the Magdalene lands nuncuptas, terras de Frireton, terras de Craigie, 
et insulam australem burgi de Perth, tenacum piscaria sua salmonum, super 
aquam de Taye infra vice comitatu de Perth. This charter is granted to John Fore- 
man, but the lands specified came all into the possession of the family of Moncrieffe, 
to whom the Foremans were nearly allied, and have ever since belonged to them ; for, 
contemporaneous with the granting of the above-mentioned charter to John Fore- 
man, the property of the charterhouse itself, with the houses, grounds, and gardens 
connected with it, was sold to John Moncrief, the eldest of the brothers, previously 
referred to by a charter dated 14th November 1569, and this deed is afterwards con- 
firmed by a charter from James VI. dated 18th May 1572, in favour of his brother, 
James, who succeeded him, and who is there designated Jacobus filius Archibaldi 
Moncreif de Easter Moncreif."

Kirk Pottie. — The church of Kirk Pottie was situated about 
three miles south from the Bridge of Earn, at the entrance to the 
north end of Glen Farg. Its ruins have been swept away within 
the last twelve years, and the site on which it stood, with the 
burial-ground belonging to it, are now occupied by the garden 
and dwelling-house of the tenant of Kirk Pottie Mill. 

A few hundred yards west from Moncrieffe House, on the north 
side of the avenue, may be seen what is supposed by some to be 
the vestiges of a small Druidical temple, consisting of a circle of 
eleven rude stones of ten feet in diameter. In the centre of it is 
a tree that was planted on the birthday of the present possessor 
of Moncrieffe. 

On the summit of Moncrieffe or Moreden hill, i. e. the large 
hill, the distinct traces of a fortification may be seen. There is 
a circular fosse about sixteen yards in diameter ; in its centre stood 
Carnac fort, which belonged to the Picts, whose monarchs during 
the eighth and ninth centuries fixed their capital at Abernethy, 
about four or five miles south-east from the Bridge of Earn. On 
the tops of several hills in this vicinity, as well as in other parts of 
Scotland, fortresses were erected in ancient times, which served 
as watch-towers, where persons were stationed to give signals of 
approaching danger. This was the case on Tomahastle, a coni- 
cal eminence in the west of Strathearn, where the indubitable 
traces of a fort are conspicuous; it coincides with Moncrieffe Hill, 
in the important point of commanding an ample range of pro- 
spect, and was therefore well fitted for the purpose now men- 
tioned. 

Village of Dunbarny. — At a remote period, when the church 
stood on the Dunbarny property, a considerable village existed 
close to the mansion of Mr Craigie, occupying for a short distance 
each side of the road conducting from it to the Bridge of Earn, 
and which was till seventy years ago the only line of communica- 
tion between Forgandenny and the Bridge of Earn. It contained 
thirty-six families. For their accommodation, a ferry-boat plied 
on the Earn, in a line with the west wall of the old church-yard, 
after crossing which, the villagers travelled to Perth by the Hilton 
knowe, the field called the " Muckle Bank," and St Magdalen's 
farm. 

The Forest of Black Earnside. — The ancient forest of Black 
Earnside, or Black Ironside, extended along the banks of the 



DUNBARXY. 



811 



Earn, and probably received the designation of black from the 
deep overshadowing gloom of the trees. It was four miles in 
length and three in breadth, and was signalized by the adventures 
of Sir William Wallace, and especially by a sanguinary conflict 
which he there maintained with the English. 

This forest has been long cut down, but large masses of black 
oak, which are supposed to be the remains of it, are found im- 
bedded in the soil, along various parts of the territory over which 
it once stretched. A large tree of this black oak was dug up on 
the south bank of the Earn, having been found when an excava- 
tion was made for the foundation of the new bridge. The lintels 
of one of the houses in the Bridge of Earn were made out of it. 
Four hundred yards further down the river, the Earl of Mansfield, 
some years ago, employed a number of men nearly twelve days 
cutting an oak found there. Large pieces of the same valuable 
timber may be seen near the banks of the Earn, in the parish of 
Abernethy. 

Old Bridge of Earn. — The old bridge over the Earn was proba- 
bly built about 500 years ago. There is extant, among the records 
belonging to the abbacy of Scoone, an order from King Robert, 
the Bruce to the abbot and monks connected with it, to allow the 
magistrates of Perth the liberty of digging stones out of the quar- 
ries of Kincarochie and Balcormac for building the bridge of Tay 
and the bridge of Earn. The tenour of it is as follows : " Ro- 
bertas Dei gratia Rex Scotorum, religiosis Abbati et conventui 
de Scona, delectis et fidelibus suis, salutem, nos rogamus, qua- 
tenus, ad instantiam nostram concedere velitis licentiam capiendi 
lapicediorum de Kynkarochi et Balcormac, pro edificatione eccle- 
sise de Perth et Eryn, ita quod dicta licentia non cedat vobis in 
damnum aut prsejudicium. Datum apud Glascua quarta die Julii 
anno regni nostri vigesimo tertio." The above was granted a. d. 
1329. The bridge over the Earn was upheld till the Reforma- 
tion by the liberality of churchmen, who supplied stones for its 
repair as they had done for its original construction. It was com- 
posed of five arches, as an additional arch was reared about eighty 
years ago, in consequence of the inroads the water was making on 
the northern bank of the river. This constituted the fifth or last 
arch. 

When the new bridge was built, a fragment of the old one was 
left, comprehending two arches. This dilapidated ruin is begin-

Notices of the Ministers of Dunbarny since the Reformation. — 
1. Mr Patrick Wemyss was minister of Dunbarny, Potty, and Mon- 
crieffe in 1569, and probably the first minister placed at Dunbarny 
subsequent to the Reformation. His stipend is stated in the Re- 
gister of Ministers, Readers, and their Stipends, printed for the 
Maitland Club, to have been L.100 Scots, " now is providet to 
the kirk of Dumberny, and instantly gettis the thryd thereof, ex- 
tending to L.60, and also to 4 chaplanriis, quhilk will extend to 
L.40."f In 1594, his name appears at the .beginning of the 
oldest session register of baptisms, which commences in 1594. 
In 1599, his stipend is stated to be,  " thrid of the personage of 
Dumberny, Paty, and Moncrief, iclxxxli. i.e. L. 180, with manse 
and gleib, with the haill vicarage thairof lxli." i. e. L.60 Scots. 
In 1607, besides the above, there is added " the haill vicarage of 
Dron, with the thrid of the chaplanries of Dunkeld, called St Ni- 
nians and St Peter in Perth, xv. li. viiis. xd.," /. e. L.15, 8s. 
lOd. Scots. Mr Wemyss was living in 161 1, when he was pre- 
sent at the diocesan svnod at St Andrews; but in 1614 and 1615, 
the church is not mentioned in the books of assionation. 

It is proper to notice here the following statements, viz.§ " An- 
dro Disart, reidar," at Moncrieffe, i.e. at the old chapel of Mon- 
crieffe, where public worship seems to have been conducted then, 

• In an historical account of the internal government of the borough of Perth from 
1745 to 1785, submitted to the Committee of Convention by the committee for the 
guildry of Perth, the following notice of the old bridge occurs : «« By an act of James 
VI. the borough of Perth have right to a certain pontage at the Bridge of Earn, 
with the burden of upholding the bridge. Some years ago an arch of the bridge was 
thought insufficient, and was taken down. It was an arch not above SO feet wide, 
but the building of it cost the town considerably more than L.3000 Sterling, although 
a complete new bridge over the same river, about six miles above, viz. Bridget f 
Forteviot, was done by subscription for L.500 Sterling. This was not all,— for the 
county, before the arch was taken down, offered to take the burden on them, in all 
time coming, on being allowed the pontage. The town's managers refused that, ai d 
they draw about L.60 a year for it. If this was prudent management the disinte- 
rested will judge." 

The following notice of the old bridge is extracted from a MS. in the Advocates 1 
Library, Edinburgh : — 

" 22d January 1G14. Being Saturday, the northmost pend and bow of the Bridge 
of Erne fell down, being evil bigged from the beginning, filled only with clay and 
earth, and without any blind pend, as the Brig of Tay has been in the same manner 
formerly bigged of old. The burgh and shire, with all diligence v caused David Jac k 
and David Mill, craftsmen, put up the same with timber-work."

I have been unable to discover when Mr P. Wemyss died, or 
who was his successor, in consequence of the loss of the two oldest 
volumes of the presbytery register of Perth, the first of which be- 
gins about 1593. The third volume is the oldest one now in their 
possession, beginning only at the year 1618. But it appears from 
the MSS. of the late Rev. James Scott of Perth, which are now in 
the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, that there was a minister here 
named, 

2. Mr William Black, some time before 16th September 1622, 
and it appears that he either died here or was translated to an- 
other parish in 1623. 

3. Mr John Hall was ordained here 6th November 1623. He 
was called to Kilspindy and the annexed kirk of Rait on 6th May 

1646, and admitted there on the 27th of May 1647. He was 
formerly a preacher in the bounds of St Andrews presbytery, and 
afterwards in Edinburgh. Several of Mr Hall's children were 
baptized in Perth, and their names inserted in the Perth session 
register. A considerable number of country ministers seems to 
have resided at this time in Perth, probably owing to the want of 
convenient manses. 

4. Mr Robert Young was presented by the town-council of 
Edinburgh, and ordained at Dunbarny on the 3d of February 

1647. This excellent minister was deposed after the Restoration 
on the 13th December 1664, by Archbishop Sharpe, for noncon- 
formity, by a sentence passed in the Archbishop's own chamber, 
only one minister being present. The circumstances attending 
the deposition are narrated in Wodrow's Church History,f and 
illustrate the character of Mr R. Young. 

Notices of Mr Robert Young are found in the presbytery re- 
gister of Perth, under the following dates, 19th March 1651 ; 
June 2d 1652, March 28th 1665, February 4th 1657, April 8th 
1657. 

It appears, from Wodrow's Church History, that Mr Young 
was alive in March 12, 1673. No notice can be traced of his 
subsequent history, with the exception of a short statement occur- 
ring in the session records. From this it appears, that such was 
the regard he entertained for the parish of Dunbarny, and such

his anxiety for the education of the poor residing in it, that, by 
his last will, dated at Edinburgh, 4th July 1677, he left or mor- 
tified to the kirk-session 500 merks, the interest of which was to 
be paid yearly to the schoolmaster for his " encouragement to 
teach puir bairns who are not able to pay quarter payment." 
He left also a similar sum, for like purposes, to the parish of 
Avondale, which was probably the place of his nativity  He had 
been one of the resolutioners, and, though a moderate man, was 
yet firm in his non-submission to Prelacy. 

A considerable interval now elapsed, during which only one 
sermon was preached in the parish church ; it extended from De- 
cember lb'64, to the 8th of June 1665, on which day, 

5. Mr John Wemyss, chaplain to Viscount Stormont, was or- 
dained at Dunbarny. He was son of Mr David Wemyss, minister 
ol Scone, who was ordained in 1620, and died in 1664, and he 
had three brothers ministers of the Church of Scotland, one of 
whom succeeded his father at Scone, while the other two exer- 
cised their pastoral functions at Lecropt and Aberdalgie respec- 
tively. He died on the 8th of June 1675.

presbytery bursars in 1658, 1659, and 1660; his allowance from 
the kirk-session was L.6, 5s. per annum. 

6. Mr John Omay, formerly minister of St Madoes, was ad- 
mitted here on the 12th of January 1676, and translated to Meth- 
ven about the 12th of June, where he was inducted on the 30th 
of July, and died in that parish after the Revolution, about the 
year 1693. 

7. Mr David Anderson, formerly Professor of Humanity in 
St Leonard's College, in the city of St Andrews, was admitted 
here on the 4th of September 1679, and transported to Perth 
with Alexander Ross on Wednesday the 27th of October 1680, 
" with all haste." He afterwards returned and preached a fare- 
well sermon at Dunbarny. Mr D. Anderson was ejected from 
the pastoral charge of Perth, soon after the battle of Killicrankie, 
27th of July 1689, from having been found guilty of dissatfection 
to the new Government. 

8. Mr John Balneaves, who had been assistant and successor 
to his father, Mr Alexander Balneaves, of Tibbermuir, was ad- 
mitted here on the 5th of January 1681. He was ejected at the 
Revolution. He was succeeded, after a considerable interval, by 

9. Mr John Tullidaph or Tullideflf, son of William Tullideff, 
Principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews, and who was 
supposed to have been one of the ministers ejected after the Re- 
storation. He was ordained here on the 14th of January 1691, 
and died the 26th of August 1714,f " after a long vacation of 
more than three years." 

 In the third, fourth, and fifth volumes of the session records, there is frequent 
allusion made to the pecuniary supplies annually given to bursars of theology. To 
elucidate these references, as well as the statement we have now given about Mr 
Wemyss, it may be mentioned, that it was a practice formerly prevalent in Scotland, 
and almost coeval with the Reformation, for every presbytery of the church to sup- 
port a bursar. " About the year 1641, it was enacted by the General Assembly, 
that every presbytery, consisting of twelve ministers, shall maintain a bursar of Di- 
vinity ; and where the presbytery is fewer than twelve, they shall be joined with 
those of another presbytery where the number exceeds." This injunction was cor- 
dially complied with ; for documents, still extant, demonstrate, that, at this time, 
there were at least seventy bursars of Theology. Their maintenance was derived 
from the kirk-session penalties, according to the provisions of an act of Assembly ; 
and every bursar was to have allotted to him at least L. 100 Socts. This act was 
suspended, by another finding of Assembly, and formally repealed in 1756. About 
the beginning of last century, there were, altogether, about 160 bursars of theology. 
See extracts from evidence before the University Commission in 1828. 

+ Extract from presbytery register: " The Episcopal incumbent, i. e. Mr 
John Balneaves, having been very early deprived of his office, the lairds of Kilgraston 
and Dumbarny presented a call to the presbytery, August 9th, 1690, in favour of 
Mr John Tullidaph, preacher of the Gospel, to be minister of Dumbarny. The 
presbytery finding several informalities in the call, and particularly that there was 
not yet a constituted session in that parish, first proceeded to ordain a qualified session 
here, and after this was clone, and all the necessary formalities observed, Mr John 
Tullidaph was ordained and admitted minister of Dumbarny, January 20th 1691." 
His son was the celebrated Mr Thomas Tullidaph, Principal of St Andrews.

10. Mr Thomas Finlayson was ordained here on the 11th of 
September 1717, and died on the 22d of May 1744. On the 
5th of May 1715, a popular call, by the heritors, elders, and heads 
of families, had been moderated in for Mr Chapman of Monedie ; 
but for some reason that cannot be now traced, he declined ac- 
cepting of it. 

11. Mr James Lindsay, minister of Laucher, was settled here 
in 1745, and translated to Lochmaben in 1750. 

12. Mr James Gillespie, minister of Abdy, was unanimously 
chosen minister here by the heritors, elders, and heads of fami- 
lies, and inducted on the 21st of March 1751. He was transport- 
ed to St Andrews on the 25th of October 1757, where he was 
invested with the office of Principal. Mr George Lyon of Strath- 
miglo received a call to succeed him in the pastoral office ; but he 
does not appear to have complied with it. 

13. Mr David Beatson, preacher in the parish of Kinross, was 
called on the 4th of February, and ordained on the 10th of May 
1759. He died here in 1795, and was succeeded by his son. 

14. Mr James Beatson, minister of Kingsbarns, who was in- 
ducted on the 26th of November 1795, and died on the 17th of 
November 1820. 

15. Mr now Dr Anderson was inducted here on the 9th of 
August 1821. He was translated to Newburgh in 1830, and 
succeeded by the present incumbent on the 23d of January 
1834. 

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish has undergone great fluctuations. 
In 1755, it was 764; in 1759, 600, in consequence of proprietors 
letting out the lands in small possessions. It increased in 1774, 
to 1026; in 1792, to 1260. The village of the Bridge of Earn 
was erected in a great measure subsequent to the date last men- 
tioned ; but any accession it has brought to the population has 
been more than compensated by the diminution arising from the 
contemporaneous abolition of the small farms. 

The population, in 1801, was . 1066 

1811, . 1037 

1621, . 1164 

1831, . 1162 

1841, 1105 

If we may draw any inference from the number of baptisms in 
former times as compared with the present, it would seem that 
from 1658 to 1700 the population was larger than at any subse-

quent period, for the average amount of baptisms annually was, 
from 1658 to 1700, 35, considerably higher than it has since been. 
After 1700 it seems slowly to have declined, till, in 1755, it was 
reduced to 764.

The average rate of mortality for the last ten years is 12, or one 
in the hundred; a remarkable proof of the extreme salubrity of 
this district. The average number of births and marriages can- 
not be given with an approximation to rigid accuracy. 

Villages.— The Bridge of Earn may be said to consist of two 
villages, an old and a new. The first houses which existed in the 
Bridge of Earn were built by Mr John Gilloch, wright and un- 
dertaker, who obtained, about 1769, a ninety-nine years' lease of 
an acre and a half of ground, from Sir William Moncrieffe, com- 
prehending the tract of land between the old bridge of Earn and 
Seales bridge. 

Alexander Wilson purchased from him the houses next the old 
bridge; but there was astipulation in the bargain that L.l per 
annum would still be paid to him for what is called the shore, or 
beach where ships unload their goods. Hence, when the former 
sold one of his houses with the shore to Robert Ford, the latter 
was bound to pay L.l per annum to Mr Gilloch. Robert Ford's

to the bridge and disburden their cargoes there. 

Gilloch pays yearly a rent of L.3 to the house of Moncrieffe, 
and is bound at the end of the ninety-nine years' lease of which 
only thirty years are now to run to leave a house of the value of 
L.10 on each of the half acres above specified. 

f the Bridge of Earn was erected ten years 
ago. Its buildings are so disposed as to form a row or street, and 
have been much admired for the symmetrical regularity of their 
architecture. 

The village of Kintulloch is situated about half a mile south- 
west from the parish church, and is terminated by a magnificent

gateway, through which the principal approach to Kilgraston runs. 
It is possessed by cottagers and pendiclers, and is remarkable for 
the taste with which its inhabitants embellish the fronts of their 
houses, by means of evergreens and roses, and for the uncommon 
cleanliness by which their interior is marked. 

The word Kintulloch signifies, in Gaelic, the top of a gentle 
rising ground, or green eminence, and appropriately describes its 
situation, which is contiguous to a slope that rises from a brook 
that rolls a little to the south. The most remote allusion we can 
find to the lands of Kintulloch is in Chalmers's Caledonia, Vol. i. 
p. 590. " Hugh Say, an Englishman, obtained a grant of the 
lands of Kintulloch, in Perthshire, under William the Lion. His 
estate descended to Arabella, his sister, who married Reginald de 
Warrene. Reginald is a witness to a charter of William de 
Ruthven, Lord of Ruthven, during the reign of Alexander II. i. e. 
from 1214 to 1249. See charter of Scone-, 74. Arabella after 
the death of her husband, granted, in 1249, to the monks of 
Scone, a toft and a croft, with three acres of land, in her territory 
of Kuntilloch," lb. 65. Kintulloch, after passing successively 
through various hands, has devolved upon Mr Grant of Kil- 
graston. When it belonged to the Craigies of Dunbarny, its 
inhabitants were " thirled" to the wind-mill that stood a little to 
the west of Dunbarny House, and of which the remains may still 
be seen. 

IV. — Industry. 
Smi, Agriculture. — From the bridge of Forteviot to the con- 
fluence of the Tay with the Earn, there is along the banks of the 
latter a spacious tract of deep clay, chiefly of a brown colour. In 
the vicinity of the Bridge of Earn, there is a considerable number 
of feet below ground a stratum of moss, from one to three feet in 
thickness. It has been often observed when a shaft has been dug 
in the earth for finding water. Itis owing to the presence of this 
stratum for some hundred yards along the margin of the Earn, in 
the parish of Dunbarny, that no good water is obtained at the vil- 
lage of the Bridge of Earn, as, in every well of water dug there, 
the liquid is impregnated by a disagreeable infusion from the moss. 
In the village of Kintulloch, situated about half a mile from the 
river, that precious fluid is found in the utmost state of purity, 
because the moss does not extend so far. Various kinds of tim- 
ber and other vegetable substances are found imbedded in it, and 
uniformly with their trunks and stems stretched in a direction from 



DUNBARNY. 



819 



north-east to south-west. They have been sometimes employed 
as fuel, but not frequently, from the offensive smell which the 
burning of them diffuses. Below this moss and its load of super- 
incumbent clay there is a stratum of sand of 18 inches in thick- 
ness, and below it a variety of soils. This moss must, like that 
designated the Moss of Flanders, have been formed by the pro- 
gressive decay of vegetable substances, and especially trees. 

While in the soil along the Earn we may see fragments of im- 
bedded timber that grew many years ago, we sometimes see in its 
banks a phenomenon, which, though not leading us so far up the 
stream of time, is yet of an interesting character, that is, parts of 
branches of trees which, having become imbedded in the sand at the 
margin of the river, have been gradually petrified ; and it is easy 
to see how the process advanced. While the work of decompo- 
sition was going on in the vegetable substances, the particles of 
sand insinuated themselves into it, so that as each vegetable particle 
successively disappeared, it was replaced by a stony particle. Thus 
the sand or stony substance gradually occupied the spaces left vacant 
by the decay of the vegetable parts ; and, being moulded in their 
cavities, assumed the contexture of the original branch. The pe- 
trified wood presents such an exact imitation of the real wood, that, 
upon cutting it transversely, we can trace the concentric rings 
which marked the annual growth of the tree. About three miles 
above the bridge of Earn, many specimens of such petrified wood 
may be seen in a high bank close to the river. In several in- 
stances the petrifaction is complete, in others it is going on, the 
sand by degrees penetrating the decayed vegetable, and copying 
the exterior form of the organic body. to 

In this parish there is to be found every variety of soil, from a 
rich loam to the poorest clay. The lands on the south side of 
the river consist of a strong, wet, clay soil, and are very flat ; those 
on the north side consist chiefly of a rich loam ; while towards the 
west end of the parish a red stiff till predominates. The mode of 
cultivation varies considerably on the different properties. On the 
Moncrieffe estate, all the farms were formerly cultivated upon a four- 
shift rotation, viz. 1st, fallow or green crop ; 2d, wheat 3 3d, grass 3 
4th, oats; but latterly, in consequence of the tenants seldom or never 
fallowing the ground, and the green crop being almost entirely 
potatoes, with the exception of a few turnips to supply their milk- 
cows, and the potatoes being all disposed of for the London mar- 
ket, while in most cases no manure was purchased in lieu thereof, 



820 



PERTHSHIRE. 



it was deemed advisable not only to bind the tenant to purchase 
a certain quantity of manure for the green crop sold, but likewise, 
except on clay soils, to stipulate that the farm shall be cultivated 
on a six-shift rotation, viz. 1st, green crop or fallow; 2d, wheat or 
barley ; 3d, grass ; 4th, grass ; bill, oats ; 6th, oats ; or on a seven- 
shift rotation, — two years in green crop; two in white crop; two in 
grass, to be pastured the second year; and one in oats after pasture. 

These rotations were much objected to at first, but the tenants 
are now finding them more productive than the former severe me- 
thod of cropping, so much so, that they are followed by others in 
the neighbourhood who are not bound to adopt them ; and the 
proprietor of Moncrieffe affords every facility for his tenants doing 
so, by supplying them with wood, which is cut up at his saw-mill, 
for fencing the unenclosed lands, though it is arranged that they 
drive the carriages and erect the paling. On the greater part of 
the lands in the parish the following six-shift rotation is practised, 
viz. 1st, fallow or potatoes; 2d, wheat; 3d, beans or turnips; 4th, 
barley ; bth, grass ; 6th, oats.

Pasturage has become more common than formerly, as farmers 
find it conducive to their own interest to practise it, both because 
less manure is thus required, and the value of subsequent crops 
is thereby increased. The ground is pastured chiefly by cattle, 
few of the tenants having as yet introduced sheep to their farms. 
Some, however, are beginning to use sheep for eating off their 
turnips. 

In most, of the farms of this parish potatoes, and those chiefly 
of the Perthshire red, are planted. They are exported chiefly to 
the London market ; and, generally speaking, the cultivation of 
the potato remunerates the farmer more than any other crop, on 
all those farms where the soil is adapted to the culture of this 
root. When the last Statistical Account of this parish was writ- 
ten, not two acres of potatoes were cultivated in any of the largest 
farms, whereas now, on a farm of fifteen acres, two acres are oc- 
cupied by their growth. About 6000 bolls are annually exported 
from the Earn to London and Newcastle. 

Turnips as well as potatoes are cultivated to a much greater 
extent than formerly, and are consumed principally by the cattle 
reared on the farms. A few cattle are fattened in this parish, but

no operations of this kind are carried on to the same extent as in 
many other places. 

Rent. — The average rent of land per acre is L.2, 10s. The 
duration of leases is generally nineteen years, except in special 
cases, and they are framed on equitable terms to the occupier, the 
proprietors always considering any unfavourable stipulation in- 
curred by the tenant as inimical to their own interest. 

Produce. — The following is a statement of the agricultural pro- 
duce of this parish. 

Of 2640 acres under culture —

The rental of the parish is nearly L.7000. 

The produce of the orchards in the parish not included in the 
2640 acres is L.120. 

The parish has of late years been much improved by draining. 

Manufactures. — There are eleven looms in operation in this pa- 
rish, and chiefly for linen fabrics. 

V. — Pahochial Economy. 

Market-Towns Sfc. — The nearest market- town to the Bridge 
of Earn is Perth, at the distance of four miles to the north-west. 
The Bridge of Earn is a post-town, and from it runners go to 
Newburgh, Dunning, and Auchterarder, delivering letters at these 
and the various intermediate places. The post-office here yields 
to Government an annual revenue of L.300. 

Several coaches pass through the Bridge of Earn every day, 

two mail-coaches, the Coburg, the Aberdeen Defiance, pass and 
repass in travelling between Edinburgh and Perth, and the Fife 
Defiance does the same between Perth and Kirkcaldy. There is 
one toll-road in this parish, which traverses its surface the length 
of three miles, being part of the great northern road. Besides it, 
there are four good statute-labour roads ; one of these is the old

turnpike, which intersected it, in passing from the Wicks of Beglie 
to the old bridge. 

The greater part of the parish is inclosed, and the fences are 
kept in good condition. 

Bridges. — The foundation stone of the new bridge was laid in 
May 1821, and the whole fabric was completed in the same year. 
It consists of three elliptic arches, each being 75 feet in span ; 
the width of the bridge is 24 feet over the parapet ; the roadway 
is about 28 feet above the bed of the river, and the total length 
of the masonry, including the wing or parapet walls, is 345 feet. 
The bridge was reared at the expense of L. 16,000 by the city of 
Perth. To reimburse them for this large outlay, a pontage' was 
put upon it which yields an annual return of nearly L.1000. The 
farmers on the estate of Moncrieffe might have been exempted 
from the payment of this pontage ; but Sir David Moncrieffe, ac- 
tuated by a spirit of uncommon liberality, was contented to forego 
this privilege. When it was opened, foot-passengers were charg- 
ed a halfpenny every time they passed along ; but, by the kind in- 
tervention of Sir David, this tax was abolished. 

There are two small bridges over a little stream which consists 
of two branches, one issuing from the Ochils in this parish, and 
the other from Forgandenny, which form a junction near Pitkeath- 
ly House, and formerly impelled the machinery of three mills. 
One of these bridges is near the west end of Kintillo, and, as ap- 
pears from the parochial registers, was originally built, and long 
maintained by the church door collections. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The present church of Dunbarny was 
erected in the year 1787, and can accommodate 651 persons, al- 
lowing 18 inches to each. No seat rents are exacted. It occu- 
pies a central position in the parish. The greatest distance at 
which any of the inhabitants reside from it is three miles, and, 
perhaps, this is one cause of the extreme regularity with which 
they attend the dispensation of public ordinances. The number 
of communicants is 400. Previous to the year 1787, a church 
stood a few yards west from the site of the present ecclesiastical 
fabric. It was erected in the year 1684, but was taken down not 
from any decay in its materials, but because it was not of sufficient 
dimensions to accommodate the whole population, which was doubled 
between the years 1759 and 1787. Previous to 1684, the parish 
church stood a mile west from the Bridge of Earn, in the burying- 
ground near the mansion of Dunbarny. This site being near the 



DUNBARNY 



823 



extremity of the parish was found very inconvenient, and on this 
account it was judged necessary to transfer it to the Bridge of 
Earn. In 1684, while the church was building, public worship 
was observed in the chapel at Moncrieffe. The ancient house 
stood in the hollow immediately south from the place of sepulture, 
at Dunbarny, and was constructed of clay and turf. The old 
burying-ground is still used as a cemetery. It is defended by a 
substantial stone wall of 10 feet high. It is situated on an ele- 
vated spot about one third of a mile from the Earn, and in it stood 
the ancient kirk of Dunbarny. The modern church-yard at the 
Bridge of Earn was formed partly in the year 1821, and partly 
some years after. It is altogether artificial, being composed of 
2000 carts of sand conveyed from the banks of the river. The 
present manse was erected in the year 1775. A handsome addi- 
tion of two capacious public rooms was subsequently made to it 
on the north side by the Rev. James Beatson, at his personal ex- 
pense. The glebe consists of seven acres, and its annual value 
may be estimated at L. 28. The stipend is as follows : Wheat, 
16 bolls, 2firlots, 0 pecks, 2 lippies : meal, 114 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 
pecks, 3 lippies ; bear, 67 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks, 2 lippies; money 
L.2, 13s. 7d. with a vicarage teind of 44 loads of coal, reckoning 
the load 2s. 6d. 

The number of Dissenting families in this parish is 20. Of 
these, 3 are Episcopalians, 3 belong to the Relief body, 13 to the 
Associate synod, and 1 to Mr Pitcairn's congregation, or the Ir- 
vingites, Perth. There is no Dissenting chapel in the parish. 

Poor. — The church collections average yearly about L. 63, 
which sum, together with the interest of L.200 belonging to the 
session, mortcloth and proclamation money, amounts to L. 80. 
There is a voluntary contribution made by the heritors, varying 
according to the exigencies of each year. About L.100 is distri- 
buted to the poor annually. The number of regular paupers is 
17, and the largest allowance 10s. per month. There are about 
12 occasional paupers. 

Education. — With regard to education, this parish enjoys pecu- 
liar advantages. So far as can be ascertained, there are no chil- 
dren above six years of age who cannot read ; and all above fif- 
teen have been taught both writing and reading. Ample provi- 
sion has been made for affording instruction to the poorest. In 
1677, the Rev. Robert Young mortified 500 merks, which bene- 
volent provision was afterwards increased by John Craigie, Esq.

of Dunbarny, who, in 1743, mortified L. 5 Sterling; and still 
more by the late Rev. James Beatson, who, in 1820, mortified 
L.108 Sterling, the annual interest of which sums is paid to the 
schoolmaster for teaching poor children. Shortly after the pre- 
sent teacher was appointed, the late Sir David Moncrieffe of 
Moncrieffe, Bart., bequeathed to the school a bursary of L. 100 
Scots, to be awarded as a prize to the best classical scholar ; and 
in addition to the above mortifications for the education of the poor, 
the Right Hon. Lady Lucy Grant of Kilgraston allows annually the 
sum of L.5 Sterling limited to the present teacher for the same be- 
nevolent purpose. The parochial teacher's salary is the maximum. 
The school is commodiously situated, and the dwelling-house is a 
neat modern fabric. 

Fuel. — The parish is provided with coal principally from Kelty, 
Lochgelly, and other districts in Fifeshire, besides supplies con- 
veyed from the neighbourhood of Newcastle to the Bridge of Earn 
in small vessels by the river Earn, and which are sold about the 
same p-ice as in Perth. 

Cottages. — At Craigend on the Edinburgh road, about two miles 
from Perth, the Moncrieffe family have erected a number of ele- 
gant cottages, which have a certain space of ground for gardens 
attached to them. They are built with projecting eaves somewhat 
in the English style. Three years ago, the Highland Society 
agreed to award ten prizes to such cottagers in the county of 
Perth, paying L.5 of yearly rent or under, whose cottages should 
be distinguished by general neatness and cleanliness, and whose 
gardens should be laid out and kept with a superior style of taste- 
fulness and elegance. The inhabitants of five of the Craigend 
cottages became competitors for these prizes, and the first five of 
the prizes held out to the whole county were adjudged to them. 

Libraries. — A public library was established in this parish many 
years ago. It comprises 300 volumes, consisting of standard works 
in history, divinity, and other departments of knowledge. There 
is also a library connected with the Sabbath-school, containing 
250 volumes on religious subjects, which are read with the great- 
est avidity. 

Savings-Bank. — There was a Savings-bank organized in the pa- 
rish some years ago, but it was dissolved through a groundless ap- 
prehension, very generally diffused through the country, that 
Government wished to appropriate the funds of such institu- 
tions. 



INCHTURE.

Ale-houses. — There are 11 public-houses in this parish, exclu- 
sive of the MoncrierTe Hotel. 

Besides the provision made for the education of poor children 
already adverted to, there were several sums of money mortified 
by the Rev. James Beatson, and which are entitled " Beatson's 
mortified sums," and which are to be appropriated to the benefit 
of Dunbarny parish. After the legacy-duty was deducted, these 
amounted to L.378. The sum of L.30 was mortified by the mo- 
ther of the Rev. James Beatson, the interest of which was to be a 
stated annual fund, providing a salary for a Sabbath-school teacher 
in the parish of Dunbarny.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. J. A. HONEY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name Inchture, it has been suggested, is probably 
derived from the Gaelic words innis, an island, and ear, the east, 
— the eminence on which the church and village stand being the 
eastern of those elevations in the Carse of Gowrie, which were 
anciently islands. 

Situation. — It is situated to the north of the estuary of the Tay, 
in the county of Perth, between Perth and Dundee, thirteen miles 
from the former, and 9 from the latter. 

Extent. — In extent it measures about 4 miles from north to 
south, and about 3 miles from east to west; and contains an area 
of about 12 square miles. 

Boundaries. — On the east, it is bounded by the parish of Long- 
'forgan ; on the south, by the Frith of Tay ; on the west, by the 
parishes of Errol and Kinnaird ; and on the north, by those of 
Abernvte and Longforgan. In figure it is nearly an oblong. 

Topographical Appearances. — Looking at the parish when the 
tide has ebbed, we have, first of all, several hundred acres of sand- 
banks indented by " water-runs," &amp;c. the seaward course of the 
" Pow," numerous temporary embankments, and a pretty broad 



820 



PERTHSHIRE. 



fringe of reeds towards the land. Then, at the height of about 
twenty feet, forming a section of the Carse of Gowrie, stretches 
onward a plain of rich alluvial soil for from two to three miles 
northerly, and the whole breadth of the parish, at the extremity 
of which rises, first of all, the eminence on which Inchture stands, 
and then, after one or two undulatory elevations, the hills of 
Rossie, Baledgarno, and Ballindean, a portion of what in the dis- 
trict is termed " the braes of the Carse," and of the verge of the 
Sidlaws, whose acclivities are not very great, and the heights of 
which may be about 500 feet. 

The parish is in one of the most fertile districts of the king- 
dom, in the midst of an exceedingly rich and beautiful, as well 
as extensive, amphitheatre, and forms one of the most im- 
posing portions of it. In the low ground, while the surrounding 
landscape is very rich in fields, and trees, and plantations, and 
parks, and edifices, and churches, and villages, not the least at- 
tractive, if not the most, are those of Inchture ; whereas from any 
one of the hills, which lie on its northern boundary, is to be de- 
scried a prospect which, in few places, can be equalled, and in 
scarce any surpassed, — the Carse of Gowrie, not inappropriately 
designated " Scotland's Garden," in all its richness, and the noble 
estuary of the Tay, dotted here and there with glistening sails, 
forming the foreground, while the back-ground comprises the hills 
east and west, north and south, in the direction of Dundee Law, 
the Fifeshire Lomonds, the Hill of Kinnoull, and the far-famed 
one of Dunsinnan, till their peaks are lost in the " blue dis- 
tance," and their bases in the ocean. 

Climate. — The climate is, on the whole, mild and balmy, parti- 
cularly in the vicinity of the " braes," as exhibited in the early 
foliage and richer fruits. 

Hydrography. — The Frith of Tay, the southern boundary of 
the parish, is here about three miles broad. At low water, how- 
ever, it is confined to a much narrower channel on the southern 
or Fifeshire side. Owing to the extensive banks over which the 
tide flows, and the rapidity of the current, there is always a quan- 
tity of sand suspended in the water, and its volume being so im- 
mensely greater than the contents of the river which are mingled 
with it, it is strongly impregnated with salt. The rapidity of the 
flow at neap-tides may be from two to four miles an hour, and, at 
stream-tides, from four to six during the same period. At the 
harbour at Polgavie, the water rises from six to eight feet during 



INCHTURE. 



827 



neap-tides, and from eleven to thirteen during spring-tides. Oc- 
casionally it has risen as high as seventeen feet, and these extra- 
ordinary risings usually correspond with the remarkable Sowings 
in the Thames, which lay many of the lower parts of London 
under water, and in the Frith of Forth, as noticed at Granton 
Pier, &amp;c. 

The parish is partly bounded, and partly intersected, by 
streams of no great magnitude, called " pows," probably from the 
Gaelic poll, a pond, a bog, marsh or mire, some of which names, 
portions of them in their passage from the highlands, through 
the alluvial soil to the frith, at a former period, no doubt well de- 
served. They take their rise among the hills to the north, and 
being joined by various tributaries, flow, the one for a considerable 
way on the western extremity of the parish into the frith at Pol- 
gavie, forming and preserving the harbour of that name ; and the 
other, after uniting the burns of Baledgarno, which partially in- 
tersects the parish, and that of Rossie, which partially bounds it 
for some length on the eastern extremity, where it diverges into 
the parish of Longforgan, and reaches the frith some miles to the 
eastward. 

The re are numerous excellent wells in the parish. The upper 
part is particularly well supplied with water ; and it is probable, 
were the wells in the lower part deepened, a fair supply, and of 
good quality, might be obtained there likewise, the experiment 
having succeeded well in other parts of the Carse. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The parish affords few geological 
features of importance and interest, as may be apparent from the 
preceding description of it, nearly three-fourths being almost level, 
a small portion only being undulatory, and the remaining fourth 
hilly. 

The level portion is almost wholly composed of rich alluvial 
clay of great depth, and seemingly resting on a bed of old red 
sandstone. A small portion, at the base of one of the hills, is of 
a darkish hue, indicating peat. Some of the undulatory portions 
consist of rich loam on old red sandstone, elevated above that 
supposed to form the substratum of the Carse, by the upheaving 
of the trap ; others again are.gravelly. The hills are chiefly the 
result of eruptions from beneath, partially only of denudation from 
above. All of them are composed principally of trap. That 

•  The ir ntaCt v,-°l U i- J fa l aV i, tr  P and of the u P ,ifted sandstone is very manifest 
in the valleys which divide the hills in the parish. y ujmummw

PERTHSHIRE. 



of Rossie is covered with gravelly sandy soil. That of Baled- 
garno is similarly overlaid, though toward the top it is sprinkled 
with huge blocks of trap ; while that of Ballindean presents both 
limestone and sandstone towards its base, in addition to the other 
characteristics. 

The trap, when exposed to view in the quarries opened for 
supplying metal to the roads in the neighbourhood, and for 
building, exhibits a columnar appearance, indicative of the great- 
ness of the agency employed in forcing it, and of the greatness 
and the power of Him " who toucheth the hills and they smoke." 

The red sandstone, again, is mottled with circular and oval 
spots of a whitish colour. They do not in general present any 
thino- peculiarly striking, beyond their greater hardness than the 
darker coloured material in which they are imbedded; In a few 
of these, however, are to be traced some very interesting forma- 
tions. In one of them in Rossie flower-garden, the section, which 
is circular, of about six inches diameter, presents a number of 
very distinct figures, resembling specimens of gypsum, or moss 
or the veins or arteries in the animal frame. In another in the 
same place, and of a like size, around the centre rise several 
beautiful concentric bands of different shades, not unlike the hu- 
man eye. 

The limestone, I am given to understand, is of good quality. 

In digging the foundation for Rossie Priory, several veins of 
copper were discovered. 

On the hill of Ballindean have been found a considerable num- 
ber of valuable pebbles, as well as a variety of other minerals. 

Zoology. — Among the rarer species of birds may be noted the 
water-rail and water-ouzel. A multitude of cross-bills made their 
appearance in the winter and spring of 1839. Their visit, how- 
ever, was only temporary. 

Very fine Ayrshire and short-horned cattle are bred in the pa- 
rish, as well as Leicester sheep ; and particular and highly suc- 
cessful attention has been paid to the breeding and rearing of these 
different kinds of stock on the home-farm of Lord Kinnaird. His 
Lordship has also lately enlivened the beautiful den of Baled- 
garno with a number of healthy and thriving fallow-deer. 

On the banks in the frith, on the southern boundary, salmon 



 Similar appearances are to be found in quarries in the neighbourhood, and to be 
sn in the stones of which the walls of the church are composed.

used to be taken. They have not, however, been fished for of 
late, owing to various causes. 

Botany. — The uncultivated spots in the parish being so few in 
number, it cannot be expected that the botanist in search of va- 
rieties will be very much gratified. The following, however, may 
be noted, furnished me by Mr Kidd of Rossie Priory garden : 

In the ponds or edges thereof are to be found Lemna gibba, or 
duckweed, and Epilobium hirsutum, or codlins and cream. In the 
ditches, Lythrum salicaria, or common lythrum. On the road- 
sides, Malva moschata, or marsh-mallow ; Rosa rubiginosa, or 
sweet-briar; Festuca loliacea, or spiked fescue grass. In the corn 
fields, Bartsia odontites, or red bartsia, and which, though com- 
mon here, is rare in many parts of Scotland. Also Melilotus offi- 
cinalis, or common melilot, and Galeopsis Ladanum, or red hemp- 
nettle. The pastures present us with Anthemis arvensis, or corn 
chamomile, and the old pastures with the rare Botrychium lunaria, 
or moonwort. The dens again abound with Chrysosplenium op- 
positifolium and alternifolium, or golden saxifrage; Primula ela- 
tior, or oxlip primrose, and P. vulgaris, or common primrose, of 
which there is every variety, and of all shades and colours; Ge- 
ranium lucidum, or shining cranesbill. In the parks is to be 
found Acinos vulgaris, or basil-leaved acinos. And in the hills, 
Potentilla argentea, or cinquefoil silvery ; Symphytum officinale, 
or common comfrey, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

There are many thriving woods and plantations in the upper 
part of the parish. The parks of Rossie are ornamented with 
many fine patches of wood, and numerous very splendid trees. 
The hills of Baledgarno and Rossie are likewise beautifully wood- 
ed. On Rossie hill, among many others deserving notice, may 
be remarked several very large and splendid silver firs, and its 
summit is capped by a clump of the Pinus sylvestris, the native 
Scots fir, apparently that described by the late talented botanist, 
Mr George Don of Forfar, in the second volume of the Caledo- 
nian Horticultural Society's Memoirs. 

There are also many fine trees within the enclosures of Ballin- 
dean. One larch is said to be the same with the famous larches 
of Athole. 

The predominating kinds are, oak, ash, elm, beech, birch, larch, 
spruce and Scots fir, lime, alder, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

II. — Civil History. 
Maps, 8fc — There are several maps and surveys of the parish,

as well as of the several properties in the possession of the diffe- 
rent proprietors. 

Eminent Characters. — Not a few individuals of eminence have 
been born in the parish, or connected with it by residence, among 
whom the following may be instanced : 

In the noble family of Kinnaird, which takes its rise so far back 
as 1176, Randolp Rufus having obtained a grant of the lands of 
Kinnaird from King William the Lion; and George Kinnaird 
having been knighted by Charles II. in 1661, and afterwards 
created Lord Kinnaird of Inchture in 1682, — while many of its 
scions might be particularised, it would be impossible to pass over 
the late Lord Kinnaird, eighth Lord, whose talents were of the 
very first order. 

Among the ministers who laboured in the parish in former 
times, may be noticed the Rev. George Blaikie, the first Protes- 
tant minister subsequent to the Revolution, translated from the pa- 
rish of Redgorton by the presbyteries of Dundee and Forfar to 
the united parishes of Inchture and Rossie, on a popular call. 
As also Randal of Stirling, and his son, the late Dr Davidson 
of Edinburgh. The former appears from the records, to have 
preached in Inchture for a considerable time previous to his 
settlement, — his predecessor, Mr Thomas Rankine, translated 

• " Gregory XI. episcopus, &amp;c, to our beloved sons the prior and chapter of St 
Andrews in Scotland, &amp;c. — Seeing your petition, lately presented unto us, contained 
that our venerable brother William de Landel Bishop of St Andrews, fearing that, 
from the violence of the sea beating against the rock on which the church of St Andrews 
is situated a great part of which rock the continual action of the waves had demo- 
lished, so that the foundation and superstructure of the said church were threatened 
with total ruin, and, seeing that the rents and revenues appropriated to the uphold- 
ing of the fabric were insufficient, on account of the wars and pestilences in those 
parts, to protect the rock and sustain the church ; and the said bishop being desirous, 
as a provision against such danger, to grant the parish church of Inchture, with its 
chapel of Kinnaird, situated in the diocese of St Andrews, being one of the mensal 
churches belonging to him and his predecessors, and which he then peaceably pos- 
sessed with all its rights and pertinents, he accordingly, with the advice and consent 
of certain jurists, gave and bestowed the same in perpetuity on the said church of St 
Andrews. But as your petition to us contains that you doubt whether a grant of this 
kind may hold good in time coming, and that you may hereafter possibly be molested 
in regard to it ; therefore we, moved by your prayers, and anxious as far as possible 
to provide against this danger, will, and by our apostolical authority permit, that you 
retain the aforesaid parish of Inchture, with its chapel and other pertinents, for a 
period of twenty years, reckoning from the date of these presents ; and that you ap- 
ply the same to the upholding of the said church of St Andrews, provided always 
that you take care that the said parish church of Inchture be not thereby defrauded 
of its dues, and that the cure of its souls be not neglected; but that it be served by 
a good and sufficient vicar, who shall receive an adequate portion of its revenues for 

his maintenance. Therefore let no one infringe this our decree, &amp;c Given at 

Avignon, Id. April, the second year of our pontificate." — A.D. 1372. Read at 

meeting of St Andrews Literary and Philosophical Society, 6th December 1841.

from Clunie, having died 14th December 1737, and his ordi- 
nation having only taken place 21st March 1739. He was 
called to Stirling in 1770, and was, as is perhaps not generally 
known, the author of the 49th paraphrase, in which Christian 
love, " of all the graces best," is pourtrayed in all its charms. 
His son was regularly called, and settled in this parish 21st Fe- 
bruary 1771. Afterwards he was translated to the Tolbooth 
church in Edinburgh, where he was reckoned an eminent mini- 
ster of the Gospel of Christ. 

The late Commodore Douglas is also deserving of being noticed 
here. Leaving the parish school, he entered into the service of a lady 
in Edinburgh, who obtained admission for him as a midshipman 
into his Majesty's service. He rose by degrees through several 
of the subsequent steps, and ultimately terminated his career as a 
Commodore in the Portuguese service. He bequeathed L.1000 
to the industrious poor of this, his native parish. 

Land-owners. — The land- owners are, the Right Honourable the 
Lord Kinnaird, Captain R. K. Trotter, and James Vaughan Al- 
len, Esq. 

Parochial Registers. — There are nine volumes of parochial re- 
gisters, sessional records, heritors' minutes, &amp;c. pretty regularly 
kept. The earliest entry is 1623. For a considerable period in 
the beginning of that century, there were no records of session 
kept, and different kinds of business were mingled together 
throughout several of the volumes. Some of the records of the 
parish of Rossie are preserved in one of the volumes. 

For a long period, baptisms seem to have been attested by 
witnesses ; and it was a common practice at one time to certify on 
behalf of those travelling into England, as reapers, &amp;c. that they 
were not " rebels." 

Antiquities. — The cross, which occupied a prominent place in 
the village of Rossie, still remains, though there is scarce a vestige 
of the habitations that once surrounded it. 

On a somewhat romantic elevation at the foot of the den, and 
the southern terminus of the hill, are the interesting ruins of the 
ancient church of Rossie, overgrown with ivy and ash, while 
around it lie the remains of generations which have passed away. 

To the eastward of these ruins, and on the boundary of the pa- 
rish, is a large stone, which is spoken of in the neighbourhood as 
the " Falcon stane," and to which the subjoined paragraph, from 



832 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Boethius's History of Scotland, 1500, is supposed by some to refer. 
The battle of Luncarty having been turned against the Danes by 
Hay and his two sons, Boethius says, " Sone eftane counsal was 
set at Scone, in the quhilk Hay and his sonnis war maid nobil and vot- 
ed for thair singular virtew provin in the field, with sindry landis to 
sustene thair estait. It is said that he askit fra the king certane 
lands quhilk he knew richt plentuous afore Hand betwix Tay and 
Arrol, end gat as mekil thairof as ane falcon flew of ane mann's 
hand or sho lichtit. The falcon flew to ane toun four miles frae 
Dundee, called Rosse, and lichtit on ane stane, quhilk is yet callit 
the falcon stane, and sa he gat all the landes betwixt Tay and 
Arrol, six miles of length, and four of breid, which landis are yet 
inhabit by his posteritie." 

Another large stone, similar to the former, lies on the hill to 
the north of the priory, said to be of Druidical origin. Another 
is to be found near the church at Rossie. Another is spoken 
of as having been near Castlehill, and another near the castle of 
Moncur. 

Castlehill, and Baledgarno, the village lying at its base, are de- 
serving of peculiar notice under this head. The author just 
quoted from, tells us that the castle which, doubtless, once 
stood on the eminence alluded to, and which gave rise to the name 
the village beside it still bears, was founded by Edgar, fourth son 
of Malcolm and St Margaret, who was anointed King of Scotland 
by Lodovick, Bishop of St Andrews, in 1001, — of whom he says, 
« he had na uncouth waris nor trubyl in his dayis, and governit his 
realme in gude peace, and was haldin in mair veneration than ter- 
rour amang his peppl also, that it was repaired by Alexander, 
his brother, who succeeded him, who is represented as building the 
Abbey of Scone of Canons regular, and dedicating it to the 
honour of the Trinity and St Michael; — also the Abbey of 
Canons regular in honour of St Colme, and completing the Ab- 
bey of Dunfermline, besides endowing the Abbey of St Colme, 
and the convent thairof, as well as the church of St Andrews. 

The castle, he expressly says, was " foundit by Edgar in Gow- 
ry, wha gat certane landis fra the Erie of Gowry, and annexit his 
name to the castle." And some of its foundations and pavements 
have been met with, in preparing for the erection of the buildings 
now standing on its site. 

The only other antiquity of interest is the Castle of Moncur, 



INCHTURE. 



833 



which is said to have been destroyed by fire about the beginning 
of last century, and is now in ruins. 

Modern Buildings. — Rossie Priory, the seat of the Right Ho- 
nourable Lord Kinnaird, is situated on the upward slope of Ros- 
sie hill, at an elevation of 132 feet above the level of the sea, 
and commands one of the richest prospects that can well be 
conceived. It was founded in 1807, and erected of very superior 
stone from the quarries on the estate, by the late Lord Kinnaird, 
though it has been materially enlarged and improved by its present 
noble proprietor. The design was by Atkinson, and it is one of 
the most magnificent edifices of its kind. 

Ballindean House is situated near the base of the hill of BaU 
lindean, and was built chiefly by the late Mr Trotter. It is cha- 
racterized by the taste for which he was distinguished. 

The parish church is in the Gothic style, and was built accord- 
ing to a plan by Mackenzie of Dundee in 1835, the material be- 
ing old red sandstone from a quarry in the village. It stands to 
the south of the high road between Perth and Dundee, in the vil- 
lage of Inchture, in the midst of the church-yard, which has been 
elevated from six to eight feet above the surrounding level, appa- 
rently from a hollow in the vicinity. 

Under the aisle of the church, which is wholly the property of 
Lord Kinnaird, is the family vault, where rest the ashes of the an- 
cestors of that noble family, for many bygone generations. 

In 1838, a thrashing-mill, the machinery of which is propelled 
by steam, was erected on Powgavie, the largest farm in the pa- 
rish, by Lord Kinnaird, the proprietor, and is deserving of notice, 
as being the first and only one under the same moving power in 
the district. It has completely answered the end of its erection. 

III. — Population. 
At the time of the publication of the last Account the parish is 
said to have contained about 1000 souls and 184 families. 

In 1821, the population was 985 Males, 474 Females, 51] 
1831, . 878 450 . 428 

1841, . . 765 374 . 387

The apparent decrease is to be attributed partly to the enlarge- 
ment of the farms, parks, and pleasure grounds— the carrying of 

• A late author, quoting from the Annals of Ulster, the most valuable of the Irish 
chronicles, stales that it was near to this castle, during a civil war among the Picts, 
that Hungus defeated Nectan 728, two years before he slew Elpin at Pitlessie in 
the neighbouring parish of Liff, and became triumphant over every competitor for 
the throne. ' 1

the high road through the principal village, where twelve houses 
were sacrificed, &amp;c. The decrease, however, is not so great as 
it appears— the time of taking up the last census being that when 
many families were absent at the sea shore, and numbers of the 
younger branches were employed as herds on the higher grounds 
in the adjacent part of the country and in Strathmore. My own 
visiting list shows, during the last five years, 825 as the lowest, and 
850 as the highest amount in the winter and spring. 

The following statement, therefore, refers to my own enumera- 
tion :

With few exceptions, the habits of the people are good, and they 
are entitled to be characterized as cleanly, sober, and industrious, 
attendant on ordinances, while, in not a few, the good seed of the 
Word seems to have taken root, and is producing the peaceable 
fruits of righteousness. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The number of acres cultivated, or occasionally 
in tillage, is upwards of 3000, Scotch measure. Several hundred 
acres might be reclaimed from the river, and are now in process 
of beino- added. Under thriving woods and plantations are about 
400 acres. Considerable sums of money are annually realized 
from the sale of the primings, thinnings, &amp;c. ; and the manage- 
ment is excellent. 

The grass parks let from L.l to L.6 per acre. 

Live-Stock.— The Carse of Gowrie, in which the greater part 
of the parish lies, being chiefly a " corn" country, not so much 
attention has been paid to breeding as otherwise would have been. 
Several of the farmers, however, have been directing their atten-

tion more of late to this most important matter, as regards Ayr- 
shire and Teeswater, or short-horned cattle, as well as horses. 

Husbandry. — The system of cultivation pursued is not sur- 
passed in Scotland, probably not in the world. The parish, consist- 
ing chiefly of rich alluvial soil, the greater part, about two-thirds, is 
farmed according to a rotation of " sevens," i. e. wheat, pease and 
beans, wheat, barley, grass, oats, and fallow. The other third 
nearly may be described as farmed after a rotation of " sixes," i. e. 
wheat, pease or turnips, barley, grass, oats, and fallow, or pota- 
toes. Of late, a few more acres of potatoes and turnips have been 
cultivated in the clay portion than formerly. 

A great portion of the farms is now very thoroughly drained ; 
and the reclaiming of the land at present overflowed by the tide 
is going on apace. 

The ordinary duration of leases is nineteen years. 

Farm- Buildings and Enclosures. — The houses and farm-build- 
ings are, for the most part, good, having had their share of im- 
provement with most other things. The enclosures are as yet 
almost confined to the upper part of the parish, though hedge-rows 
have of late been planted to a very considerable extent on the pro- 
perty of Lord Kinnaird in the lower part. Where they do exist, 
they are in general good, being either hedge-rows or strong paling. 

Quarries. — There are several quarries in the parish of trap or 
whinstone and red sandstone. A limestone quarry was opened 
on the Ballindean property at one time, but it has not been made 
available for several years. 

Mines.— Several veins of copper ore are to be found in the pa- 
rish. They have, however, never been wrought. 

Average gross amount of raw Produce .— The produce of the 
parish may be nearly as follows : 

238 acres of wheat  9 bolls, or 1069- 132 imp. qrs. 7d L 2, lis. 6d. L.2753 0 3

pease  7 bolls, or 703-382 .. L.l,8s5d 999 7 q 



The principle of the above estimate is, that the parish contains about 3700 Scotch 
acres, two-thirds of which are usually in cultivation,— 1666 farmed according to a 
rotation of  sevens, 1 and 833 according to a rotation of « sixes;" of the remain- 
ing third, about two-thirds are usually in grass, and the remainder in wood. The 
average of prices for the last nine years is adopted.

Manufactures. — There is a manufacture of linen, which is un- 
derstood to afford a fair remuneration to those engaged in it. It 
is principally carried on in the houses of those employed. 

Breioeries. — Inchture has long been famous for its beer, which 
is the produce of a pretty extensive brewery in the village, from 
whence supplies are weekly sent to Perth, Dundee, Cupar- Angus, 
and the surrounding district for many miles. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — Dundee is the market-town, at a distance of 
about nine miles. 

Villages. — In the parish are the villages of Inchture, Baled- 
garno, Ballindean, and several hamlets. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office in the vil- 
lage of Inchture, which is a great advantage, the only other in 
the district being that at Errol, and its branch on the turnpike. 
Three coaches to the north and south, inclusive of the mail, pass 
through the parish every lawful day. 

Navigation. — The Frith of Tay, forming the southern boun- 
dary of the parish, there is a harbour opening out into it at 
Powgavie, which is frequented by a considerable number of ves- 
sels laden with coals, lime, seed, grain, manure, &amp;c. for impor- 
tation, and with grain, potatoes, wood, fruits, &amp;c. for exporta- 
tion. The number of vessels is not at present so great as for- 
merly, owing to a variety of causes. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is almost new. It is situat- 
ed in the centre of the parish, or nearly so, the most distant 
families being little more than three miles from it, while the 
Greater number are within half that distance. Exclusive of the 

&amp; 

aisle, which is the property of Lord Kinnaird, one-half of 
which is occupied as a family seat, and the other for the 
domestics and others, it affords accommodation for 550, and is 
apportioned, after the usual allotment of heritors' seats, &amp;c. among 
the farmers and their servants, — the table-seats and the greater part 
of the galleries being appropriated for the villagers. No part is 

• Most of the land usually in grass is not inferior to that usually in crop ; and a 
considerable portion of the fallow land being now either planted with potatoes or with 
turnip, the annual gross produce will be considerably larger than the above.

let. The public services of religion are generally well-attended, 
The average number of communicants for the last five years is 820. 

In connection with the Sabbath school, there is a library, com- 
prising between 300 and 400 volumes. It is much resorted to. 

The average amount of collections for the last five vears for 
religious and charitable objects, has been L. 25, 5s. 5d. ; and for 
the poor, L.48, 13s. Id. L. 1000 in the 3 per cent, consols, as 
before noticed, was bequeathed by the late Commodore Douglas 
for behoof of the industrious poor. It was reduced by expenses 
to L. 795, Is. 2d. L.10 has also been mortified for the educa- 
tion of poor children. 

The manse was built upwards of fifty years ago, and has lately 
been enlarged very considerably, and repaired. 

The glebe is upwards of 10 acres, including the site of the 
manse, offices, and garden, &amp;c. 

The stipend, inclusive of the annual value of the glebe, manse, 
&amp;c. is stated by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners at L.250 a-vear. 

Education. — In addition to the parochial school, there are three 
schools under the management of females. There is a dame's 
school at Baledgarno. The salary of the parochial schoolmaster 
is the maximum, L. 34, 4s. 4d. The school-fees may amount 
to about L.25 per annum, and he has the legal amount of ac- 
commodation. He is also heritors' and session-clerk. The other 
schools are almost entirely supported by Lord Kinnaird. 

Poor. — Eleven is nearly the average number of persons receiv- 
ing parochial aid, or rather on the poor roll during the last five 
years; the lowest sum being 4s. per month. It is to be taken into 
account, however, that these 1 1 and about 20 others receive 2£ 
bolls of coal, as well as other occasional assistance in monev from 
extraordinary collections, &amp;c. and that many are kept off the 
poor's fund altogether by the benevolence of those on whose 
property they reside. 

Inns and Alehouses. — There is an excellent inn in the village 
of Inchture, much resorted to by travellers ; and one alehouse 
at Polgavie, for the accommodation of those frequenting the har- 
bour. 

Fuel. — Coal is generally used in the parish, though a very con- 
siderable quantity of wood is also burnt, and is obtained from the 
woods in the neighbourhood at a reasonable price.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. DAVID DUNCAN, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The ancient form of the name by which the town and 
parish are known, was Abernethyn ; and so late as 1420, Winton, 
the rhyming chronicler, and prior of St Serf's Inch, in Loch Le- 
ven, makes the final syllable to rhyme with the Scottish word, 
" svne," Anglice "since." The word evidently denotes the 
town upon the Nethy, a small stream which flows through the 
centre of the parish, and close by the town. About a mile farther 
down, on the same stream, and nearer to its influx into the river 
Earne, is Inner nethy, formerly the family residence of the Freers, 
and now belonging to Sir Thomas Moncrieffe of Moncrieffe, and 
a place, the name of which may be traced back to the time of King 
William the Lion. 

Chalmers says, that " Neith" or " Nid" in the British lan- 
guage denotes a stream that forms " whirls" or " turns," and that 
Nethan or Nethy are diminutives. It is proper to add, that, in 
the last Statistical Account of the parish, drawn up by the father 
of the present incumbent, it is alleged that the name which the 
Highlanders give to Abernethy is Obair, or Abair Nadchtain, i. e. 
the work of Neathan or Nectain, a name of more than one of the 
Pictish kings, who are supposed to have been founders of Aber- 
nethy, and by whom it was selected as their capital and place of 
residence. 

Boundaries. — The parish is bounded on the north by the rivers 
Tay and Earne ; on the west, by the parishes of Dron and Dun- 
barny, and the Farg, a rivulet which joins the Earne at Colfar- 
gie, and flows through the romantic scenery of Glenfarg ; on the 
east, by a small rivulet which separates it from the parish of New-

burgh, and is also the boundary in this quarter of the counties of 
Perth and Fife. On the south, its confines adjoin the parishes of 
Auchtermuchty, Collessie, Strathmiglo, and Arngask. A small 
portion of the southern district is in the county of Fife, but by 
much the larger part of the parish is in the county of Perth. It 
forms a very irregular trapezoidal figure, whose greatest diameter 
from the north-west to the south-east may be about nine miles. 
Its length and breadth from east to west, and from south to north, 
vary much in different places. In the middle of the river Tay, 
opposite to Mugclrnm, which is in the parish of Newburgh, is an 
island belonging to the parish, called Mugdrum Island, about an 
English mile in length, containing an area of 35 acres of arable 
land of the richest quality, which, by the improvements in progress 
and embankments, &amp;c. may be greatly extended, as has been the 
case by similar operations, along the opposite shores of the Carse 
of Gowrie. 

The parish may comprise an area of about 7030 acres, two- 
thirds of which, forming part of the range of the Ochils, are hilly; 
the remaining part, lying between the Ochils and the rivers Tay 
and Earne, is arable, and in the highest state of cultivation. It 
forms the lowest part of the vale of Strathearne, and its beauties, 
as well as fertility, not exceeded by those of any other district in 
Scotland, are too well known to require notice. 

In examining the soil along the banks of the Earn, and the 
sections in which the strata are exposed to view, there appears, 
under a thick layer of clay, a bed of peat of about two or three 
feet thick, being apparently a continuation of the submarine forest 
discovered in the neighbourhood of Flisk by Dr Fleming. Be- 
low the peat is a stratum of white or yellow sand, the depth of 
which is not known. The contents of the peat are thus arranged : 
Immediately above the white sand, lies the lowest and hardest part 
of the peat, composed of the leaves and branches of trees, princi- 
pally birch. Above this, is a stratum composed of moss, and a con- 
siderable quantity of seeds, similar to those of the common broom. 
Above this, the peat passes into a sedimentary like matter, form- 
ing the uppermost part of the bed of peat, in which are found re- 
mains of reeds extending upwards into the bed of clay. These 
are found in abundance in that part of the bed of clay immediate- 
ly above the peat, leaving their impression on the clay. These 
remains are frequent for a space of three or four feet above the 
peat, but as we ascend they gradually become fewer and less dis-

tinct, till they entirely disappear, leaving a bed of pure clay or 
loam. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The old red sandstone, which fills 
up so much of the Carse of Gowrie and Stratherne, was at one time 
quarried at Innemethy, near the junction of the Earne and Tay, 
and is visible in contact with the trap about 300 yards to the south 
of the manse, as also about half a mile distant from the House of 
Ayton, in the channel of the Farg. Though concealed elsewhere 
by a thick mass of alluvial matter, it most probably constitutes the 
only rock in that part of the parish which lies between the Tay 
and the first trap range of the Ochils. It declines towards the 
north at an angle of from 15° to 20'. It occasionally inclines to 
conglomerate. In the Glen farg quarry, near Ayton, have been 
discovered fragments of scales of those extraordinary ichthyo- 
h'tes, which have of late been found in abundance at Clash- 
benny, in the Carse of Gowrie, and Duraden to the south-east 
of Cupar, Fife. The Ochil Hills, among which a consider- 
able portion of the parish is situated, consist wholly of trap, and 
in this quarter, of the varieties known by the names of clinkstone, 
amygdaloid, porphyry, and claystone. A singular blood-red va- 
riety of the last of these is found around Balvaird Castle. From 
the Castle Law west towards Glenfarg, on the north face of the 
hill, trap tuffa, resembling some of the gravel stones of Colonel 
Imrie, prevails. The boulders which are scattered over the pa- 
rish, and are especially prevalent on the tops of the hills, consist 
chiefly of gneiss, primitive trap, and quartz rock. 

Quarries. — The only quarries worked in the parish are from 
the greenstone and clinkstone rocks in the Ochil range. They 
are used generally for road-metal, but sometimes for coarse build- 
ing. The quarry in Glenfarg, immediately above Ayton and in 
Lord Mansfield's grounds, exhibits the clinkstone arranged in 
beautiful distinct concretions. The Zeolites of Glenfarg have 
been long so celebrated, that they need not be particularly de- 
scribed. They are found on the rocks stretching from Ayton 
to Balvaird Castle. In the same locality, and particularly on the 
estates of Balvaird and Catochil, agates of various kinds, jaspers, 
and calcareous spars, are in abundance. 

In the range of hills near Auchtermuchty there are limestone 
rocks.

the surrounding districts, the roe-deer, the fallow-deer, the 
fox, hare, rabbit, and weasel. The polecat is occasionally found ; 
and there are the ordinary varieties of the rat, mouse, and 
mole. 

As for the feathered tribes, there are the varieties of species 
common to this and other parishes. Vast numbers of water-fowl 
are found around Mug-drum Island. Among these, specimens 
of the magnificent wild swan are sometimes observed. Wild- 
geese make their appearance in great flocks about the middle of 
October, and continue throughout the winter ; while, all the year 
round, there are found on the shores of the rivers the mire-duck, 
the sheldrake, the teal, the poker-duck, the coote, the water- 
hen, and various tribes of divers, the red-shank, the curlew, the 
green and yellow plover, the heron, and sometimes, though very 
rarely, the bittern. The larger and lesser gull visit us in stormy 
weather; while kittywakes, sea-swallows, and sea-pies, continue 
with us through the summer. Many other varieties of water-fowl 
are occasionally found. 

The mammifera which frequent the waters of the river itself 
are, the seal, the otter, the grampus, and the porpoise. The two 
latter are rarely seen above Newburgh, and the otter seldom with- 
out the mouth of the Earne. 

II. — Civil History. 
There are few parishes so rich in antiquities as Abernethy ; and 
the town itself, though no longer occupying any prominent claims 
to attention on other grounds, is to be traced to a very remote pe- 
riod, and was much more populous and extensive than at present. 
According to traditions which exist, and which are confirmed by 
the discovery of ruins of buildings, it extended a considerable way 
to the eastward of the present village. We may here introduce a 
curious passage, as given by Sir James Balfour from Campden 
Manuscript Col. Stratherne. " Or ever the river Earne hath 
joined his waters with Tay in one streame, so that now Tay is 
become more spatious, he looketh up a little space to Aberneth, 
seated at the feete of the Ocellian mountains, anciently the royal 1 
seat of the Picts, and a weel peopled city, which, as we reade in 
ane ancient fragment, Nectan, King of the Picts, gave unto God 
and St Bridget, until the day of doome, togidder with the bounds 
thereof, which lay from a stone in Abertrent,J;o a stone nigh Car- 
pul, supposed Carpow, and from thence as far as to Ethan," sup- 
posed to be Hatton, the name of a farm-steading.

PERTHSHIRE. 



The oldest Scottish historians represent Abernethy as the ca- 
pital of the Pictish nation, both in civil and religious matters. 

Most probably, a church was built at Abernethy at a very re- 
mote period — in the fifth century, by Nethan Morbet, a king of 
the Picts, according to the Pictish chronicle ; towards the close 
of the sixth century, by King Garnard M'Dourmach, according 
to Fordun, Winton, and Major ; or in the beginning of the seventh 
century, by King Nethan II., Garnard's immediate successor, ac- 
cording to the Register of St Andrews. 

Pinkerton supposes that Nethan III., who asked architects or 
masons from Ceolfrid, Abbot of Weremouth, in the eighth cen- 
tury, and who, according to Winton, founded Rosemarkie, may 
have been a founder of Abernethy also ; or, at least, have substi- 
tuted more substantial buildings in place of the original wooden 
erections. 

According to the Pictish chronicle, the founding and endowing 
of the church of Abernethy was a sacrifice which the Pictish king 
offered to God and St Bridget, in acknowledgement of the reco- 
very of his kingdom ; and over the sacrifice, i. e. on the occasion 
of dedicating the church and lands to the use of religion, hallelu- 
jahs were sung by Darlintach, an Irish abbess, who had previously 
in her own country prayed for the restoration of the Pictish king, 
and was then, as it would appear, placed at the head of an esta- 
blishment of nuns in her capital. Fordun, indeed, does not scruple 
to relate that St Patrick himself introduced St Bridget and her 
nine nuns into the religious establishment of Abernethy.f 

The antiquity as well as dignity of the church of Abernethy 
may be seen in this, that it was the seat of the Bishop of the Picts. 
Fordun says, that there were three elections of bishops at Aber- 
nethy, while as yet there was only one bishop in the whole king- 
dom of the Picts ; and that the church of Abernethy was founded 
227, some said 244, years before the church of Dunkeld. 

According to Boethius and Buchanan, Kenneth M'Alpine, 
King of the Dalriad Scots, translated the Episcopal see, after he 
subdued the Picts, from Abernethy to St Andrews, in the ninth 
century; and the Bishop of St Andrews henceforward was known 
as the national Bishop, Episcopus Scotorum.

nethy came to be included, was founded in the 'twelfth century, 
by King David L, seemingly out of the great national bishopric 
of St Andrews, according to the manuscript missal. 

Of the early history of the monastery established at Abernethy, 
and of the institutions of the Culdees, who had one of their prin- 
cipal seats in this parish, we possess scanty information. From a 
confirmation of some lands which were given to the Culdees of 
Lochleven, we learn, that, towards the end of the eleventh cen- 
tury, there were schools at Abernethy, in which was taught the 
whole circle of the sciences as far as they wereknown in dark 
ages, and among a barbarous people. Among the witnesses are, 
the rector of the school of Abernethy, three priests of Aberne- 
thy, and a fourth, who is styled priest of the Culdees. Almost 
all the names are evidently of Celtic origin, and indicate that the 
Saxon had not yet supplanted the ancient language in that part of 
the country. 

In the following century, Orme, the son of Hugh, proprietor 
of various lands in Angus and Fife, received the .lands of Aber- 
nethy from King William the Lion ; and from these lands, he 
and his posterity assumed their surname. A charter of the same 
King and of Lawrence de Abernethy, conveyed to the" Abbey of 
Arbroath, as a free and permanent alms-gift, the church of Aber- 
nethy and its advowson, with all its pertinents, the chapels of Dron, 
Denboig, and Errol ; the lands of Balloch, Pittenlower, Pitlour, 
and tithes of several kinds. But, among other things, there are 
excepted the tithes of Mukdrum, Kerpull, Carpow, Balchere- 
well, Baltolly, and Innernethy ; which tithes, as well as the lands 
themselves, were the property of the Culdees. The charters 
were confirmed by the bishop of Dunblane, within whose diocese 
the church of Abernethy lay. But the avarice of the Abbey of 
Arbroath ; the poverty, as it seems, of the see of Dunblane ; 
and the growing dislike of the hierarchy towards all the institu- 
tions of the Culdees, soon operated to the disadvantage of the 
monastery of Abernethy. 

About the year 1240, the altarage of the church, with the lands 
of Pittenlower, and a moiety of those of Balloch, were transferred 
to the bishop of Dunblane ; and, in return, the bishop engaged 
to provide for the service of the church of Abernethy ; to esta- 
blish a vicar in his own cathedral, in the name of the abbot and

monastery of Arbroath ; to enrol Abernethy among the prebendal 
churches of the diocese ; and to instal the abbot of Arbroath, as 
a prebendary or canon, with a manse and privileges similar to 
those of the other canons. 

At last, the fate which sooner or later overtook all the Culdee 
institutions, came upon Abernethy also hr 1273, when the ancient 
monastery became a priory of canons regular, and a cell of Inch- 
affray, from which place came the new order of priests. 

It would appear, that, in process of time, the priory of Canons 
regular became a provostry or college of secular priests. Forbes 
says, that a provostry was founded at Abernethy by the Earl of 
Angus ; and Sir James Balfour speaks of Abernethy as a colle- 
giate church with eight prebends, founded by Henry Lord Aber- 
nethy, the nobleman, perhaps, who is mentioned in 1455, in the 
Parliamentary forfeiture of the Douglases. It might have been 
expected that the provostry had been the work of an Earl of 
Angus, probably of the Earl George, who, receiving a great part 
of the forfeited estates of the Earl of Douglas in 1457, was one 
of the first subjects in Scotland, both in power and popularity, 
and rendered the Douglases of Angus formidable to the throne 
as well as to civil liberty. But, be that as it may, we hear no 
more of Canons regular in this district ; and there is every reason 
to believe that, for a very considerable period before the Re- 
formation, Abernethy was a collegiate church, at the head of 
which was a provost. f In a charter of privileges given to the 
town of Abernethy, of date 23d August 1476, and by which 
charter the government of Abernethy was and continues to be 
vested in two bailies and fifteen councillors, one of the witnesses 
is John Frizzel or Frazer, who is designated provost of the colle- 
giate church of Abernethy. 

The common seal of the collegiate church or establishment at 
Abernethy, of which a fac simile or plate is given in Jamieson's 
History of the Culdees, was as follows : Obverse, a shield of arms 
in a shield gule ; a lion rampant, surmounted with bend dexter 
argent ; Legend, " Sig. commune Collegii de Abernethe." 
Reverse, an abbess, probably representing St Bridget the sup- 
posed tutelar saint, concerning whom there are traditions, in a 
veil, holding a crosier in her right hand, and at her right hand is

a small figure of a bull, deer, or such other animal. Legend, 
" In domo Dei ambulavimus concencu," — words which are taken 
from the vulgate Latin of the 55th Psalm, verse 14, a c being 
erroneously substituted in the place of s in the penult syllable. It 
is remarkable that the matrix for making casts of this seal was 
found so late as 1789, and so far from home as Eniskillen, in the 
county of Fermanagh, in Ireland. It is of brass, and, at the pe- 
riod when the last Statistical Account was published, was in the 
possession of the Honourable Mrs Drummond of Perth. Whe- 
ther it be still preserved by her successors, the writer has not 
been able to ascertain. 

In 1531, in a rental of the churches of the Abbey of Arbroath, 
the church of Abernethy is stated at 293 lib. 6s. 8d. 

In 1560, at the time of the Reformation, the valuation of the 
kirk of Abernethy is said to be 273 lib., a sum which is somewhat 
smaller numerically than that stated in the rental of 1531, and 
much smaller in actual value when the diminished weight of the 
coin is considered. After the Reformation, the church of Aber- 
nethy seems to have come under the denomination of a parsonage, 
like, perhaps, several other vicarages ; for the bond by which 
they were connected with bishopricks, abbeys, and other religious 
establishments, was then dissolved. The rental of the provostry 
at the time of the Reformation was as follows: — Money, 13 lib. 
13s. 4d. ; bear, 2 chal. 9 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck; meal, 5 chal. 
4 2 bolls, 3 firlots. 

Of the events in the department of civil history connected with 
Abernethy, few have been handed down. Fordun, Winton, and 
the English historians tell us that, in 1072, when William the 
Conqueror invaded Scotland, Malcolm Canmore did homage pro- 
bably for his English possessions at Abernethy. 

Goodal, in his introduction to Fordun's History, says that the 
place was on the river Nith, in the south of Scotland ; and his 
opinion is generally approved by subsequent Scottish historians. 
But the harangue of an English general, before the battle of the 
Standard, in the following century, implies that William had 
passed through several provinces before Malcolm made his sub- 
mission ; and David M'Pherson, the editor of Winton, supposes 
that the English army advanced as far as Stratherne. Winton's 
language is ; — 

" Ae thousand twa and seventy yere, 
William Bastard, with his powere 
In Scotland came, and wasted syne, 
And rode throught till Abernethyn."

Alexander de Abernethy, the great-grandson of him who co- 
operated with William the Lion, in granting the church of Aber- 
nethy to the Abbey of Arbroath, swore fealty to Edward I. in 
1292 :a nd, adhering to the English interest, was appointed war- 
den of the counties between the Forth and Grampians in 1310, 
by Edward II. His lands seem to have been forfeited, after the 
battle of Bannockburn, by King Robert Bruce, and they were 
probably saved by the marriage of his three daughters, who car- 
ried them to husbands better affected towards the Scottish Crown. 
With Margaret, the eldest daughter, John Stewart, Earl of Angus, 
inherited the lordship of Abernethy. Margaret Stewart, their 
grand-daughter, married William, Earl of Douglas. Their son, 
George Douglas, on the resignation of his mother in 1389, be- 
came Earl of Angus ; and Lord Douglas, as the representative 
of the Earl of Angus and Duke of Douglas, is still superior of 
the town of Abernethy and many neighbouring estates.-f- In the 
early history of Scotland the Douglases were a most powerful 
family. Their historiographer has observed that, " so many and 
so good as the Douglases have been, of one sirname, were ne'er 
in Scotland seen." Pennant states, that " they went about with 
2000 men with them, and had their councillors and established 
ranks, and constituted a Parliament, and might have provided a 
House of Peers out of their own family." 

The family, during their early and more intimate connection 
with the parish, seem to have had a castle or place of residence, 
which, tradition says, was near to the House of Carpow. In this 
parish also, it appears, was a place of sepulture, in which the ashes 
of some of the family repose, and which is supposed to have been 
within an aisle of the old church, taken down in 1802. At Aber- 
nethy, says Monipenny, in his Scottish Chronicle in 1612, the 
Earls of Angus have their sepulture. Earl George, the second 
of the name, a loyal and good man,- the head of the aristocracy, 
and chief of his family, after the forfeiture of the older branch, 
and who was probably the founder of the provostry, was buried 
here in 1462; as was also Alexander, his great-grandson in 1556, 
who led the van of the Scottish army in the unfortunate battle of 
Pinky. George's son, the Great Earl, as he is called, or Archi-

bald Bell-the-Cat, whose two oldest sons, with 200 gentlemen of 
their name, fell at Flodden in 1513, ended his days in the follow- 
ing year at Whittern in religious solitude ; but some time previ- 
ously, he had given to Abernethy a proof of his favour in the char- 
ter before referred to, which erected the town into a burgh of ba- 
rony, and vested the municipal government, in two bailies and 
fifteen councillors. Earl William renewed the charter in 1628. 

Antiquities.— The most remarkable evidence of the antiquity of 
Abernethy, and of the prominent place it occupied in the civil 
and ecclesiastical history of Scotland at a very remote period, is 
the round tower, to which there is nothing similar in Scotland, 
except at Brechin. It is 74 feet in height, and consists of 64 
courses of hewn stone. The external circumference is 48 feet at 
the base, and diminishes somewhat towards the top. The thickness 
of the wall is 3i feet. The door stands a little above the base, and 
faces the north ; is 8£ feet in height, and 2£ feet in width from 
jamb to jamb. Towards the top of the building are four windows, 
equidistant from one another, and pointing to the four quarters of 
heaven, each of them 5 feet 9 inches in height, and 2 feet 2 inches 
in width. The steeple or tower is a hollow pillar, and the only 
mode of ascent is by scaling ladders attached to different wooden 
platforms erected for the purpose. It stands detached from, but 
near to what was the site of the buildings connected with the col- 
lege and ecclesiastical establishment, and where stood the paro- 
chial church, one of the oldest in Scotland, which was taken down 
in 1802, when the present new church was built in a different 
locality. It is now, and has been, occupied from time immemo- 
rial, as a belfry for ecclesiastical purposes ; and a right to use it 
for civil purposes connected with the burgh, has been claimed and 
exercised within certain limits. Though this tower is generally, 
and by the voice of tradition, ascribed to Pictish times, and sup- 
posed to have been connected with ecclesiastical purposes, much 
obscurity rests on the subject, which has not yet been removed, 
and will probably remain on it. 

Circular towers, of the same kind as those at Abernethy and 
Brechin in Scotland, are found in different parts of Ireland, and 
also in some parts of Asia. As to the origin and uses of these 
towers, there has been of late much speculation, and various theo-

ries have been proposed. O' Brian has recently drawn much at- 
tention to this class of antiquities. The theory which he endea- 
vours to establish is, that the round towers of Ireland and Scot- 
land are by much the earliest buildings we possess, dating their 
existence before the Christian era, and owing their origin to ori- 
ental idolatry, being the temples of the Buddhist worshippers. 
This theory seems to derive much weight from the arguments ad- 
duced in its support by the most recent and brilliant historiogra- 
pher of Ireland, as well as the learned writer of the Pictorial His- 
tory of England. Among those who ascribe the circular tower to 
Pictish and Christian times, some conceive that it was not only 
connected with ecclesiastical purposes, but was also designed as a 
place of sepulture for the Pictish kings, during the period Aber- 
nethy continued to be the capitol of their kingdom. A few months 
ago, the public attention was directed, through the newspaper 
press, to the discovery of a human skeleton within the basement 
of the round tower of Ardmore, in the county of Waterford. In 
the process of digging within this tower, there was found, first, a 
layer of large stones, then a perfectly smooth surface of mortar, 
and beneath this a bed of mould, in which, at the depth of some 
feet, a skeleton was discovered lying from east to west. After 
seeing this statement, the writer of this report had a communica- 
tion with the proprietor of Ardmore, and also with Mr Windele, 
the secretary of the South Munster Antiquarian Society. 

It would appear from these communications, that the subject of 
round towers, which are numerous in Ireland, occupies at present 
much attention ; and that, with a view to throw light on the orio-in 
and uses of this class of antiquities, some of these towers have 
been particularly examined by competent judges. One of the re- 
sults of their investigation has been to prove, that they were gene- 
rally used as places of sepulture. Evidences of this fact have been 
found in the round towers not only of Ardmore, but of Ram Island 
and Timahoe, and latterly in the tower of Clove. 

Of the operations in this last place, the writer has received from 
Mr Windele the account which follows: " In September 1841, 
the workmen under the superintendence of Mr William Hackett, 
after penetrating through about two feet of rubbish, reached a solid 
floor, about a foot in thickness, formed of small stones laid in 
gravel, so firmly bedded as to yield only to repeated efforts with 
the crow-bar and pick-axe. Under this they found, within a space 
of six feet diameter, a stratum of earth mould, in which were dis-

covered three skeletons laid west and east, two of them lying side 
by side of each other, and the third under these. The gentlemen 
under whose directions these researches were prosecuted, and who 
were in attendance on this interesting occasion, were the Rev. 
Messrs Horgan, Rogers, Jones, Bolster, and D. Murphy, Messrs 
Hackett, Sainthill, Abell, Windele, Kelcher, and F. Jennings." 
While upon this subject, it is worthy of being noticed, that, in 
May 1821, the Rev. Andrew Small, author of a curious work en- 
titled Roman Antiquities in Abernethy and neighbouring parishes, 
discovered a stone-coffin, with an entire skeleton and several human 
skulls and other detached bones, within the tower at Abernethy, 
while digging in the foundation of the building. An account of 
the discovery will be found in the work to which I have referred, 
published in 1823. 

After all, however, which has been written or suggested as to 
the orio-in and uses of this class of ancient monuments, it must be 
admitted, that the researches of the antiquarian have hitherto 
failed in producing any theory on which much reliance can be 
placed. 

" On the summit of a hill immediately behind Pitlour, and in 
this parish, are the remains of an ancient fort, called ' the Roman 
Camp,' which Colonel Millar, in his Essay respecting the site of 
the battle of Mons Grampius, supposes to have been occupied by 
the army previous to the great battle, which he supposes to have 
been fought in the plain below. The sides of this hill, except on 
the north-east, where it is connected with the general range of the 
Ochils, are steep, and it rises about 400 feet from its base. The 
summit is surrounded by a chain of rocks upwards of 300 yards in 
circumference, which forms a sort of natural citadel, and is still 
called  the fort.' It has besides been well fortified; and many of 
the stones used for that purpose have been brought from a great 
distance. Upon clearing the ground for planting it in 1828, the 
road leading to it, laid with stone, was laid open. The entrance 
on the east side was also discovered cut through the rock, and the 
pavement in the inside quite entire. Upon digging, many human 
bones were found, both within and without the circumference of 
it, also the bones and teeth of horses. A little below the summit, 
and on the side facing the Lomond hill, the slope was cut into 
terraces, similar to those at Markinch, with this difference, that 
these seem to have been faced with stone. They are now all 
levelled but one, which is used as a farm road. Although this fort

may have been occupied by the Romans, there seems little reason 
to doubt that it had previously been a British fortress, and that it 
had even subsequently been used by that people for the same 
purpose." 

Among the Ochils, in the south-west corner of the parish, and 
in Fifeshire, stands Balvaird Castle, a relic of feudal times, — the 
property of the Earl of Mansfield and of his ancestors since the 
days of Robert II. Andrew Murray of Balvaird was settled mi- 
nister of Abdie in 1618, knighted in 1633, and created Lord Bal- 
vaird in 1641, some conceive in consequence of the manner in 
which he acted in the important Assembly of the Church of Scot- 
land of 1638. He died in 1644. His son, David, the second 
Lord Balvaird, succeeded a kinsman in the older titles of Scone 
and Stormont in 1658. 

The seventh Viscount of Stormont succeeded his uncle in the 
Earldom of Mansfield in 1793, and was grandfather of the pre- 
sent Earl. 

At an early period the titularity and patronage of the parish 
were granted by the Crown to Sir Andrew Murray of Balvaird, 
who was one of the Lords of Erection. 

" The Castle of Balvaird is at present in a ruinous state, but 
it has obviously been, in former times, a place of considerable 
strength and importance. No date can now be traced on any part 
of the building; but there are the remains of several coats of arms, 
almost wholly obliterated, on different parts of it. Above the 
door which opens into the principal building from the court-yard 
is a shield, on which two coats of arms are emblazoned. They 
are very indistinct ; but they appear to be those of Margaret Bar- 
clay and her husband, Sir Andrew Murray. And if this be the 
case, the building must be as old as the reign of James IV. In 
the open green in front of the castle, lies the recumbent figure of 
a female carved in freestone, which has obviously formed part of 
a monument. The stone was brought from the old church of 
Arngask at the time it was taken down, and is said to have been 
the monument of Lady Margaret Barclay, who married Sir An- 
drew Murray, youngest son of Sir William Murray of Tullibar- 
dine, and who, as the only surviving child of James Barclay of 
Kippo, to whom the barony of Balvaird and Arngask previously 
belonged, brought with her in marriage these baronies. Since 
that period, a considerable portion of the lands included in these

851 



baronies have passed into the hands of other persons, who hold 
them in fen of the Earl of Mansfield, with whom the superiority 
still remains." 

Besides the relics and monuments of other times, to which I 
have referred, there are others in the parish which, for some years, 
have drawn much attention, and have led to the conclusion, that 
here there was an important and extensive Roman station at a for- 
mer period. 

On the lands of Carpow, and near to the junction of the Earn 
with the waters of the Tay, there have been discovered founda- 
tions of buildings. These are within the policy grounds around 
the mansion-house of Carpow : and, when the surface of the 
ground was scorched by the extreme drought of 1826, attention 
was particularly drawn to them and to their extent. 

A recent excavation in these grounds brings to light the foun- 
dations of many old walls. They are rudely constructed of stones 
and pieces of brick, with what would now be considered a very 
superfluous expenditure of lime and cement. One apartment, 
pretty entire, of which the walls are standing to the height of 20 
inches, measures 10 feet by 18, and seems to have been neatly 
floored with tiles. Another appears to have been fitted up as a 
bath. It is 7 feet by 10, and the floors and sides are carefully 
plastered over with a hard compact cement, apparently composed 
of lime and brick-dust. 

Near to this there was dug out, a few years ago, a piece of lead 
pipe about an inch and a half in internal diameter, and rudely sol- 
dered together with a coarse external seam. It is now, together 
with some Roman urns, coins, and fragments of bones, &amp;c. found 
in the neighbourhood, in possession of Peter Hay Paterson, Esq. 
of Carpow. While Sibbald refers to ruins as existing in his time, 
in this district, he also refers to a Roman road as leading from 
thence to Ardoch, and another to Perth, f 

The Castle Law, about three -quarters of a mile south-west from 
the village, is a steep, picturesque, grassy hill, rising to the height of 
about 600 feet. On its summit, from which there is a most de- 
lightful view of Strathearn and the Carse of Gowrie, are the ves- 
tiges of a very imperfect vitrified fort. The principal enclosure 
seems to have been surrounded by a rude mound of irregular

stones, many of which are burnt or partially fused. The form is 
somewhat like the section of a jargonelle pear cut longitudinally. 
— the greatest diameter from east to west being 16 yards, and 
from north to south, 24. Two indistinctly visible outworks, lower 
down the hill, as also a winding terraced walk, seem to have been 
connected with it. It might have perhaps been designed to guard 
the pass into Abernethy Glen, which it overlooks, or to watch the 
Roman station below. Supposing it to have been a signal- post, 
an office for which the site and construction of other hill forts 
point them out as well adapted, it could communicate with the 
vitrified forts on the Law Hill, seven miles east from Dundee ; 
with those on Evelick and Dunsinnane Hill to the north, with 
which it nearly forms a straight line ; with Dunmore at the mouth 
of Logiealmond, on the north-west; and with its magnificent 
namesake, the Castle Law, about six miles west, in Strathearn, in 
the same range of hills. 

The Chronicle of the Church of Abernethy is the title of a re- 
cord long since lost, but to which there is reference in Fordoun, 
and in Innes's quotation from the Book of Paisley. In consequence 
of the loss of this document, and also the imperfect and mutilated 
state of the records of the diocose of Dunblane, within which 
Abernethy was, posterity have perhaps been deprived of much that 
would have been interesting in relation to the ecclesiastical and 
literary institutions of Abernethy. In order to set aside or depre- 
ciate their claims to notice, it has been asked why so little has 
been found concerning them in the registers of Scone, or in that 
of St Andrews, the metropolitan seat. This, however, will appear 
less surprising if we remember that it was the system of the ca- 
nons regular, after they obtained the superiority of the Episcopal 
seats and monasteries, to keep the Culdees and their institutions 
in the shade as much as possible, and to seek their extinction. 

To the ecclesiastical antiquities of Abernethy, and to the pro- 
minent place which the Culdees who had their principal seat in 
this parish occupy among those who were witnesses for the truth 
in a dark age, by testifying against many of the errors of the 
Church of Rome, the public attention has been directed in the 
collections of Sir James Dalrymple, and, more recently, in the 
Historical Account of the Ancient Culdees of Iona, and their 
Settlements in Scotland, England, and Ireland, by John Jamieson, 
D. D., F. R. S., F. A. S. E. To these sources the author must 



ABERNETHY.

refer his readers for fuller information on this interesting subject 
than can be given within the limits of a statistical report of the 
parish. If Abernethy, as associated with the name of the Cul- 
dees, the pioneers of the Reformation, be a scene interesting to 
the Christian inquirer, both as a seat of learning and religion, it 
became, in a later age, one of the original seats of that secession 
from the Church of Scotland, which has now extended so widely, 
and produced an important change in the state of society in Scot- 
land. 

One of the fathers of the Secession, the Rev. Alexander Mon- 
crieffe, was minister of Abernethy, and proprietor of Culfargie, a 
considerable estate in the parish. He was the son of Matthew 
Moncrieffe, Esq. of Culfargie, and born about the year 1696. 
His grandfather was the Rev. Alexander Moncrieffe, minister of 
Scoonie, in Fifeshire, from 1643 to 1660, who was ejected at the 
Restoration, and died in 1688. After prosecuting his studies in 
Scotland, and for some time at Leyden, in Holland, he returned 
home, and soon after was licensed to preach the Gospel by the 
presbytery of Perth, and was ordained minister, of Abernethy in 
September 1720. 

He was one of the four ministers who protested against the 
Act of the General Assembly of 1733, which restrained ministerial 
freedom, and who, being afterwards ejected from the Established 
Church, constituted themselves into a presbytery for bearing tes- 
timony to the covenanted work of the Reformation in Scotland, 
and against all defections from the same. He is the author of 
two volumes of sermons, and of different pamphlets on subjects 
connected with the controversies and errors of the times. He 
was appointed Professor of Divinity to the General Associate 
Synod, after the death of Mr William Wilson of Perth, about 
the year 1742, and continued to have the charge of the students 
of divinity at Culfargie till the period of his death in 1761. His 
popular talents, and the influence which his property in the parish 
gave him, enabled him to draw away from the Establishment a 
great proportion of the population ; and though a great change 
has since taken place, the name of Moncrieffe is dear to many 
connected with that body of Christians in which he acted so pro- 
minent a part. After his ejection from the Church, he continued 
to live on his paternal estate of Culfargie, and out of his private 
funds immediately erected a large substantial meeting-house, in 
the vicinity of Abernethy, capable of accommodating about 1000 



854 



PERTHSHIRE. 



persons, and also gave the ground for its site to the congregation 
gratis. But besides the place of worship, he left them, for 
the support and accommodation of their ministers, four or five 
acres of valuable land, on which the manse and offices are built 
for the incumbent. It is understood that, both in relation to the 
meeting-house and glebe, the rights are given to Mr Moncrieffe's 
successors in the charge of the Secession congregation, only so 
long as they continued to adhere to the principles for which he 
had seceded. 

The Rev. John Brown, who was for thirty-six years minister of 
the Associate Burgher congregation at Haddington, and the au- 
thor of the Self- Interpreting Bible and other valuable' works on 
theology, was born at Carpow, in this parish, in 1722. 

Parochial Registers. — Many of the session records preceding 
the period of the Secession seem to have been carried away or 
lost during the troubles of this period, and all attempts to recover 
them have hitherto failed. The register of baptisms commences 
in the year 1667, and, with the exception of a few years before 
and after the Secession, has been continued to the present time. 
It is to be observed, however, that in this, as in other parishes in 
similar circumstances, many of the Dissenters, as well as some 
connected with the Established Church, have not registered the 
births of their children. Hence the little value of the register 
as a statistical document in relation to the number of births in the 
parish. The same remark applies to any records which have 
been kept of marriages and burials, &amp;c. The defects which exist 
in all our parishes, with few exceptions, in the system of registra- 
tion, suggests the necessity of some legislative measure on the 
subject. 

Ministers of the Parish, — The following is a list of the ministers 
of this parish, with the dates of their settlements and deaths, so far 
as it has been ascertained : — 1 . Robert Jenkins, deposed by the coun - 
cilfornot praying for William and Mary, &amp;c. September 7, 1689; 
2. Alexander Dunning, ordained, 1691, died, 1719 ; 3. Alexander 
Moncrieffe, ordained, 1720, deposed, 740 ; 4. Andrew Grey, 
D.D.,  ordained, 1747, died, 1779; 5. William Duncan, or- 
dained, 1780, died, 1809; 6. David Duncan, ordained, 1809. 
From a small document, entitled Some Notices of the Family of 
Moncrieffe of that Ilk, and its branches in Perthshire, furnished 
f o the author by Mr Rowand, keeper of the Theological Library, 
Edinburgh, it would appear that one of the numerous branches

ABERNETHY.

of the family of Moncrieffe was the Moncrieffe of Culfargie, in 
this parish. Alexander Moncrieffe, deposed in 1740, and one of 
the fathers of the Secession ; and his son, Matthew, the second 
minister of the Seceding congregation at Abernethy, belonged to 
this family, and were proprietors of Culfargie. It would appear, 
from the document adverted to, as well as from the presbytery 
books, that persons of the same name, and probably belonging to 
the same family, had been ministers of Abernethy before the 
Revolution. 

The first of these was Archibald Moncrieffe, who, after re- 
ceiving his education in England, returned to his native country, 
and became minister of Abernethy about 1579 or 1580. He 
appears to have taken an active part in the disputes of the times 
between the Court and the Church, and in general to have sup- 
ported the Court party. In the act of the Secret Council for 
support of the Protestant religion in 1589, his elder brother and 
himself are both named as commissioners. He supported the 
King's measures, violent as they were, in the Provincial Assembly 
of Perth, in 1607. But this is not surprising, when it is observed 
that his two brothers-in-law, David Murray of Balgonie, and Sir 
George Auchinleck of Balmanno, were joint commissioners for the 
King, with Sir David Murray of Arngask, the comptroller. 
Being appointed to attend the meeting of Assembly, they con- 
tended, with most incessant violence, to carry a point the King 
had much at heart, viz. the appointment of bishops to be per- 
petual moderators of the Church courts. Mr Archibald Mon- 
crieffe does not appear to have had fortitude to resist their influ- 
ence. He was accused, besides, of aspiring to a bishoprick, and 
was for some time in the Court list for that situation, though he 
never obtained it. These facts are detailed in the manuscript 
copy of Calderwood's history, a much more complete and larger 
work than the printed book which bears his name. Mr Archibald 
Moncrieffe was also named by the Court party to be a member 
of the meeting, then called the " Privy Conference at the Ge- 
neral Assembly of Perth in 1618 a committee the same in sub- 
stance with regard to the ecclesiastical assemblies which the Lords 
of the articles were with regard to the Parliament of Scotland ; 
and although he does not appear to have attended, he was no- 
minated one of the Court of High Commission in 1619. His 
father had acquired the property of the monastery of Elcho, 
which was in the vicinity, and, in 1601, Archibald Moncrieffe, 



856 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the minister of Abernethy, was appointed prior and commendator 
of that priory and monastery, with a right to the whole rents be- 
longing thereto, which must have been considerable. 

Archibald MoncriefFe married Margaret Auchinleck, the sister 
of Sir George Auchinleck of Balmanno, who was admitted a Lord 
of Session 14th February 1626. The fruits of this marriage were 
three sons and three daughters. His second son, George, was 
minister of Arngask, and afterwards represented the family. His 
eldest son, Archibald, was his heir, and also successor as minister 
of Abernetby. He succeeded his father about the year 1630, and 
married Barbara, eldest daughter of David MoncriefFe of Balcas- 
kie, one of six brothers who all belonged to the household of James 
VI. Archibald, the second of the name who was minister of 
Abernetby, lived till after 1662, as appears by a document of that 
date, in his own writing, in the possession of the late Sir Henry 
MoncriefFe of Wellwood. 

Land-owners. — The greater part of the parish belongs to the 
following heritors, who are non-resident : The Right Honour- 
able Earl of Mansfield, who is patron of the parish, and takes one 
of his titles from Balvaird ; the Right Honourable Earl of 
Wemyss and March ; Sir Thomas MoncriefFe of MoncriefFe, a 
branch of one of the most ancient families in Scotland, the genea- 
logical accounts of which go back to the beginning of the twelfth 
century, and represent Ramerus de MoncriefFe as the founder, who 
lived between a. d. 1107 and 1124, and is said to have been keep- 
er of the wardrobe in the family of King Alexander I. The prin- 
cipal resident heritors are, Peter Hay Paterson, Esq. of Carpow ; 
Joseph Murray, Esq. of Ayton, formerly Craigpottie ; James Rit- 
chie, Esq. of Carey, &amp;c. The feuars generally hold of Lord 
Douglas, and are numerous, the number of heritors at present on 
the roll being 78. Though the greater proportion of these occupy 
only from one to three acres, yet, from the conjoined value of their 
lands and houses in the village, the number of individuals in the 
parish who enjoy the political franchise under the Reform Bill is 
very large.

It appears from the census of 1841, compared with that of 
1831, that there has been an increase in the population to the ex-

tent of 139. This increase may be ascribed to the recent acces- 
sion made to the villages of Glenfoot and Abernethy; but chiefly 
to the establishment of a bleachfield at Clunie, in the eastern part 
of the parish. Of the population about 1100 reside in the vil- 
lages of Abernethy, Glenfoot, and Aberargie, and the remainder 
are scattered over the landward part of the parish, which is ex- 
tensive. 

The comparative state of the population, &amp;c. in 1831 and 1841 
is exhibited in the following certified extract :

In the villages by far the greater proportion of the inhabitants, 
both male and female, are employed in weaving linen yarn. During 
the fishino- season on the Earn and Tay about 70 individuals are 
engaged in the salmon- fishery, a great proportion of whom have 
recourse to the loom during the winter months.

There is no district in which there is a better specimen of 
agricultural operations, couducted on the most improved principles 
of cropping and cultivation, than the parish of Abernethy, and par- 
ticularly that part of it which stretches along the rivers Earn 
and Tay. 

The valued rent of the parish is L.8884, 15s. Id. Scots. 

The present average rental of the low land may be from L.2, 
10s. to L.3, 15s. per acre; of high land, from L. 1 to L. I, 15s. 
per acre. Some of the burgh acres are rented so high as L.5, 5s. 
per acre. 

The annual rental of the fishings on Earn and Tay, belonging 
to the parish of Abernethy, does not. during the present year, ex- 
ceed L.250 Sterling ; but in some preceding years, they have 
brought a much higher rent. It is supposed that the Carpow 
fishings have been greatly injured by the operations in progress 
for clearing and widening the channel of the Tay. The preced- 
ing statements in relation to agricultural statistics of the parish 
have been drawn from materials furnished by an intelligent farmer 
in the parish, Mr David Barclay, tenant of Balgonie.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There are in the parish, besides Abernethy, which is a burgh 
of barony holding of Lord Douglas, two villages, Aberargie, and 
Glenfoot. Two markets are held at Abernethy in the course of 
the year, but for a considerable period few have resorted to them, 
and little business has been done. A penny-post office was esta- 
blished at Abernethy about two years ago, but our nearest regu- 
lar post-offices are at Newburgh and Bridge of Earn. The great 
turnpike road from Perth to Edinburgh, passing through the ro- 
mantic scenery of Glenfarg, is for a considerable way in this pa- 
rish. The other roads in the district are upheld by statute labour, 
and one of these is the line of road leading from Perth to Cupar, 
Fife. In this line there has been erected since the last Statistical 
Account was published, a new bridge over the Farg, where it was 
much needed. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which was built in 
1802, is conveniently situated, and although externally it be a 
plain and unadorned edifice, is very substantial and commodious. 
It contains about 600 sittings, and would not be nearly sufficient for 
the population if a considerable proportion of the people who have 
no ricrht to seats in the parish church, did not find accommodation 
in the Dissenting meeting-house. 

According to the census of the parish, given in the Statistical 
Account of 1792, when the whole population amounted to 1415, 
628 were connected with the Establishment, and 787 with the 
Secession congregation. Since that period the population has 
greatly increased, and a very considerable majority of the people 
are now connected with the Establishment. Amidst all the influ- 
ences which have been at work to agitate the public mind, and to 
widen the unhappy breach which exists between the Church of 
Scotland and Dissenters, it is gratifying to be enabled to state, 
that the ministers of the different congregations in this parish have 
continued to live in harmony and friendship. 

The manse was built in 1774, and, though very inferior in ac- 
commodation to many built at a subsequent period, is sufficiently 
comfortable. 

The present stipend is 17 chalders of victual, half meal half 
barley, and L.8, 6s. 8d. is the allowance for communion element 
money. The glebe does not exceed the legal minimum extent of 
four acres, and might bring a rent of about L.3 per acre. 

Education. — Some years ago, the heritors erected a large and 



860 



PERTHSHIRE. 



commodious school-house and school-room, and provided a garden 
for the schoolmaster. The present incumbent, who is now old and 
infirm, has withdrawn from teaching, and his place has, for some 
years, been tilled by a teacher selected by the minister and some 
of the heritors, who provide a salary in addition to the school fees. 
The average number of scholars attending the parochial school for 
the last three years has been about 80 ; and the school fees may 
amount to from L.20 to L.25 per annum. 

The rates of fees are, 2s., 2s. 6d., and 3s. for the ordinary and 
elementary branches of education ; and 5s. for Latin, book-keep- 
ing, practical mathematics, &amp;c. 

The schoolmaster retains all the fixed emoluments, which 
consist of the maximum salary, and the interest of L.I 90, being a 
sum mortified by the Earl of Mansfield for behoof of the parish 
teacher. He has besides the perquisites as session-clerk, which 
may amount to L.10 per annum. 

Besides the parochial school, and a school in Abernethy con- 
nected with the Secession congregation, there is a third school in 
the village of Aberargie, under the patronage and superintendence 
of Joseph Murray, Esq. of Ay ton, who gives the teacher se- 
lected by him, besides the fees, an annual salary, with a 
school-room and house. The teacher is a member of the Esta- 
blished Church, and has his school annually examined by the 
presbytery. In this school, the average attendance may be about 
60, and here, as in the parochial school, the most approved modes 
of tuition are introduced. The heritors of the parish of Aberne- 
thy are entitled to much praise for the sacrifices and exertions they 
have made for the education of the people, and the fault is with 
parents themselves if they neglect the ample provisions made for 
the instruction of their children. 

There are Sabbath evening schools both at Abernethy and 
Aberargie, conducted by the teachers and assistants, and under 
the superintendence of the parish minister. Libraries are con- 
nected with these schools, from which books, chiefly of a religious 
character, are circulated among the children attending the schools, 
farm-servants, and other classes of the population. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of paupers 
on the roll for the last three years is 33, and the allowance given 
to each individual varies from 2s. 6d. to 9s. per month. Addi- 
tions, however, are occasionally made to these allowances in cases of 
distress, &amp;c. Relief is also sometimes given to persons who are 



ABE RNETHY. 



861 



not on the list of regular paupers. The sources of revenue are 
the collections at the church doors, and the rents of lands morti- 
fied for behoof of the poor, and under the administration of the 
kirk-session. The average annual revenue does not exceed L.85 
Sterling. Hitherto there has been no assessment in the parish ; 
but as the regular income has not for some years been found suf- 
ficient for meeting the increasing wants and numbers of the poor, 
it has been necessary to make up the deficiency by obtaining vo- 
luntary donations from the principal heritors, who, much to their 
credit, have not resisted the appeals made to their benevolence. 

There was a period when the Dissenting congregation contri- 
buted largely by their collections to the relief of the poor in the 
parish. It is stated in the last Statistical Account to the amount 
of L.20 Sterling ; but it is to be regretted, that, for some years, 
this source of charity has been almost entirely closed by the diffi- 
culties felt in raising the stipend payable to the ministers. 

Alehouses. — There are within the limits of the parish five houses 
licensed to retail spirits. This number may not be considered 
large when compared with that of other parishes; but it is more 
than sufficient for all purposes of trade and good morals; 

Much of the poverty and misery existing in our parishes is to be 
traced to the increasing use of ardent spirits. Any measure cal- 
culated to check an evil so inconsistent with the temporal and spi- 
ritual interests of the people, is deserving of the countenance and 
support of all who would desire to see an amelioration in their 
condition. 

Ferries. — There are two stations on the river Earn where pas- 
sage-boats are provided, the one at Cary, little used, and the other 
at Ferry field, on the estate of Carpow, near the junction of the 
Earne with the Tay. There are passage-boats daily plying be- 
twixt Ferry field and the Carse of Gowrie, where there is now a 
good pier and landing-place, on the property of Sir John Rich- 
ardson of Pitfour. If low- water piers were erected at Ferryfield 
and the opposite side of the Tay, it would be a great addition to 
the means of intercourse, and would be most beneficial to the 
public. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
At the time when the last Statistical report of the parish was 
drawn up by the father of the writer of this article, there were few 
districts in Scotland which furnished a more favourable specimen 
of the state of agriculture. Since that period, the parish has kept 



862 



PERTHSHIRE. 



pace with the progress of improvement. The new system of drain- 
ing, &amp;c. has been generally adopted with much benefit; and for 
this mode of improvement there are now great facilities in a brick 
and tile work which has recently commenced at Ferryfield, on the 
estate of Carpow. In consequence of the division of two com- 
monties, which was effected some years ago, a considerable addi- 
tion has been made to the number of acres in plantation, or under 
cultivation.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. PATRICK J. MACFARLANE, A. M., M. D., 

MINISTER. 



i — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Extent, fyc. — The name Dronn, in the Gaelic lan- 
guage, is said to signify a ridge or projection, a hunch or bunch, 
which is descriptive of the situation of that part of the parish where 
the church and manse are placed. The parish is situated about 
a mile south of the river Earn, and five miles south-east of the 
town of Perth. It extends in length from east to west between 
three and four miles, including a narrow strip of the lands of Pit- 
keathly, in Dumbarny parish, which intersects it ; and in breadth 
from north to south, about three miles. The principal and lower 
part stretches, in a sloping position, along the bottom of the Ochil 
hills, which form the southern boundary of the rich and beautiful 
vale of Strathearn, and presents to the view of the traveller pas- 
sing along the great road which leads from Perth to Kinghorn and 
the Queensferry, a very agreeable prospect of well-cultivated and 
inclosed fields. The face of the hills here is generally smooth 
and regular, uniformly green, and adorned with strips and clumps 
of plantation. Some are covered with an extensive wood of firs, 
birch, ash, &amp;c. which at once ornaments the prospect and enriches 
the country. A few farms, more extensive than rich, occupy the 
higher part of the parish, being situated on the summit of the 
Ochil hills. 



DRON. 



863 



Rivers, Springs, Minerals.— Though there are no rivers which 
run through this parish, yet it is plentifully supplied with water, 
by springs and little currents which descend from the hills. The 
only river which borders on the parish, and divides it from Aber- 
nethy is the Farg. It rises in the Ochil hills, about five or six 
miles above, and runs through a deep and narrow and wooded 
glen, of romantic beauty, through which the Great North Road 
passes, for a considerable way, before it issues into the plain ; 
and after a short course directly north it bends to the east, and 
loses itself in the river Earn, at a place, which derives its name 
from it, called Culfargie. This river abounds with tine trout. 

There is some freestone in the parish, but seldom wrought, ex- 
cept on a particular demand. The appearances of coal are so 
great, that many attempts have been made to discover it, by dig- 
2'mo-, borino-, &amp; c . but hitherto without success. Many different 
trials have been made within this parish since the year 1758, and 
sanguine hopes have been entertained, but as often disappointed. 
The nearest coal mines are at Keltie and Loch Gellie, at the dis- 
tance of eighteen and twenty miles south, from whence they are 
usually brought in carts during summer, for the supply of all the 
country south of Perth. There is no moss nearer than eight or 
nine miles. This scarcity of fuel is severely felt by the lower 
classes of the people. 

The soil in the lower division of the parish, though various, ac- 
cording as it approaches to the bottom of the hills, or the level of 
the Strath, is in general strong and fertile, consisting partly of 
clay, till, and loam, producing plentiful crops of potatoes and tur- 
nips, wheat, beans, pease, barley, clover, oats, which is the usual 
rotation observed here. The soil of those farms which lie on the 
hills is of a lighter kind, shallow and interspersed with rock, lying 
at the bottom of the furrow, and frequently jutting out above the 
surface. But in the flats and hollows the soil is good, and produces 
very tolerable crops, chiefly of barley and oats, turnips and potatoes, 
pease only in small quantities. Wheat has been also cultivated 
with success, and grass. Large tracts, however, in these forms are 
unfit for cultivation, and only afford an extensive range of indiffe- 
rent pasture for cattle and sheep. From the elevated situation of 
these farms, they are much exposed to suffer from high winds and 
late harvests. 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers. — There is a register of baptisms, marriages, 



864 



PERTHSHIRE. 



collections, and minutes of session, in eight volumes, commencing 
in 1682, and continued apparently with considerable regularity 
to the present time. 

Principal Land-owners. — Alexander M. H. Belshes, Esq. of 
Invermay, possessing nearly half of the parish ; heirs of the late 
Mr Husband of Glenearn; Earl of Wemyss ; J. Beatson Bell, Esq. 
of Glenfargr 

Mansion- Houses. — Balmanno Castle, formerly the seat of the 
Murrays, Baronets of Balmanno, is now the property of Alexander 
Murray Hepburn Belshes, Esq. of Invermay, nephew of the last 
baronet, who was killed at the age of twenty-two at Long Island, 
in the American War. It is a fine specimen, in perfect preser- 
vation, of the old Scottish castle and mansion-house; part of it 
of great antiquity. It is now partly occupied by the farmer. 
There is also the modern mansion-house of Glenearn, a neat 
small country-house. 

Antiquities. — In the parish church-yard there is the grave and 
grave-stone of John Welwood, a celebrated minister of the Gospel 
in the times of the persecution under Charles II., who died in 
Perth in 1679, and was brought out and buried here during the 
night. In the old church-yard at Ecclesiamagirdle, there is the 
grave of a Covenanter killed in these times. 

There were in former times two small chapels in this parish 
besides the parish church. One of these, which stood in the 
east corner of the parish, at the mouth of Glenfarg, where now 
stands the mill of Pottie, is now totallv in ruins, no vestige of 
it remaining except some part of the foundation below ground. 
The other chapel of Ecclesiamagirdle is at Glenearn, in the west 
end of the parish, and still remains, though in a ruinous state. 

Rocking Stone. — On the south descent of the hill, opposite to 
the church and manse, stands what is called the rocking stone of 
Dron, presenting at once a monument of ancient ingenuity and 
superstition. It is a large mass of whinstone, of an irregular figure, 
about ten feet in length, and seven in breadth, and stands in a 
sloping direction. Vide Old Account. 

III. — Population. 
The inhabitants of the parish consist exclusively of a few 
farmers of high respectability and great skill, and an indus- 
trious rural population. There are no resident heritors, and 
the parish is divided into six large farms and four smaller hill 
farms. The population by the last census 1841 amounted to 



DKON. 



865 



441. The number of houses in the parish is about. 90 or 95. 
There is no village. Number of illegitimate births in the parish 
within the last three years, 3. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — About 2600 imperial acres are cultivated. About 
1100 acres are in hill pasture. Every acre in the parish is culti- 
vated, both on the high land and the low, where cultivation would 
make any return. About 400 acres are under wood. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land may be stated at 
about L.2 for arable, and 9s. for pasture. The entire rental of 
the parish is about L.5000. The agriculture of the parish is in 
a high state of improvement. The most recent agricultural im- 
provement is that of tile-draining, which is carrying to a great 
extent, and for which the soil is peculiarly fitted, being for the 
most part retentive and clayey, and much of it on a low dead-level, 
not drainable by other means. 

V.— Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — Seventy-two families belong to the parish 
church ; about ten families to different Dissenting bodies. Num- 
ber of bothies in the parish, 8, of which the inmates belong to the 
Establishment. 

Stipend. — About 1 chalder wheat, 4 chalders barley, 10 chal- 
ders meal, money, L.12, 13s. 9d. ; coals, L.6, 5s. lid. Average 
in money, L. 175. No allowance for communion elements. Teinds 
said to be exhausted. Glebe, about 4 acres, value about L.12. 

The present manse Mas built about twenty-five or thirty 
years ago, and received extensive alterations, improvements, and 
repairs, besides a large addition four years ago, at the ex- 
pense of the heritors and the present incumbent. The church 
was built about fifteen years ago in a plain and handsome style, 
and is an excellent model of a country church. It is seated for 350 
persons, and cost about L.800. The situation of the church and 
manse is one of great beauty, on an elevation at the foot of the 
line of the Ochils, and commanding a rich, and varied, and ex- 
tensive view over the whole lower part of Strathearn, the upper 
part of the Carse of Gowrie, and the whole extent of the braes 
of the Carse on the one side, and of the Ochils on the other, as far 
as the Law of Dundee. An entirely new school and school-house 
have just been built by the heritors, in the neighbourhood of the 
manse and church, in a handsome style, and on a commodious 
plan, at an outlay of about L.600.

PERTHSHIRE. 



Education. — No schools in the parish but the parish school, 
which is in a flourishing state. Salary, the maximum. Probable 
yearly amount of fees actually paid to schoolmaster, about L.21. 
Probable amount of the other emoluments, about L.8 or L.9, in- 
cluding salary as session-clerk and heritors' clerk. There is a 
small piece of ground, about seven acres, adjoining to the minister's 
glebe, which was mortified by a Mr William Bell, minister here, 
1641, and afterward conveyed to the parish of Errol, for the 
purpose of maintaining a student of divinity ; the management and 
disposal of this mortification is in the hands of the presbytery of 
Perth, who let the lands, and appoint the rent to be paid annually 
as a bursary to the student whom they have chosen, and who 
continues in the possession of it for four years. The bursars are 
obliged to attend the university of St Andrews. The present 
rent of these lands is about L.21, exclusive of all public burdens, 
but subject to a deduction of one-fifth for stipend. Ministers' sons 
in the presbytery are preferred to all others. 

Public-Houses. — There are three public-houses in the parish. 

Poor. — Average number of persons receiving parochial aid, 
9 or 10, besides one in the lunatic asylum. Average sum allotted 
to each of such persons per week or year, about L.3, 15s. per 
annum. Average annual amount of contributions for relief of 
the poor, L.60. From the poverty of the greater part of the po- 
pulation, and the total want of resident heritors, the collections 
are small ; average, about L.6 or L.7. There is no legal assess- 
ment, but the heritors voluntarily assess themselves for the sup- 
port of the poor to the amount, at present, of L.53 or L.54, of 
which L.23 are for a lunatic in the Perth Asylum.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. GEORGE HOPE MONILAWS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation and Extent. — This parish is situated in the south-west 
extremity of the county of Perth, on a beautiful hill, gently de- 
clining to the south and west, and sloping to the north and north- 
east ; and this local peculiarity, in all probability, gave to the pa- 
rish the name of Tullialian, — the beautiful hill. It consisted ori- 
ginally of the barony of Tullialian only ; but in 1673, the barony 
of Kincardine, lands of Lurg, Sands, and Kellywood were dis- 
joined from the parish of Culross at the instance of the Earl of 
Kincardine, " with concourse of the King's advocate and solicitor, 
and the recommendation of the presbytery." The extreme length 
of this parish is about 2f miles, and its breadth nearly 2 miles. 
It contains about 3850 imperial acres. 

Soil, Climate. — The soil is various, consisting of coarse clay, 
loam, moor, peat, and rich alluvial soil recently reclaimed from 
the sea. Sheltered on the north and east by rising ground and 
extensive plantations, and exposed on the south-west to a free cur- 
rent of air, this parish is noted for a mild and temperate climate, 
the healthiness of its inhabitants, and the absence of those dis- 
eases and fevers which prevail in many neighbouring parishes. 
Agues, formerly prevalent, have not appeared for many years, and 
the recent improvements in agriculture have undoubtedly proved 
beneficial to the general health of the people. 

Coast, Ferry. — The situation of Kincardine is one of the best 
on the Forth for trade and shipping. There is water on the road- 
stead to the depth of 21 feet, where 100 vessels may ride in safety. 
The ferry across the river here is decidedly the best on the Forth. 
It is under excellent management. The ferry is three-quarters of

a mile at high water, and only one quarter when the tide is out. 
Two steam-hoats are attached to the ferry, which pass in about 
five minutes at all times of the tide and in all states of the wea- 
ther. The piers at the ferry were built in 1826 and 1827 by Lord 
Keith's Trustees, at the cost of L.6468, 5s. 9d. 

Minerals. — This parish abounds with excellent freestone, coal, 
and ironstone. The quarry of Longannat, in the east part of the 
parish, and near the river, is well known for its excellent durable 
white freestone. It was once wrought by the Dutch, and it is said 
that the Stadt House of Holland was built of the stone of this 
quarry. The Royal Exchange, Infirmary, and Register Office in 
Edinburgh are partly built out of it. There is abundance of coal 
under the recently reclaimed land. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — The old Castle of Tulliallan, which formerly be- 
longed to the Blackadders, is the most remarkable old building in 
the parish. It stands upon a small rising ground to the west of 
the town. A moat, communicating with the Forth, formerly sur- 
rounded the building, which at that time was within 150 yards of 
the river. It must have been a place of great strength. A 
portion of the moat is still visible. Nothing remains of the 
building but the walls and the arch over the ground flat, which 
consists of three rooms. It has given the name to Tulliallan 
Castle, — the chief mansion-house in the parish. The old church 
at Overtown forms the tomb for Lord Keith's family. Some of 
the tomb-stones are very old. Gold, silver, and copper coins of 
the English Edwards' reign are found in the earth of this old 
church, and in the tomb of the Blackadder family. Some Roman 
urns, partially filled with ashes, were dug up on the farm of Dam- 
end, in the north of the parish, so recently as 1880. 

Land-owners. — These are, Trustees of Tulliallan estate; James 
Johnstone, Esq. of Sands; Lord Abercrombie.

Agriculture. — The arable land in this parish is in a state of 
yearly improvement. 

Imperial acres, either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, about 3055 
remaining waste or in pasture, . • J 

under wood, natural and planted, • 505 

The valued rent is about L. 2589, 9s. 6d. Scotch, but the real 
rental of the landward part of the parish is L.4549, 5s. 4d. Ster- 
ling, and this added to the rental of the town, which is L.1772, 
]4s., makes the whole rental of the parish L.6322, Is. 4d. The 
average rent of land per acre is about L.2, 10s. The most im- 
portant improvement in the parish for the last twenty years, is the 
addition made to the arable land by two extensive embankments, 
one on the west, the other on the east of the town of Kincardine. 
The former of these was commenced by the late Lord Viscount 
Leith, in the spring of 1821, and was completed in 1823. The 
length of this embankment is 2020 yards. It height is 1 1 feet 
6 inches above the level of the river Forth. The land thus re- 
claimed is equal to 152 imperial acres, and the expense of the 
embankment was L.6104, 0s. 7d. The other embankment to the 
east of the town, extending from the shipping pier on the west to 
Longannat point on the east, is in length 3040 yards, or nearly 
one mile and three -quarters. Its height averages 16 feet. The 
land reclaimed is equal to 214 acres of alluvial mud, which, when 
the salt is extracted, will bear the richest crops. This embank- 
ment was commenced by the Trustees of the late Lord Viscount 
Keith, in 1829, by a stone embankment, by way of a break-watcr, 
and was finished with a head embankment inside the stone in 
1839. The work proceeded slowly, in order to allow an accumu- 
lation of mud inside, and the tide water which deposited the mud, 
was not excluded until the month of January 1838. This em- 
bankment cost nearly L. 14,000, and is regarded by competent 
judges to be one of the best in Scotland. The land thus reclaim- 
ed constitutes a new farm, and is a great improvement to the 
parish. The soil is strongly impregnated with salt, which must 
be extracted by the sun, rain, and frost, before vegetation com- 
mences, and the first plants which appear on the surface are 
always those which are to be found in salt-marshes, and on the 
shores of the sea. 

Trade and Commerce. — These are decidedly on the decline in 



870 



PERTHSHIRE. 



this parish. The extensive distilleries, collieries, and salt-works, 
which formerly employed many workmen, are totally extinct. The 
shipping interest is also on the decline. Formerly many vessels 
were built here, and during the winter nearly 100 were to be seen 
in the roadstead. In 1786, there were nine on the stocks at one 
time; in 1842, there are only three. The ship-owners buy or 
build vessels oflarge tonnage elsewhere, and these are seldom seen 
at this port, being chiefly employed in the East and West India 
trade, — the Brazils, Mediterranean, and New South Wales. The 
tonnage of vessels belonging to Kincardine is about 9000 tons, 
and allowing L.12 to the ton, the capital invested in them will be 
L. 108,000. There are two small manufactories, one for rope, and 
the other for sailcloth. Several girls are employed in tambouring. 
There are a few plain cloth and damask weavers in the town, 
and the other labourers are chiefly employed by the farmers in the 
parish. 

Fisheries. — These were once numerous and successful in this 
part of the river, but there are now only a few cruives or baskets 
employed for this purpose, which catch a few small fish in autumn, 
and a few salmon are taken with nets in July and August. The 
large quantity of moss floating down the river is supposed to 
have injured the fishings. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — There are three places of worship in the 
parish, two connected with the Church of Scotland, and one be- 
longing to the United Associate Synod. Lady Keith is the pa- 
troness of the parish, and her ladyship, in the exercise of her pa- 
tronage, has always manifested a due respect to the wishes and 
opinion of the people. The present parish church is an elegant 
and substantial building, erected in 1833, at the cost of L.3400, 
and contains accommodation for 1176 sitters. The great majori- 
ty of the population belongs to the Established Church, and their 
number has been lately increased by the union of the Old Light 
Seceders with the Church. There are no Episcopal or Roman 
Catholic familes in the parish. The stipend enjoyed by the pa- 
rish minister is about L.259. The extent of the glebe is about 
13 acres, and its annual value L.40. The present manse was 
built in 1823. It is situated west of the town, and is a comfort- 
able and commodious dwelling. 
Education. — There is a parish school, confessedly too small, with 



TULL1ALLAN. 



a dwelling-house and garden. The school is taught by the mas- 
ter, aided by an assistant, and is attended by 180 scholars. The 
salary is the maximum. The fees are not well paid. The mas- 
ter received for fees last year L.60, out of which he pays L.40 to 
his assistant. Within the last year, a subscription school has been 
built by Government aid. It is taught by an elder of the Esta- 
blished Church, and an assistant, and is attended by 130 scholars. 
An infant school has been lately opened, and promises to be suc- 
cessful. There are three other schools in the town and parish, in 
which sewing, knitting, and the ordinary branches of education 
are taught. There is a general library in the town, consisting of 
upwards of 1000 volumes, which has afforded much instruction to 
the community, and is under excellent management. There are 
two other small libraries, chiefly religious, for the benefit of the 
members of the churches to which they belong. The state of 
education and instruction in this parish is good, and, under the 
Divine blessing, must prove highly beneficial to the moral and in- 
tellectual character of the rising generation. 

Town of Kincardine. — The town of Kincardine, which contains 
the greatest proportion of the population of the parish, is situated 
on the north bank of the Forth, about midway between Stirling 
and Edinburgh. It is a burgh of barony. The Trustees of Lord 
Keith are the superiors, and they appoint baron-bailies as magis- 
trates. The town has been very irregularly built. The houses 
are mostly one storv, and covered with tile ; but those recently 
built contain two or three flats, and are covered with slate. The 
streets are in a bad state, but there is a prospect of their being 
improved. There are two good inns in the town, and at the post- 
office there are two arrivals from the east and west during the 
twenty-four hours. There is a branch of the Glasgow Union and 
Commercial Banks in the town, which affords great accommoda- 
tion to the surrounding district. A coach passes through the 
town daily for Glasgow, and st;am-boats ply regularly between 
Edinburgh and Stirling, and take in passengers at the pier. 

Puor and their Provision. — The number of the poor on the ses- 
sion roll is 51. This number is small in proportion to the popu- 
lation of the parish ; but many of the parishioners receive Trinity 
money and other annuities, and are thereby rendered more indepen- 
dent of parochial assistance. There is also a society of ladies who 
minister much to the comfort and support of the poor. One of the 



872 



PERTHSHIRE. 



causes of pauperism is, the increased population of many parishes, 
where not one-half of the people are known by either the minister 
or elders. Applicants are put on the roll of whose name and cir- 
cumstances, the session knows nothing. " Wherever the carcass 
is, there will the eagles be gathered together." The success of 
one applicant encourages others, and in a few years the poor roll 
of a parish may be crowded with the names of those who may be 
among the least necessitous of the poor. In any parish where the 
population exceeds 3000, this may happen, and the alone practi- 
cal sufficient remedy for this evil is, the reduction of our large pa- 
rishes to such an extent as shall enable the minister and elders to 
be acquainted with every family and individual within their bounds. 
The heritors of Scotland would consult their best interests bv aid- 
ing the Church in any device for bringing the people under a 
strict efficient parochial superintendence, and thereby mitigating 
the manifold evils which flow from the ignorance, poverty, and vice 
of a neglected and discontented population. In this parish, however, 
every individual is known by name to the minister and elders. 
Application for relief is made by the elder of the district in which 
the applicant resides, and the case is disposed of according to its 
merits. Occasional aid is given to those who may fall into dis- 
tress from sickness and other causes. In some cases, where the 
habits of the poor are bad, their allowance in money is converted 
into some of the necessaries of life, and given to them as such. 
They receive payment every Monday morning, and are generally 
contented and grateful. The elders have a sympathy for the poor, 
and this produces mutual confidence and respect. The average 
sum allotted to each per week is Is. 6d. Their support and other 
expenses connected with the church and parish are defrayed out 
of the collections, aided by donations from the heritors. These 
last year amounted to about L.200.

I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Extent, These two parishes were united about 150 
years ago, and took their names from the saints to whom they 
"were dedicated. The united parish extends from the banks of the 
Tay about 5 miles to the east, forming an oblong square, averaging 
nearly two miles in breadth. The soil in general is a black 
mould, with a till bottom, and seems originally to have been taken 
from moor, but is now mostly all cultivated. Limestone is also 
found, though not used to any great extent. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers.— The registers commence in 1712. Till 
about 1820, matters of church discipline, cash transactions, births, 
and marriages were all huddled into one book ; but since that pe- 
riod, there has been a distinct and accurate register of each kept.

Antiquities.— Under this head fall to be noticed the remains of 
Macbeth's Castle at Cairnbeddie, Caer Bed or Caer Beth, the 
Castle of Macbeth. It is still known by this name among the 
people of the country. The ground on which the castle stood is 
considerably elevated, being a circular spot of about 230 feet in 
diameter, and surrounded by a moat 30 feet in breadth. Tradi- 
tion has handed down, that this place, not being secure against the

many insurrections of the times, Macbeth removed to the cele- 
brated Hill of Dunsinnan ; that by the advice of two witches, the 
most celebrated at that time in the kingdom, and living one on 
each side of Macbeth, he fortified the castle on Dunsinnan Hill ; 
that they met him one night at a place still called " the witch 
stane" where a remarkable stone still stands, about a mile from 
his old residence, and warned him to beware " Till Birnam forest 
come to Dunsinane." About twenty-four years ago, a great 
quantity of earth was removed from one side of the mound, and 
horse shoes, apparently like those of ponies, were found in great 
abundance; likewise handles of swords and dirks.

teind, however, is not all exhausted, and it is upwards of twenty 
years since an augmentation. There are two glebes,— one seven 
acres, the other, four and a half, worth about L.2, 10s. per an- 
num. The manse was built in 1791, and thoroughly repaired in 
1837. It is commodious and comfortable. 

Education.— There are two schools in the parish, both efficient-

]y taught. The parochial teacher has received a classical educa- 
tion, and is so highly esteemed that young men often come to 
him' from other parishes to finish their education. The salary is 
the maximum. He receives about L.24 Sterling from school fees, 
and about L.6 from other sources. With regard to the other 
school, there are no emoluments but the school fees, which are 
very small, and the ground for school and school-house, furnished 
by the Guildry Incorporation of Perth. There are likewise two 
Sabbath schools in the parish ; one taught by the minister, for 
young persons, fourteen years or upwards, the other for young- 
children.

is a branch of the Perth Savings Bank. It was recently esta- 
blished. 

p oor , The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 

is 19 ; and the average sum allotted to each of such persons is 
about Is. 6d. per week, or L.3, 18s. per year, exclusive of house- 
rents, coals, clothing, &amp;c. The average annual amount of contri- 
butions for relief of the poor is about L.99, 17s. 3d. Sterling ; viz. 
from church collections about L.51, 15s. 3d. ; from voluntary con- 
tributions of heritors, L.20 ; from alms or legacies, &amp;c. L.4, 2s. ;

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. C. C. STEWART, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — THe Old Statistical Account states that the parishes 
of Aberdalgie and Dupplin were united into one parish in the 
year 1618. In the times of Episcopacy, the parish of Aberdalgie 
seems to have been included within the diocese of Dunkeld, while 
that of Dupplin belonged to the diocese of Dunblane. Indeed 
the church of Dupplin seems only to have been a family chapel, 



876 



PERTHSHIRE. 



attached to the Castle " de Dnpline" for the benefit of its pos- 
sessors. 

Extent, fyc. — The extent of the parish, from east to west, is 
about 3 miles; and from north to south, about 2i miles. It is 
compact, situated upon the rising ground which forms the 
northern boundary of the beautiful vale of Strathearn, while the 
view is limited to the south by the Ochil Hiils. The Earn forms 
the southern boundary of the parish, separating it from the pa- 
rishes of Forgandenny and Forteviot. This high land range 
slopes gradually again to the north, overlooking the rich and wide- 
spread valleys of the Almond, the Tay, and Strathmore ; while 
the noble range of the Grampians in the distance, with their tow- 
ering summits, forms a splendid boundary to this panoramic scene. 
On the north-east, the parish is joined by the landward part of 
the East Church parish of Perth ; and on the south-east, by a 
portion of the parish of Forteviot ; on the north, it is bounded by 
the parish of Tibbermuir \ and on the west, by that of Forteviot. 

The Earn is remarkable for its beautiful windings through the 
Strath, especially from the bridge of Forteviot to the Bridge of 
Earn. The various elegant seats of noblemen and gentlemen 
on the declivities, and the substantial farm-houses and offices, all 
ornamented with much fine wood, form a scene which strikes the 
eye of every traveller with delight. The river is subject to great 
inundations. It is famous for salmon and a variety of fresh-water 
trouts, which are caught by the net or in cruives. 

Geolagy. — The prevailing stratum of this parish, along with 
tracts of the surrounding country, is sandstone of the older for- 
mation. There are several quarries in the parish, the finest of 
which is at the Milton. Of this stone the present manse has 
been built. 

Plantations. — In no part of the country is finer wood to be seen 
and of greater variety than around Dupplin Castle. The sweet 
and horse chestnuts are of great age. Black spruce of the greatest 
dimensions, with quantities of beech, and the fine old Scots fir, 
with its massive gnarled arms of great size, adorn the avenues 
leading to the castle. Larger solitary trees may be found in other 
places ; but it is generally acknowledged that few seats in Scot- 
land are surrounded by such an extent and variety of large and 
valuable wood as Dupplin Castle. The old plantations extend to 
about 200 Scots acres, and the present Earl has planted about 150. 

II. — Civil History. 
The oldest session record is of date February 14, 1613, and is 



ABEUDALGIE AND DUPPLIN. 



877 



preserved with singlar regularity, and but few omissions, down to 

1656. This manuscript, if deciphered, might prove interest- 
ing. The records disclose a lamentable picture of the state 
of the country during Cromwell's usurpation. Mr Playfair was 
superannuated during the keen debates between the Resolu- 
tioners and Protesters, and incapable of taking an active part in 
these troublous times. After many difficulties, Mr Francis Hay, 
Laird of Balhousie, and sole heritor of Aberdalgie and Dupplin, 
granted a competent stipend for a colleague and assistant to Mr 
Playfair, when, in the end of the year 1656, a call was moderated 
in favour of Mr George Halyburton, who was ordained in August 

1657. Mr Playfair died about 1658, when Mr George Halybur- 
ton, named Junior to distinguish him from his cousin, minister of 
Perth, and who afterwards, conforming, became Bishop of Dun- 
keld in 1662, and died in 1664, became sole minister till 1662, 
when he was ejected and deposed, along with five other ministers 
of the Presbytery of Perth, and about 300 ministers of the Church, 
for nonconformity. He married Margaret Playfair, daughter of 
the Rev. Andrew Playfair, his predecessor. These were the pa- 
rents of the eminent and pious Thomas Halyburton, who was 
born in Dupplin in 1674, and afterwards minister of Ceres, and 
Professor of Divinity in St Andrews, in 1710, and who died at 
the early age of thirty-eight years. 

Upon Mr George Halyburton's ejection, in 1662, Mr George 
Hay, Laird of Balhousie, Aberdalgie, and Dupplin, a gentleman 
of exemplary piety, and a great sufferer for nonconformity, pro- 
vided him with a house and refuge near Dupplin, where Mr Haly- 
burton dwelt with his family in great privacy, till his death in 1682. 

During the prevalence of Prelacy, succeeded, 23d August 
1663, Mungo Weemys, son of David Weemys, the conforming 
minister of Scone. About 1675, succeeded David Lauder; and, 
February 19th 1679, John Hardie, who was early deprived of his 
office after the Revolution. 

After the Revolution, in 1688, David Shaw was ordained 23d 
September 1691, at which period the kirk-session records are re- 
sumed, after a blank of thirty- five years, and are continued with 
great regularity till about the time of Mr Shaw's translation to 
Auchterarder, which took place in October 1718. Mr Shaw was 
succeeded by Mr James Mercer of Clavage, well known as the 
bitter opponent and accuser of Ebenezer Erskine of Stirling for 
his synod sermon, delivered at Perth in October 1732, which 



878 



PERTHSHIRE. 



proved the origin of the great secession from the Church of Scot- 
land. He was translated from Forte viot to Aberdalgie 31st De- 
cember 1718. 

From 1717 to 1736 the volume of the kirk-session records has 
either been lost or destroyed. 

Mr Thomas Rankine, who was ordained minister of Kinnoull 
in 1733, was translated to Aberdalgie in November 1745, and 
died in 1781; when Mr William Garvie succeeded him on Ja- 
nuary 10, 1782. Mr Garvie was translated from West Calder, 
and died in 1831, at an advanced age; when he was succeeded by 
the present incumbent, Mr Charles C.Stewart, on March 15, 1832. 

Dupplin Castle. — The castle mentioned in the last Statistical 
Account was burned to the ground by accident on the 1 1th Sep- 
tember 1827, and in the course of five years afterwards, a new 
and very handsome edifice was erected on the same site by the 
present Thomas Robert Drummond Hay, Earl of Kinnoull, under 
the auspices of Mr Burn of Edinburgh, after the Elizabethan 
style of architecture, at a sum exceeding L.30,000. The greater 
part of the valuable library and paintings were fortunately pre- 
served from the conflagration, though some valuable manuscripts 
of historical interest were unfortunately destroyed. 

The Lords Oliphant of Bachilton were for centuries the feudal 
lords of Aberdalgie. A full account of this ancient family is given 
in Douglas's and Crawford's Peerage. 

III. — Population. 

At every decade since the beginning of the century the popu- 
lation has been decreasing. 

Amount of population in 1801, . 542 

1811, . 513 
1821, . 490 
1831, . 434 
1841, . 330 

The principal causes of the decrease seem to be the throwing 
of small farms into larger ones, and the decay or destruction of 
cottars' houses, while fewer are erected than those which were de- 
stroyed. The farmers consequently complain of want of labour- 
ers, especially during the spring and harvest, when they find it 
requisite to send to the town of Perth for labourers. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — This parish is not behind the rest of the district 
in its agricultural improvements. The most essential of these 
has certainly been the system of wedge-draining, now so generally 



ABERDALG1E AND DUPPLIN. 



879 



adopted, which, from its instant effects in drying wet and tilly 
lands and cold subsoils, speedily repays the tenant for his labour 
and expense. The introduction of turnip husbandry has likewise 
proved very beneficial both to the tenantry and to the lands, and 
has been the means of introducing not a little sheep-husbandry, 
especially during the winter season. Potatoes, which have become 
of late years a valuable article of export from Strathearn, have 
been much grown in this district, and have much improved the 
lands, owing to the facilities thereby given to the obtaining of fo- 
reign manure, great quantities of which are driven to this parish 
from Perth. 

Wheat is much cultivated in the south part of the parish, 
where the land is of a rich loam and clay, and where it is well 
exposed to the genial influence of the sun ; but in the northern 
district, which is much exposed to the north winds, and a cold 
tilly soil, oats, barley, pease, and beans form the only corn crops. 

The valued rent of the parish of Aberdalgie and Dupplin is 
about L.3000 Scots. The average rental of the last seven years  
L.3200 Sterling. 

The parish consists of six large farms, containing from 156 to 
280 Scots arable acres, exclusive of pasture, and three smaller 
ones varying in extent. 

The number of arable acres may amount to 2500, and there 
are about 50 acres incapable of cultivation, and lying waste. 
The total number of Scots acres in the parish is about 2900. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — The road from Perth to Stirling 
passes through the parish for nearly three miles. Lord Kinnoull 
advanced L.3000 for the commencement of this road. It was 
finished in the year 1811, and has proved an unspeakable benefit 
both to the commercial and agricultural interests of this part of 
the country. Many excellent farm-houses have been built along 
its line, and the facilities afforded for the conveyance of lime and 
other manures, as well as for the export of the produce, have 
greatly increased the productiveness and value of farms which 
formerly boasted but of little arable land. The old road passes 
likewise through the parish upon its northern declivity : but a far 
better line has been adopted for the new one in the plain below. 

Ecclesiastical State — The present church of Aberdalgie was 
built in the year 1773, and a vault was constructed beneath the 
church for the burying-place of the noble family of Kinnoull. 



880 



PERTHSHIRE. 



The ancient burying-place, however, is at the church of Kinnoull, 
where a monument was erected in 1635 to the memory of Sir 
George Hay, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, and the first Earl of 
Kinnoull, who died in 1634. 

The church stands in need of considerable repair, but might be 
easily rendered very comfortable. It is a pretty object, adorned 
with abundance of the creeping ivy, and surrounded by sycamores 
of exceeding beauty, rendering the burying-ground attached to it 
sheltered and retired, an emblem of the peace and repose which 
reigns in the graves beneath, " where the weary are at rest." 

The foundations of the old church of Dupplin remain within 
the small enclosed burying-ground, situated at a beautiful bend 
of the river, while a little above it, on an eminence, stands the 
Castle of Dupplin. Until the death of the late incumbent in 
1831, the manse and glebe were contiguous to this old church- 
yard ; but in 1832, upon the induction of the present incumbent, 
an excambion of the glebe lands was made, and they are now si- 
tuated close to the parish church. 

In 1833, a new manse and offices were built by the Earl of 
Kinnoull, from a plan furnished by Mr Burn of Edinburgh, which 
is regarded, almost without exception, as the best and most com- 
modious manse within the bounds of the presbytery. The new 
glebe, including the site of manse and offices with the garden, is 
about 14 acres in extent, and may be valued at L.l, 10s. per 
acre. The stipend is L.92, 17s. in money, 4 bolls, 1 firlot, 3 
lippies of barley, and 9 bolls, 1 firlot, 3± lippies of meal, which, 
at the average fiar prices for the last seven years, would be L.l 2 
3s., making the stipend amount to the value of L.105. An an- 
nual grant is made by the Exchequer of L.58, 14s. 8d., which 
includes in it an allowance of L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 
The Earl of Kinnoull is sole heritor of the parish, and is vice- 
patron of the living with the Crown. 

In the " Rotuli Scotise," preserved in the Tower of London, 
and ordered to be printed by George III., mention is made of 
one " Adam Parson curate of Dippling and vicar of Perth." 
This is the earliest ecclesiastic whose name has been met with as 
connected with this parish. This document is dated Berwick, 
2d September 1296. The name of Sir John Myrton, canon of 
the cathedral of Dunkeld, and prebendary of Forgandenny, and 
rector of the parish church of Dupplin, occurs as witness to a 

3 



ABERDALGIE AND DUPPLIN. 



88 



charter, dated 31st December 1489, of the Carthusian convents 
and priory of Perth. He died 2d August 1507. 

After the Reformation in 1560, the paucity of ordained mi- 
nisters was so great, as to render it expedient to unite many pa- 
rishes under the care of one ordained minister, and to supply the 
deficiency by readers pro tempore. 

Agreeably to this arrangement it appears, from " the Register 
of Assignations for the ministers' stipend for the year 1 574," pre- 
served in the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh, that the following 
parishes were united in one cure for the time : — Tibbermuir, 
Dupplin, Aberdalgie, and Pitcairne ; Alexander Young, minister. 
Aberdalgie and Dupplin, William Melrose, minister, William 
Gibson, reidar, 1569. Robert Symsonn, reidar at Dupplin; 
John Moir, reidar at Aberdagy. These were probably the very 
first persons settled here after the Reformation. The presbytery 
or session records supply us with no information of an earlier date 
than February 14th 1613, when Mr Andrew Playfair was or- 
dained here under the forms of Episcopacy, which the year before 
had been re-established by James VI. 

Education. — The present school-house and schoolmaster's re- 
sidence were built in 1826. The schoolmaster's house affords lit- 
tle more than the legal accommodation ; but both it and the school- 
room are well finished. The salary is the maximum, L.34, 4s. 
4d. ; amount of fees, about L.10; and other emoluments, about 
L.3, 10s., with the legal quantity of garden ground. 

Poor — The number of persons receiving parochial aid is 12. 
The church collections are quite inadequate for their maintenance ; 
but the present Earl of Kinnoull has proved as kind and benevo-

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYXOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER BURT, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Arngask, sometimes erroneously written Arngosk, is 
the ancient as well as modern name of this parish. It has been 
supposed to be compounded of the Gaelic words, Ard-nan-gaisg, 
the hill or height of heroism. Though we are unable to point to 
any authentic account of a battle having been fought, or to the 
performance of any extraordinary feat of valour, to entitle the lo- 
cality to be regarded as a scene of bravery, yet it is not impro- 
bable that Cairn Geddes, referred to under a subsequent head, 
may be connected with some event which would justify the appli- 
cation of the name. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish extends about four miles 
from east to west, and nearly three from south to north. Its su- 
perficial extent forms an area of fully 9 square miles t Its figure 
is somewhat of a circular form. But the boundary line is irregu- 
lar, in consequence of slight indentations produced by some of the 
contiguous parishes. It is bounded on the east, by the parish of 
Abernethy; on the south and south-east, by the parishes of Or- 
well and Strathmiglo; on the west, by those of Forteviot and 
Forgandenny ; and on the north, by that of Dron. 

The climate is on the whole favourable both for vegetation and 
health. There is no distemper peculiar to the parish. 

Topographical Appearances. — The counties of Perth, Fife, and 
Kinross meet at Damhead, and the parish is almost equally situ- 
ated in these counties. It embraces a portion of the Ochil Hills, 
which stretch from the Forth, in the north east of Stirling- 
shire, to the immediate vicinity of Ferry-Port- on- Craig, on the 
southern bank of the Tay, and may therefore, in its general as- 
pect, be denominated hilly, consisting, as it were, of a combina-

tion of gentle rounded waved-like elevations, varying in height 
from 600 to 800 feet above the level of the sea. The grounds, 
particularly of Conland, Newfargie, Letham, Paris, and Dun- 
crivie are laid out in a tasteful manner, substantially enclosed, 
and embellished with wood. The general appearance of the 
parish is pleasing and varied, and the views from many parts of 
it are singularly beautiful and extensive. The prospect from 
Cairn Geddes, a part of the lands of Fordel, is particularly 
splendid, comprehending the Frith of Tay, Carse of Gowrie, the 
Sidlaws, terminating in Moncrieff and Kinnoull hills, the upper 
part of Strathearn, and a considerable portion of the Grampian 
range. 

Hydrography. — The parish abounds with springs, which afford, 
at all seasons, a copious supply of excellent water. These springs, 
owing to the general structure or undulating form of the parish, 
give rise to numerous rivulets, most of which are tributaries to the 
Farg, — a small stream which rises near the western extremity of 
the parish, and, for upwards of a mile, separates it from that of 
Forgandenny. It then flows through the parish, separating, till 
it reaches Damhead, the county of Kinross from that of Perth. 
Then it begins to separate the county of Perth from that of Fife, 
and continues to form the boundary between these counties till it 
arrives at the point where it leaves the parish, about the middle of 
the romantic and beautifully wooded glen to which it communi- 
cates its name, and which travellers so much admire. The Faro- 
abounds with trout, and is much frequented by the angler. 

Geology, 8fc— The parish does not present any thing of much 
interest, considered in a geological point of view. It is composed 
of trap rocks, and, from certain appearances, it is not improbable 
that these are of igneous or volcanic origin. The most remarkable 
vein traverses the parish from east to west : it is composed of 
greenstone, which, as it passes through the lands of Pittillock, 
Arngask, and Hilton, is of a compact and fine texture, and of a 
dark hue, in consequence of containing a great proportion of au- 
gite ; but, in passing through the lands of Blair and Plains, while 
the rock is equally compact, it is of a coarser grain, consisting of 
felspar and hornblende, and, when broken, it presents a ro'ugh 
crystallized aspect. Instances of porphyritic rock are to be seen 
upon the lands of Fordel ; and beds of amygdaloid, frequently 
coarse and tuffaceous, are found in several parts of the parish, and,

PERTHSHIRE. 



in the vesicular cavities by which this kind of structure is charac- 
terized, we find beautiful specimens of agate, calcareous spar, and 
zeolite. 

Soil. — The soil, of which there exists a considerable diversity, 
is principally formed from the decomposition of the trap or whin- 
stone rocks. In general, it is of a black loamy character ; and 
though some fields are light and shallow, yet many others are 
comparatively rich, and capable of yielding abundant crops. There 
is not much of it of a gravelly description ; but, among the waste 
or uncultivated land, there is a considerable extent of moorish or 
heathy soil. 

II. — Civil History. 
Notices regarding the Parish In the chartulary of Cambus- 
kenneth, preserved in the Advocates' Library, are contained seve- 
ral charters relating to the church of Arngask, and certain lands 
in the parish. From this source, we learn that, in 1281, Gilbertus 
Frislay, dominus de Forgey, gave to God and to the monastery of 
Cambuskenneth the patronage of the church of Arngask, with the 
piece of land which lies near the house of the priest " in territorio 
de Arngosk." Soon afterwards, this grant was confirmed by Wil- 
liam Bishop of St Andrews, with the whole revenues " paupertati 
dicti monasterii compacientes." We next find a charter of resig- 
nation, in 1282, by Radolphus, dominus de Symmersdburn, rector 
of the church of Arngask. Then appears a document, styled 
" Institutio ejusdem ecclesiae," &amp;c. and this deed was followed, in 
the same year, by a confirmation, by the chapter of St Andrews 
and John, the Prior of the cathedral, of the church and church 
lands of Arngask. Henricus de Frislay, dominus de Forgey, in 
J 295, made a grant of the mill of Arngask, with two acres of land 
near it, to the abbey of Cambuskenneth, " pro salute animal suae." 
Sir William Frislay, miles, dominus de Forgey, confirmed the 
deed of his predecessor, which is ratified by a charter under the 
Great Seal of King Robert at Glasgow in 1325. The Frislays, 
it appears, possessed the barony of Arngask " et dominium de 
Forgey" till about 1332, when the heiress of that name married 
Sir Richard Barclay of Kippo. Hugh Barclay, laird of Kippo 
and Arngask, by a charter to the Blackfriars of Perth, dated at 
Perth 18th September 1389, "granted to them," according to 
the superstition of those times, " for the salvation of his own soul 
and the souls of his predecessors and successors, in pure and per- 



ARNGASK.

petual alms, to God, the blessed Mary, and the Predicant Friars 
of Perth, ten shillings Sterling out of his lands of Arngask, to be 
paid in equal proportions at two terms of the year, viz. five at the 
feast of Pentecost, and other five at the feast of the blessed Mar- 
tin in winter, for the sustenance of one burning lamp in the choir 
of the foresaid friars, from year to year for ever," &amp;c. "29th charter 
in the chartulary of the Blackfriars of Perth. The Barclays con- 
tinued in possession of the baronies of Kippo, Arngask, &amp;c, till 
the reign of James IV., when James Barclay of Kippo died with- 
out male issue, and was succeeded by his daughter, Margaret, as 
his sole heiress. This lady was married, about 1491, to Sir An- 
drew Murray, second son of Sir W. Murray of Tullfbardine, and, 
on the 24th January 1507, she resigned, in the hands of King- 
James, her whole estate for new infeftment to herself and her hus- 
band, Sir A. Murray of Balvaird, in liferent, and the fee to their 
offspring. The said lady, with consent of her husband, and Sir 
David Murray, their son and heir, founded a chaplainry in the pa- 
rish church of Arngask, and endowed it with an annuity of 14 
merks and two acres of land, lying contiguous to the church, for 
the prosperity of their sovereign James V., and for the health and 
welfare of themselves, their heirs, and successors, " et omnium 
fidelium defunctorum." The deed of mortification is dated at the 
Castle of Balvaird in 1527, and the name of one of the witnesses 
is John Bullerwale, curate of the said church of Arngosk. 

By an act of Parliament, in 1606, the abbacy of Cambusken- 
neth, with which Arngask, and many other kirks had been con- 
nected for several centuries, was erected into a temporal lordship 
in favour of John Erskine, Earl of Mar. These churches were 
hereby disunited and dissolved from the said Abbacy, and the 
Kirklands were comprehended within the newly created lordship 
of Cardrois, or lordship of Cambuskenneth, as it is styled in char- 
ters held by proprietors of church lands within this parish. The 
act provides that the foresaid parsonages and vicarages { sail be 
provydit and plantit with qualefeit, godlie, and learnit persons, apt 
and hable to instruct the parohineris thairof, in the knawin veritie. 
For which purpose the advocation, donation, and full right and 
titill of all sundrie the foresaid kirks are given, granted, and dis- 
poned to the foresaid Lord John, Earl of Mar," &amp;c. This im- 
portant act re-enacts and declares the parish church of Arngask 
and the others named with it, to be, in all time coming, the legal

PERTHSHIRE. 



parish kirks of their respective localities, as they had formerly been 
so before the Reformation.  

The parish must have been originally small. But it was con- 
siderably enlarged by a decree dated -25th November 1642, dis- 
joining- Clashjeuglie, Glendymiln, Blair, Plains, and the lands of 
Easter and Wester Fordell with their pertinents, from the parish 
of Forgandenny, and annexing them to the parish of Arngask in 
all time coming. And on 28th July 1669, it received a further 
enlargement, and attained its present magnitude. On that occasion, 
as we learn from Connell on the Law of Parishes, " the minister, 
of Arngask obtained a decree disjoining the lands of Hiltown and 
Grammore" Carmore " from the parishes of Orwell and Strath- 
miglo, and annexing them to Arngask, as being much nearer 
thereto, MS. D " We have not had an opportunity of examin - 
ing the authority to which Sir J. C. refers ; but while Hiltown is 
unquestionably in this parish, Carmore is still considered as be- 
longing to Strathmiglo. 

Ministers of the Parish. — Soon after the Reformation, when 
there was a great scarcity of Reformed ministers, John Pittblado, 
as we learn from the register of ministers, exhorters, and readers, 
and of their stipends, sen the yeir of God 1567, which was printed 
for the Maitland Club in 1830, was reidar at Arngask about the 
year 1569, with xvi. li., i. e. L.16 Scots of stipend. And Alex- 
ander Wardlaw, as we find from the register of assignations for the 
ministers' stipends, for 1574, an ancient MS. in the Advocates' Li- 
brary, officiated here in the same capacity. It appears from the 
Presbytery record that the parish was for a considerable time under 
the pastoral superintendence of the ministers of Strathmiglo. 1. Mr 
George Moncrieff, son of Mr Archibald Moncrieff, minister of Aber- 
nethy,wasthe first Protestant minister of Arngask. From a minute of 
Presbytery, August 14, 1633, we find that a letter from his relative, 
Mr Andrew Murray, minister of Abdie, was produced in favour of 
Mr Moncrieff, " desiring the brethren to license the said Mr George 
to preach at Arngask kirk, till the said kirk be provided and plant- 
ed. The brethren having considered the same, gave license to 
the said Mr George, till the first day of November, and no fur- 
ther, lest, under pretext of his serving the cure, the plantation 
thereof be hindered." He was appointed the minister of the pa- 
rish in October 1635, and continued in the discharge of his pas- 



 Scots Acts of Parliament, Vol. iv. p. 343.

toral duties for the period of nearly thirty years. He was one of 
the sixteen ministers of the Presbytery who, in 1662, conformed 
to Prelacy. It is stated in the Presbytery record, 1664, that in 
the Privy Censures, Mr George Moncrieff, minister of Am- 
gask, was approven in life and doctrine." 2. Mr Robert Ged- 
deis, in August J 665, became the Episcopal incumbent of Arn- 
gask, and, according to the Presbytery Record, " was unanimous- 
ly accepted by the heritors thereof." But at the Revolution he 
was served with a libel by the Presbytery, and, as repeated acts of 
drunkenness were proved against him, was deposed from the mi- 
nistry on the 8th October 1690. 3. Mr Gilbert Melville, who 
had been one of the field preachers under the persecution period, 
was appointed, 18th December 1688, to officiate as a Presbyterian 
minister at Arngask, though the Episcopal incumbent was neither 
deprived of his office by the Privy- Council, nor as yet deposed by 
the church. But not having been regularly called to the parish, 
and probably enjoying little or no remuneration for his services, 
he accepted a call to Glendevon, and was loosed from Arngask on 
the 2d of June 1694. 4. Mr John Dempster received a call from 
the parishioners of Arngask, 27th November 1694, and was ordain- 
ed by the Presbytery, and legally admitted minister of the parish on 
the 27th February 1695. He was loosed from Arngask 13th March 
1706, and transported to St Madois on the 27th of that month. 
5. Mr James Gillespie had a call moderated to him, 17th De- 
cember 1706. " All the heritors and elders voted and subscribed, 
nemine contra clicente." Session record. He was ordained on the 
21st of May 1707. The day of his death is not specified; but 
it appears from the session record, that he preached for the 
last time on the 23d November 1729, and was buried on the 
8th of the following month. 6. Mr John Johnston was ordain- 
ed 10th March 1731, and died on the 28th of December 
1746. The Rev. Dr David Johnston, who was long the mi- 
nister of North Leith, and much distinguished for his Chris- 
tian worth, was his second son. 7. Mr Andrew Williamson 
was ordained on the 3d November 1747, and continued to be the 
minister of the parish for thirty- five years. He was transported 
to Auchtergaven in December 1782. 8. Mr William Lang, who 
had for several years previously assisted Sir Robert Preston, one 
of the ministers of Cupar, received a unanimous call to be minister 
of Arngask on the 26th of June, and was ordained on the 18th

September 1783. He died on the 10th of January 1827. 9. 
The present incumbent, a native of the parish, was ordained as- 
sistant and successor to Mr Lang, 14th October 1819. 

Parochial Registers. — These consist of several volumes, and, 
upon the whole, have been regularly kept. They extend back 
to 1688, and the date of their earliest entry is the 18th December 
of that year. 

Land-owners. — The heritors of the parish at present are 28 
in number, and, with the exception of five of the non-resi- 
dent, are proprietors of land of the yearly value of L.50 and up- 
wards. The chief of these, in the order of their valued rents, 
are, W. Murray, Esq. of Conland ; J. Hay, Esq. of Paris ; A. 
Coventry, Esq. of Pittillock ; Mrs Captain Wardlaw, and R. Low, 
Esq. of Fordels ; J. Burt, Esq. portioner of part of Duncrivie and 
Deuglie ; J. Whyte, Esq. of Arngask ; Colonel G. Miller of 
Eastertown ; Rev. A. Burt, of Wester Deuglie ; Mrs Barclay, of 
Glendymill ; J. Murray, Esq. of Forresterseat ; W. Hay, Esq. 
of Haysmill ; W. Henderson, Esq. of Blairstruie ; C. G. Sidey, 
Esq. of Letham ; J. Bogie, Esq. of Oldfargie; W. Simpson, Esq. 
of Hayfield, &amp;c. Ten of the heritors are resident, and some of 
them farm their own lands. 

Antiquities. — The parish scarcely affords any materials for the 
exercise of antiquarian skill. We may state, however, that on 
the farm of Newfargie, near the turnpike road which passes 
through Glenfarg, there is a large block of mica-slate weighing 
several tons, which, until a recent period, was so nicely balanced 
on a rock, that it moved by a slight pressure of the hand. This 
was long regarded as a singular curiosity ; but the equilibrium, 
by some means unknown, has been completely destroyed. The 
stone must have reached its present position by human ingenuity; 
but in what way, or for what purpose, remains to be discovered. 

We are equally incompetent to furnish a satisfactory account 
of the origin of Cairn Geddes, a small artificial mound in the 
north-west district of the parish. It was formerly covered with a 
considerable quantity of stones, but these have been recently re- 
moved for the purpose of filling drains. No account or tradition 
concerning this cairn has come down to us. It was partially 
opened in the centre some years ago, and a rude stone coffin was 
discovered about three feet from the surface. Had the work of 
excavation been more extensive, it would probably have led to 



AUNGASK. 



889 



more important discoveries. As yet, however, nothing has been 
ascertained which can warrant us to affirm with precision, that 
under the cairn were deposited the ashes of a once renowned but 
now forgotten hero. 

It may not be uninteresting to add, that in the church, which 
was demolished previous to the erection of the present edifice, 
there was a statue of rude workmanship, with the beads employed 
by Roman Catholics attached to the hands. This relic of anti- 
quity lay for many years on the site of the former church ; but, 
in consequence of directions given by the late Earl of Mansfield, 
it was at last removed to the Castle of Balvaird. This statue, it 
is supposed, was formed in honour of Margaret Barclay, spouse 
of Sir Andrew Murray of Balvaird, who, in 1527, as already 
stated, founded and endowed a chaplainry in the church of Arn- 
gask. 

J II. — Population. 
When the census was taken by Dr Webster in 1755, the popu- 
lation amounted to 736, but in 1790, when the last Statistical Ac- 
count was drawn up, it had decreased to 554. By the Parliamen- 
tary census of 1801, it was found to be 564, and by that of 1831 
it amounted to 712. The Government census of 1841 repre- 
sents the population at 750, of whom there are 380 males, and 
370 females. By a minute numerical survey which the incum- 
bent took in 1839, the total number of inhabitants was ascertained 
to be 724. 

Of this last number, 267 were under 15 years of age. 

148 were betwixt 15 and 30 
179 . 30 and 50 

106 . 50 and 70 

24 . 70 and 90 

The yearly number of proclamations, taking the average of the last 7 years, is 6s 
The yearly average number of interments, . . . jjj 

The average number of births per annum, . . . jg 

Number of bachelors and widowers above 50 years of age, . . 22 

widows and unmarried women above 45 years of age, . 40 

From the number of baptisms registered, it is obvious that the 
population, during the first half of the last century, was fully as 
great as it is at present. The diminution which took place dur- 
ing the second half of the century appears to have been occasion- 
ed chiefly by the removal of cottages, and by converting, at least in 
one instance, several small pendicles or farms into one. Candy, 
during that period, consisted of four distinct farms, with an equal 
number of cottages, and thus afforded accommodation for eio-ht fa- 



890 



PERTHSHIRE. 



milies; whereas, for the space of nearly half-a century, the only 
dwelling-house on the farm has been occupied exclusively by the 
tenant. Lustielaw, during the same period, exhibited the appear- 
ance of a village, and contained upwards of twenty families, many 
of whom, along with their cottages and gardens, rented small pen- 
dicles ; but these cottages, with the exception of half-a dozen, 
which still remain, have long since been demolished. The in- 
crease which has taken place during the present century has been 
occasioned by the erection of houses along the side of the new 
turnpike road. 

The people are in general intelligent, steady, sober, and indus- 
trious. The bothy system has, of late years, been partially intro- 
duced ; but the effects which have hitherto resulted from its ope- 
ration prevent us from bearing our testimony in its favour. The 
demoralizing practice of smuggling has, for a period of more than 
twenty years, been completely suppressed. Poaching in game, it 
is to be regretted, prevails to some extent. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — There are 6110 acres standard imperial measure 
in the parish. Of this number 4590 are arable, 1291 uncultivat- 
ed, and 235 under wood, planted chiefly within the last thirty years. 

Rent and Leases. — The valued rent, according to the cess-books 
of the three counties in which the parish is situated, is L. 2614, 
4s. 4d. Scots. The real rent is about L. 5217 Sterling. Some 
of the lands being occupied by the proprietors themselves, can 
only be reported at an estimated value; but, from information col- 
lected by the writer, the above sum, it is believed, must be ex- 
ceedingly near the present yearly rental. The average rent of the 
whole, exclusive of the portion under wood, is upwards of 17s. per 
imperial acre. A considerable portion of the arable land is let at 
L. 2 ; and some fields, when let for pasture during the season, oc- 
casionally bring L. 4 an acre. The average rent of the arable 
land per acre may be reckoned at L. 1, Is. 9d. ; whereas that of 
the permanent pasture, or uncultivated ground, does not exceed 
3s. 5d. Leases are generally granted for nineteen years, but not 
a few are of shorter duration. 

Husbandry. — A very considerable portion of the parish is, ge- 
nerally speaking, under a regular system of tillage, the rotation of 
crops varying to suit the different qualities of the soil. In the 
more fertile districts, the rotation is usually five or six years, viz. 



ARNGASK. 



891 



oats, turnips, and potatoes, barley, grass-seeds cut in bay, follow- 
ed by eitber one or two years' pasture. On tbose farms where the 
soil is of a more varied description, a rotation of eight or nine 
years is in many cases adopted, taking two successive crops of 
oats after three or four years' pasture. Turnip husbandry now 
prevails to a considerable extent, and appears to be admirably suit- 
ed to a great part of the arable land. The cultivation of this va- 
luable root has been, within the last few years, greatly extended, 
chiefly in consequence of the introduction of the use of bone ma- 
nure, and the increased fertility of the soil occasioned by the tur- 
nip crop being eat off by sheep. 

Produce. — The average value of the raw produce annually rais- 
ed in the parish, as nearly as it can be ascertained, is as follows : 

White crop, including wheat, oats, and barley, . L. 6432 0 0 

Green crop, including pease, potatoes, and turnips, . 3200 0 0 

Hay, both meadow and cultivated, . . 720 0 0 

Pasture of all kinds, . . , 1824 0 0 

Total annual value of raw produce, . . L. 12,176 0 0 

Mills, Sfc. — There are 4 mills for grinding com, 1 saw-mill, 
and 22 thrashing-mills. Of the latter, twenty are moved by horses, 
one by steam, and another by water. There are about 62 ploughs 
regularly employed upon the different farms; and, besides these, 
four or five are occasionally used by persons occupying small pen- 
dicles, and frequently acting in the capacity of carters. There 
are only 8 hand-looms, weaving being carried on to a small ex- 
tent. In four shops, groceries are sold. And, besides some journey- 
men and apprentices, there are 4 masons, 7 carpenters, 3 smiths, 
4 tailors, 3 shoemakers, and 1 plasterer. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — The parish enjoys ample means of 
communication. It is traversed for upwards of three miles by the 
Great North Road from Edinburgh to Aberdeen, on which four 
public coaches, including the mail, regularly travel to the north 
and to the south. The Statute Labour roads are generally well 
kept, and are nearly ten miles in extent. The stone bridges, 
consisting each of a single arch, are in a proper state of repair. 
Four of these are across the Farg, six are over some of its tribu- 
taries, and one is upon a small stream which flows south from 
Damhead, and unites with the Eden at Burnside. 

Villages. — There are two small villages in the parish, Duncri- 
vie and Damhead. The former is pleasantly situated on rising 



692 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ground near its southern extremity, and contains 108 inhabitants, 
lhe latter, which is more central, stands in the vale through which 
the turnpike-road passes, and contains a population of 122. At 
this village a post-office, in connection with Kinross on the south 
and Bridge of Earn on the north, was established by the post- 
office authorities in January 1838. This arrangement, which was 
much needed, proves a great accommodation to the surrounding 
district. 

Market-Towns. — The chief market-towns are Kinross and 
Perth, the former being seven and the latter ten miles distant 
from the centre of the parish. Newburgh, at which a stock-mar- 
ket is held every Tuesday, is principally frequented by the far- 
mers, for the sale of agricultural produce; and Milnathort, at 
which only samples of grain are exhibited, is resorted to by some, 
on Wednesday, for a similar purpose. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which is situated on gently 
elevated ground, was built in 1806, and is a plain but substan- 
tial edifice. If the present turnpike-road had been formed pre- 
vious to its erection, it would in all probability have been placed 
in the vicinity of Damhead ; but as it occupies a central position, 
and only a few families are distant from it upwards of two miles, 
it is by no means inconveniently situated for the great mass of the 
population. It was found necessary, in 182], on account of the 
increasing demand for church accommodation, to erect galleries, 
by which 140 additional sittings were obtained. The whole of the 
sittings in the church, amounting to 380, belong exclusively to the 
heritors, who in general gratuitously accommodate their tenants 
and other parishioners. 

The manse, a substantial and commodious edifice, was built in 
1828, and finished in 1829; The offices, which were erected at 
the same period, though equally substantial, are scarcely of suffi- 
cient extent. The glebe, including the site of the manse and 
offices, comprehends little more than the statutory allowance. 
But, in 1829, it was slightly augmented by Mrs Lang, a relative 
of the incumbent, who purchased upwards of an imperial acre of 
land contiguous to it, and, by a legal deed, secured the same to 
him and his successors in office. The whole, if let, would bring 
about L.9 per annum. The sum of L.20 Scots is paid, in lieu of 
a grass glebe, by the proprietors of the kirk-lands. 

The stipend, including the allowance for communion elements, 
averages L. 179. It consists of the whole teinds of the parish,

which amount to L.172, 8s. 10} §d.; 5 bolls, 3 firlots, If lippies 
of meal, and 2 bolls, 2 pecks, § lippies of meal. Mrs Wardlaw 
and Robert Low, Esq. of Fordels are joint patrons. 

There are 170 families in the parish, exclusive of a few bothies. 
Of these families, 149 belong to the Established Church; and 
21, including 82 individuals of all ages, are chiefly connected with 
the United Secession Church. The number of male heads of 
families in communion with the church is 115; and the total num- 
ber of communicants, taking the average of the last seven years, 
is 280. There is no other place of public worship but the paro- 
chial church ; and the people, with few exceptions, are most re- 
gular in their attendance upon the stated services of religion. 

There has been a parochial society in operation for upwards of 
twenty years, whose object has been to assist in disseminating the 
pure and unadulterated word of God. Since its formation in 181.3, 
it has been connected with the Kinross-shire Bible Society, and 
contributed to the funds of that institution the sum of L.184, 5s. 
3d. Occasional collections have been made in aid of the funds 
of the Scottish Missionary Society. And for many years we have 
had collections in behalf of the benevolent schemes which are 
sanctioned and recommended by the General Assembly. The 
average amount of annual contributions and church collections for 
religious and charitable objects is L.15. 

Education. — The parish is amply supplied with the means of 
education, there being two schools in active operation within its 
limits, viz. the parochial school, which is situated near the church, 
and a school in the village of Duncrivie. The number of chil- 
dren attending each of these schools is nearly equal, and, when 
taken together, they are found to vary from a seventh to a sixth 
part of the population. It is to be regretted that the attendance 
of some at school is of very short duration. At the same 
time, there are none who do not obtain a share of education 
to the extent of being, in some measure, qualified for perusing the 
Sacred Scriptures. The branches of instruction generally taught 
in both schools are, reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, 
and geography. Latin and Greek are also occasionally taught in 

There is a striking contrast between the present state of education in the parish 
and that which existed in the seventeenth century. In the register of the presbytery 
of Perth, 28th March 1649, is inserted a list of the families within several of the pa- 
nshes belonging to that presbytery, wherein some of the members could read. Am- 
gask is one of the parishes there specified, and, at the period referred to, it was found 
to contain only sixteen families in which some of the members could read.

the parochial school. The teacher of the unendowed school has 
a free house, but is otherwise entirely dependent on the school 
fees. The parochial teacher's house affords little more than the 
legal accommodation. His salary is L.34, 4s. 4d. ; but this sum 
is inclusive of an allowance for a garden. He receives from the 
heritors L.2 per annum, being interest of money in their hands, 
and mortified by a native of the parish, Robert Glass, late mer- 
chant in Perth, for the purpose of M being chiefly applied to the 
means of education of the young." In return for the above sum, 
and with the view of carrying into effect the intention of the benevo- 
lent donor, he teaches four children, who are annually selected by 
a committee of heritors, and whose parents may be in indigent cir- 
cumstances, but are not receiving parochial aid. The total sum 
arising from school fees, if properly paid, may be stated as amount- 
ing to L.26. There has been a Sabbath evening school, for many 
years, in the village of Duncrivie. It is principally taught by one 
of the elders, and is generally well attended. There is a small 
library attached to it for the benefit of the children. 

Ample as our means of education are, it is gratifying to add, 
that, through the munificence of John Glass, Esq. we have an im- 
mediate prospect of their extension. He has recently erected 
upon his property at Newton of Balcanqnhal, in the locality which 
gave him birth, an excellent and commodious dwelling-house and 
school-room, and is at present adopting measures for obtaining a 
properly qualified teacher, to whom he intends to secure the hand- 
some salary of L.50 per annum. The school was opened in Oc- 
tober 1841, but the teacher's salary, it is understood, is now re- 
duced to L.36 per annum. 

Library. — A parochial library has been recently established, 
and is under the management of the kirk-session. It includes a 
variety of excellent publications, chiefly of a theological character, 
and has been formed by donations from a few of the heritors. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
regularly receiving parochial aid, exclusive of those who obtain 
occasional relief, is 10; and the monthly allowance granted to 
each varies, according to circumstances, from 5s. to 12s. The 
kirk-session, in several instances, also allow a quantity of coals, 
and pay the house rent of the pauper. They further defray the 
expense of educating the children of paupers, which, at an average, 
amounts to the sum of L.2 per annum. 

The annual revenue at the disposal of the kirk-session, and 



ARNGASK. 



895 



available for the maintenance of the poor, and the payment of the 
united salaries of the precentor, kirk-officer, presbytery and synod 
clerk, arises from the following sources ; church-door collections, 
mortcloths, proclamations, and land. The yearly amount of 
church-door collections, taking the average of the last seven year, 
is L.7, 14s. ; the average amount of mortcloth dues is L.l, 9s. 9d. ; 
and that of proclamation dues is 10s. 3d. The sum of 2s. is only 
payable to the poor's fund when the bride belongs to the parish. 
The kirk-session purchased, in 1726, for the benefit of the poor, 
two small pendicles at Newton of Balcanquhal, for the sum of 
2600 merks. And for a similar purpose another pendicle, quite 
contiguous to rhese, was purchased in 1838 by the present kirk- 
session for the sum of L.650 Sterling. These 'pendicles now form 
one small farm, which is let to an active and industrious tenant at 
an annual rent of L.61, 10s., from which, however, land-cess, feu- 
duty, and other sums constituting the public burdens, fall to be 
deducted. Besides the dwelling-house occupied by the farmer, 
there is another upon the property, which is at present let to two 
families; but the session intend to employ it ultimately in accom- 
modating some of their paupers. 

The parochial fund has attained its present state of prosperity, 
under the gratuitous and careful management of the kirk-session, 
and, if the sources of supply are not allowed to be dried up, 
it will continue adequate for ameliorating the condition of the poor, 
and warding off a legal assessment. For several vears, however, 
the expenditure has fully equalled the income, oiing to the ex- 
pense incurred in effecting necessary improvements upon the pro- 
perty. It is proper to add, that, though there is occasionally 
shown little or no aversion to be put on the poor's roll,' yet, in 
general, a considerable reluctance to accept parochial relief is still 
displayed. 

Fain.-— These are four annual markets or fairs for the sale of 
cattle. One of these has been held at Lustielaw, from time im- 
memorial, on the third Tuesday of May, O.S. The other three 
established about twenty years ago, are held at Damhead, on the 
last Tuesday of April, O.S., first Thursday of August, and first 
1 uesday of October. 

Inns.-- There are four houses licensed to sell by retail, beer 
ale, and other exciseable liquors. The number of houses of this 
description, though they are upon the whole well regulated, is far 
from producing beneficial effects. Two of them might be sup-

pressed with great advantage to the interests of morality. The 
other two, established at Damhead, along the line of the great 
north road, would prove amply sufficient for the accommodation 
both of parishioners and of the public. 

Fuel. — At a former period, turf, furze, and peat were used to a 
considerable extent, but now coal is almost exclusively employed 
as fuel. It is generally conveyed from Kelty, at the distance of 
twelve miles from the centre of the parish ; but it is also frequent- 
ly brought from the collieries of Lumphannan and Lochgelly, a 
little farther off. It varies in price ; at present it is sold at the 
pit mouth, at the rate of 3d. the cwt., 4s. 16 cwt. or four loads, 
which is the usual quantity put upon a single cart. A cart load, 
including carriage and tolls, costs in the parish, 9s. or 9s. 6d. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
During the last fifty years, a striking change has been effected 
in the general aspect of the country. New lines of communica- 
tion have been opened up, and in many instances, districts which 
were once remarkable for bleakness and sterility, are now in a 
state of cultivation, or embellished with thriving plantations. The 
spirit of improvement has certainly reached the portion of the 
Ochils of which this parish is composed. All who knew it half a 
century ago, and remember its extensive tracks of furze and of 
heath, — its comparative want of roads and enclosures ; — and now 
witness its well cultivated fields, substantial fences, excellent roads, 
and beautiful stripes and clumps of wood, — must be convinced that 
a decided change to the better has taken place. Of the various 
improvements which have been carried into effect, one of the most 
important is the formation of the new turnpike road which passes 
through the parish. The portion of this road which runs through 
Glenfarg to Damhead was executed between 1808 and 1810, but 
the part which extends from Damhead towards Milnathort was not 
completed until 1832. If, in addition to what we already possess, 
the proposed Western Fife Railway be ever executed, our means of 
communication may then be considered as most complete.

THE REV. ROBERT M'DONALD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In the former Statistical Account, the name of this 
parish is said to be derived from the Gaelic word Blaar, signifying 
a place where moor and moss abound. By another theory, it is 
connected with the Gaelic word signifying battle, or the place of 
battle. Gowrie was the ancient name of the district in which the 
parish is situated, and seems to have been added to the term Blair, 
to distinguish it from other places of the same name, as Blair- 
in-Athole, Blair-Logie, Blair- Drummond, &amp;c. The baronv is 
said to have formed a part of the extensive possessions of the "un - 
fortunate family of Gowrie. 

Extent, Boundaries, fyc— The figure of the parish is exceed- 
ingly irregular; but the length is considered to be about 7, and 
the average breadth about If miles English, which would give a 
superficial extent of about 10 square miles. This computation 
is exclusive of two detached portions of the parish, to be imme- 
diately noticed, which, it is supposed, contain together about 
6 square miles additional, making a total superficies of some 16 
square miles. The main division of the parish is bounded on the 
east, partly by a detached part of the parish of Bendochy, but 
principally by Rattray parish, from which it is separated by the 
river Ericht, which forms the boundary line of the parish for the 
space of 10 miles; on the south, by Bendochy parish ; on the 
south-west and west, by the parishes of Caputh and Kinloch ; and 
on the north, partly by another detached part of Bendochy, and 
partly by the parish of Alyth. As already noticed, there are 
two portions of the parish separated from the main division 
by the intervention of branches of the parishes adjoining. The 
largest of these detached parts lies to the north-west of the

principal division, from which it is separated by branches of the 
parishes of Kinloch and Bendochy. It comprehends part of the 
district called the Forest of Cluny, and a considerable tract on 
both sides of the river Ardle, consisting of the properties of Black- 
craig, Wester Cally, and Whitehouse. Its superficial extent may 
be about 4 square miles. The Forest of Cluny, within the me- 
mory of man, contained a considerable population, who cultivated 
small farms along the banks of the Burn of Lornty, which tra- 
verses the district ; but this population has been entirely swept 
away, and their possessions thrown into one large grazing. The 
other detached portion of the parish lies to the north-east of the 
main division, from which it is separated by the parish of Rattray, 
and is supposed to contain about 2 square miles. It is known by 
the general name of the Creuchies, and is but thinly inhabited. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish lies on the north side 
of the magnificent valley of Strathmore, partly within it, and partly 
along the series of gentle elevations which form its northern 
boundary, rising in height, as they recede from the plain, till they 
swell out into the lofty summits of the Grampian mountains. 
Longitudinally, the parish extends nearly due north and south, 
and is naturally divided into two districts, nearly equal in extent, 
the Highland and the Lowland ; the former being the hilly divi- 
sion, which lies to the northward of the great strath, the latter, the 
portion lying within its boundary, — each differing from the other, 
as well in the characteristic features of natural scenery, as in the 
habits and manners of the population, though, in the latter re- 
spect, the difference is daily becoming less remarkable. The 
upper division extends for a distance of several miles along the 
west side of the romantic Glen-Ericht, which forms the entrance 
of one of the great passes into the Highlands, and through which 
the Ericht pours its impetuous torrent towards the valley of 
Strathmore, in a direction nearly south-east. The first of the 
series of elevations rises with a somewhat steep ascent, from the 
level of the strath, to the height of a few hundred feet. It is 
known by the name of the Hill of Blair, and is entirely under cul- 
tivation. Immediately behind this eminence rises another ridge, 
rather higher than the first, called Knock-ma-har, partly culti- 
vated, and partly covered with plantations of Scots fir, and sloping 
abruptly on the north side down to the bed of the burn or water 

 Ericht, a Gaelic name, meaning literally " rough" or " rapid." 



BLAIRGOWRIE.

of Lornty, which flows nearly due east to join the Ericht. Beyond 
the Lornty, the ground rises very abruptly into another ridge, 
much higher than those already mentioned, and of very wide ex- 
tent. On the south and east, this ridge or hill, though steep and 
difficult to farm, is in general well cultivated, and produces good 
crops of grain. This district, of the parish at least that part of 
it lying next to the Ericht, is known by the general name of the 
Maws ; The Braes of Maws, the Cloves or cliffs of Maws, and 
the Heughs of Maws, are all local terms descriptive of the more 
marked features of its general aspect. To the westward of the 
Maws, along the north side of the course of the Lornty Burn, lies 
the ground of Drumlochy, which was anciently a barony or laird- 
ship, possessed by a family of the name of Heron, the ruins of 
whose fortress are still to be distinctly traced, by the enormous 
thickness of the loop-holed walls, amid the meanness of the pre- 
sent modern farm-offices. Above Drumlochy there is another 
farm, which extends to the summit of the ridge, and is called Ard 
or Aird, a Gaelic name meaning literally the " head" or " top." 
The top of this great ridge presents a wide undulating tract of 
moor and moss, which stretches away to the west, many miles be- 
yond the boundary of the parish in that direction. The great 
peat-moss of Cochridge,f on this ridge, supplied fuel to the in- 
habitants of the surrounding district to a considerable distance; 
but coal is now fast superseding the peat even in the higher part 
of the parish. On the north, this ridge slopes down to the bed 
of the Ardle, and on the east to the vale of Glen Ericht. At 
this point, the western boundary line of the parish, after crossing 
the ridge, runs in a slanting direction, with a partial interrup- 
tion from an intervening portion of the parish of Kinloch, 
down to the river Ardle, and then follows the course of the 
river to its junction with the Shee or Blackwater, about a 
mile below the Bridge of Cally. Crossing these united streams, 
now the Ericht, it follows the eastern bank of the Black- 
water for a space of nearly three miles, to a place called 
Kingseat, which is the northern extremity of the parish. Where 
it crosses the Ericht, the parish is narrowed to little more 
than a mile in breadth ; but beyond the stream it rapidly widens 
so as to embrace the whole district of Clayquhat on the south,'

and Ash more and the Kingseat on the west side of the hill of 
Glayquhat or Colliemore, the summit of which is within the 
parish. This hill, though of gentle and easy ascent, is the 
highest elevation in the parish. Its height has never been cor- 
rectlv ascertained ; but it is supposed to be about 1000 feet above 
the level of the sea. A large portion of the upper part of this 
hill is covered with plantations of larch. The vale of Glen- 
Ericht, especially along the banks of the river, is adorned with 
a good deal of wood, both spontaneous and planted ; and the 
scenery is picturesque and beautiful in a high degree. 

The lower division of the parish stretches away to the south, 
from the foot of the hill of Blair to the middle of the valley of 
Strathmore, a distance of four miles. It comprises an extensive 
superficies, and is considerably diversified in he nature of its soil 
and the character of its scenery. A narrow tract, lying directly 
at the foot of the hill comprehending the manor-farm of Blair- 
gowrie and some smaller farms, consists of a good sharp soil, and 
is in a good state of culture. To the south of this cultivated part, 
there is an extensive tract of flat moorish ground, extending to 
about 1000 acres, called the " muir of Blair," the greater part of 
which is covered with thick plantations of Scots fir ; and where 
there is no wood, it is clothed with heath, furze, and broom. 
The surface of the moor consists of two or three inches of light 
dry soil upon a gravelly bottom, and could only be brought under 
tillage at a great cost. All along the side of the Ericht, includ- 
ing a large portion of the souih-east extremity of the parish, the 
land is fertile and highly cultivated. Along the southern boun- 
dary, beyond the muir of Blair, the soil, though generally thin 
and light, is under cultivation. The estate of Ardblair occupies 
a considerable extent on the west side, and is partly under crop- 
ping and partly laid out in grass parks. 

The town or village of Blairgowrie occupies a pleasant situation 
on the west bank of the Ericht, on a rising ground, which forms 
the first step of the acclivity of the " hill of Blair." 

The church is finely situated on the summit of the hill of Blair, 
immediately above the village. Close behind the church there is 
a deep ravine or dell, finely wooded, both banks of which, at its 
eastern extremity, descend almost perpendicularly to the bed of 
the river. • From the churchyard, which lies in front of the church, 
the prospect is one of great extent and surpassing beauty, — em- 
bracing the whole valley of Strathmore, from its western extremity

to the Hunter Hill of Glammis on the east, — shut in on the south 
by the picturesque range of the Sidlaw Hills. This noble valley, 
so richly cultivated, and so diversified in its scenery, forms one of 
the most magnificent panoramic views that can be conceived. The 
river Ericht, debouching from the narrow defile on the left, sweeps 
rapidly past the village towards the hollow of the Strath, forming 
a fine reach of a mile in length, before it turns to the eastward, and 
disclosing occasional glimpses of its waters in the distance, as it 
tranquilly winds onwards in a devious course to its junction with 
the Isla. 

About three miles to the north of Blairgowrie on the estate of 
Craighall, belonging to R. C. Rattray, Esq., the course of the 
Ericht, for the space of nearly two miles, lies through a deep 
chasm or ravine, the sides of which are of great height, consisting 
in some places of perpendicular precipices rising sheer 300 feet 
from the bed of the river; in others, of steep banks clothed with 
thick underwood of oak and hazel, interspersed with clusters of 
tall and graceful trees, disposed in the most picturesque and taste- 
ful manner. One of the most remarkable of these precipices is to 
be seen on the west or Blairgowrie side of the river, and is called 
Craig Liach or " the Eagle's Craig." It is a huge rock about 300 
feet in height, presenting a vast gray front, so uniform and un- 
broken in its surface as to resemble a work of masonry, and it is 
fringed on either side and along the summit with forest trees and 
underwood. In this rock, at the base, there is a cave or fissure, 
which seems to have been formed by the violent breaking off and 
detaching of huge masses from the solid rock. It is low in 
the roof, and extends only about 30 feet underneath the rock. 
Immediately beyond this precipice, at a sudden bend of the 
river, the scenery is indescribably grand and savage ; the rocks 
on either side are lofty and imposing, most bizarre and eccentric 
in their shape, and overhanging a deep and gloomy chasm, at 
the bottom of which the river forms a deep and sullen pool, 
black as night, and apparently of great depth. Nor is the myste- 
rious legend befitting such a scene wanting to heighten its romantic 
interest.  Upon an angle of the rock, and on the very veroe of 
the precipice, are still to be traced the ruins of a circular tower, 
once of great height and strength, still known by the name of 
Lady Lindsay's Castle, in which, some centuries ago so runs the 
legend a daughter of the noble house of Crawford was confined 
for life in obedience to a fiat of the Pope, to expiate, by a dreary

penance, some deep and deadly sin which she had committed. 
On the Rattray side of the river is to be seen the mansion- 
house of Craighall, occupying a magnificent position on the verge 
of a high cliff which overhangs the river, adding greatly to 
the picturesque aspect of the scenery. The view from the win- 
dows up the river is much admired, and allowed to be unsurpassed 
in pictorial beauty by anything of similar character and extent in 
Scotland. The whole scenery about Craighall has been recently 
invested with a new and powerful interest, by the publication of 
the fact, of its being the prototype of the Tully-Veolan of Wa- 
verley. 

Natural History. — The temperature of the atmosphere during 
winter is in general rather higher in the district of the parish im- 
mediately surrounding the village of Blairgowrie, than in the 
neighbouring and less elevated parishes; a circumstance which is 
in a great degree owing to the southern exposure of the surface, 
and the shelter which the rising grounds to the north afford from 
the cold north winds. The temperature, in common with all dis- 
tricts bordering on the Highlands, is subject to frequent and sud- 
den variations, f 

 Sir Walter Scott visited this part of the country in the course of a Highland ex- 
cursion. " Another resting-place," says Mr Lockhart, " was Craighall, in Perthshire, 
the seat of the Rattrays, a fami'y related to Mr Clerk, who accompanied him. From 
the position of this striking place, as Mr Clerk at once perceived, and as the author 
afterwards confessed to him, that of Tully Veolan was very faithfully copied, though, 
in the description of the house itself and its gardens, many features were adopted from 
Eruntsfield and Ravelstone." — Lockhart s Life of Scott, Vol. i. 

f While upon this suhject, it may not he out of place to give here a brief account of 
the various phenomena attending the earthquake which was felt throughout this dis- 
trict in the month of October 1839, The most severe shock was felt ahout twenty mi- 
nutes past ten o'clock on the night of the 23d October, and was accompanied by a 
noise resembling distant thunder, or the rapid passage of a heavy-loaded vehicle over a 
newly-metalled road. The motion, at the commencement of the concussion, was of 
a waving or undulating nature, and terminated in a vibration or tremor, becoming 
gradually less distinct, until it ceased altogether. The shock appeared to be most 
strongly felt in houses situated on elevated ground, in some of which it was so severe 
as to excite very great alarm in the inmates; and in one house, situated in the town, 
the motion was so gre;:t as to force open some of the doors. In the distiicts of Glen- 
shee and Strathardle, about ten or twelve miles to the northward, the shock was 
much more violently felt than in this neighbourhood ; so much so, that several peo- 
ple who were asleep at the time were awakened by the shaking of their beds ; and 
one person, who was lying in bed awake when the shock commenced, describes the 
feeling he experienced to be as if his bed had been heaved up. and pushed, first to 
one side and then to the other, from west to east, and afterwards shaken violently ; 
and he at the same time heard a loud noise, of the nature already described. The 
sound, in the opinion of the majority, proceeded from the ground, advanced from the 
north or north-west, and died away in the opposite direction. 

The atmospherical appearances which attended this convulsion were not in any re- 
spect remarkable, excepting that, during the whole evening, before the shock occurred, 
the eastern horizon was overspread by a dull, lurid light of a yellowish hue ; and for 
some days previously, a very great quantity of rain had fallen, which had increas- 
ed to a torrent on the evening of the occurrence, accompanied by a pretty strong

Hydrography. — There are one or two chalybeate springs in the 
parish ; but they have never been chemically analyzed, so far as 
the writer of this account is aware. There is one very fine spring, 
called the " heugh well," which deserves particular notice. It 
springs from the face of the " heughs of Mause,"- — a mortar cliff 
of singular appearance, which descends abruptly into the bed of 
the river with an almost perpendicular declivity of about 200 feet 
— and judging from its colour, contains a considerable quantity of 
ferruginous matter. The use of its water has been found to be 
very beneficial in cutaneous eruptions, and affections of the sto - 
mach. 

There are no less than six lakes in the parish, viz. the Stor- 
mont Loch, or Loch Bog, Black Loch, White Loch, Fingask 
Loch, the Monkmyre Loch, and Ardblair or the Rae Loch, all 
of which abound with pike, perch, and eels. The first mentioned 
loch is very shallow, the depth being in general not more than 
from 2 to 3 feet, and the bottom is composed of soft mud or moss 
of considerable depth. Black, White, and Fingask Lochs are situ- 
ated close together, in a line from east to west, and communicat- 
ing with each other by small burns running from one to the other. 
Black Loch is more properly a morass or mossy pool than a loch, 
exhibiting merely a collection of reeds and other aquatic plants, 
with a small space of clear water; but it contains some very powerful 
springs, as is evident from the circumstance, that although it re- 
ceives no supply of water from the surface, a large stream runs out 
of it into the adjoining lake of White Loch, sufficient to turn a 
mill, and this stream is never diminished in quantity even in the 
driest weather. White and Fingask Lochs are sheets of water of 
about one mile each in circumference. The bottom of the for- 
mer is gravelly, while the latter rests upon a bed of clay or marl, 
of which great quantities were formerly excavated, and used for 
agricultural purposes by the farmers for many miles around. Of 
late years, however, the use of this substance as a manure has 
been almost entirely discontinued. Ardblair or Rae Loch is a small 
sheet of water, lying close to the road between Blairgowrie and 
Duukeld. Its depth is believed to be greater than that of any of 

breeze from the east. The barometer also had previously, notwithstanding the con- 
tinued rams, risen rapidly, and stood at "set fair" on the index. It was also ob- 
served, that the river Ericht fell several inches below the level it had attained during 
the day, although the rain had, in the interval, continued with unabated violence. 
Two other shocks were felt on the same evening, but they were much less violent 
than that already described.

the others, but it has never been accurately ascertained." The 
depth of the others varies from '2 to about 20 feet. The Monk- 
myre Loch, as the name indicates, scarcely deserves the name of a 
loch, having been originally merely a shallow pool or "myre," 
surrounded with moss and reeds, and abounding with marl, in the 
course of excavating which substance, it was gradually deepened, 
until it assumed the form of a small lake. The rivers connected 
with the parish are the Ardle and Blackwater, which skirt part of 
the northern division of the parish, — the Ericht which is formed 
by the junction of these two near the bridge of Cally, — the Lunan, 
which partly bounds the parish on the south, — and the Lornty, 
which flows through part of the parish and falls into the Ericht, 
about half a mile above the town. The two latter are more pro- 
perly large burns than rivers. The Ardle rises among the Gram- 
pians, at the head of the valley of Strathardle, and, after a course 
of ten or twelve miles, forms a junction with the Blackwater. 
This last-mentioned stream has its source near the summit of 
the Cairnwell mountain, and flowing, under the name of Beg, 
through Glenbeg, debouches at the Spittal of Glenshee into 
Glenshee, where it is joined by the Tetnich water, and takes 
the name of the Shee for about six miles farther. It then again 
changes its name to the Blackwater, which it retains until its 
junction with the Ardle, when the two united form the Ericht. 
The whole course of this stream to its junction with the Ericht is 
about twenty miles. The Ericht flows along the north-east boun- 
dary of the parish, through the romantic scenery of Craighall, pas- 
ses close by the town of Blairgowrie, and falls into the Isla at Cou- 
par Grange, after a course, under its own name, of about ten or 
eleven miles. The upper part of its course, including that of the 
Shee and Blackwater, is very rapid and impetuous, particularly in 
winter, when, swelled with the torrents that pour into it from the 
hills on both sides, it comes thundering down with headlong fury, 
carrying away everything moveable within its reach. Close to the 
town of Blairgowrie, the bed of the stream has a considerable de- 
scent to the valley of Strathmore, and forms a small cascade call- 
ed the " Keath," which has been heightened by artificial means, 
so as to create, for the benefit of the fishings below, an obstruc- 
tion to the upward progress of the salmon from the sea. In great 
floods, however, this contrivance is rendered of no avail, for at 
such times the impetuous torrent fills up the whole space betwixt 
the rocky banks so as to obliterate the fall altogether, and admit

of the passage of the salmon up the stream. In summer, when the 
. river is low, its course is here so hemmed in by encroaching rocks 
on each side, that it is quite possible to leap across, although the 
feat is certainly attended with some peril. 

The scenery of the river, in the vicinity of the town, is very 
beautiful, comprehending those most essential elements of roman- 
tic scenery, — wood, water, and rocks, in finely diversified combi- 
nations. 

Geology. — The chief geological formations in the parish are of 
three kinds, 1st, greyvvacke; '2d, greenstone; 3d, sandstone, 
or conglomerate. In the northern division of the parish we 
find an extensive bed of clay- slate at a place called Rochalzie, 
about four miles to the northward of the town, where il was 
some years ago quarried for roofing houses, a purpose for which 
it seemed to be well adapted. This quarry has for some years 
past been discontinued, owing partly to the difficulty and expense 
of carriage, and partly to the limited demand for the slates, which, 
though of durable quality, were of a disagreeable yellowish-blue co- 
lour. This formation seems to stretch across the parish in a wes- 
terly direction ; but it is not again visible on the surface at any 
other point. Its thickness is supposed to be about 40 feet, 
and it dips at an angle of about 40° north-west. Proceeding 
southward, we meet with a stratum of greenstone or whinstone, 
stretching along the summit of the ridge already described, call- 
ed Knock-ma-har, and extending quite across the parish, from 
east to west, into the adjoining parish of Kinloch. The same 
formation is seen also in the adjoining parish of Rattray, at a place 
called the Cats-craigs, where it rises into cliffs of considerable ele- 
vation. The strata are nearly horizontal, with a slight inclination 
to the north-west. Still farther south, all along the southern 
slope of the ridge immediately to the north of the town, and ex- 
tending into the lower ground to the south and west, there is a 
very extensive stratum of coarse red sandstone or conglomerate, 
of great thickness, running in a north-westerly direction across 
the parish. It dips towards the north-west with an angle of 
about 15°. About a mile to the south-east of the town, this 
red sandstone assumes a much finer grain and darker colour, and 
forms a perpendicular cliff of considerable height on the bank 
of the river, at a place called the Red-brae, where it was par- 
tially quarried some years ago. About a mile to the south of this, 
there is another very regular and beautiful stratum of fine grey 



906 



PERTHSHIRE. 



sandstone, of excellent quality for building, and apparently of great 
thickness. This bed has been extensively quarried at Parkhead, 
within this parish ; and at this point the' strata appear to be nearly 
horizontal. On both sides of the bed of the Ericht, and about 
half a mile to the northward of the town, there is a fine dike of 
columnar basalt, in horizontal layers, so very regular as to re- 
semble in some degree a work of art, and to obtain for the loca- 
lity the popular name of the " Deil's Briggs." The basalt is not 
visible at any other point in the parish. 

All the rocks in the parish which are of any height are formed 
of the conglomerate above-mentioned ; and in some places, such 
as Craighall and other points along the course of the Ericht. they 
rise into lofty mural precipices, exhibiting scenery of the most pic- 
turesque and romantic description. The whole strata of conglo- 
merate are intersected by occasional fissures at right angles to the 
planes of their stratification. 

The alluvium which covers the strata already described is a 
species of till of very irregular quality and thickness. At a place 
called the " Heughs" or " Cloves of Mause," haif a mile north 
of the town, it forms a precipice of a very singular and pic- 
turesque appearance, rising from the bed of the river to the 
height of nearly 200 feet. To the north-west of this, the grev- 
wacke already described is covered with moss to a very great 
extent, forming the great moss of Cochridge, an extensive tract 
of barren moor, covered with heather and pools of water. To 
the southward of this, on the slopes of the ridges rising to the 
north of the town, the soil is a brown stiff clay, of considerable 
fertility ; and in the southern division of the parish it is a strong 
black loam, yielding a large return to the labours of the farmer. 
A large extent of barren unproductive gravel, however, intervenes, 
forming the " Muir of Blair," a great part of which, as formerly 
mentioned, is under plantation, and the remainder covered with 
heather. 

Zoology. — There are no rare kinds of the quadruped or fea- 
thered tribe in this parish, with the exception of the jer or ger 
falcon, which breeds amongst the precipices about Craighall, and 
which was highly valued in ancient times when the sport of hawk- 
ing was the favourite pastime of the nobles and gentry of the land. 
Now that this sport has fallen altogether into desuetude, however, 
these birds are permitted to breed and bring up their young in 



BLAIRGOWRIE.

their rocky habitations, unmolested. The Stormont Loch is, in 
summer, frequented by immense flocks of sea-mews or gulls, 
which build innumerable nests amongst the reeds and rushes, by 
which a considerable part of the surface of the lake is covered. 
Their eggs are highly prized, and are annually gathered and sold 
for the benefit of the proprietor or his tenants. These birds ar- 
rive from the sea-coast about the beginning of March, when they 
may be seen in thousands fluttering about the surface of the wa- 
ter. For the first week after they make their appearance, they go 
back to the sea every night and return the following morning ; 
but after this reconnoisance is over, they finally take up their resi- 
dence on the loch, and commence building their nests with great 
assiduitv. These nests are formed merelv of a few rushes laid on 
the surface of the water, amongst the reeds and grass with which 
the loch is covered. After bringing up their young, and when 
they are strong enough to fly, they take their departure again for 
the sea in the end of autumn, to return to this, their favourite 
haunt, again with the mild weather in the following spring. All 
the lakes in the parish are well stocked with pike, perch, and eels. 
In the Stormont loch, especially, both perch and pike are occa- 
sionally caught of a very large size, — the nature of the bottom be- 
ing peculiarly favourable for their growth and subsistence. The 
Ardle, Blackwater, Lunan, and Lornty abound with trout, and 
the Ericht, below the Keath, with both salmon and trout. Sal- 
mon generally begin to appear in the Ericht, from the sea, early 
in April, and sometimes sooner, if the weather is mild, and they 
continue running, when the water is in flood, until the month of 
June. In the months of July and August grilse make their 
appearance in the river, and occasionally a few of these are found 
newly run, until the 14th of September, when the fishing closes 
in this river. In the end of September, salmon and grilse be- 
gin to ascend the river for the purpose of spawning, and commence 
spawning in the fords and shallows about the middle of October, 
and sometimes earlier, when the weather is cold. Thev continue 
spawning until about the end of December or beginning of Janu- 
ary, when they retire to the deep pools, in which they remain un- 
til they have somewhat recruited their exhausted strength, when 
the male fish make for the sea ; but the female fish often remain 
in the river until the month of March and beginning of April. 
It is supposed by some, that the female fish do not leave the river, 
until the young fry are able to accompany them to the sea. The 



908 



PERTHSHIRE. 



young fry or smolt begin to leave the river on their way to the sea 
in the end of April, and are all off before the end of May. 

Wood. — In the southern division of the parish, there are exten- 
sive plantations of Scotch fir, formed, about forty or fifty years 
ago, on ground which had been previously a barren moor or com- 
mon, covered with heather and broom, and which was, about that 
period, divided amongst the heritors and feuars. A great part of 
this moor, as already mentioned, still remains in a waste and un- 
productive state ; but some parts of it have lately been planted 
with Scotch fir and larch, to the growth of which the soil of the 
parish seems to be most congenial. 

There are also a few detached plantations of hard wood in the 
parish, but none of any considerable extent; and the face of the 
country generally is embellished with clumps and belts of oak, elm, 
ash, and beech trees, none of which, however, have attained any re- 
markable size. The northern division of the parish is compara- 
tively bare and destitute of trees, excepting the banks of the river, 
which are richly clothed with wood, chiefly natural, such as birch, 
hazel, mountain-ash, alder, and oak coppice. About Craighall, 
especially, the oak coppice is of considerable value. It is cut pe- 
riodically every eighteen or twenty years, and the proprietor rea- 
lizes a considerable sum at each cutting from the sale of the bark 
and of the wood for fuel, &amp;c. But, although the parish does not now 
contain any tracts of wood deserving the appellation of forests, there 
is reason to believe, as well from the names still attached to certain 
portions of the parish, as from the fossil remains chiefly oak of great 
size which are frequently discovered in excavating the mosses for 
fuel, that, in ancient times, the face of the country had been much 
more densely wooded than it is at present. Thus there is an ex- 
tensive tract of country, now barren and covered with heather, 
which still bears the name of the Forest of Drimmie, and another 
of the same description, in the north-west quarter of the parish, 
called the Forest of Cluny ; and the country people, in digging 
for peats in these districts, have often uncovered huge logs of oak 
as black as ebony thence called " black oak," and in as perfect 
a state of preservation as if they had but yesterday fallen under 
the axe of the woodman. The writer has seen one of these 
logs which measured upwards of three feet in diameter. Mr 
Tytler, in the second volume of his History of Scotland, mentions 
the Forests of Drimmie and Alyth as being royal forests, preserved 
for the recreation of the kings of Scotland.

II. — Civil History. 

Till of late years, the parish, from its remote situation, and the 
rural character and occupations of its inhabitants, was little no- 
ticed, and comparatively insignificant. Owing to these circum- 
stances, also, it had little or no share in the great religious and 
political contests which so frequently, in former times, agitated the 
great body of the population, and deluged the country with blood ; 
or, at least, its share in these if it had any was too insignificant to 
obtain a place in history. The village is, however, casually men- 
tioned, in the History of Montrose's Wars, as one of the places 
through which that great warrior passed in one of his hostile de- 
scents from the Highlands into the valley of Strathmore. 

Eminent Men. — The eminent men connected with this parish 
are, 1. George Drummond, who was repeatedly elected Lord Pro- 
vost of Edinburgh, and was the principal projector of the North 
Bridge of that city, and other important and useful public under- 
takings connected with it. He was born in the Newton Castle, 
which is situated within a quarter of a mile of the village. 2. Tho- 
mas Graham of Balgowan, afterwards Sir Thomas Graham, now 
Lord Lyndoch, who was formerly proprietor of the estate of Blair- 
gowrie, including the Mause district. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners of the parish are, Wil- 
liam Macpherson, Esq. of Blairgowrie ; Robert Clerk Rattray, 

 About the time of the outbreaking of the French Revolution, the village of Blair- 
gowrie, obscure and insignificant as it then was, shared in the general excitement 
which pervaded the nation, and numbered amongst its inhabitants a very few ol 
the soidisant " friends of the people." At the time that the Militia Act first came 
into operation, also, the class of persons who were liable to serve under its enactments, 
and the lower ranks in general throughout the country, were greatly discontented 
with the measure ; and on the day when the Justices of the peace for the district met 
in Blairgowrie for the purpose of balloting for those who should serve, this discontent 
broke out into open violence. Great crowds of people from this and all the other 
parishes of the district collected in the village — made prisoners of Colonel Macpher- 
son of Blairgowrie, Sir William Ramsay of Banff, and the other gentlemen assembl- 
ed, — and confined them in the inn until they got hold of the only " writer"f then in 
the village, whom they compelled malgri hti to draw out what they called a bond, 
to be executed by the Justices, by which they should be bound to abstain in future 
from any measures for enforcing the obnoxious act. This precious document was 
accordingly duly prepared, written out on a stamp, — a ludicrous attempt to legalize 
an illegal document by a rigid observance of the statutory solemnities and sub- 
scribed by the captives under the threats of the mob. Satisfied with the victory they 
conceived th«y had gained, and in the full belief that they had effectually extinguish- 
ed the Militia Act, the-e deluded men then allowed their prisoners to depart, and 
themselves peaceably dispersed to their respective parishes. But a week had not pas- 
sed over their heads when a strong body of the Sutherland Fencibles made their ap- 
pearance in the district, — pounced upon the most active of the rioters, and set most 
of the others scampering to the hills to avoid a similar fate. This vigorous proceed- 
ing effectually quelled the disturbance, and the provisions of the act were thencefor- 
ward carried into effect without further trouble. Several of the most active of the 
mob were sentenced to various periods of imprisonment, of from one to four months.

Parochial Registers. — The earliest parochial register now extant 
belonging to this parish commences in the year 1647, and con- 
tinues down to August 1658. There is no register from the lat- 
ter period down to 1702, from which time to the present the books 
are complete, and appear to have been regularly and accurately 
kept. The book or books in which the register betwixt 1658 and 
1702 was kept have been lost. The existing volumes contain 
the register of births and marriages, and the records of ses- 
sion, but no register of deaths. In the more ancient session 
records, there are several rather curious entries, illustrative of the 
strictness of discipline enforced in the Presbyterian Church, the 
internal discord and contentions which then distracted the 
kingdom, and the rude and ignorant condition of the popula- 
tion ; and it may not be uninteresting to the readers of this ac- 
count to give a few extracts from them, so far as they relate to 
these points : " October 15, 1648, The minister asking if there 
was any new scandal, the session declare that George Clyde, 
Andrew Keay, and Walter Butchart were shearing corne the last 
Sabbath, and George Watson did threshe the said Sabbath. The 
kirk-officer ordained to summon them against ye next day." 
" October 29, 1648, The above parties called compearit, quho, 
after long denying, at last being convinced, confessed the breach 
of ye Sabbath, as they alleged after sunsetting. After ye minister 
had aggravated yair sinne, by shewing yat ye whole Sabbath is 
religiouslie, to be observed not only in the kirk, but in yair pri- 
vate families, the sessione ordain them to satisfie ye next Lord's 
day, before ye pulpit, in humbling themselves and acknowledging 
their breach of Sabbath before ye congregation." Again, " No- 
vember 27, 1648, Sundrie people fined," under an ordinance 
previously made regarding the keeping of the Sabbath, and "or- 
dained to satisfie before ye pulpit. Further, ye sessione, for the 
suppressing of this sinne upon the Lord's day, doe also hereby 
ordain that every taverne keeper, or seller of aile, quho runs aile 
in tyme of sermon, or ye whole day in ane excessive manner to 
any, sail pay hereafter as much as ye drinkers, toties quotics, it 
sail be found they are guiltie therein." An ordinance of session 



BLAIRGOWRIE. 



911 



having been made on August 5, 1649, that the elders should 
search the " taverne houses" during afternoon service, " Tor con- 
temners of the Word," there occurs, on next Sabbath, the fol- 
lowing entry : " August 12, 1649, The elders being required to 
give account of yair diligence anent searching ye taverne houses 
for contemners of God's worship, reported that two of them had 
gone through the towne, and searched, and had found sundrie in" 
their awin houses, quho declared to them that they were pre- 
sentlie going to ye church before yair coming in to them. The 
sessione, therefore, to the end that the wicked prevaricatione of 
these persons may be better detected, ordaine that hereafter they 
search, not immediatelie at the beginning of ye afternoon service, 
but betwixt ye closure of ye sermone and ye blessing, or betwixt 
ye last prayer and Psalme, that such persons as then sail be found 
may be clearly rendered inexcusable." One George Ambrose 
having been called before the session to answer a charge of being 
absent from church and " selling of aile" on the preceding Sab- 
bath, appeared on the 16th January 1654, and gave the following 
curious account of the cause of his absence from church : — " The 
said George denyed that he sold any aile that day in tyme of Di- 
vine service, and that the trow cause of his absence was, that he 
had but ane playd betwixt his wyfe and him, and that she had the 
use thereof that lay, and was in the church." Notwithstanding 
this naive excuse, however, the session " reprove him of his sinne, 
and ordaine him to keepe the kirk in tyme cumand, under ye 
paine of censure." 

Innumerable other entries of this nature occur in these re- 
cords, from which the session appears to have exercised the most 
vigilant superintendence over the conduct of the parishioners in 
the observance of the Sabbath, and to have visited the slightest 
fault with severe censure and punishment. 

These records also contain numerous entries of historical inte- 
rest, such as intimations of fasts on account of national occurrences, 
&amp;c, a few of the most curious of which we shall extract. On the 
10th December 1648, "the Covenant, and ane publick acknow- 
ledgement of the sinnes of the land, were publickly read before 
the blessing, and a fast for this effect intimated, to be keeped on 
Thursday first and the next Sabbath immediatelie following; and 
the Covenant intimated to be renewed on ye said Lord's day, ac- 
cording to ye ordinance of the Commissione of ye General As- 
semble."—" Aug. 16, 1649. The same day there was intimat

and read causes of a solemne fast, appointed by ye Generall As- 
semble to be kept throughout all the congregations of the king- 
dom upon ye last Sabbath of this instant;" the causes whereoi 
were, inter alia, the following: « 1. We are to mourne for the 
continuance and increase of sinne and profanitie, especallie of the 
abominable sinne of ivitchcraft, which abounds in ye land, as ap- 
pears from ye frequent discoveries thairof in all corners and quar- 
ters of the countrie. 2. We are to afflict our souls before ye 
Lord for ye sad interruption of the Lord's work in England and 
Ireland, and for the sore oppressione of his people, and such as 
ar stedfast in his cause in these kingdoms, by a prevailing partie 
of sectaries in ye one, and of malignants in the other. 3. It is 
matter of humiliations to us, that our King hath not as yet granted 
the just and necessarie desires of this kirk and kingdome for serv- 
ing of religion, and that he hath made peace with the Irish rebells, 
who have shed so much blood of ye Lord's people, and hath 
graunted unto them the full libertie of Poperie," &amp;c. And again, 
on the 14th November following, another fast was intimated, one 
of the causes of which was stated to be "ye pregnant scandall of 
witchcraft and charming within this part of ye land;" and on 26th 
May 1650, solemn thanksgiving is intimated "to be keeppit upon 
the 2d of June, the next Lord's day, for that wonderful 1 victorie 
over James Grahame and his associates of late in the north." On 
the 28th of July following, « ther was read from the pulpit a de- 
claratione of the Generall Assemblie, in answer to a declaratione 
of the armie of England, upon their march into Scotland, and in- 
timatione given of a fast for the sinnes of ye land, and for the 
great danger the cause and the work of God are into by the inva- 
sione of sectaries." On the 10th October 1652, intimation is 
given of a collection " for the sadd condition of the toune of Glas- 
gow, being half brunt." Under the date of 12th December 1653, 
it is intimated, that there was " na sessione, in respect the elders 
were withdrawin in attending some of Glencairne's souldiers, who 
were ranging throw the paroch." 

There are still farther in this ancient manuscript several curi- 
ous entries respecting parochial matters and discipline, and of a 
miscellaneous nature, which we cannot resist the temptation of 
transcribing, even at the risk of being charged with tediousness. 
The following are a few of the most remarkable of these : " Decem- 
per 24, 1648," a schoolmaster being required for the parish school, 
a person of the name of Fittie had presented himself to the session 



BLAIRGOWRIE.

asa candidate for that office, and attended on them for several Sun- 
days to obtain their decision on his application. The following ra- 
thermive minute at last occurs under the above date, from which it 
may be inferred that the applicant had at length become rather im- 
portunate, and that the session stood somewhat in awe of the bold 
" troopier". " Compeared Mr Patrick Fittie desyring ane answer. 
Thesessionehe being removed declare yt he was presently a troo- 
pier before he presented himself, and yt he was cashiered as being 
upone ye unlawfull ingadgement. The sessione resolve, calling 
him in againe, to discharge him in a, fair way, in respect thairvvas 
not a competent provision yet agried on, and ordained to give 
him twentie-four shillings" Scots. On the 12th August 1649, 
"compeared James Ireland adult 1  in ye publick place of re- 
pentance for the twenty-fourth time, and the minister aggravat- 
ing his sinne, and exhorting him to sorrow and griefe of heart for 
the same, was continued to give farther evidence of ye treuth of 
his repentance." " February 17, 1650, Given this day to Sir 
Robert Mubray, sometyme laird of Barnbougall, now become 
through indigence, ane poor supplicant, twentie-foure shillings." 
On the 24th February 1650, "the Presbyterie Act anent bry- 
dalls, ordaining thair sould not be above eight persons in ye syde, 
that thair sould be no debaucht pypars nor fiddlars, nor promis- 
cuous dancing, nor excessive drunkennesse, was lykeways intimate 
out of ye pulpit." Finally, on the 19th July 1650, there occurs 
the following minute of session : " The minister inquiring if there 
was anie new scandall, it was declared be some yat Andro Mal- 
colme had most despytefullie and devilishlie railed against ye ses- 
sione, cursing minister and elders. The said Andro ordained to 
be cited against next day." — Afterwards ordained to evidence his 
repentance in face of the congregation, but proving " refractory and 
contumacious," was put into " the jouggs" till he agreed to obey 
the former ordinance. 

Antiquities. — This parish contains few remains of antiquity pos- 
sessing much interest. Amongst those deserving of notice are 
the Haer cairns, of which there are, or rather were several, in va- 
rious parts of the parish, marking the scene of mortal conflict, and 
the last resting place of the slain. Most of these have now been 
either partially or wholly removed in the course of modern agri- 
cultural improvements ; and in the process of excavation, human 
bones in great quantities have been found, and two stone coffin, 
formed of four flat stones, containing a skull and a quantity of ashes.

About twenty years ago, the workmen engaged in removing a large 
mound of gravel in the western part of the town, uncovered two 
Roman cinerary urns containing burnt bones, but these were un- 
fortunately broken and thrown away by the men as of no value. 
A Roman spear head was also found many years ago in the great 
moss of Cochrage, already mentioned, and is now in the posses- 
sion of the writer. Another was found, about eight years ago, 
near the bed of the river. There was also found in the neigh- 
bourhood of the town, and close to one of the cairns above 
mentioned, a coin of the Emperor Hadrian in bronze. Close 
beside the manse, there formerly existed a green conical mount, 
about 200 yards in circumference, called the " Hurcheon" or 
" urchin hill," on which, according to tradition, the Earls of Gow- 
rie and their predecessors, in times still more remote, held their 
baron courts, for administering justice or at least such jus- 
tice as the weak could expect from the strong in these bar- 
barous times, to their vassals and retainers ; and, as these fierce 
barons were then invested with the formidable power of "pit 
and gallows," this mount must, doubtless, have often witnessed 
the last despairing glance of the wretched offenders against their 
despotic chiefs, ere they were hurried away to their doom. There 
is a ridge or rising ground within less than a quarter of a mile to the 
westward of this knoll, which still bears the name of the " gallow 
or gallows bank," where, according to tradition, the unfortunate 
criminals condemned at the neighbouring baronial court were im- 
mediately afterwards, and without further ceremony, hung up to 
the bouglrof a tree. The hill or mount, in its original and perfect 
state, had a flat space on the top, which was surrounded with an 
embankment or rampart of earth ; but most unfortunately the whole 
of the earth composing it was some years ago carted away, and 
put upon part of the glebe, and there are now few vestiges re- 
maining. There is a small island in one of the lochs already de- 
scribed, on which the traces of a building are still to be discerned, 
and tradition states that, in times of peril, the inhabitants of the 
surrounding district removed their most valuable effects to this 

• In the course of digging the foundations of the new wing added to the manse, 
in 1838, there was discovered, in the centre of the space formerly occupied by the 
mound, a circular excavation, about three feet in diameter, and six feet in depth, 
which had been dug far down into the hard gravel, and afterwards rilled up with black 
unctuous looking mould, intermixed with ashes and pieces of charred wood. The 
writer examined this excavation, but can form no conjecture as to its origin or pur- 
pose, unless it may be supposed to mark the spot where witches were formerly burnt, 
— many of whom, according to tradition, were executed on this knoll.

island for safety, whence the loch derived its name of the Stor- 
mont or  Store Mount Loch." There are likewise some re- 
mains of a building on a wooded knoll near Ardblair, about a 
mile west from the town of Blairgowrie. This knoll, accord- 
ing to tradition, was at one time surrounded with water, — a cir- 
cumstance which is partly corroborated by the nature and aspect 
of the surrounding ground, which is low, flat, and mossy, and even 
at this day partially covered with surface water in winter. The 
Newton Castle, situated close to the town, is a good specimen of 
the castellated style of mansion-houses which prevailed about the 
latter end of the seventeenth century. It possesses the finest pro- 
spect imaginable, commanding the whole valley of Strathmore 
with all its picturesque and varied scenery ; and, occupying an 
elevated site, forms itself a very picturesque object, and is visi- 
ble from a great distance. Like most other ancient buildings, 
this old mansion is provided with a ghost, in the shape of a lady 
dressed in a green silk gown, thence called the "green lady," which 
is said and believed by some even in this modern age of scepticism 
on these points, still to haunt some of the apartments of the cas- 
tle. About a gunshot to the west of Drumlochy Castle, already 
mentioned, on the opposite side of the deep ravine which forms 
the boundary between the parishes of Blairgowrie and Kinloch, 
are to be seen the still imposing ruins of the ancient castle of 
Glasclune, once a place of considerable strength, both natural 
and artificial, possessed of old by a powerful family of the name 
of Blair. An inveterate feud subsisted between the Blairs of 
Glasclune and the Herons of Drumlochy, which the proximity 
of their strongholds afforded them abundant opportunities of 
gratifying, by a constant and harassing system of petty war- 
fare, attended with considerable bloodshed on both sides, till at 
length the struggle was ended in the total discomfiture of the un- 
fortunate laird of Drumlochy, and the demolition of his fortress. 
Notwithstanding the tempting nature of the subject, however, 
which is full of interest, both antiquarian and historical, we must 
refrain from describing the ruins of this castle, that we may not 
encroach on the province of the statist of Kinloch parish, within 
the boundaries of which it is situated. 

 It may be here noticed that Mr Knox, in his ' Topography of the Basin of 
the Tay," confidently argues that the high ground extending westwards from the 
town of Blairgowrie, is the true locality of the battle-field where the decisive encoun- 
ter betwixt the Caledonians under Galgacus and the Roman legions of Agricola, 
described by Tacitus as the battle of the Grampians, and which has been so long a 
" bone of contention" amongst antiquarians, took place. He supposes the Cale-

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish in 1792 appears to hate been 
1651, of which 1226 were in the landward part of the parish, and 
425 in the village. It is thought that, for perhaps two centuries 
preceding the period to which this report applies, and down to 
about the year 1812 or 1814, the population continued nearly 
stationary, or, at all events, that the increase was very small, if any. 

On comparing the return by Dr Webster in 1755 with that fur- 
nished in the last Statistical Account, we find that, in the inter- 
vening period of nearly fortv years, the increase over the whole 
parish was only 55. 

The following table shows the state of the population of the 
country part of the parish at different periods betwixt 1792 and 
1836, and the comparative increase or decrease at each period :

1831, . 1051 33 

1841, . 1226 171

Total decrease, . 4 

The disproportioned increase in the latter part of this period is 
chiefly owing to the number of families who have of late years 
taken up their residence in the neighbourhood of the various 
spinning-mills adjoining the town. The writer is at a loss to ac- 
count for the large decrease which seems to have taken place among 
the rural population between 1793 and 181 1, unless on the as- 
sumption, that, there must have been some mistake or inaccuracy 
in the return for the former year. 

The state of the population in 1841, and the respective pro- 
portions residing in the town and country, is as follows :

donians to have occupied the ridge or elevated ground extending from the Ericht 
to Forneth, about five miles to the westward, having their left covered by the 
precipitous banks of the Ericht, and their right by a deep ravine to the westward of 
Forneth ; and he advances a very ingenious hypothesis as to the mode of attack, the 
various movements of the two hostile armies during the battle, and the fatal error 
committed by the Caledonians, of descending from their vantage ground, and expos- 
ing themselves to the impetuous attacks of the Romans on the plain. Without 
venturing any opinion on this subject, it is sufficient to refer the reader who may 
feel any interest in this much disputed question, to Mr Knox's work. The na- 
ture of the ground, as well as the numerous remains of Roman encampments and 
ramparts which are still to be seen in the neighbouring parishes, certainly favour the 
hypothesis alluded to.

In the upper district of the parish the Gaelic language is still 
partially spoken by the common people ; but there are none who 
cannot also speak English. The Gaelic is, however, gradually 
disappearing; and it is likely that, in a short time, it will be alto- 
gether disused. 

The general character of the people, both in a moral and intel- 
lectual, and also in a religious point of view, now stands as high, 
it is believed, as in any parish similarly situated in Scotland. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The strict accuracy of the following returns can- 
not altogether be depended on, but they have been made up with 
as much correctness as the nature of the information obtained 
would admit of. 

The number of acres which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage is estimat- 
ed at . . . . . . . , 4987

The species of trees most generally planted are larch and Scotch 
fir. Of the latter especially, as formerly stated, there are large plan- 
tations in the southern district of the parish. There are no planta- 
tions of hard-wood of any great extent, biit there is a considerable 
quantity of ash, elm, and beech planted, either in hedgerows, belts, 
or small clumps, and these kinds appear to thrive well. The kinds 
which are indigenous to the parish are, the alder, the birch, the 
hazel, and the mountain-ash, which especially the first grow in con- 



918 



PERTHSHIRE. 



siderable quantities along the banks of the rivers and burns in the 
parish. The management of the plantations, with respect to thin- 
ning and periodical felling, appears to be good ; and of late years 
considerable attention has been paid by the proprietors of the district 
to these operations. The Scotch fir has been invariably found, 
after reaching a certain age and size, to stop growing, and, soon 
after, begin to decay, so that this species of tree is generally 
cut when it has reached the age of from 40 to 60 years, or, if left af- 
ter that period, it begins to get fogged or covered with moss, the 
branches lose their dark green hue and become yellow, and in a 
very short time the wood gets deteriorated in quality, and exhibits 
that bluish colour, after being cut up, which is always perceived in 
what is technically called " back-going wood." This is not the 
case with the larch, however, which continues to improve to the 
last, and even after it has apparently ceased to increase in size, 
the wood goes on improving in quality and hardness. For this 
reason, the more recent plantations are either altogether composed 
of this useful tree, or at least contain a large intermixture of it. 
The writer regrets to add, however, that a great proportion of 
the larch planted within the last fifteen or twenty years is al- 
ready beginning to wither and decay, but whether this is owing to 
the bad quality of the seed or to the nature of the soil, he cannot 
take it upon him to express an opinion. 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land in the parish is L. 1, 
10s. per imperial acre. In the upper district of the parish, the 
rent is considerably lower, and it is much higher in many parts of 
the lower district, while in the immediate vicinity of the town it is 
as high as L.3 and L.4 per acre; but the average, as nearly as 
can be estimated, is the sum above stated. 

Live-Stock. — There are few or no sheep reared in the parish; 
but many sheep farmers are in the habit of purchasing sheep in 
the autumn, feeding them on turnips in the fields during the win- 
ter, and selling them again in spring in a fattened state. Consi- 
derable quantities of turnips are eaten off the ground in this way 
by sheep, either belonging to the farmer himself, or to sheep- 
farmers in the Highland districts, to whom he lets the turnips at 
a certain rate per acre, varying according to the quality of the 
crop. 

Within the last few years, great attention has been paid to the 
improvement of the breed of cattle in the parish ; and by the in- 
troduction of short-horned bulls, and crossing them with the native 



BLAIRGOWRIE. 



919 



breed of cows, the quality of the stock is now equal to that of the 
best agricultural districts of the country. A large quantity of cattle 
are annually fed and sold for the Glasgow and Falkirk markets. 

With regard to the system of cropping, it is the opinion of those 
most intimately and practically acquainted with the subject, that 
it would be a decided improvement to introduce, for good soils, in 
place of the present system, which is one of Jives, a rotation of 
sevens, in the following order : viz. 1st, oats ; 2d, potatoes with 
dung ; 3d, wheat, barley, or oats ; 4th, turnips with bone-dust, a 
proportion of which to be eaten off the ground with sheep ; 5th, 
barley with grass-seeds; 6th and 7th, two years grass, one of which 
at least to be pastured. 

Very considerable improvements have of late years been made 
in draining and inclosing, and the face of the country now presents, 
in this respect, a very remarkable contrast to its appearance at the 
period of the publication of the last Statistical Account. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years, although se- 
veral are only fifteen ; and the stipulations are in general favour- 
able to the tenant. 

Quarries and Mines. — The only kinds of stone found in exten- 
sive beds in this parish, and which are at all adapted for building, 
are the coarse red sandstone or conglomerate already mentioned, 
and a species of whinstone of a very dark colour, a stratum of 
which, as mentioned under a previous head, stretches in horizon- 
tal layers along the ridge of Knock-ma-har. This latter has been 
used only to a very limited extent in building, owing to its sombre 
and gloomy colour, and its almost impracticable hardness. Of 
the former there is a large quarry within half a mile of the town, 
which was worked for a great number of years, and out of which the 
greater part of the stones used in and around the town were taken. 
Some years ago, however, the proprietor of the neighbouring villa 
of Altamont, which is situated in the close vicinity of the quarry, 
having experienced great annoyance from the process of blasting 
the rock so close to his house, took a lease of it from the trustees 
of the proprietor, and shut it up; so that it has not been worked 
for several years. A quarry of the same material has been open- 
ed abouthalf a mile to the south-west of the old one, and is 
now in full operation. The stone, as already mentioned, is of 
very coarse quality, and not easily dressed, but durable. An- 
other quarry of red sandstone, of finer quality but softer texture, 
was opened some years ago and worked for some time on the 



020 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ground of Rosemount, in the face of an almost perpendicular clitT 
rising out of the bed of the river; but it has now been abandoned. 
There is still another quarry of fine gray sandstone at Parkhead, 
in the southern district of the parish ; but it has not been worked 
to any considerable extent of late years, owing to the expense of 
carriage, and the difficulty of keeping the excavations free from 
the water, with which they are liable to be inundated. 

Fisheries. — The only fishery carried on in the parish is sal- 
mon-fishing, which has now much decreased in value, owing to 
the fish being intercepted and destroyed in such numbers on 
their way from the sea at the fishing-stations further down, in 
the Tay and Isla. Previous to the commencement of the present 
century, salmon and grilse were very plentiful in the river; so 
much so, that, in the year 1804, no less than 336 salmon and 
grilse were caught at one haul in a pool called the Coble Pool, in 
the neighbourhood of the village; but, owing to the cause already 
mentioned, they are now scarce and high-priced. The fishing 
along the whole course of the Erich t, from the Keith to the 
boundary of the parish, is now let for L.21, 12s. per annum; and 
even this sum is considered much too high. 

 It may not be considered out of place here to describe the method of fishing 
with the hand-net, which is curious, and is believed to be peculiar to this parish. 
The net used is what is called a pock-net, about six feet six inches in depth, fixed on 
a hoop or " scob" formed of elastic hazel wands. This hoop or " scob" is about four 
feet in diameter, of an oval or circular form, and is attached to an elastic pole or 
handle about 21 feet in length. When the river is in flood, the fishermen, standing 
on the rocky brink of the water where it is narrowed by the approach of the rocks 
on each side to a breadth of from 8 to 12 feet, dips down the net into the eddies 
formed by the projecting points of rock turning aside the force of the stream, and 
into which the salmon retire to avoid the strength of the current, and recover 
themselves before attempting to leap the. fall immediately above ; and, by means of 
the long elastic handle, he moves the net slowly along from six to eight feet beneath 
the surface of the water, and the moment he feels any obstruction to its progress, he 
hauls it rapidly up, and lands the fish on the rock without trouble. In this way, 
when the fish are plentiful, and the river swollen with rain, considerable numbers of 
salmon and grilse are caught. When the river is small and clear, it is artificially dis- 
coloured, by throwing a quantity of mortar into it above the fall about the dusk of the 
evening, and the fish are then caught in the same way during the night. There is still 
another expedient put in practice for the destruction of the fish. When the river issmall, 
its breadth from rock to rock, about thirty yards below the fall, is not more than six or 
eight feet ; and at this narrow part a net nearly of the same form as those already 
described, but shorter in the handle, and sufficiently large to fill up nearly the whole 
space from side to side, is put down into the water, as near to the bottom as possible, 
and the fish are dislodged from under the rocks above, and forced downwards by 
means of a long pole with a mass of red cloth at the end of it, which is pushed under 
the rocks. Terrified and confused by the noise\ and splashing, and the glare of the 
uncouth instrument with which it is performed, the salmon rush blindly down to es- 
cape from it, and fall into the net placed to intercept them. Frequently, however, 
they escape the danger, either by getting past or under the net, or by darting out of 
it again before it can be raised to the surface. 



t We are satisfied, from personal observation, that salmon do hear, though this is 
a disputed point in natural history.

The best months for angling in this river are April and May for 
salmon, and July, August, and September for grilse. The second 
day after a flood, when the wind is from the east, and the sky cloudy, 
but without any appearance of rain, the fish rise readily to the com- 
mon salmon and grilse fly; and in the. warm summer months, 
when the river is low, they will sometimes readily take a minnow 
in the deep pools early in the morning. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish is, as nearly as can be ascertained, as follows, viz. 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for the food of 

man or the domestic animals, . . • L. 12,000 0 0

Manufactures. — The only branches of manufacture carried on 
here are the spinning of flax and tow into yarn, and the weaving 
of these yarns into cloth of various fabrics. There are no fewer 
than five spinning-mills in the parish, engaged in the first-men- 
tioned branch of manufacture, and the machinery of all of them 
is driven by water. Three of these are situated on the Ericht, 
one on the Lornty Burn, and one on the Lunan, a small stream 
which forms the south-west boundary of the parish. \ The fol- 
lowing table shows the number of hands engaged at each of these 
mills, distinguishing the males from the females : —

The flax used at these mills is imported into Dundee from the 
Baltic ports, and, after being spun into yarn, is either reconveved 
to Dundee for sale there, or disposed of to manufacturers in the 
neighbourhood, and in Myth and Cupar-Angus. The value of 
flax weekly consumed in the three mills at present in operation in 
the immediate vicinity of the town, is from L.400 to L.500, or from 

• The writer of this account has not been able to obtain sufficient data to enable 
him to hazard any estimate of the probable value of the produce of the unarable 
ground pastured, or of the annual thinning and periodical felling of copse and plan- 
tations, which is of a very fluctuating and uncertain nature. 

f Besides the mills above enumerated, there is another large mill, employing 
above 200 hands, situated in the close vicinity of the town, in the adjoining pa°- 
rish of Rattray, a large proportion of the people engaged at which reside in the 
town of Blairgowrie. 



922 



PERTHSHIRE. 



L.20,800 to L.26,000 per annum ; and the value of yarn spun at 
the same mills, from L.650 to L.700 per week, or about from 
L.33,000 to L.36,00 per annum. 

The other branch of manufacture, the weaving of yarn into 
cloth, employs about 370 hands. The yarns are purchased by 
the master manufacturers of the place, who employ weavers to 
weave it into cloth, which is then sent to Dundee and sold to 
cloth merchants there. Part of the cloth, however, is shipped di- 
rect, at the risk of the manufacturer, to North and South America 
and France. The greater part of the cloth manufactured consists 
of Osnaburgs and coarse sheetings ; but there is also a consider- 
able quantity of fine dowlas and drill manufactured. The weavers 
employed by the master manufacturers are paid for their work by 
the piece, and their earnings average for men, 8s. ; and women, 
5s. per week, working fourteen hours per day. The whole of the 
weaving is done by hand-looms, no machinery being employed for 
that purpose. 

About the period of the publication of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, a considerable quantity of flax was grown in the parish, the 
produce of which was spun with the common spinning-wheel by 
domestic servants, and women who were not fit for any harder 
work, and it was quite a common thing for expert hands to earn 
from 3s. to 4s. 6d. a-week in this way. The yarn was then woven 
into linen, sometimes of very fine texture, for shirting, &amp;c. The 
introduction of machinery, however, has now completely super- 
seded this branch of industry. 

With regard to the effect which these occupations may have 
upon the health of those employed in them, the writer is not pre- 
pared to say that it is prejudicial, at least to any great extent, — 
certainly much less so than in large towns where the operatives do 
not enjoy equal advantages in respect of air and exercise ; and 
were these operatives more regular in their habits of living, and 
more attentive to cleanliness in their persons and dwellings, it is 
thought that they would be equally healthy with other classes of 
the population who are also engaged in occupations of a sedentary 
nature. 

Their effect on the morals of the operatives are unfortunately 
much more marked and observable, and is such as might natural- 
ly have been expected, and has invariably followed, from the pro-

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The only market-town in the parish is the 
town of Blairgowrie, which was erected into a barony in favour of 
George Drummond of Blair, the then proprietor of the estate of 
Blairgowrie, by a Royal charter from Charles I., dated 9th July 
1634. In the year 1809, the town was created a free burgh of 
barony by a charter from Colonel M'Pherson, the feudal supe- 
rior, whereby the burgesses were empowered to elect a bailie and 
four councillors for the management of the affairs of the burgh. 
The bailie and two of the councillors vacate their offices every 
two years, and their places are supplied by others elected by the 
burgesses qualified to vote in terms of the charter. 

The population of the town in 1841, the period when the last 
census was taken, was 2242. Since the publication of the last 
Statistical Account, its population has been quadrupled, as will 
appear from the following table : —

The police of the town is regulated by the provisions of 
the General Police Act, and is under the management of the 
chief magistrate and four commissioners, the latter being elected 
annually by the L.10 householders. These commissioners have 
the power of levying, for the purposes of the act, an assessment 
to the extent of 8d. per pound on rents at and above L.2 ; and 
the funds thus raised are applied under the management of these 
commissioners, to defray the expenses of lighting and cleaning 
the streets of the town, and other necessary charges connected 
with the police of the place. The provisions of the Act regarding 
watching and paving have not been adopted, the householders 
d by the charter of constitution, either themselves to 
take their turn of watching, or to provide substitutes. This is 
not a very burdensome duty, as it only devolves about once a-year 
on each inhabitant. 

The town is now well lighted with gas, supplied by a joint-stock 
company established in 1834, and gas is now very generally sub- 
stituted for oil and candles, both in the shops and private dwel-

ling-houses in the town, although the high price charged for it, 
14s. per 1000 feet, and the expense of pipes and fittings, has 
somewhat retarded its introduction into general use among the 
poorer classes. The company now pays an annual dividend of five 
per cent, to the holders of the stock. There is a branch of the 
Bank of Scotland, and another of the Commercial Bank in the 
town. 

There is no other place in the parish deserving the name of 
village. 

Means of Communication. — Besides private roads, there are 
three public roads which intersect the parish, viz. 1. the Great 
North Road from Perth to Fort George, which enters the parish 
at its southern boundary, about two miles from the town ; 2. 
The road from Cupar- Angus to Blairgowrie, which was made a 
turnpike in the year 1832, and is now kept in excellent repair. 
It enters this parish about two miles to the south of the town, and 
terminates at Blairgowrie ; 3. The line of road from Kirriemuir, 
Forfar, &amp;c. to Dunkeld, passes through the town and across the 
parish from east to west. There is not much traffic on this line 
of road, even in summer, and it is not therefore kept in a very 
sufficient state of repair. 

There are five bridges in the parish, viz. the Bridge of Blair- 
gowrie, by which the Great North Road crosses the Ericht, the 
Bridge of Craighall, where it recrosses the river ; the Bridge 
of Cally, where it crosses the Ardle ; the Bridge of Carsie, by 
which it crosses the water of Lunan, and the bridge of Lornty, 
where the old military road crossed the Lornty. These bridges 
are all in tolerably good repair ; but they are all built on the old 
construction, with a considerable rise in the centre, and very 
narrow. The Bridges of Craighall and Cally, especially, are 
not only too narrow to admit of the passage of two vehicles meet- 
ing, but also form an acute angle with the road, which renders 
them both inconvenient and dangerous. At the Bridge of 
Cally, there is a very steep ascent on both sides from the 
bridge, with an almost perpendicular declivity on one side of the 
road, quite unprotected by any fence or parapet, so that any car- 
riage going too near the side of the road would infallibly be 
hurled down the steep bank to the river, a depth of from 60 to 
100 feet. Besides the bridges above enumerated, there is a very 
elegant suspension bridge of iron over the Ericht, erected by 



BLAIRGOWRIE.

Ecclesiastical State.— The situation of the town of course de- 
termined that of the parish church, which, as already stated, is si- 
tuated close to it. In a parish of such extent, it necessarily fol- 
lows that the church is inconveniently placed as regards some 
part of the population ; but, as its site is nearly equidistant from 
both the northern and southern extremities of the parish, it is 
quite accessible to the great majority of the inhabitants. It is 
true the districts of Clayquhat and Cally are from four to five 
miles distant from the church, while the detached districts of 
Blackcraig and Wester Cally are upwards of seven miles distant ; 
but although, owing to this circumstance, the inhabitants of 
these districts are, in general, unable to attend the parish church, 
their comparative proximity to the chapel of Persie, a chapel 
of ease for the accommodation of the inhabitants of detach- 
ed parts of Bendochy, Blairgowrie, Myth, and Kinloch parishes, 
materially lessens the inconvenience which would otherwise re- 
sult from their remote situation. The most distant points of 
these districts are not more than three or four miles from the 
chapel of Persie. The parish church was erected in 1824, 
on the site of the old church, which had become much too 
small for the accommodation of the rapidly increasing popula- 
tion, and it is of course in good repair. It is calculated to hold 
about 1000 people, although in the scheme of division of the seats 
among the heritors, the number it would hold was computed at 
only 900. There are no free sittings, with the exception of a very 
few' which are reserved for the poor. The manse was built in 
1771 ; but in the year 1838, the whole house and offices, with the 
exception of the wing containing the dining and drawing rooms, 
were taken down and rebuilt, and several additional rooms added 
to the dwelling-house. Both the dwelling-house and offices are 
now, therefore, in the most complete and sufficient state. The 
repairs and additions cost upwards of L.500. The glebe, includ- 
ing 5 acres which were given in lieu of a right of pasturage for- 
merly enjoyed by the incumbent, extends to about 9£ acres, and 
its average annual value may be about L.18. The stipend is 
partly money and partly " victual," in the following proportions, 
viz. money stipend, L.109, Is. 7d ; meal, 71 bolls, 2 lippies, 2 
pecks ; barley, 62 bolls, 3 firlots, I lippy, and 3 pecks, convertible 
into money at the highest fiars prices of the year.

In the year 1837, the parish church having been found to be 
much too small for the adequate accommodation of the parish- 
ioners, and a chapel belonging to the burgher congregation being 
then for sale, a subscription was entered into for the purpose of 
purchasing the building, and opening it as a preaching station in 
connection with the parish church. Nearly L.300 having accord- 
ingly been raised by subscription, the chapel was purchased for 
the sum of L.399, and the title taken to certain trustees appoint- 
ed by the subscribers, and their successors in office, for behoof 
of the subscribers; and the chapel was opened as a preaching 
station in the month of December of the same year. The sub- 
scription raised having proved inadequate for the payment of the 
whole price, the Church Extension Committee granted L.100 
from their funds for the benefit of the chapel. This sum has 
completely relieved it of all debt, and the annual income aris- 
ing from the seat rents and collections having hitherto proved suf- 
ficient for the payment of the minister and all incidental charges, 
the undertaking has turned out a most successful one, and pro- 
mises to be of great and lasting benefit to the community at large. 
The chapel is situated in Brown's Street, Blairgowrie, and is a 
plain building of hewn stone. It is capable of containing about 
600 souls, and is for the present amply sufficient for the supply of 
the destitution of church accommodation which previously ex- 
isted. The minister receives the whole free income arising from 
the seat rents and collections, after deducting the necessary ex- 
penses, and the sum paid to him from this source for the last 
years was upwards of L.140. The seat rents for the current half 
year December 1842 amount to L.42, 0s. 4d., and the collec- 
tions average upwards of L.l per week. 

There is one Independent and one Catholic chapel in the pa- 
rish, the ministers of which are paid, it is understood, partly from 
the seat-rents and collections, and partly by voluntary contribu- 
tions from the members of their congregations; but the annual 
amount of their stipends is not known, being rather fluctuating and 
uncertain. Public worship is performed in the Catholic chapel 
only once a month, and it has no resident clergyman — the gentle- 
man who officiates having his residence in Perth, and having un- 
der his charge several other chapels besides the one in this town. 
There is a considerable number of Seceders in the parish ; but 
no chapel belonging to that body within its bounds. Those who 
belong to that sect attend either the chapel lately erected in the 

4 



BLAIRGOWRIE. 



927 



neighbouring parish of Rattray for their accommodation, or the 
Seceder chapel, at Lethendy, three miles distant. 

A congregation in connection with the Scottish Episcopal 
Church was formed in the year 1841, and the number of individuals 
belonging to it is at present not more than 90, — the regular weekly 
attendance in its present temporary place of meeting averaging 
from 30 to 40. Its founder and pastor, the Rev. John Marshall, is 
at present engaged in the erection, chiefly at his own expense, of a 
handsome Gothic edifice, in the early English style of ecclesiasti- 
cal architecture, to be named " St Catharine's Church," which 
will afford accommodation for about 200. Being intended as a 
model of the style and form of ecclesiastical edifices previous to 
the Reformation, it consists of a nave and chancel ; the latter con- 
taining a beautiful window of stained glass, ornamented with vari- 
ous devices relating to church subjects. There is a vestry and 
library attached to the building ; and the latter is not intended 
exclusively for the use of the congregation, but for persons of all 
denominations, and contains many works in science and general 
literature. 

The number of families in the parish that attend the Esta- 
blished Church, either in the parish church, Brown Street chapel, 
or Percy chapel, is about 560 ; the number of individuals, about 
2400. The number of persons attending the chapels of Dissent- 
ers and Seceders is about 560. The number of individuals be- 
longing to the Episcopalian church is about 90 ,• and to the Ro- 
man Catholic persuasion about 40. 

There is a Sabbath evening school held in the church, at which 
the attendance is upwards of 400, and the good effects of the reli- 
gious instruction there communicated are beginning to appear very 
conspicuously in the evident and rapid improvement of the. popula- 
tion, and the sensible decline of vice and immorality of every de- 
scription. 

The average number of communicants in the parish is 1100. 

The average amount of church collections yearly for religious 
and charitable objects, exclusive of the regular weekly collections 
for the poor, is L.18, 10s. 9d. Sterling ; but there is a society in 
the parish, called " the Juvenile Parochial Missionary Associa- 
tion," whose average annual contributions for the last three years 
amount to no less than L.87. The funds raised by this associa- 
tion are devoted to the five schemes of the General Assembly, 
and to female education in India.

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is four, 
whereof one is a parish school, and the other three are taught 
by individuals on their own account, without any endowment or 
other emolument than the school-fees. Three of these schools 
are situated in the town, and the other at a place called Banchory, 
in the lower extremity of the parish. The salary of the parish 
schoolmaster is the maximum ; and the parochial teacher has the 
legal accommodations. The general expense of education per 
annum, in all the different branches taught in these schools, is 
from L.l to L.l, 12s. 

The whole population of the lower part of the parish, and the 
greater proportion of that inhabiting the upper district, are within 
a convenient distance of one or other of the schools above enume- 
rated, or, at least, they are accessible to them without much in- 
convenience ; but the inhabitants of the detached districts of 
Blackcraig and Cruchies, and also the district of Clayquhat, are 
at too great a distance from all of them to derive any benefit from 
their operation. The wants of that portion of the population are, 
however, partly supplied by a school near the Bridge of Cally, 
which is open in the winter season only, and by another school situ- 
ated at a place called Ballentuim, in the parish of Kirkmichael. The 
former of these is supported partly by voluntary subscription, and 
partly by the school-fees, which are very small, and the latter al- 
together by the school-fees. The district of Cruchies is supplied 
partly by a school supported chiefly by Sir James Ramsay of Banff, 
and partly by the parish school of Alyth. An endowed school, 
established at or near the Bridge of Cally in this parish, would be 
of very great benefit to the population of that district of the parish, 
which is very considerable. A bequest of the late Mr George 
Barty, connected with this subject, is afterwards described under 
the head of Charitable Institutions. 

Literature. — There are two circulating libraries in the town of 
Blairgowrie besides the library attached to the Episcopal church, 
already mentioned ; and a small parochial library has also been form- 
ed in connection with the Sabbath school. There is likewise a 
small printing press in the town, which is chiefly used for printing 
handbills and advertisements. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — The only institutions of a 
charitable nature at present in operation in the parish are, a So- 
ciety for the purchase and distribution of clothing to destitute 
families, and a Savings' Bank. The latter was established in Oc- 



BLAIRGOWRIE. 



929 



tober 1837, and now numbers 120 depositors, having at their cre- 
dit deposits amounting to L.1197, 19s. 7d. The institution is a 
branch of the National Security Savings Bank of Perth, with which 
its funds are invested, and the rate of interest paid on deposits is 
3£ per cent. The deposits vary in amount from 5s. to L.30. 

The late Mr George Barty, formerly tobacconist in Perth, and 
a native of this parish, by his settlement, bequeathed one-third of 
the free residue of his estate to the Dean of Guild and Guild- 
Council of Perth, in trust, for the purpose of laying it out on he- 
ritable security, and paying the interest thereof annually to the 
parish schoolmaster of Blairgowrie, and his successors in office, to 
defray the expense of educating " all the orphan, fatherless, and 
poor children" belonging to the parishes of Blairgowrie, Rattray, 
Bendochy, and Kinloch in the parish school of Blairgowrie, the 
children to be recommended by the minister and kirk-session of 
these parishes, and those bearing the names of Barty and Soutar 
to be preferred. Mr Barty died in the month of June 1838, and 
his bequest came into operation at Martinmas 184 J. The fund 
thus mortified amounts to about L.1400, and there are now forty 
children enjoyingthe benefit of the bequest. These children are 
taught the same branches, and enjoy equal advantages in other 
respects with the other children attending the parish school. 

There are still two other institutions, which will properly fall to 
be alluded to under this head, viz. the Monthly Deposit Com- 
pany, and the Tee-total Society. The former of these is some- 
thing of the nature of a savings' bank, although conducted on dif- 
ferent principles. It comprehends about 106 members, who each 
deposit 5s. per month for a period of ten years, at the expiration 
of which the whole funds, principal and interest, fall to be divided 
amongst the depositors or their representatives. The funds as 
they are periodically collected from the depositors are lent out at 
interest, either on personal or heritable security, and they at pre- 
sent amount to upwards of L.2000. 

A Tee total Society was established in November 1838, and 
numbers about 700 members, including those inhabiting the neigh- 
bouring parish of Rattray. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving aid regularly from the poor's funds of the parish is 37 ; 
and the average sum allotted to each is 5s. per month, or L.3 per 
annum. 

The average number of persons receiving occasional relief from 

PERTH. 3 N 



930 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the funds is 38 ; and the average sum paid to the whole collec- 
tively is L.16, 14s. per annum, or about 8s. 9d. each person. The 
average annual amount of the whole contributions for the relief of 
the p°oor, from whatever source, is as follows, viz. collections at 
church gate, L. 69, 6s. 5d. ; voluntary contributions of the heri- 
tors, L. 38, 18s. 8d. ; proceeds of mortcloth dues and other ses- 
sional emoluments, L. 1 1 ; total, L. 1 19, 3s. Id. 

There is no other regular mode of raising funds for the support 
of the poor than those above enumerated. When there is any de- 
ficiency in the ordinary collections for the poor, it is supplied by 
the heritors, who assess themselves voluntarily in the necessary 
sum, according to their respective valued rents. 

Until within the last twenty or thirty years, there existed 
amongst the poor a very great disinclination to seek relief from 
the poor's fund. Unhappily, however, this noble and independent 
spirit is now in a great measure extinct, and the kirk-session are 
continually overwhelmed with applications for relief, often from 
those who have relatives quite able to afford them such help as 
would render such applications unnecessary. 

Prisons.— The only place for the confinement of delinquents is 
a sort of cell in the lower story of the town-house, which is di- 
vided into two apartments, and well secured with sufficient locks 
on the doors, and iron gratings on the windows. The cells are 
under the superintendance of the town-officer, whose duty it is to 
report to the bailie the apprehension of every offender as soon as 
he is secured in the cell, or, at all events, next morning, if he has 
been incarcerated late on the previous night, and the bailie then 
holds a court upon the prisoner without delay, hears the charge 
and evidence, and inflicts a punishment according to the nature of 
the offence, varying from a fine of Is. to L.2, or from twenty-four 
hours to twenty days' imprisonment in the cells on bread and water. 
This system has been found to be very efficient for the prevention of 
drunken brawls and other breaches of the peace, which are now 
much less frequent than they formerly were. The number of prison- 
ers confined in these cells during the year 1841 was 128; and the 
offences were petty thefts, drunkenness, assaults, and other de- 
linquencies of the same nature. 

Fairs.— The fairs held in the town are the following, viz. the 
third Wednesday in March ; the 26th May if a Wednesday, if 
not the first Wednesday after; the 23d July; the first Wednes- 
day in November; the 22d of November or first Tuesday there- 



BLAIRGOWRIE. 



931 



after; and on the Wednesday before Falkirk Tryst. A market 
for cattle and grain is also held every fortnight, on Wednesdays, 
during the winter and spring, which is much frequented by the 
farmers and graziers of the district. 

The number of licensed inns and alehouses in the parish is 36, 
the whole of which are in the town, with the exception of two. 

Fuel. — The fuel generally used in the town and the lower part 
of the parish is coal and wood ; and, in the upper district, peats. 
The coal is procured from Dundee and Perth, and costs, includ- 
ing carriage, from Is. 2d. to Js. 4d. per cwt., or, if sold by the 
ton, from L. 1, 3s. to L. 1, 6s. The wood used for firewood 
is furnished by the thinnings of the fir and larch plantations 
in the parish, the branches lopped off the hardwood trees, and 
the oak copse when periodically cut for the bark. The peat 
is obtained principally from the great moss of Cochrage already 
mentioned, but it is not much used in the lower division of the 
parish, except for kindling the fires. It cost about 3s. the cart- 
load. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The changes that have taken place within the parish since the 
publication of the former Statistical Account are numerous and very 
remarkable. The population has been nearly doubled ; trade and 
manufactures have grown up and flourished in an unprecedented 
manner ; agriculture has been extended, and brought to great 
perfection; and a vast and beneficial alteration has taken place on 
the social condition of all classes of the community. The charac- 
ter, manners, and habits of the people, have likewise undergone 
an important and striking change, in some respects, for the better, 
but in many, it is feared, for the worse. It appears that, while 
the population of the rural districts has decreased, that of the vil- 
lage has augmented in more than a corresponding ratio. About 
forty years ago, Blairgowrie was a quiet and insignificant village 
of mean and thatched houses, collected in the vicinity of the pa- 
rish church and the seat of the proprietor of the barony. It is 
now a large manufacturing and market-town, containing good 
streets, filled with all the bustle of an active and industrious po- 
pulation. 

In the rural districts the change is not less remarkable. There 
is now, properly speaking, no peasantry, the whole class coming 
under that denomination having been swept away by the breaking 
up of the cottar system throughout the parish, and the prevalence 



932 



PERTHSHIRE. 



of the practice, now so generally adopted by Scottish land- 
owners, of throwing several small farms into one, — a practice which 
has had the effect of transferring the agriculture of the parish to 
a body of men possessed of superior intelligence, and such a com- 
mand of capital, as enables them to conduct it on a liberal scale, 
and on the most approved principles. The result has been a vast 
improvement in the whole system of agricultural management, 
and, consequently, in the general aspect of the country, since 
the publication of the last Statistical Account. Then nearly 
two-thirds of the parish lay quite open and unenclosed : Al- 
most every field was intersected in many places by stripes of 
waste ground, called " baulks," on which the stones gathered from 
the ground under crop were deposited : there were no drains to 
carry off the superfluous water, and no plantations to shelter the 
fields from the cold and blighting winds : a proper system or ro- 
tation of cropping was almost unknown, and a great extent of 
ground remained wholly waste and unproductive, or yielded but 
a scanty pasturage for cattle during the summer months. Now 
almost every farm is properly subdivided and enclosed ; the 
" baulks" have been all removed ; the wet ground has been drain- 
ed ; and many plantations formed for shelter to the more exposed 
grounds. A proper rotation of cropping and manuring has been 
introduced ; and the greater part of the waste ground has been 
either reclaimed and cultivated, or covered with thriving wood. 
Nor is the improvement in the domestic economy of the farmer 
less marked. Instead of the miserable thatched hovel, — dark, 
dirty, confined, and withal ill furnished, — in which he formerly 
contrived to exist — he now inhabits a good substantial slated house, 
well-lighted, clean, commodious, and comfortably furnished. In- 
stead of the ill-fashioned garments, of coarse home-spun materials, 
which he formerly wore, he is clad in well- fitting clothes of good 
broad-cloth ; and the hat of modern shape has taken the place of 
the broad blue bonnet of former days. The- change in the whole 
style of his " house-keeping" is equally observable ; and, without 
entering into a minute detail on this subject, it may suffice to re- 
mark, that the habitual style of living which now prevails among 
this class marks the acquisition not only of new tastes and refined 
habits, but of the means of gratifying them ; and, however opinions 
may differ on the question, whether this change may not have been 
carried farther than their station and circumstances warrant, the

social condition of the farmer, as compared with what it was thirty 
or forty years ago, is unquestionably both elevated and improved. 

It would be extremely gratifying to be able to record an im- 
provement in the moral and religious character of the population, 
commensurate with that which has taken place in their external 
circumstances and mode of living. But it must be admitted that 
in this respect there has been a very evident and decided falling 
off ; that the strictness of religious principle has been relaxed ; 
and the general tone of morality greatly lowered. The chief 
cause of this unfortunate deterioration is undoubtedly to be found 
in the great influx into the parish, from Dundee and other large 
towns, of immoral and dissolute characters of both sexes, who ob- 
tain employment in the numerous spinning-mills in the neighbour- 
hood ; and it is not difficult to foresee that the contagious effect of 
this moral pestilence must inevitably be felt throughout the com- 
munity. Great exertions are at present making, however, by the 
gratuitous instruction of the children of the working classes in 
Sabbath schools and otherwise, to counteract this evil influence, 
and to promote the growth of practical religion and morality 
throughout the parish ; and it is to be hoped that the means em- 
ployed for this object may, through the blessing of God, be at- 
tended with the desired effect, and lay the foundation of a gradual 
and thorough reformation.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JOHN EDWARD TOUCH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, fyc. — This parish is of a very irregular form, being in- 
tersected in different directions by those adjoining. It incldues 
the village of Balbeggie on its northern extremity, betwixt and 
which the parishes of Scone and St Martins intervene, while the 
village of Inchyra, lying on its eastern extremity, has the parish- 
of Kinfauns interjacent. Its greatest length may be stated at 12 
miles, its greatest breadth 4. The central part of the parish, con- 



934 



PERTHSHIRE. 



taining about seven-ninths of the population, lies immediately op- 
posite to Perth, from which it is separated by the Tay : and, ris- 
ing from the margin of the river till it reaches the summit of the 
hill of Kinnoull, presents many striking features of natural beauty. 

Geology. — The principal part of the parish being situated on 
the western terminal slope of the Sidlaw hills, consists almost en- 
tirely of the different varieties of trap, of which a large portion of 
that range is composed. One slight and solitary exception oc- 
curs in a thin bed of stratified sandstone, seen to lie over the trap 
in a quarry near the church. Great beds of water-worn gravel 
rest on the rocky strata, some two hundred feet above the present 
level of the river, and these are peculiarly conspicuous near the 
toll-bar at Barnhill, about three-fourths of a mile, south-east from 
the church. On the river side, rich alluvium prevails like that 
which constitutes the soil of the lower Carse. In the Inchyra 
section of the parish, trap also is alone visible, although it is ex- 
tremely probable that the great bed of red or greyish sandstone 
which fills up the Carse of Gowrie, and- the westermost quarries of 
which are at Pitfour, in the adjoining parish of St Madoes, extends 
as high up as Seggieden, and consequently may be found around 
Inchyra. The rich alluvium here, however, is so thick, that after 
quitting the slopes of the trap on the hill side, and descending to 
the level ground, no rocks of any sort are visible. The Balbeg- 
gie division of the parish, though lying within the region of the 
old red sandstone formation, consists chiefly of the same material 
as that alone appearing in the other two districts. Greyish red 
sandstone is found, however, and is abundant in the neighbour- 
hood. It is of considerable beauty, and from its compactness and 
durability, is in demand as a building stone. 

The minerals in the parish are so common, and are so univer- 
sally found in trap districts, that it is unnecessary to enumerate 
them. The splendid agates, of which most museums in Britain 
contain specimens, and which are known by the name of Kinnoull 
stones, though found in the hill of Kinnoull, are so chiefly, in that 
part of it lying in the parish of Kinfauns. 

Climate, Sfc. — The climate of this parish may be said to be ge- 
nerally salubrious. From the fine exposure of that part of it 
which lies opposite to Perth, and the shelter from the east which 
the rising grounds interpose, there are here the earliest indications 
of coming spring. Close to the river, no doubt, hoar frost is oc- 
casionally very severe, as is seen in its effects on shrubs and plants

coming within its range, — these being often killed down, while, of 
those occupying an elevation, higher by a few yards only, some are 
to be found, having acquired a prescriptive right to the name of 
evergreens— others, again, almost refusing to be deciduous. 

Rivers, Salmon -Fishing, c— The Tay, forming the western 
boundary of the parish, divides itself into two parts a little be- 
low the church, forming a small island called Moncrieff island, one- 
half of which is in this parish, and the other in that of Perth. 
That branch of the river on the farther side of the island is the 
course which larger vessels hold, in coming to Perth, while that, on 
this side is navigable by vessels of about 60 tons burden, and af- 
fords a somewhat shorter passage, when, in spring tides, they seek 
to make Kinnoull shore ; and from which, within the last few years, 
two vessels of that measurement have been launched. 

Of the many valuable salmon-fishings on the river, Kinnoull 
has its share, — the stations or hawls belonging to it being rented 
at about L.1200 per annum. 

Hills. — " There are two hills in this parish, Kinnoull-hill,and the 
hill of Murray's-hall, which are rather different parts of the same 
ridge of hills, at the distance of two miles from one another; 
from which there is one of the most beautiful and extensive 
prospects. The hill of Kinnoull is the most remarkable. Its 
height above the level of the Tay is 632 feet. On the south 
it is exceedingly steep, consisting of ragged rock, and presents a 
very striking and formidable appearance. It is covered with a 
thriving plantation to the very summit. On the north side of the 
hill there is a gradual ascent, through a serpentine walk, by which 
a carriage can easily go to the top. This is called Montague's 
walk, from the late Duke of Montague, who was in Scotland when 
it was formed. 

"There is a steep and hollow descent betwixt two tops of the hill, 
which is called the Windy Gowle. Near to this place, in certain 
positions, there is a remarkable echo, that repeats above nine 
times ; and on the face of the hill there is a cave in a steep part 
of the rock, which, it is said, will contain about a dozen of men. 
It is called the Dragon-hole. We are informed from the k ancient 
records of the kirk-session of Perth that, during the time of Po- 
pery, a great number of people assembled here on the 1st of May 
to celebrate superstitious games, which the Reformers prohibited 
under severe censures and heavv penalties. There is a tradition

among- the common people that Sir William Wallace hid himself 
in this hole of the rock, where he absconded for some time." 

Botany. — This parish affords no inconsiderable variety of plants, 
in consequence of its embracing part of Kinnoull hill, together 
with some small detached portions of moor and upland pasture, 
as well as fertile fields in conjunction with the Tay. From a list 
of upwards of 430 species which might be enumerated, the fol- 
lowing are given as the most rare : —

II. — Cjvil History. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Earl of Kin- 
noull ; Lord Gray ; Niel Fergusson Blair, Esq. of Balthayock ; 
Andrew Murray, Esq. of Murrayshall ; Robert Crystal, Esq. of 

Inchyra ; Sir Thomas Moncrieffe of Moncrieffe, Bart. ; 

Farquharson Macdonald, Esq. of St Martins ; Captain Moncrieffe 
of Barnhill or Woodend ; Archibald Turnbull, Esq. of Bellwood ; 
and the Directors of James Murray's Royal Asylum. Besides 
these, there are many proprietors of villas, in the central part of 
the parish, having from two to eight acres attached. 

Parochial Registers. — The session registers commence in 1618, 
and, with the exception of the period between 1725 and 1730, 
have been regularly brought down to the present time. 

Eminent Characters, Antiquities, Sfc— As from this parish the 
title of the Noble family of Kinnoull has its origin, so did it con- 
tinue for many generations to be their burial-place ; and within 
the aisle which was attached to the old church, there still remains, 
in high preservation, a very striking monument, erected in 1635, 
to the memory of George, first Earl of Kinnoull, and Chancellor 
of Scotland. In a recess behind four columns, enriched with a 
variety of curious ornaments, and surmounted by a pediment ern-

bellished with escutcheons, stands a statue of the Chancellor in 
his robes, his left hand resting on a small table, and on which are 
placed, side by side, the Great Seal of Scotland, &amp;c. insignia of 
his office, and a human skull. There is no inscription. The 
simple but striking device explains itself. 

This curious relic is carefully roofed in and preserved ; and 
there is reason to believe that the present Noble representative of 
the family is disposed to give even greater external character to a 
building under which the ashes of his ancestors have long reposed. 
The site of this mausoleum is peculiarly striking, occupying the 
centre of the old parish burying-ground, which immediately over- 
hangs the river. 

The character of the Chancellor is given by Crawford in his 
" Lives of the Officers of State," as " by a person of honour 
and great probity, who had very good access to know. That he 
had the reputation of a very wise man ; behaved himself very well 
in his function, and appeared equal to it, and carried himself so 
moderately, both in Parliament and council, that he did his master 
much service, and preserved himself in the good opinion of the na- 
tion, — a favour very few other men in any high trust at that time 
were indulged with." 

Although no inscription is to be found on the monument, an 
epitaph, by Dr Arthur Johnston, is given by Crawford. 

About a quarter of a mile south from this spot, some small 
vestiges of the old Castle of Kinnoull remained at the date of the 
last Statistical Account, but which have now disappeared, the site 
being occupied as an orchard attached to one of the many villas 

 A curious anecdote, strikingly characteristic of the resoluteness of the chan- 
cellor in maintaining the high privileges attached to his office, is recorded by Sir James 
Balfour in his Annals of Scotland. It appears that the King, in a letter to his Privy- 
council, had commanded that the Archbishop of St Andrews, as primate and metro- 
politan of Scotland, might have the precedence of the Lord Chancellor, "and so, con- 
sequently, before all others; wich, notwithstanding, the Lord Chancellor Hay, a gal- 
lant stout man, wold never condescend too, nor even suffer him to have place of him, 
doe quhat he could, all the dayes of his liffetime. I remember continues Sir James 
that King Charles sent me, the day of his coronatione, in the morning, in Ao. 1G33, 
to show the chanceler that it wes his will and pleasure, bot only for that day, that he 
wold ceed and give place to the archbishope; bot he returnid'by me to his Majestie 
a werey bruske anssuer, wich wes, that since his Majesty had beine pleased to conti- 
new him in that office of chanceler, wich, by his meines, his vorthey father, of happey 
memorie, had bestowed upone him, he was redey, in all humility, to lay it doune at 
his Majestie's feete ; bot, since it wes his royall will, he should enjoy it with the 
knowen praevilidges of the same, no preist in Scotland should sett a foot befor him so 
long as his blood was hotte." The King finding his chancellor immoveable, and his 
own somewhat disingenuous proposal thus thwarted, seems to have been in no good hu- 
mour when, on hearing the result of the conference, he replied, " Weel, Lyone, letts 
go to bussiness. I will not meddle furder with that olde cankered gootishe man, at 
quhose hands there is nothing to be gained bot soure wordes."

with which the river side is studded. The only memorial of its 
existence preserved, is the name given by the proprietor to his re- 
sidence, Castle Bank. 

At Balthayock, the seat of a branch of the ancient family of 
Blair, are the remains of a castle, bearing marks of great antiquity, 
and supposed to have belonged to the Knights Templar. It con- 
sists of an oblong tower of about 50 feet in height, and the sides 
52 and 37 feet. The walls are still entire, and of prodigious 
thickness. Its position is very commanding, cresting the top of 
a deep ravine, which the frowning mass, as seen from the Carse 
of Gowrie, appears to overhang. The present mansion-house of 
Balthayock,which stands within a few feet of the tower, had 
been built at different periods, and is also of considerable antiquity. 
The more modern part bears the date 1578, while that to which 
it is attached is supposed to be of a date about two centuries ear- 
lier. There is nothing striking in the character of the edifice 
beyond the substantialness which marks buildings of that period. 

Modern Buildings. — The principal modern buildings besides 
the church and Murray's Asylum, afterwards to be noticed, are 
the mansion-house of Inchyra — a very handsome edifice of po- 
lished ashlar work, and in the Grecian style; and Bellwood, oc- 
cupying a very striking position on the face of the hill of Kinnoull 
fronting Perth. The other mansion-houses in the parish are Mur- 
rayshall, and Barnhill, or Woodend. 

Bridge of Perth. — So far back as 1329, a bridge connecting 
Kinnoull with Perth appears to have been constructed. In 1573, 
this erection was partly swept away. Again, in 1582, " the down- 
falling of five bowis" arches is recorded. In 1589 the " bra 
trein pillars of the brig" appear to have given way ; and from 
that period being " ready to fall without help," it continued under 
repair, and a considerable portion of it was built anew, until, in 
1617, the work was supposed to beat last substantially completed. 
But only four years thereafter 1621 " it was hailly dung down, 
excepting only one bow thereof standing." 

Strange to say, all after attempts to renew the fabric seem to 
have failed for a century and a-half, during which long period the 
only communication across this — one of the most frequented passes 
in Scotland — continued to be carried on by means of ferry-boats. 
At length, in 1766, the foundation stone of the present handsome 
structure, as planned by Smeaton, was laid by Thomas, eighth 
Earl of Kinnoull, and the work completed on the 13th of Novem-

ber 1771, at an expense of about L. 27,000. To that patriotic 
nobleman's exertions it may well be said to owe its existence ; for 
not only was it commenced under his auspices, but a fund for its 
completion actually secured, by his Lordship's generous pledge of 
no inconsiderable part of his private fortune. From the substan- 
tial character of the building, and the scientific principles upon 
which it is constructed, it promises to afford a lasting monument 
of the skill and taste of its able architect, while the memory of its 
chief promoter will continue to be associated with the manifold ad- 
vantages, not to Perth and its neighbourhood only, but to the 
country at large, which it has been the medium of conferring. It 
consists of ten arches, the clear water-way being 590 feet, and its 
extreme length 906 feet. It has often, of late years, been severely 
tested at the breaking-up of the ice in the river, when several of the 
arches have occasionally become nearly gorged by the gigantic 
masses which continued to accumulate on its upper side. Not- 
withstanding the tremendous pressure, it stood, as " still unshaken 
and unscathed it stands." Repeated proposals have been of late 
years made to widen the carriage-way — an improvement called for 
by the great increase of traffic ; and it is now understood there is 
an immediate prospect of such a plan being adopted as, without 
disfiguring the structure, will not only effect this object, but afford 
a wider space for foot-passengers. 

Bridgend. — This village, or rather suburb, which, before the 
new bridge was built, consisted chiefly of a few cottages occu- 
pied by the boatmen employed on the ferry, has so increased, 
as now to contain about four-sevenths of the population of the 
parish. It extends almost continuously from the church to the 
southern boundary of the parish of Scone, a distance of nearly 
three-fourths of a mile, the bridge being nearly equidistant from 
these two points. This district of the parish, like that stretching 
from the church towards Baronhill on its southern extremity, is 
richly studded with villas, which, from the striking position many 
of them occupy, whether on the river side, or on the rising grounds 
towards the north and east, contribute in no small degree to the 
picturesque beauty of the landscape which bursts upon the eye, 
when Perth and its environs are first seen on approaching them 
from the south. The Earl of Kinnoull is superior of the village, 
and in his Lordship's charter, it is styled the burgh of Kinnoull, 
with certain rights of markets, fairs, &amp;c. but which have long since 
gone into desuetude. The houses, streets, and roads in and about

Bridgend are lighted with gas; and to this district of the parish 
are extended the other benefits of the Police Act lately obtained 
for Perth. 

III. — Population. 



The population of this parish, as returned in 1 755, was 

1795, 
1801, 
1811, 
1821, 
1831, 
1841, 



1163 
1465 
1927 
2431 
2674 
2957 
2870 



The most remarkable period of increase is seen to be between 
1795 and 1811, the increase being at no less a rate than 66 per 
cent. ; while, by the census taken in 1821 and 1831, it is about 10 
per cent, at each of these periods. The erection of the bridge in 
1771 may be stated to be almost the sole cause of this large 
and progressive increase which has taken place in Bridgend and 
its neighbourhood. A decrease of nearly 3 per cent, is for the 
first time observable in 1841 ; and this is to be accounted for 
by the depression in trade and manufactures, which has been felt 
here as elsewhere, since the date of the former census. Hence, 
not a few families have recently emigrated, and no less than 77 
dwellings in the parish are at present uninhabited. There is no 
public work or manufactory in the parish. 

The population in 1841 is reported as thus distributed :

Births, Marriages, 8fc. — It needjscarcely be remarked, that the 
following averages, given from the session records, afford no satis- 
factory conclusion, especially in a locality so closely connected with 
Perth. The yearly average number of recorded births for the last 
seven years, is 40 ; of burials no register is kept beyond the mort- 
cloth book, which records 30 ; proclamation of banns, 24. 

Number of illegitimate births during last three years, 5 ; insane 
persons in the parish, 2 ; fatuous, 2 ; blind, 2. 

IV. — Industry. 
Almost every variety of soil is to be found in the parish ; and

such is the improvement of late years in its culture and manage- 
ment, that very few spots remain in which the best systems of hus- 
bandry are not practised. The latest improvement introduced is 
that of tile-draining.

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land may be stated to be 
from L.2, 5s. to L.2, 10s. per acre; but in the central part of the 
parish, i. e. in the immediate neighbourhood of Perth, from L.5 
to L.10 per acre is readily paid ; and along the bank of the river, 
grounds for villas have of late years been sold at no less a rate 
than L.1000 per acre. 

Rental of the Parish. — The old valued rent of the parish is 
L.4775, 18s. 6d. 

The real rental, as made up in 1823, and by which the assess- 
ment for building a new church was regulated, was declared to be 
L. 12,303; but the rents both of lands and houses having since 
considerably fallen, perhaps L.10,000 should be now substituted. 
In this sum, the rent of the salmon-fishings in the parish is in- 
cluded. 

Nurseries. — So far back as the year 1767, a nursery was form- 
ed here, on the east bank of the Tay, by Mr Dickson of Hassen- 
deanburn, in Roxburghshire. He was soon thereafter succeeded 
by his brother, Mr William Dickson, who, for the long period of 
sixty-three years, continued to conduct this extensive establish- 
ment in a spirit of enterprize and improvement, and with a good 
taste, which not only made his professional name well known 
throughout the island, but insured him a wide field of demand 
for those endless varieties of nature's productions which he was so 
successful in rearing. Since his death in 1835, its various de- 
partments have been conducted in the same spirit, and even on a 
more enlarged scale, under the direction of his nephew, who had 
for many years taken an active part in its management. These 
grounds now extend to not less than 60 acres : and from their lie, 
their natural and artificial shelter, and the variety of soils which 
they contain, it is difficult to conceive a situation more adapted, 
whether by nature or art, for every possible purpose to which such 
establishments are sought to be appropriated. Its giving employ- 
ment to between 70 and 80 individuals, may be mentioned as not 



942 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the least important of the advantages which it confers on the pa- 
rish and neighbourhood. 

At the northern extremity of the village of Bridgend, another 
nursery, containing about eight acres, has within these few years 
been formed. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Mr Lewis Dunbar was translated from the 
parish of Dunning, in the presbytery of Auchterarder, to Kinnoull, 
7th November 1782, and died there on 22d February 1829. The 
present incumbent was translated from the parish of Maderty, in 
the presbytery of Auchterarder, and admitted minister of Kinnoull 
on 24th September 1829. 

The former church of Kinnoull, rebuilt in 1779, accommo- 
dated only 400 sitters; and although in 1795, the last incum- 
bent complains, that even then, it was " much too small," it con- 
tinued down to the year 1826, without addition or enlargement, the 
population still continuing steadily to increase, and nearly one- 
half of those connected with the Establishment being thus neces- 
sitated to seek accommodation in the various churches of Perth. 
In that year, however, the present handsome and spacious struc- 
ture, in the Gothic style, from a plan of Mr Burn, was erected 
within a few hundred yards of the old one, at an expense of about 
L. 4000. The internal arrangements, and the chasteness of the 
exterior, are alike creditable to the architect. It contains upwards 
of 1000 sittings. 

The only other place of worship in the parish, is in the village 
of Balbeggie, five miles distant, where an Antiburgher meeting- 
house was built in 1788, but which was taken down a few years 
ago, and replaced by one of more ornate character, containing 
about 350 sittings. It is in connection with the Associate Synod. 
There is a comfortable house for the minister, with garden, offi- 
ces, &amp;c. attached. 

A new manse and offices were built in 1829, immediately after 
the induction of the present incumbent. They occupy a very fa- 
vourable position on the rising ground above the Tay, command- 
ing a view of a considerable stretch of the river. Several old 
trees, planted about a century ago, skirt the buildings. One of 
these, a larch, is rather a picturesque object, from the fantastic 
form it has assumed. 

The glebe adjoins the manse, and contains about 4± acres. It 



KINNOULL. 



943 



may let for about L. 22. There is no grass glebe nor any allow- 
ance for one. _ 

The present incumbent is in possession of an instrument of sei- 
sin, dated 13th June 1726, giving infeftment in these acres to the 
then incumbent, Mr Andrew Darling, for himself and his succes- 
sors in office— rather a rare mode, it is believed, of making good 
the title of a minister to his glebe lands. It follows on a contract 
of excambion between George, Earl of Kinnoull, and Mr Dar- 
ling, and contains a power of resiling, so soon as the minister or 
his successors " shall complain of the quantity of his glebe, and 
desire to have the same augmented." 

The stipend was in 1835 augmented to 124 bolls, 3 firlots, 3 
pecks, i lippie of barley ; 129 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks, If lippie 
of meal. L. 42, 10s. 2\d Sterling; and L. 10 for communion 
elements. A small part of the money stipend, which is laid on 
the feuars of Bridgend, has hitherto been lost to the present in- 
cumbent, from the difficulty of apportioning it. 

The proportion of the population belonging to the Establish- 
ment, as given up to the Royal Commissioners in 1836, was stat- 
ed to be about 2060 ; belonging to other denominations, 780 ; 
not known to belong to any, 160. But in this last number were 
included 91 patients in the Lunatic Asylum ; and the remaining 
69 included the children of those who were not members in any 
church. The difference in the above proportions since that period 
is so trifling as to be scarcely perceptible. 

There are eight Episcopalians in the parish, and three Roman 
Catholics. 

From the circumstance, before noticed, of so many of the pa- 
rishioners having, for a period of half-a century, been accustomed 
to seek accommodation for themselves and their families, in the 
different places of worship in Perth, it can easily be understood 
that the habit of resorting thither still continues with not a few ; 
and when it is farther considered that, within the last seven years, 
two additional churches, connected with the Establishment, have 
been reared there while the population, both in Perth and in this 
parish, has been rather on the decrease, it is not, perhaps, to be 
wondered at, if the same fluctuations in the attendance of parish- 
ioners are observable here as in other localities similarly situat- 
ed. The partial disruption of the parochial system, which such 
concomitant causes tend gradually to introduce, it is difficult to 
©bviate, and more especially where such a quantum of accommo- 



944 



PERTHSHIRE. 



dation exists in the close vicinity, as is to be found in Perth. Not- 
withstanding, however, this somewhat anomalous state of things, 
and the hindrances thence arising to the working of a scheme 
for supporting its poor, which has been introduced since the 
induction of the present incumbent, the fact of the collections 
being nearly treble the amount of what they were before the 
new church was erected, indicates a quantum of attendance 
throughout the year, as large as can, in the circumstances, be 
expected. The whole population, of all ages, connected with 
the Establishment, residing within two miles of the church, does 
not exceed 1500 ; and of these, from 500 to 550 are hearers at 
Kinnoull ; whilst about 200 attend other Established churches in 
Perth. The number of communicants varies from 420 to 500 
The Lord's Supper is dispensed twice in the year, on the same 
days on which that solemnity is observed in Perth. Occasionally 
a few individuals from the distant corners of the parish join here 
at these times, but the great majority of such, partake of the ordi- 
nance in the churches of St Madoes, St Martins, and Kinfauns, 
where, on account of their distance from their parish church, thev 
seek the benefit of Sabbath-day service throughout the year. 
From 80 to 100 of the parishioners communicate in these churches. 

Education. — The parochial school is well attended by about 
130 scholars on an average ; the salary is the maximum ; and the 
amount of the teacher's fees is about forty guineas annually. His 
emoluments as session-clerk may be reckoned at L. 10; but these 
are still more contingent. There is a good school and school- 
house, with an excellent garden attached. 

The higher branches of instruction are rarely sought for here, 
Perth, with its academy and grammar-school, being close at hand. 
There are three unendowed schools ; one at Bridgend, and two ly- 
ing on the outskirts of the parish, namely, at Balbeggie and Bal- 
thayock ; the latter located in Kinfauns, but within a few yards of the 
Kinnoull boundary. In these districts, much difficulty is felt in re- 
taining the services of a good teacher. A small salary, in addition 
to the scanty amount of school-fees, is required, and endeavours 
are at present employed with a view to secure this object. The 
people may be said to be generally fully alive to the benefits of 
education, and there are few, if any, of their children betwixt six 
and fifteen years of age who cannot read or write. Where pover- 
ty is pleaded or known as the hindrance to bestowing this invalu- 
able boon, the parochial teacher, on the recommendation of the 



K1NN0ULL. 



945 



kirk-session, willingly undertakes the task of instructing such gra- 
tuitously. There are several Sabbath schools in the parish, that 
in the central part being conducted by the parochial teacher and 
the minister, and having upwards of 100 scholars in attendance. 

National Security Savings Banks. — One of these useful in- 
stitutions exists in Perth ; and it is noticed here, on account 
of its benefits being as immediately available to the inhabitants 
of this parish as to the adjoining city, where it has its head office. 
Although established under the sanction of the more recent le- 
gislative enactments, no farther back than 1839, with a capital of 
L. 3032, the sum at the credit of depositors at November 1842, 
amounted to no less than L. 35,254, showing an increase in the 
course of four years of L. 32,222 ; the number of depositors in- 
creasing in the same period from 859 to 2800. These results fur- 
nish evidence of perhaps a greater'proportional measure of success 
than distinguishes any similar institution in the country, that of 
Edinburgh excepted. 

It is conducted under the superintendence of a very numerous 
and highly influential body of trustees and managers, and its be- 
nefits extend to the country as well as t&amp; the city, the branches or 
receiving-houses being six in number. The important fact, that 
it continues to grow in the estimation and confidence of those for 
whose benefit it was specially intended, is proved by the details 
given in last annual report, which make it evident that it is chiefly 
resorted to by. the labouring classes, and is, in truth, what it pro- 
fesses to be, — e  the Working Man's Bank." Notwithstanding the 
late depression in trade and manufactures, the increase on deposits 
during the last year was L.4914. At the same time, there is little 
 doubt that its beneficial operation is in no small degree hindered 
by the number and proximity of licensed alehouses, to which cir- 
cumstance, some measure of the poverty and want of domestic 
economy and comfort here occasionally observable in the families 
of the working-classes, may be traced. The evil has of late been 
sought to be lessened by an annual representation from the kirk- 
session to the Justices of the Peace, at the time of granting li- 
cences. The fact of such endeavours having been encouraged, 
and so far rendered effectual, is gratefully recorded. 

James Murray's Royal Asylum for Lunatics. — To the benevo- 
lence of Mr James Murray, a native of the parish of Perth, the 
public are indebted for this splendid institution, which is ad- 
mitted to be one of the best conducted in the kingdom. A short

account of the events which put it in the power of that individual 
to bequeath the funds for its establishment, may not be uninte- 
resting. 

Mr William Hope, the son of Mr Murray's mother, having 
gone to India in early life, realized in Madras a very large fortune 
as a merchant. Having, by the advice of his physicians, deter- 
mined to return to Europe in 1809, he early, in that year, exe- 
cuted his will, providing handsomely for his wife and four daugh- 
ters, and bequeathing, at the same time, considerable legacies to 
his mother and her two sons. The deed, however, contained 
no provision against the event which afterwards followed ; but 
by a peculiar interposition of providence, when Mr Hope was about 
to embark with his family, he hurriedly, as appears from his will, 
provided, that, in the event of himself and his family perishing at 
sea, his fortune should go to his mother and her sons. On the 30th 
of January 1809, he, with his wife and daughters, embarked for 
England in the Jane Duchess of Gordon. The sad fate of that 
vessel, and of other three Indiamen of the same fleet, is still well 
remembered. Mr Hope and his family were among the hundreds 
who perished in the storm. Neither ships, nor crews, nor pas- 
sengers were ever seen or heard of since the fatal night of the 15th 
of March 1809. Out of this appalling event a succession opened 
up to Mr Murray, which enabled him to endow this institution on 
its present splendid scale. 

The building, which is spacious and handsome, stands on the ac- 
clivity of Kinnoull hill, commanding an immense range of view. Up- 
wards of L.40,000 have been expended on the house and grounds ; 
and latterly, the directors have purchased a farm adjoining, at an ex- 
pense of nearly L.7000. The plan, and indeed the whole of the ar- 
rangements, were designed by Mr Burn, and these may be said to 
have been so contrived as not only to embrace every modern im- 
provement, which is to be found in similar institutionsthroughout the 
kingdom, but to render available the many special advantages con- 
nected with so favourable a locality. The house stands in the middle 
of a park of twelve acres, with its gardens, walks, and shrubberies, 
in which the convalescent patient may seek exercise or amusement. 
A number of verandahs commanding the extensive view before re- 
ferred to, afford him the benefit of enjoying healthful occupations 
in the open air, during the greatest heat of summer, or the most 
inclement weather of winter. While all is sufficiently secure to 
prevent injury or escape, all is free from the gloomy aspect of con-

finement, and there is an air of quiet and of comfort which never 
fails to strike the visitor as pervading the whole arrangements of 
the institution. It was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1827, 
and its management vested permanently in twenty-five directors, 
viz. nine ex officio, four for life, and twelve elected annually. It 
was opened on 28th June 1827, and at present contains 140 pa- 
tients. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Many years ago, the heritors of 
this parish found it necessary to meet the wants of the poor 
by annual voluntary contributions. Finding, however, the burden 
becoming gradually heavier, in consequence of the great increase 
in the population, a fund of about L.170 was uplifted and applied ; 
and, finally, in 1823, it became neeessary to resort to the last and 
least desirable expedient of a legal assessment. The evils arising 
out of this system were soon felt and complained of, and almost 
immediately after the present incumbent's induction, he was urged 
by his parishioners to seek for a renewal of the previous system. 
Some difficulty was experienced in the first attempts to accomplish 
the object. The following pleas continued to be urged, however, 
on the part of the kirk-session : 1st, That the heritors would have 
for the present 1831 to contribute somewhat less than they had 
been in use to pay for the preceding seven years ; 2d, That the 
expense connected with collecting from upwards of 400 individuals 
would be saved ; 3d, That the plan proposed might operate, in 
some degree, as a check upon what seems to have become the 
necessary concomitants of stated assessments for the poor, viz. an 
increase in their numbers and in their demands ; and, 4th, That 
it would at once remove that feeling of dissatisfaction and grudge, 
and even of resistance, which had manifested itself, and lead to the 
revival and enlargement of that true charity which gives not by 
constraint, but willingly. Then, and not till then, was it held to 
be likely that any successful appeal could be made to this Christ- 
ian principle among the parishioners generally. 

The heritors soon thereafter agreed to make the experiment, 
and the results have been such as to encourage its continuance up 
to the present time,— for one and all of the anticipated conse- 
quences have been the result, \st, the heritors themselves conti- 
nue to pay somewhat less than before ; 2d, the expense of collect- 
ing, and of the legal proceedings occasionally required to enforce 
payment, are saved to the parishioners generally,— the minister 
and elders themselves undertaking the work of gathering in the

contributions, whether from heritors or members of other congre- 
gations, or from those who are but occasional hearers in the parish 
church ; 3d, the number of ordinary or stated paupers has consi- 
derably lessened ; and, lastly, the collections at the church door 
have continued considerably to exceed the estimated probable 
amount. Average collections for the three years preceding the 
imposing of assessment in 1824, L.47, 17s. 2|d. ; for the three 
years following, L.29, 9s. 8d. ; for the three years, 1839, 40, 41, 
L.114, 0s. 7d. ; average contributions by heritors for do. L.65; 
do. by parishioners attending other churches, or but occasional 
hearers at Kinnoull, L.23 ; average mortcloth dues, proclama- 
tions, &amp;c. L.8, 15s.; highest rate of annual relief to paupers on 
roll exclusive of those in Murray's Asylum, L.6, 16s. 6d ; low- 
est, L.l, lis. 6d. The average number of ordinary poor is now 
reduced to 20 ; but there is a like number of orphan children upon 
the roll. Occasional relief is furnished to about 25 not on the 
roll. Coals are distributed annually in January to about 60 of 
those receiving permanent or occasional relief. The whole ex- 
pense of management since 1831 had been only L.5 annually, but 
in 1840, the heritors augmented the allowance to the kirk trea- 
surer, which is now L.10. 

It is to be hoped, that nothing may occur to mar the operation 
of this scheme, which has already proved so successful.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JAMES DRUMMOND, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent. — This parish is about 10 miles long and 2 broad on 
an average. It stretches from the river Erne, its northernmost 
boundary, south-west into the Ochil hills, until it joins the parish 
of Milnathort. It is bounded on the east by the parishes of Dun- 
barny, Dron, and Arngask ; on the west, by those of Forteviot and 

 From Notes furnished by a parishioner of Foigandenuy. 



FORGANDENNY.

Dunning ; and on the south and south-west, by those of Forteviot 
and Milnathort. A considerable portion of it, on the south-west, 
is in the county of Kinross ; but by far the greater part lies in 
Perthshire. 

Its whole extent is computed to be about 12,800 acres. 

Topographical Appearances, Sfc. — It naturally divides itself into 
two parts, the lower and the higher ; the former reaching, by a 
gradual ascent, from the Erne to the foot of the Ochils, a dis- 
tance of about a mile and a-half ; and the latter including all that 
part of the Ochils which lies in the parish. The lower part is ge- 
nerally of a rich soil, some of it being the best carse land, and in 
a state of high cultivation, producing wheat and all other kinds of 
grain in great abundance. The higher part is also, on the whole, 
well cultivated ; but its climate being considerably colder, and its 
soil lighter, wheat is seldom grown on it. 

The Ochil hills occupy fully three-fourths of the surface of the 
parish. Hardly any part of these can be said to be rocky, as they 
are all either pastured by sheep and cattle, or regularly cropped. 
They vary greatly in their respective heights, beginning on the 
north side by gentle acclivities, until they reach about 1000 feet 
above the level of the sea, which is the height of the highest hill 
in the parish. 

There is a deep fissure on the boundary which separates this 
parish from Dron, on the edge, of which, it is said, one of the inha- 
bitants was shot in the time of the persecutions under Charles II. 

On the eastern boundary of the parish, and on Lord Ruthven's 
property, there are one or two springs, possessing exactly the same 
medicinal properties as the Pitcaithly wells. 

The river Erne skirts the whole of the northern side of the pa- 
rish. A great part of it also is intersected by the May, a beauti- 
ful mountain stream, which, taking its rise in the upper part of the 
parish of Auchterarder, flows westward through the Ochils, form- 
ing the northern boundary between this parish and Dunning, and 
dividing it in the highest part. 

Geology. — Nearly the whole of the parish, and especially the 
Ochil part of it, is composed of trap. This rock is, indeed, found 
at different depths, and varies considerably in its degree of hard- 
ness, being softer and more brittle where it has approached near 

Forgandenny was one of the eleven prebendaries of the Cathedra of Dunkeld 
and is ranked as the seventh in order. The church was a mer.sal church of that ca- 
thedral, and furnished a stipend for one of its prebends.

the surface and yielded to the influence of the weather. The 
trap seems to overly the sandstone, with one trifling exception, 
throughout the whole extent of the parish ; and in the case 
of this exception, the sandstone strata is found nearly in a ver- 
tical position. Atthat spot, too, the trap has changed the sand- 
stone at the line of junction. The old red sandstone, doubtless, 
might be found in many places by cutting through the trap ; but 
this has never been tried in any part of the parish. In the 
upper parts are to be found beautiful specimens of conglomerate 
in great abundance, the nodules of which are either trap or por- 
phyry. Beautiful specimens of the blue and purple pebbles also 
abound in the decomposed trap. It is a singular circumstance, 
that, in so extensive a parish, and all lying upon rock, there has 
not been discovered any portion of the trap, with one solitary ex- 
ception, sufficiently hard to build even a common dike with. It 
has its uses, however, and these are of no small importance, — being 
excellent for metalling roads, and making drains. 

The only other variety of mineral found in the parish is a thin 
layer of laminar limestone on the lands of Dumbuils ; but, from the 
great distance of coal, and the thinness of the seam, the present 
proprietor, Lawrence Oliphant, Esq. of Condie, has not consi- 
dered it worth working. 

It is stated in the former Statistical Account, that copper had 
at one period been wrought in the wood of Condie ; but no traces 
of this metal have been lately met with. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — The only public characters we have been able 
to discover in connection with this parish were, Sir William Oli- 
phant of Newton, who was King's Advocate in the reign of 
James VI., and at whose instance many of the trials for witchcraft, 
so prevalent at that period, were conducted ; — his grandson had 
the misfortune accidentally to kill his mother, and was obliged, in 
consequence, to fly the country : And Mr James Graeme of 
Newton who, before the Revolution in 1688, was solicitor to James 
VII.. 

In the churchyard, on the south side of the church, there is a 

tombstone bearing this inscription : " Here lies Andrew Brodie, 

wright in Forgandenny, who, at the break of a meeting, October 

1678, was shot by a party of Higlandmen, commanded by Bal- 

lechan, at a cave's mouth, flying thither for his life, and that 

for his adherence to the word of God, and Scotland's cove-

ttanted work of Reformation. Rev. 12, c. 7." The account of 
this deed, which Wodrow gives in his history of the sufferings 
of the Church of Scotland, Vol. ii. p. 484, substantially agrees 
with this inscription. He says, " By an attested account I find 
this year 1678, there was a conventicle in Perthshire, at the hill 
of Caltenachar," supposed to be what is now called Culteuchar, 
one of the Ochils, and belonging at present to Lawrence Oliphant, 
Esq. of Condie, " in the parish of Forgandenny : and upon the 
Lord's day, an officer, with a company of wild Highlanders, came 
suddenly upon them, and, without any orders to dismiss, or essay- 
ing to seize any of them, discharged their pieces among the poor 
unarmed people. By good Providence, there was but one man 
killed — Andrew Broddy, a wright by trade, who lived at my Lord 
Ruthven's gate, in the green of Freeland. He left behind him a 
widow and four orphans." 

The only point in which the record on the martyr's stone, 
and Wodrow's account seems to disagree, is the particular spot 
where the martyr was killed. The stone says it was a cave's 
mouth ; while Wodrow's testimony is, that it was on the hill of 
Caltenachar. The tradition of the parish is, that the event took 
place at a cave, or rather what in this quarter is termed a deigh, 
or dell, on the boundary between this parish and that of Dron, 
and not more than two or three hundred yards from the hill of 
Caltenachar. In all likelihood, in those days, the whole of the 
range extending east to that deigh might be called Cultenchar, and 
Andrew Brodie's murder might be perpetrated at that spot. His 
descendants, some of whom are still resident in the parish, say, that 
after he had been shot, his wife, who was also present at the con- 
venticle, immediately went and covered his body with her scarlet 
mantle or cloak. One of the party of soldiers then came up to her, 
and asked her what she now thought of her husband  To which she 
replied, " More than ever I thought of him." The same thing is 
related of the widow of the poor pious carrier, John Brown of 
Priestfield, in the parish of Muirkirk, whom Claverhouse shot 
with his own hand; but there is no difficulty in supposing that 
these widows might both speak in these terms of their husbands. 

The earliest registers of the parish begin with September 24th 
1654 ; and from that date down to the present time, the ent ries are 
made with great regularity and distinctness. They are not volu- 
minous. 

On the north side of the Ochils, the re is a hill of considerable

height, on which there has evidently been a castle or fortification 
of great extent. The description given of this hill and fortifica- 
tion in the former Statistical Account, is very accurate, and is 
still strictly applicable. " Somewhat more than a mile," or more 
nearly two miles south of the village of Fogandenny, is a place cal- 
led Castle- Law. It is situated upon the summit of a high hill, 
which resembles a low cone. The circumference of its area is about 
500 yards. This spot is defended on all sides by a stone wall, the 
vestiges of which are yet to be seen. These vestiges are of a form 
nearly circular, and the walls seem to have taken their form from 
the top of the hill on which they were built. Besides this wall, 
there are also several outworks, which seem to have been formed 
for defence ; particularly on the south side, where the hill is less 
steep, and the ground below higher, there are three distinct 
mounds of earth parallel to the wall and to each other. Within 
the area of this castle or fortification are the vestiges of buildings, 
which vestiges cannot now be easily traced ; and there was erect- 
ed by a former Lord Ruthven on this spot a sort of half tower, 
part of which is still standing. The top of this hill commands a 
prospect of the county to the mouth of the Tay or the German 
Ocean on the east ; all Strathearn to the Grampian mountains on 
the west ; a great part of Perthshire and Angus-shire on the north 
and north-east ; and the summit of the Lomond hills on the south. 
The general opinion concerning Castle- Law is, that it had been 
a Danish fortification." Another opinion, however, which has been 
much entertained of late, is, that it must have been a vitrified fort. 
I believe some pieces of vitrified stone have been found among the 
immense mass of rubbish which it contains. At all events, both 
the hill itself, and the remains of the fortification, bear a very close 
resemblance to the Castle-Law, in the parish of Abernethy, which 
is allowed on all hands to have been a vitrified fort. 

On the estate of Ardargie, belonging to Mrs Fechney, and 
lying about a mile and a-half south-west of Castle-Law, there is 
a beautifully preserved small Roman camp, which has been so cal- 
led from time immemorial. Its walls and ditches are quite dis- 
tinct, and almost entire. The proprietors have all along prevented 
them from being altered in any way. This ancient encampment 
is situated upon a high sloping bank looking towards the west, im- 
mediately above the May, and commanding a wide prospect of that 
part of the Ochils, and also a view of the great Roman road which 
passed from the Tay to the great encampment at Ardoch. From

its position, it must have been admirably fitted to prevent any par- 
ties from descending in that direction to the adjacent valley of 
Strathearn. Its figure is an exact square, each side of which is 
about 90 yards long. On its south side, it is defended by a deep 
hollow, through which a small brook runs ; and on the remaining 
three sides, by deep trenches. The width of these trenches at 
the top is about ten yards ; their depth, on the sides next the en- 
campment, is about 14, while on the outside it is 10. 

There are the remains of another fortification on what is 
called the Law of Dumbuils, belonging to the estate of Freeland, 
about a mile south-east of the village. This Law is a low craggy 
eminence ; it is elliptical in its form ; the south and west sides, be- 
ing a precipitous rock, form of themselves a natural wall ; while 
on the north and east sides a wall has been formed of very large 
granite boulders, many of which still occupy their original position. 
This Law commands a beautiful and extensive view of the lower 
part of Strathearn, of the north part of the coast of Fife, of the 
windings of the Tay, and of the Carse of Gowrie, all the way to 
Dundee, a distance of more than twenty miles. 

Land-Owners. — The principal land-owners in the parish are, the 
Right Honourable Lord Ruthvenof Freeland; Lawrence Oliphant, 
Esq. of Condie ; James S. Oliphant, Esq. of Rossie ; and Mrs 
Fechney of Ardargie. With the exception of the barony of Struie, 
which holds feu of Stirling of Keir, and which formerly belong- 
ed to that family, and also that part of the parish, containing 
about 1000 acres, which lies in the county of Kinross, and which 
holds feu of the Grahams of Kinross ; the remainder appears to 
have been divided betwixt the houses of Oliphant and Ruthven, who, 
during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, possessed 
large estates in this neighbourhood. About three-fourths of the 
parish still belong to the descendants of these houses.

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish must once have been much larger 
than it has been for at least the last fifty years .f This decrease 

 Of Mr Pilmer we find a very interesting notice in Mr Fraser of Kennoway's 
" Life and Diary of the Rev. Ralph Erskine of Dunfermline." 

« Nor was Mr Gow of Cargil," says the author, " the only clergyman whose cau- 
tion ultimately prevailed against his courage. We may here specify the Rev. Mr 
Pilmer of Forgandenny, as supplying another instance. An intimate friendship sub- 
sisted between him and Mr Wilson of Perth. Soon after the secession, Mr Pilmer 
was seized with an illness that terminated in death. During the time of his affliction 
he was anxious to enjoy much of Mr Wilson's company, who gratified him on this 
point as far as he could. Conversing one day very closely, Mr Wilson hinted to him, 
• Brother, I think you should have stood forth with me, and some others, and borne 
an open testimony against those indignities which you have often lamented, and 
which are so injurious to your Master's cause and interest at this day.' The good 
dying man replied, 1 Yes, brother, I have always been deficient in courage and zeal 
for my Lord and Master, but I hope, by the riches of his mercy, that sin, and all my 
other sins, shall be as the iniquities of Israel, which shall be sought for, and there 
shall be none, and as the sins of Judah, that shall not be found.' "

has arisen chiefly from the small farms being thrown into larger 
ones. 

The population in 1801 was 958 
1811 902 
1821 902 
1831 913 
1841 796 

Of the 796, the present population, about eighty live in the 
village of Fogandenny. The rest are scattered over the rural 
parts of the parish, with the exception of about forty, who live in 
a small village in the Ochils, called Path Struie, and now more 
commonly the Path of Condie. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— About 2000 acres have never been cultivated ; 
although one-half of these, it is supposed, might be cultivated with 
advantage. Mr Oliphant of Condie, who is a very intelligent and 
enterprising agriculturist, has of late years broken up a great deal 
of these waste lands, carrying his improvements to the very hill- 
tops, and has them now laid down in beautiful sheep pasture, and 
enclosed with excellent fences. Two of his tenants in the Ochil 
part of his estate are following his example, and have their ex- 
tensive farms laid down in the same manner. No part of this pa- 
rish is now in a state of undivided common. About 438 acres are 
planted, and about forty of these are covered with natural wood. 
About 100 acres of the lower part of the parish are of rich clay 
land, through which the Erne has cut its way, and formed a low 
bed of alluvial soil, formed by the same process as the Carse of 
Gowrie. 

The rent of the lands in the parish varies from L.3 to 3s. 

The fishings on the Earne are let at about L.10 a year. 

In looking back two hundred years to the quantity of produce, or 
to the value of land, as estimated in 1650, compared with the pre- 
sent time, we do not find that great rise which is exhibited in many 
of the other parishes of Scotland. This is easily accounted for ; 
three-fourths of the parish being hilly, and producing little else 
but grass, in which state it still remains to a great extent, it is 
obvious that it would feed as much stock 200 years ago, as it does 
at present. The difference of value, therefore, can arise only 
from the difference of value of the animal, and not from the num- 
ber. Three-fourths of the parish being admirably suited for 
turnip husbandry, sheep-walks may be carried to the tops of the 

able persons, taking the age from seven and upwards. The annual number of bap. 
tisms was then about 30, and of deaths about 20.

highest hills. This is, in fact, going rapidly forward at present on 
the estate of Condie, under the direction of the present intelligent 
proprietor. At this moment, he has growing, on the summit of 
the highest hill in the parish, as beautiful a crop of turnip as is 
to be seen in any part of Strathearn. Several years ago he in- 
troduced wire fences into the hill part of his property, and has 
already erected six or seven miles of these. He was the first to 
introduce them in this part of the country, and his example is 
now generally followed, not only here, but in many other parts 
of Perthshire. A facility of enclosing has thus been obtained, 
the want of which was the great drawback to systematic improve- 
ment in the upper parts of this parish, as no stones are to be 
found fitted for building dikes or walls. These wire-fences are 
composed of oak, or larch, or ash posts, placed three and four 
yards apart, with five horizontal wires, the whole costing about 6d. 
per yard. 

A great portion of the lower part of the parish has been fur- 
row-drained. These drains have been filled chiefly with broken 
trap ; but drain-tiles are now beginning to be introduced to a 
considerable extent, particularly on the estate of Freeland. 

Fallows, except upon the stiffest clay, have been entirely given 
up, to make way for the growth of potatoes for the London mar- 
ket, which is largely supplied with these from this parish. 

A striking improvement has taken place in farm buildings of 
every description, since the last Statistical Account was published. 
At that period, almost the whole houses in the parish were thatched 
with straw ; but now, every new building is either covered with 
reeds brought from the Carse of Gowrie, or with slates. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The stipend is 12chalders, 2 bolls, 1 fir- 
lot, 2 pecks, 1 5 lippy of grain, two-thirds of which are meal, and 
one-third barley, and L.24 payable in money. This includes an 
allowance of L.5 for communion elements. 

The glebe, including the stance of manse and offices, and the 
garden, is about six acres. Its value is about L.12. 

There are about 180 Dissenters in the parish, chiefly belonging 
to the United Secession body, who have a small church at the 
Path of Condie. 

Schools. — There are two schools in the parish, viz. the parochial 
school, in the village of Forgandenny, generally attended by about 
70 scholars at an average, and another at the Path of Condie. 



FOKGANDENNY.

The latter is an endowed school, in connection with, and under 
the superintendence of, the Church of Scotland. It seems to 
have been instituted shortly after 1663, by an act of the presbytery 
of Perth, dated October 3d 1660, which was afterwards confirmed 
by the Privy- Council in the year 1663, empowering the heritors 
to uplift the vacant stipend of 1659, and appropriate it to the 
formation and endowment of a school at the Path of Condie. 
The money thus raised is laid out at interest for the behoof of 
the teacher. This sum, however, is small ; but the last incum- 
bent of the parish, Mr Willison, bequeathed a small field for its 
support, which, with a house upon it, yields L.7, 10s. annually. 

The parochial schoolmaster's salary is the maximum ; and the 
probable amount of fees paid to him yearly is about L.35. His 
other emoluments arise from the office of session-clerkship. 
" Both of the above schools are very efficiently taught. The 
teachers have adopted the most approved modern methods of in- 
struction. 

There are also two Sabbath schools in the parish, which are 
attended by 70 or 80 children. 

Poor. — During the last six years, there have been collected for 

the poor the following sums : — 

For 1836, . L.30 6 1 

1837, . 29 5 2

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JOHN MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 



f. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The word Dunkeld -f is derived from three ancient 
British words, Dun, "a stronghold" and Kaled and in, "a rough 
mountainous country" \ By joining these words together we have 
Dun-kaled-hii " the stronghold of the rough mountainous country ;" 
— or, the stronghold of Kaledin. 

The letter C in the ancient British language was very frequent- 
ly used as K ;§ and hence the word Kaledin came to be written by 
historians Caledin, Calidon, and Caledon.|| 

Prior to the fifth century, the Caldones or Caledonians had a 
stronghold situated, it is supposed, upon a knoll called the King's 
Seat, at the entrance of the vale of Atholl, near to the city of Dun- 
keld. The stronghold, from its position, had the effective com- 
mand of the passes leading into Atholl. It appears to have been 
at the time an important feature in the country, for Hollingshed, 
in speaking of the sanguinary battle of Monteith, between the 
Scots and Picts, adds, for geographical direction, that the field of

f Though the city of Dunkeld and the parish of Dowally are now commonly con- 
sidered as forming one parish, yet the statistical circumstances of each differ so wide- 
ly as to justify their being noticed separately. 

£ Camden in his Britannica says kaled signifies hard, and the plural of it is kale- 
dion, from which comes the word Caledonia, that is, a people hardy, rough, uncivi- 
lised, as northern nations in general are. Dr Macpherson, in his Critical Disserta- 
tions on the Caledonians, p. 26, says, that kaled in both the ancient British and Gaelic 
languages signifies hard. In both these languages in or yn signifies a country. From 
the monosyllable in comes the diminutive innis, which, in the Welsh and Gaelic, is 
of the same import with the English word island. By joining kaled and in together 
we have kaledin, signifying a rough mountainous country, which is exactly the signi- 
fication of Alba, the only name by which the Highlanders distinguish Scotland to 
this day. See also Bullet's Memoires sur la Lang. Celt, under the word kaled.

|| Caledon in ancient writers is spoken of only as a division of Scotland. The 
Roman writers added their Latin termination ia to the word Caledon ; hence Cale- 
donia. Camden says that the word Caledonia was latterly applied by the Romans to 
the whole of Scotland.

•engagement, although near to the county of Stirling, was " not 
fane from Calidon Castell, otherwise called Dunkeld." In the 
sixth century, King Conal built a monastery for St Columba, 
where he and Kentigerne resided for six months. For greater se- 
curity to them, and to the religious men who should come there 
to reside and teach, it was built near to that stronghold. The 
followers of Columba, from their purity of conduct, soon acquired 
considerable influence, and were enabled to give protection to a 
fixed or permanent residence. From that time dwellings increas- 
ed around the monastery, the locality grew into importance, and 
derived its name from the Dun or stronghold of Kaledin or Ca- 
ledon. For some ages subsequent to 848, it would appear, that 
the religious establishment of Dunkeld formed the primacy of 
Scotland, until it was supplanted by St Andrews, f 

The word Dunkaledin is found spelt in Camden and other ancient 
writers Dunkelden, and by innovation is now pronounced Dunkeld.J 

The late Principal Baird, in the former Statistical Account, 
makes it appear, that Dunkeld derived its name from the Gaelic 
words dun chalden, " the hill of the hazels." Such was the de- 
rivation given by Dr Buchanan, the Scottish historian. § Dun- 
keld, however, is surrounded on all sides by hills, and hazel grew 
on almost every hill in Scotland, therefore dun chalden might 
apply to every place in Scotland where there was a hill covered 
with hazel-trees. Dr Macpherson|| says, that, had Dr Buchanan 
properly considered his native tongue, he would have found that 
there was no such word as calden to be met with in the Gaelic 
language. The Gaelic for a hazel-tree is calltuinn ; therefore,

t Little Dunkeld parish was originally Dunkeld, the minor charge. Within its bounds 
various clergy officiated. They presided over the chapels of Inver, Inchmagrano- 
chan, Logynallochie, &amp;c. The city of Dunkeld, being the site of the cathedral, and 
the residence of the bishop and other dignitaries of the church, was the major charge. 
The two Dunkelds are separated by the river Tay, and are stvled in the locality lit- 
tle and Mucklc Dunkeld. 

§ A number of sensible people still assert, that the hazel-hill, meant by Dr Bu- 
chanan, is Stanley hill, within the Atholl pleasure-grounds ; and that from that hill 
the word Dunkeld is positively derived. Anciently, that hill was a small insignifi- 
cant knoll, where the town's children amused themselves in wrestling It was a 
bare sandy knoll, and it was graphically called by them " Shawkee Hilf" In 1730 
James, Duke of Athole, heightened the knoll at very great expense, and formed it 
with military slopes, like a German fortification. As a specimen of the taste of a 
former age, it is a curiosity. This artificial mound, the Duke called Stanley Hill, 
after his mother. Lady Emily Stanley. The village of Stanley, in Redgorton, derives 
its name from the same source. 

|| Critical Dissertations, p. 24. 

II Calden appears to be a mis spelling of kaledin or caledin. By clothing the word 
according to the rules of the Gaelic language, with the letter h for the genitive case, 
the Doctor has created the new word chalden.

according to Dr Buchanan, the proper Gaelic derivation should 
have been Dun-challtuinn not Dun-chaldcn. 

Extent and Boundaries. — Dunkeld, with the enclosed pleasure- 
ground, is somewhat of a semicircular form, about 1 mile in 
circumference, and about three-fourths of a mile in diameter. It 
is surrounded by high hills on the east, west, and north, and skirted 
on the south by the river Tay. 

Dunkeld lies about fifteen miles to the north of Perth, and at an 
elevation of 130 feet above the level of the sea. It is bounded 
on the west by the parish of Dowally ; and, with the exception 
of the site of the cathedral church and part of the town, the 
ground lies within the parish of Caputh. 

The boundaries of Dunkeld as a parish, properly so called, are 
not only limited, but not very easily ascertained. As Dunkeld 
was the Bishop's see, and the service of the cathedral was per- 
formed by his chaplain, or by some of the beneficed clergy in the 
neighbourhood, it was not, during the time of the bishops, thought 
necessary to constitute it formally a parish. In fact, it does not 
appear to have been done. It is not entered as a parish in the 
county cess-books. What might be called the parish quoad ci~ 
vilia can be no more than what was formerly included within the 
boundaries of the old city of Dunkeld. It is said that the ca- 
thedral church stood about the centre of the old town. In 1689, 
the city, with the exception of the cathedral and three houses, 
was reduced to ashes by the adherents of James VII. It is im- 
possible now to state what were the boundaries of the old city, or 
even to name the extent of ground they embraced. The last 
Statistical Account says, that the houses and gardens to the west 
and north-west of the cathedral occupied a space extending to 
about five acres, and that that portion of the town was never re- 
built. In 1690, the present town was built to the east of the ca- 
thedral. There is a small burn called the Ketlochy or Catlochin, 
contained in a common sewer which runs through the town. On 
the west side of that burn, the properties are, by the title-deeds, 
described as lying not within the parish, but within the city of 
Dunkeld. On the east side of it, the properties are titled to be 
lying within the parish of Caputh. 

Dunkeld is not a parish, properly so called, but, as an ecclesi- 
astical parish, it consists of two parts,— the city of Dunkeld, and 
that part of the city, within the parish of Caputh ; the former

quoad sacra. 

By the form of the presentation to the minister, he is presented 
to the united churches of Dunkeld and Dowally. At neither place 
is there a manse and glebe ; but he receives a pecuniary equiva- 
lent. From the circumstance of presenting to the united churches, 
the people, in common speech, though erroneously, have, for the 
last century, called Dunkeld the parish of Dunkeld ; and, under 
the Reform Act, proprietors in the town of Dunkeld, in claiming 
a right to vote in the county, describe their property as lying in 
the said city, and within the united parishes of Dunkeld and 
Dowally. 

At what period the cathedral church of Dunkeld was united to 
the church and parish of Dowally is not known. 

Topographical Appearances.—The situation of Dunkeld is very 
remarkable, being surrounded on all sides by hills of great height 
and of diversified forms. Travellers, from the general appearance 
or the place, have very graphically compared it to a punch-bowl. 
rom the position and natural advantages of the ground, it must 
anciently have been a valuable encampment of our warlike ances- 
tors. It is seated at the entrance of the vale of Atholl and 
htrath-braan, and at the outlet leading from Dunkeld by Birnam 
to the opening or pass of the Grampians, which overlooks the val- 
ley where Orrea, one of the five Pictish towns, was situated. The 
immediate hill to the east of Dunkeld, called Newtyle, commands 
the whole of the Stormont, and a magnificent view of the valley of 
Strathmore. The other surrounding hills furnished posts for 
earning the advance of an enemy, and affording time to the camp 
below to arrange the proper place where to meet and give them 
battle. In the year 138, the Romans encamped east of the Gram- 
pians, within six miles of Dunkeld, but never ventured within the 
fastnesses of Atholl. 

Dunkeld appears to have been, at one time, eovered with water 
to a great height. The surface of the ground to the eastward is 
quite a level, but to the westward it is irregular, and, in many 
places, presents very singular forms, which can only be attributed 
to the violent action of the waters. 

With the exception of the site of the present town of Dunkeld 
the whole vicinity is converted into pleasure-grounds 

rounding alpine scenery. g Dunkeld and its bridge, and the sur.

The city of Dunkeld, subsequent to 1690, formed one street, 
from the cathedral to the top of the hill on the eastward, by which 
hill the traveller had to descend to the town. The old residence 
of the Atholl family in Dunkeld was built to front this old ap- 
proach to the city, and the double rows of trees which lined the 
access to the mansion are still standing. After the erection of the 
Dunkeld Bridge in 1809, the town completely changed both 
its form and ancient appearance. The great north road from 
Perth to Inverness was made to intersect the town, and a new 
street of handsome buildings was formed, in a line with the bridge. 
In the old part of the town, near to the cross, the weekly cattle 
markets are held, and all imported vegetables, &amp;c. are sold. A 
small yearly assessment on the inhabitants repairs the streets ; but 
there is no assessment for lighting the town during winter, which 
is a great desideratum. There is no gas-work ; no public green 
for bleaching ; and no ground for public amusements. The clean- 
ing of the streets is paid by the sale of the sweepings. The inha- 
bitants at one time intended to avail themselves of the act of 
Parliament termed Loch's Act, for the better management of the 
town ; but, on a representation to them, that it was not a burgh 
of barony, but only a portion of the barony of Dunkeld, that 
movement terminated. The police of the city is at present regu- 
lated by a magistrate, deputed by the Duke of Atholl, who is the 
hereditary bailie, in place of the Bishop of Dunkeld. The salary 
of the Bishop's bailie is L. 40 Scots, payable out of the Bishop's 
rents. 

The city is now built in the form of a cross. Its extent is not 
perceived by a stranger until he reaches the centre of the Dun- 
keld Bridge. At that point he has a full view of the town. Its 
cathedral church is here displayed in a picturesque and favourable 
point of view, relieved by the deep back-ground of the richly wood- 
ed pleasure grounds of Dunkeld, above which rises the hill of 
Craig-y-barns, whose varied and picturesque outline, with its sides 
richly clothed in wood, forms the chief object in the landscape, 
while the extreme distance is constituted by the long woody ridge 
of Craig-vinean. Perhaps, however, the most striking feature of 
this picture consists in the river Tay. As it retires from the eye in 
a prolonged and varied perspective, silent, smooth, and dark, its 
source seems lost in the deep woods and rocky recesses of the 
lofty hills by which it is overshadowed ; while, on the other ham, 
trees of endless variety skirt its margin, often feathering down into

the dark water, and blending with their own reflections so as to 
conceal its boundaries. 

About a century and a half ago, the capacity of the grounds 
which now form the Dunkeld park was neither understood nor va- 
lued. The great improver of the grounds was John, the last Duke 
of Atholl, one who never saw a difficulty in his gigantic undertak- 
ings. In all his improvements he combined utility with ornament. 
Limited though the grounds are, the Duke so planned them as 
to have a home farm, grass parks, an extensive garden, ornament- 
al walks, picturesque carriage drives, American gardens, and a 
lawn, all within the inclosures. In appropriate spots he planted 
different kinds of wood, which now enhance the varied beauty of 
the grounds. In every walk the stranger can take, he sees before 
him variety without confusion, and ornament without the least ap- 
pearance of design. So often have the beauties of the Dunkeld 
Park been described by pen and pencil, to lengthen this account 
by enlarging upon them would be useless. As one of the evi- 
dences of their popularity, however, it may be stated, that, from 
1815 to 1S42 inclusive, the grounds have been visited by about 
60,000 persons of all ranks; nearly 4000 of which number were 
foreigners. 

It may be observed, that many persons content themselves with 
wa.kmg over the pleasure-grounds to the hermitage or waterfall, 
and back. This, however, is but a small portion of the beauties 
of Dunkeld. To see the place properly, the visitor requires to 
spend two or three days, and visit the summits of Newtyle, Craio-.y. 
barns, Craigvinean, and Birnam, where he will see landscape °and 
alpine scenery nowhere to be surpassed in Britain. 

Within the pleasure-grounds to the north-west of the cathedral 
are the two noted larches, the first that were introduced into 
Britain. They were brought from the Tyrol by Menzies of Cul- 
dares ,n 1738, and were at first treated as green-house plants 
I hey were plan ted only one day later than the larches in the Monzie 
gardens near Crieff. The two Dunkeld larches are still in perfect 
vigour, and far from maturity. The height of the highest is nearly 
DO teet, with girth in proportion. 

A little to the east of the two larches stood the old residence 
of the Atholl family ; and to the west, stands the new house in the 
course of erection. At the death of Duke John in 1830 the 
operations ceased, a mournful dispersion of the work people in 
stantly took place, and from that hour not a stroke has been heard

-among the walls. Two floors of this noble edifice are nearly fi- 
nished, as well as a gallery 96 feet long, besides an elegant pri- 
vate chapel, a spacious staircase, and several noble Gothic win- 
dows, which were to have been emblazoned with all the family 
shields and quarterings, carved in stone. The walls have been 
temporarily covered for protection. 

In this neighbourhood, it is a singular coincidence, that the twin 
houses of Dunkeld and Murthley have both lost their founders, 
and have remained ever since unfinished. 

Climate. — Dunkeld and Dowally are, generally speaking, very 
healthy, but more particularly the town of Dunkeld. Fever is 
comparatively very rare, though it is not uncommon in neighbour- 
ing towns of the same population. It has been supposed, from 
the abundance of wood about the town and its neighbourhood, that 
Dunkeld would, in all probability, become more liable to disease, 
and to fever in particular. This supposition has not hitherto been 
borne out, for since the late Duke of Atholl extended his immense 
plantations, both here and in other parts of his estates, disease has 
become notoriously less frequent. In proof of the situation of 
Dunkeld and its neighbourhood being healthful, it may be men- 
tioned, that it is often recommended by physicians as a suitable 
summer residence for invalids. Many instances of longevity might 
be mentioned. About half a century ago, a friendly company oc- 
casionally met, which was called the Eighty-four Club, where no 
member was admitted till he had attained that age. The meetings 
are said to have been characterized with fun and good humour. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geological character of Dun- 
keld and Dowally is extremely simple. The limits are confined 
to about ten miles of the northern side of the valley of the Tay. 
Of these, the rocks in situ are exclusively of the transition clay slate, 
nearly devoid of simple minerals, and only remarkable for the sin- 
gular contortions into which the strata, or rather laminae, have been 
twisted, previous to their becoming indurated, which has given the 
blocks of stone much the appearance of knotted timber. 

The soils naturally arising from the decomposition of this slate 
are. in general, cold and poor, and seem better suited to the 
growth of timber than for agricultural purposes. The most pro- 
ductive parts of Dunkeld and Dowally consist of those great 
platforms and rounded knolls of water-worn and stratified sand

and gravel with which the whole valley of the Tay has become 
loaded, and which are usually known as diluvial deposits, plainly 
bespeaking the violent action of waters at a much higher level than 
the waters of the Tay could ever have reached. Of these diluvial 
deposits consist the most productive farm-lands. Although these 
gravelly soils are in some parts too dry to be productive, especially 
in dry seasons, yet nowhere can be seen finer pastures, or more 
beautiful woods, than throughout the whole length of Dunkeld and 
Dowally ; and in addition to the more usual varieties of timber 
common to Great Britain, which are all found here in the greatest 
luxuriance, the earliest and finest specimens of the larch which are 
known in the kingdom are to be found around Dunkeld. The vast 
scale on which this useful species was planted by the late John, 
fourth Duke of Atholl, and the truly national object which his 
Grace had in view in so doing, render the subject too important 
to be passed over in silence, in taking a statistical survey of this 
district. 

The only known indication of the more valuable mineral pro- 
ductions around Dunkeld and within this district, is a small vein 
of copper ore in the eastern base of the mountain called Craig-y- 
barns, but which has not been worked. The valuable slate quar- 
ries a little lower down the Tay are in the neighbouring parishes 
n of Caputh on the north, and of Little Dunkeld on the south of 
the Tay. 

Gold in grain has been occasionally found in a sand-bank about 
three miles above Dunkeld, and fully twenty feet above the level 
of the Tay. A few small trinkets were made of it, but the quan- 
tity of gold was so small, and the expense of extracting so great, 
that no attention is now paid to the discovery. 

Pearls, of a coarse kind, but occasionally of good form and co- 
lour, are produced by the species of muscle common in the Tay. 
About half a century ago, the collecting of the pearls was a trade. 
A merchant in London who had contracted to receive all that was 
collected became insolvent, which caused a loss to the inhabi- 
tants who were engaged in the traffic. Since then, the people of 
the place have ceased to collect them. Many of the pearls that 
were collected brought high prices. 

Zoology. — Both Dunkeld and the parish of Dowally are very 
rich in natural productions. 

Of the Carnivora, there is a considerable variety, although they 
are not so numerous as they were some years ago, in consequence

of the war of extermination carried on against them by the game- 
keepers. 

There is one species of the tribe Plantigrade the common 
badger, or Meles vulgaris. This used to be a very common animal 
in the neighbourhood ; but, since the introduction of the wild 
rabbit, it has been hunted down and destroyed, under the idea 
that it was destructive to the young litters. A number, however, 
are still to be seen. 

Of the Digitigrada there are several species. The sanguinary 
polecat, Mustela putorius, Cuv. ; the weasel, M. vulgaris ; and 
the ermine or stoat, M. erminea, are very common, and very de- 
structive to the game and poultry. The elegant and beautiful 
pine martin, M. abietum, Ray, used to be frequently met with, 
but is now, comparatively speaking, a rare animal. The fox, Ca- 
ms vulpes, is now rarely seen in the neighbourhood. 

The common otter,— genus Lutra, Ray, — is still to be ob- 
served about the banks of the river and neighbouring lakes. 
This animal afforded at one time a considerable revenue to some 
of the country people, who, during part of the winter, used to hunt 
it down for its skin. This has now ceased, in consequence of the 
preference given in the market to the skin of the sea-otter. 

Of the genus Felis, the only indigenous species is the common 
wild-cat, Felis Catus, Linn. They were at one time in great num- 
bers, and of great size in the woods around Dunkeld ; but, like the 
fox, they are now rarely to be found. 

Rodentia. — There are numbers of these to be met with. The 
squirrel is so plentiful as to be a nuisance to the nursery and 
seedsmen. The hare and rabbit are common. The alpine hare 
is to be found in great plenty in the upland parts of Dowally. 

Pecora. — Of this order, the only species common in this neigh- 
bourhood is the roe-deer, Cervus capreolus, Linn. About Dunkeld 
:md Dowally they abound to an enormous extent. In the large 
larch plantations of the Atholl family, they are as common as sheep 
on the moors. A stray red-deer, Cervus elaphus, from the Blair 
forest may also be occasionally seen. 

Ornithology.— 0{ the class Raptores there are, the peregrine 
falcon, F. peregrinus, Linn. Although not common, yet it cannot 
be called a rare bird. The merlin, F. JEsalon, Linn/; the kestrel

typical, there are, the sparrowhawk, Accipitcr fringillarius ; the 
©sprey, Pandion haliaetus. During the winter of 1 840, Dunkeld

and Dowally were visited by considerable numbers of the rough- 
legged buzzard, Buteo lagopus, of Fleming ; but they are only oc- 
casional visitants. A beautiful specimen of the honey-buzzard, 
Pernis apivorus of Cuvier, was shot here some years ago. It is 
the only one we have heard of north of the Frith of Forth. 1 he 
stuffed bird is in the possession of the Right Honourable hox 
Maule, Birnam Lodge. . 
The barn and tawny owl, as well as the small short-eared owl, 

are very common. , 

Amongst the Insessores a few of the beautiful kingfishers, Alcedo 
Ispida, are to be seen by the banks of the river in the neigh- 
bourhood of the town of Dunkeld. It is one of the rarest and 
certainly the most highly adorned of all our birds, and yields to 
few of its foreign brethren in lustrous beauty. In winter, the 
cross- bill visits this quarter in great numbers. 

Of the Rasores there are the wood-pigeon in abundance, the 
pheasant, black grouse, and partridge. 

The migratory birds, both summer and winter, visit us in great 
number and variety.

II. — Civil History. 
At a very early period Dunkeld was, from its natural position, 
deemed a place of great note among the Caldones or Caledonians. 

approached near to the place ; but, 
from the many passes and dangerous defiles with which it abounds, 
they never could successfully invade it. After they left Scotland, 
and prior to 500, the inhabitants, to meet the improvements in war, 
built a stronghold, which, in Gaelic, was called Dun-ghael-dhuin, 
and by the Southerns Dun~Kaledin, or Dun-calidon. It is authen- 
ticated by historians, that, about 570, Dunkeld became the abode 
of the Columbans or Culdees. They were a religious body of

■vant. Hence Ciik-de, the servant of God, de being the genitive of Dia, God.

men, by whose labours the character of the inhabitants in the 
northern districts of Scotland was materially improved. Conal, 
King of the Scots, about 570, built a monastery for them near to 
the Castle of Calidon, now called Dunkeld, where Kentigerne and 
Saint Columba, the leader of the order, resided about six months, 
" teaching and preaching to the people of Atholl, Calidon, and 
Angus, who came in great numbers to hear their godlie instruc- 
tions." This establishment was conducted after the original at 
Iona. Over it an abbot ruled, f The followers of St Columba, 
though erroneously called monks, were yet a body of regular 
clergy, whose form of government was essentially Presbyterian, 
To the members of their synod or assemb.y was given the name 
of seniores, or elders, to whom, in their collective capacity, be- 
longed the right of appointing and ordaining those who engaged 
in the ministerial office. To these, when settled in any particular 
locality, was given the name of Bishop, a dignity not different from 
that of presbyter or pastor. These bishops were subject to the 
discipline of the College of Iona, with which they kept up a regu- 
lar correspondence. They taught and preached the truths of the 
Scriptures, but had no fellowship with the Church of Rome.J 
The Columbian institutions were formed for residence, teaching, 
and for worship. They were not only beneficial to the Scots and 
northern Picts ; but were also advantageous to the northern Eng- 
glish, as an asylum from the severities of war. 

The original monastery of Dunkeld, like the Abbey of Iona, 

 Hollingshed, Vol. i. p. 204, and Smith's Life of St Columba, p. 13. Dean 
Mill, in his MS. History of the Dunkeld Bishops, says, that the monastery was 
founded by Constantine III., King of the Picts, " about the year 729, being 226 
years, 9 months, and 6 days after the church of Abernethy was built; others bring 
it the length of 224 years." But Columba died on the 9th of June 597, leaving his 
monasteries firmly settled, a people converted by his labours from Paganism to Christ- 
ianity, and a name for the celebration of every age. Chalmers's Caled. Vol. 1. p. 323. 

t The abbots of Dunkeld were persons of great influence in Scotland. Many of 
them held offices of trust, and figured in several of the bloody scenes of the Scottish 
Government. The Ulster Annals, under the year 865, state the death of Tuathal 
MacFergus, the Archbishop of Fortren, and Abbot of Dunkeld. The annalist mere- 
ly means to speak of the primate by the florid expression of Archbishop. Under the 
year 872, the same annals state the death of Flavertach Mac Murtach, the primate 
of Dunkeld. These notices evince, in opposition to the claims of the Register of St 
Andrews, that Dunkeld long held the primacy of the kingdom. Duncha, the Abbot 
of Dunkeld, was slain at the battle of Duncrub, in the attempt to dethrone Duffi 
Chron. No. 3, Inncs. Under the year 964, the Ulster Annals state, that Crinan, the 
Abbot of Dunkeld, married Bethoc, one of the two daughters of Malcolm II., and fell 
in battle 1045, in an attempt to restore her grandson to the throne. Ethelred, the 
son of Malcolm III., was Abbot of Dunkeld. Crawford's Officers of State, p. 430.

not indeed in the Hebrew, but in the Latin translation. Religion of the Ancient 
Irish, p. 6. They also instructed the people in secular knowledge.

was constructed of wattles, the only materials then generally used 
in the country. Building with stone and mortar was the work of 
an after and more intelligent age. In 729, the monastery was 
rebuilt of stone, but not founded as a new institution, as stated by 
Dean Mill. This institution, however, is neither noticed by Keith 
nor by Spottiswood among the religious houses of Scotland. 

In 834, Brudus, the king of the Picts, summoned all his sub- 
jects who were able to bear arms to meet on a certain day in Ne- 
ther Calidon with a suitable supply of provisions. They mustered 
there in a great body. Hollingshed says, that this army passed 
over the Tay, and marched into the castle of Calidon, previous to 
engaging Alpinus, the King of Scots, at Angus. From this it may 
be inferred that, at that time, the dwellings erected near to this 
castle were so considerable as to have afforded, along with the 
castle, the requisite accommodation for so great a body of men. 
The various attempts of the Danes to plunder Dunkeld, also fa- 
vour the view that the place was not, only extensive, but its monas- 
tery was reputed important and wealthy. About 845, the Danes, 
under their celebrated sea-king, Regner Lodbrog, on their advance to 
plunder Dunkeld, were successfully engaged and defeated between 
Cluny and Dunkeld by Kenneth MacAlpin, who united the Scots 
and Picts into one kingdom.f About 905, the Danes advanced 
a second time, when they successfully plundered the town. 
The extent of their booty is nowhere recorded. Under the reign 
of Kenneth III. they meditated a third attack for a similar pur- 
pose, but they were met at Luncarty by Kenneth, where he 
fought a famous battle and routed them. 

In 848, Kenneth MacAlpin built a church at Dunkeld, from 
respect to the memory of St Columba, wherein he deposited the 
relics of that saint, which had become unsafe at Iona from the 
rapacity of the Danes. The site of this sacred depository has not

think it must not be passed over. The Bishop had marked out and consecrated bur 
rying ground for his people, being much afraid of the pestilence. In the meantime" 
he visited some of the church tenants of Caputh, who had been bad of that disease' 
and gave them such consecrated things as might be of use to them. Next dav he 
caused dip the bones of St Columba in consecrated water, and sent it to them to 
drink by the chancellor. Many did drink and were cured. But there was one for 
ward fellow among them, who said to the chuncellor,  for what does the Bishop send 
us water to drink  I wish he had sent us some of his best ale.' But he and the rest 
to the number of thirty, who refused to drink of the water, died of the P W C and 
were buried in one grave a little belcw the ordinary burving-ground "

yet been discovered by antiquarians. By this act of Kenneth, 
St Columba became the patron saint of Dunkeld and its church.f 

In 1127, the monastery of Dunkeld was converted by David I. 
into a regular episcopate. It has been thought that he expelled 
the Culdees to make room for a bishop. On the contrary, he 
guaranteed to them during life the rights and possessions which 
had formerly belonged to their abbey. The Culdees continued 
to nominate their superior, but a short time, when they were super- 
seded in their elections by the canons regular. 

In 1318, Bishop Sinclair, better known as Robert the Bruce's 
own bishop, built the choir on the site of part of the old monastery, 
— the old abbey church, built by Kenneth, serving as the place 
of worship until the new edifice was finished. As a memorial of 
his having built the choir, he placed on the top of the eastern 
gable a cross ingraille, part of the arms of his family, where it re- 
mained, much dilapidated, until the repairs of 1817, when it was 
renewed. § In the middle of the gable are to be seen several red- 
dish stones, which formed part of the wall of the monastery. Bi- 
shop Peblis, in 1380, glazed the eastern window of the choir, and 
adorned it with several figures painted on fine glass. 

Bishop Cardney, on the 27th April 1406, founded the nave of 
the church, and raised it as far as the second row of arches com- 
monly called the " blind storijs." Bishop Ralston, who assumed 
the mitre in 1447, finished the nave, and began the aisles of the 
cathedral. Dean Mill says, this bishop " had this work so much 
at heart, that he and one or two people of high rank who staid 
with him had a custom of carrying every day out of the quarry of 
Burnbane several burdens of stones." The stones for building 
the choir and cathedral were all of a small size, as they had to be 

 From the preceding foot-note, it would appear that the remains of St Columba 
had been disturbed by some of the early Roman Catholic bishops. — Chalmers's Cale- 
donia, Vol. i. p. 426. 

f The armorial bearings of the town of Dunkeld have been blazoned, with a view 
to the dedication of its church to St Columba, " Sable, a dove argent, holding in its 
beak an olive branch proper ; the shield is surrounded with a ribbon, or, whereon is 
written Caledonia, and in the bottom part of the shield is a thistle proper ; the whole 
is encircled with two palm branches vert." — MS. Cumin. Chal. Caled. Vol. i. p. 435. 

 Dean Mill says, " crexlt in Cathcdralem Ecclesiam. It is questioned whether the 
expression involves a physical or other meaning. It would seem to imply a change 
of physical structure. &amp; 

§ In the centre of the choir the bishop made a burial-place for himself, near to the 
entrance of the chapter house. There was a marble monument over his tomb, and 
a handsome statue of him in alabaster. The statue was either mutilated by the mob 
in 1560, or by the soldiery in 1689. The tomb was lost sight of in the various 
changes which the interior has undergone.

carried on horseback by means of curachs. Roads and carts were 
subsequent inventions. The workmen's wages did not exceed 3d., 
nor that of the labourers, 2d. Scots per day. The mortar was 
carried in baskets on horseback. The cost of a man with a horse 
and baskets, or with a curach, was 3d. Scots per day. In 1460, 
Bishop Lauder finished the cathedral. He built the porch of the 
south gate, and adorned it with several fine images. There is a 
gateway at the western end, of which there is no record. In 1464, 
Bishop Lauder dedicated the church to its old patron, St Co- 
lumba. 

The palace of the bishops stood a little to the south-west of the 
cathedral. It consisted of several long houses of two stories, 
thatched after the manner of the times. For greater security to 
that residence, a castle was erected close to it in 1408. The 
castle contained " a great hall, with vaulted granaries and a lar- 
der," — a precautionary step against any long-continued attack 

 It may not be uninteresting to give, from Dean Mill, a list of some of the or- 
naments presented to the church by the different bishops. In 1406, Bishop Card- 
ney gave a handsome and very valuable mitre and bishop's staff. In 1441, Bishop 
Bruce ' a cope and four vestments of great v;ilue." In 1450, Bishop Lauder pro- 
cured many priests vestments of silk, and a deal of silver work, such as six candle- 
sticks, one cup, two phials, three flaggons, a box for the chrism, a cross, in which 
there is a part of our Lord's cross, a vessel for holding the eucharist of considerable 
weight, and another for the holy water, two instruments for sprinkling the holy wa- 
ter, and two incense censors. There was over against the great altar a piece of paint- 
ing representing the twenty-four miracles of St Colme, and overhead of this, two sta- 
tues of that saint. There were two pillars on which rested two angels, who held two 
candlesticks of fifteen branches, agreeable to what is said in the Revelation of John. 
Each of these branches was suspended by a silken rope. He made a pillar for sup- 
porting the great wax lights at Easter, with a bishop's chair, and a bench for the cho- 
risters. Bishop Brown in 1500 gave various gorgeous dresses, as also a cover for the 
altar of blue and gold. He made a pulpit of brass, divided into four, each division 
of which supported the statue of an Evangelist, and when the Gospel was read, it 
was in that division which answered to the name of the Evangelist which was then 
read. He made a lesser pulpit, which was supported by the statue of Moses behind, 
on which there was a candlestick of three branches. He caused paint the upper parts 
of the pews. He made new the throne of the holy cross, the chancel, the altars of St 
Martin and St Michael. He caused make images of the apostles, and portraits of 
the other saints, to be drawn upon the wall all around. But as to the King's noble- 
men, bishops, andothers whohad been benefactors tothechurch he caused theirfigures 
be drawn upon the wall behind the altar, that the whole quire might, in time of pray- 
ers, have their eyes upon them. He also beautified all the altars with proper figures, 
and for the use of each gave proper vestments to the priests. He bought two great 
bells, — the lesser called George, and the greater St Colme. He procured another 
greater, named Maryford, which he left his successor." A number of the prebends 
contributed vestments and other valuable and weighty silver ornaments. The pre- 
bend of Fungorth gave two chalices, silver gilt, two silver phials, and a pot adorned 
with the image of St Columba, his guardian saint. 

The altars in the church were dedicated, 1. to the Blessed Virgin — " save us from 
the pains of hell." That altar stood to the right of the principal altar; 2. St Mi- 
chael; 3. St Martin ; 4. St Nicholas; 5. St Andrew the apostle; 6. the Innocents; 
7. All Saints ; 8. Stephen the Martyr ; 9. John the Baptist ; 10. St Catherine ; II. 
St John the Baptist ; and the 12. is believed to have been the altar of St Ninians or 
St Salvator.

from the clans. Although no vestige of this edifice remains its 
site is still called « the Castle Close." In 1 508, a wing was built 
to the palace, and adjoining to it a handsome private chapel. Bi- 
shop Brown furnished the palace in 1509, and left the furniture 
to his successors in office. , , 

In 1469, Bishop Lauder built the chapter-house, and also he 
steeple or greater tower of the cathedral. The height of that 
tower is about 96 feet, and its base 24 feet each side. It was at 
one time mounted with small cannon, and occupied, in 1689, by 
the Cameronians in their defence of the town. There is, on the 
west side of the tower, a singular zig-zag rent from the top to the 
bottom, which seems to have been caused by the insufficient foun- 
dation of the north-west corner. In the upper flat of this tower 
is the town clock and six music bells,— the property of the Atholl 
family. The morning and evening bells, to begin, and to return 
from, labour, are rung,-the former at six o'clock, and the latter at 

eight o'clock. . 

It has often been a matter of surprise how any religious insti- 
tution could have existed 1300 years ago in such a spot as Dun- 
keld, and that it should, through so many ages of trouble and 
chanaes of character, have continued to the present day. So far 
as is known, the early clergy experienced little or no annoyance 
from the uncultivated clans within the diocese ; but when the be- 
nefice grew in wealth and importance under the Romish hierarchy, 
the clergy were fearfully harassed. It is pretty well established, 
that, at that period, the clans suddenly, through want of educa- 
tion,' became more attached to the possessions of the bishops, than 
to their religious instructions. Many of the influential barons 
seized such portions as lay near to their own estates, and forced 
the bishops to grant them feudal rights, which they were glad to 
give as the price of peace. At the same time, it is amusing to 
find that, over the superstitious and half-instructed minds of some 
of the savage chieftains, the terrors of the church would occasion- 
ally assert their way. After they had attacked the prelate and 
his vassals with sword and buckler, or stolen his cattle, or burned 
his stack-yard, they would come to the altar in sackcloth, and at 
once implore the forgiveness of Heaven and of his Lordship. 
Once forgiven, they held themselves free to sin again. From 
Dean Mill, we learn that neither the sacred office of bishop, nor 
the sanctity of the church, deterred the clans from attacking the 
prelate in his palace, or within the walls of the cathedral. In 



974 



PERTHSHIRE. 



1407, Bishop Cardney had to fly from his palace, from a band 
of marauders who sought to murder him. Iu 1441, Robert Reoth 
Macdonachie, the progenitor of the Robertsons of Strowan, who 
are to this day still called the clan Donachie, fought Bishop Bruce 
and his vassals more than once, with loss on both sides. Robert 
was a powerful man, and a great scourge to the church. He 
plundered the church lands of Little Dunkeld, within sight of the 
bishop's castle, and fought the church tenants at Auchtergaven. 
After his engagement he appeared at Perth, before the King, 
from whom he received the lands of Strowan for apprehending 
the Master of Atholl. Singular enough, about 400 years after, 
these lands came into the hands of the family, on whose account 
they had been gifted. In 1452, Bishop Lauder, on assuming the 
mitre, found his diocese plundered in every quarter, and was 
obliged to solicit the King's commission as bailie. In virtue of 
his office he imprisoned and hanged the most outrageous. By 
the terror of his authority, he got rid " of an arch robber, Mac- 
bre, his sons, and his whole gang. This man was reckoned the 
most bold and infamous person of his time. The name he took 
was that of the Bishop's Sorner, that is, dne who went about to 
extort money and victuals from the bishop's tenants." The bailie's 
authority, however, seems not to have been much respected by 
the clan Donachie men. On one occasion he imprisoned one of 
them. The chief, on being told of the detention, collected his 
fipllowers, marched to Dunkeld, in order to punish the bishop and 
release the prisoner. They found, on arrival, that the bishop was 
celebrating mass in the cathedral. Regardless of all decorum, 
they entered the church, and threw a shower of arrows at him 
as he stood by the altar, which "obliged him to give over the ser- 
vice, and to take shelter behind some of the timber of the quire." 
It is not recorded how the people in the cathedral or in the town 
acted on that occasion. It appears, however, that the poor bishop 
had to give up his prisoner, and hostilities ceased. A complaint 
was made to the King; but the chieftain being son-in-law of Lord 
Glammis, a court favourite, the matter was hushed. For fear of 
the catherans, the bishop was obliged to remove the synod from 
Tulilum, near Perth, to the church of Dunkeld. Bishop Brown, 
one of the most conscientious of the bishops, had also his share 
of trials. In 1494, he recovered the church lands of Muckersev, 
which had been violently possessed by Sir James Crichton of 
Strathord. On that account, " Sir James, with twelve men, lay

in wait, and set upon the bishop, near the Bridge of Earn, as he 
was on his way to Court with a retinue of 40 people. If the 
bishop and the clergy of his train had not softened them, he had 
surely been cut to pieces by the Servants. However, they parted 
without coming to blows; and, to convince the worldof Sir 
James's bad intentions, the bishop returned to Dunkeld." Sub- 
sequently, both parties were reconciled. This bishop had the 
fruits of his benefice, on their way to Dunkeld, repeatedly carried 
off by bands of robbers, who seem to have defied his vigilance and 
despised his authority. It is said that Andrew, Lord Annandale, 
the then chancellor, favoured the laity in all suits for recovery of 
church lands, where there had been peaceable possession. For 
that reason, the bishop, in his last will, left a peculiar charge with 
his successors to recover, " under his heavy curse if he did it not," 
the church lands of Fordale, unjustly detained by James Fother- 
ingay, who was connected with the chancellor. by personal obliga- 
tions. After the death of Bishop Brown, the Earl of Atholl, 
nephew to James II., called the canons of the church of Dunkeld 
together, and requested them to make choice of his brother, An- 
drew Stewart, as bishop. The canons, from personal fear, una- 
nimously elected him, though he was not in full orders. Pope 
Leo X. rejected the appointment, and nominated the celebrated 
Gaviu Douglas, uncle to the Earl of Angus, the Queen's husband. 
On Bishop Douglas's arrival at Dunkeld, he found Andrew 
Stewart, the postulated bishop, had armed his servants, and had 
possession of the palace and the steeple of the cathedral. He 
retired to the dean's house, to receive the homage of the clergy, 
and while engaged in consultation with them what course to follow, 
he was informed that Stewart was in arms to relieve the palace. 
It is recorded, that at that instant, a shower of cannon shot came 
from the steeple and the palace. The people of rank hurried to 
the bishop's defence. Notice was sent of this transaction to the 
bishop's friends in Angus and elsewhere, upon which there came 
next day such crowds from Montrose, the low parts of Fife, and 
the country round about, that the city of Dunkeld could scarce 
hold them. But, for all their numbers, the prebendary of Alyth 
had laid up such abundance of everything, that there was room 
and provision for all the men and their horses." Stewart not 
being able to relieve his servants who held the palace and steeple, 
retired to the woods. By threat of excommunication, and partly 
by force and stratagem, possession was yielded. Stewart was al-

lowed to retain what he had collected of the bishop's rents, and 
he got the churches of Alyth and Cargill, on paying a small trifle 
yearly to the bishop. After the bishop had obtained peace with 
Stewart and the clans, he set about doing good works. 

The revenue of the bishops of Dunkeld was considerable. 
During the reign of James II., Bishop Lauder got the church 
lands, south of Forth, erected into the barony of Aberlady ; and 
on the north, into the barony of Dunkeld. The bishops had 
four palaces; one in Edinburgh, Perth, Cluny, and Dunkeld. 
Bishop Brown could ride from the Dunkeld palace to the palace 
of Cluny on his own ground, a distance of seven miles, by four 
different routes, — by Cairdney, the Litter, Stenton, and Caputh. 
The different parishes which were subject to the jurisdiction of 
the commissariat court of Dunkeld are given by Keith, p. 186, 
in his Catalogue of the Scotch Bishops. 

The cathedral, which had been erected with so much taste and 
ability, became a noble ruin in 1560, and stands to this day a 
striking picture of the mutability of human opinions. On the 
12th of August that year, an authority, in the handwriting of Lord 
James Stewart, — judging from his signature, — and subscribed by 
him, Argyle, and Ruthven, directed the lairds of Airntully and Kin- 
vaid " to pass incontinent to the kyrk of Dunkeld, and tak doun 
the haill images thereof, and bring furth to the kirk-zayrd and 
burn tham oppinly. And siclyk cast down the altaris, and purge 
the kyrk of all kinds of monuments of idolatyre. And this ye faill 
not to do, as ye will do us singular empleseur; and so committis 
to the protection of God. Faill not, but ze tak guid heyd, that 
neither the dasks, windocks, nor durris be ony ways hurt or broken 
— eyther glassin wark or iron wark." It would have been well 
had this order been literally obeyed, but the demolition was un- 
fortunately carried on with a disposition of mind and temper more 
worthy of reprobation than applause. The cathedral and the choir 
were completely sacked. The windows were smashed, and the 
doors torn from their hinges. For the credit of the mob, it does 
not appear from the walls that fire had ever been applied as one 
of their engines of destruction. Tradition affirms that what these 
lairds had left undestroyed was demolished by the Laird of Caird- 
ney, among whose family papers the original order for the de- 
struction is to be found. This laird unroofed the cathedral, al- 
though one of his ancestors had honourably presided in it as bishop,

whose tomb was and still is one of its attractions, and from whom 
part of his power as laird had been acquired. 

At the Reformation of 1560, the revenue of the Dunkeld 
church was upwards of L. 1600, but the benefice afterwards be- 
came so poor, that the king, as is understood, by an entry in the 
secretary's books, of date 23d October 1G85, had to make a gift 
of L. 100 Sterling yearly to the incumbent. It appears that the 
Episcopalian bishops did nothing towards the repairing of the ca- 
thedral, for, in 1600, Stewart of Lady well repaired the choir, and 
roofed it with slate at his private expense. Although Episco- 
pacy was subsequently supplanted by Presbyterianism, yet there 
is still a Bishop of Dunkeld who regulates the Episcopal worship 
within the united diocese of Dunblane, Dunkeld, and Fife. The 
bishop at present resides in Aberdeenshire, and the Dean of Dun- 
keld in Forfarshire. 

By the Acts of the General Assembly of 1586 and 1593, Dun- 
keld was appointed as the seat of presbyterial meetings, which con- 
tinues to be the place of meeting to the present day. 

In 1647, Sir James Galloway, Master of Requests to James 
VI. and to Charles I. was created Lord Dunkeld.f His grand- 
son James was attainted at the Revolution of 1688, and dying 
about the year 1700, the title became extinct. 

In 1689, Viscount Dundee endeavoured with a Llighland army 
to oppose the Revolution settlement of 1688 in the north of Scot- 
land. With that view, he marched to Perthshire, where he fought 
and died at Killiecrankie. His troops, after the battle, marched 
down and attacked the town of Dunkeld. It was garrisoned by 
the Cameronians, now the 26th Regiment, then a body of raw 
recruits. The battle began at seven o'clock in the morning of the 
21st August 1689, and continued with intervals till eleven o'clock 
at night. The fiercest struggle was made on the site of the pre-

quies and burials of the great: — Assembly of 7 July 1579, Sessio 5. Anent the bur-

sent town. The Highlanders afterwards got possession of many 
of the houses from which they galled the soldiers by their fire. 
To dislodge them, small parties of the soldiers, with burning fag- 
gots, were sent to fire the houses. " Where they found keys in 
the doors, they lockt them, and burnt all within," which raised 
distressing cries of help from those in the fire. There were six- 
teen consumed in one house. The town was burned to ashes, ex- 
cepting the cathedral and three houses where some of the soldiers 
were advantageously posted. The inhabitants found shelter in 
the church. After the enemy retired, the seats of the church 
were carried out, and the defences repaired, in the event of a se- 
cond attack, — which the enemy never made. The Cameronians 
lost several officers, among whom was Lt.-Col. Cleland, the father 
of William Cleland, Esq. the original of the celebrated " Will 
Honeycomb" in the Spectator. After the battle, the dead were 
buried on the south of the cathedral. 

In 1691 or thereabouts, the Atholl family repaired the choir for 
worship at their own private expense. In 1762, Government con- 
tributed L.300 towards a first repair, and in 1815, L.1000 to- 
wards a second repair, to which the Duke of Atholl added L.5000, 
and restored the choir, with some slight variations, to its original 
state, f The cathedral still stands unroofed, and unheeded by 
government. But from time to time it has received such repairs 
from the Atholl family as will prevent it becoming a total ruin. 
The area of the cathedral, once the highly prized cemetery of the 
great, is, with a scrag of ground to the south of it, the only burial- 
place of the inhabitants of Dunkeld. Where the inhabitants in- 
terred their dead prior to 1560, is now difficult to tell. Although 
the cathedral and place of interment are situated within the walls 
of the Dunkeld park, yet access is freely given by the keeper of 
the east gate, at reasonable hours, to every person who have there 
a right of sepulture. 

During the reign of Charles II., an offer was made to erect the 
town of Dunkeld into a royal burgh, but that offer was at the 
time declined. Queen Anne renewed the offer in 1704, which 
was accepted. The requisite charter was prepared, and ready 
for the royal signature, when, as traditionally reported, a dispute

tory of Scotland, Vol. v. p. 268. 

f In lowering the floor of the choir, many foreign, Roman, and Scottish coins 
were found by the inhabitants. One person who had thirty coins,— some Roman, 
sold them to a travelling jeweller for L.l.

arose among the inhabitants as to the expense of the charter, 
which they refused to pay, and the matter was allowed to drop. 
The charter was dated 17th April, and written to the great seal, 
16th, and sealed 20th September 1704. 

In 1745, the Marquis of Tullibardine, on his way from the 
north with the Pretender, took transient possession of the Castle 
of Blair, in the absence of his younger brother, the Duke of Atho 1, 
and spent a short time with the Prince in the ducal palace, which, 
but for him, the Marquis might have called his own. Lord Nairn 
and Lochiel were sent forward to proclaim the Pretender at Dun- 
keld, which they did at the old cross. Neither upon that occa- 
sion, nor on the Prince's resting with the Marquis on their way to 
the south, did the inhabitants manifest much attachment to the 
Pretender, or his pretensions. The Duke of Cumberland, early 
in 1746, made Dunkeld and Blair in Atholl his advanced posts. 
These detachments lived on the inhabitants, plundered the houses 
of the rebels, and committed very wanton excesses. On their de- 
parture, the stations were occupied by the Hessians ; but being 
ignorant of the country, and of the Highland mode of warfare, they 
were daily harassed by the Athollmen. Many well fought skir- 
mishes took place between them near Dunkeld. 

Dunkeld was visited by one of our early kings, William the 
Lion, for deer hunting, it is reported that he took his station for 
shooting the deer, on a small knoll now called the king's seat. It 
is a small terraced hill, on the summit of which is the remains of a 
building and the out-works of an ancient fort. The road which 
runs between that knoll and Craig-y-barns is called the King's pass. 
Mary Queen of Scots also visited the locality for a similar amuse- 
ment. On one of her hunting excursions, she narrowly escaped 
serious bodily injury from the leader of a herd of deer, who ran 
in the direction where she stood, and which she selected contrary 
to the advice of her attendants. For the entertainment of that 
Queen, the then Earl of Atholl employed 2000 Highlanders to 
collect the deer of the central Highlands.f It is traditionally re- 
ported, that Queen Anne, who raised the Marquis of Atholl to 
ducal dignity in 1 703, did subsequent to that year visit the castle 
of Blair, on matters connected with Scotland, and subsequently 

 The old cross was a round pillar, on which was four round balls, supporting a 
pyramidal top. It was of stone, and stood about 20 feet high. The pedestal was 12 
feet square. On the pillar hung four iron jugs for punishing petty offenders. The 
cross was removed about forty years ago.

Dunkeld House. A state room it that castle is still shown as 
Queen Anne's bed-chamber. At a former period, the High Com- 
missioner of Scotland made a formal visit, and was royally enter- 
tained. Many of the present monarchs of Europe have visited 
Dunkeld, and enjoyed not only the Highland hospitality of the 
Atholl family, but have been liberally indulged in all the sports which 
the locality so amply affords. The last royal visit to Dunkeld 
was paid by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in September 
18-12. Her Majesty was received on the boundary of the Dun- 
keld property by a guard of the Atholl men, and conducted to 
the park, where Lord Glenlyon, the heir apparent of the Atholl 
title, received her Majesty at the head of several hundred High- 
landers, and conducted her to the Royal tent. 

Bishops of Dunkeld. — As they are identified with the civil his- 
tory of the locality, it has been considered proper to subjoin a ca- 
talogue of them, so far as they can be collected, from historical 
writers. -f- 

 The royal tent stood on the lawn to the north of the cathedral, which command- 
ed a view of the wild alpine scenery to the west, north, and south of Dunkeld. This 
view is bold, hut it is softened when combined with the mellowed beauties of the 
lawn, and the grey walls of the cathedral. Nature and art here harmonize. 
The tent was appropriately situated for the gratification of royalty, and the lieges 
present. Her Majesty first reviewed the Highlanders, and then walked along the 
line formed by the members of the local Societies, inquiring into the provident ob- 
jects of each body, with which she expressed herself much interested and delighted. 
The Queen, with a select party, afterwards retired to the tent, where a princely lunch 
was served up on gold and silver, with the most choice liqueurs, and Atholl hrose. 
Her Majesty tasted a little of the brose out of Neil Gow's glass. After lunch, the 
officers of the Atholl clan were formally introduced to the Queen, and kissed hands 
in the tent. Several of them at her request danced a set of the Highland reels ; the 
sword dance, which is very intricate from the gradual rapidity of its movements was 
also gracefully performed. Her Majesty, after enjoyinga few hours at Dunkeld, depart, 
ed for Breadalbane. The Honourable Captain Murray, his Lordship's brother, rode 
beside the carriage to the boundary of the Atholl property, in Strathtay, a distance of 
13 miles, giving the names of the places, which Her Majesty carefully noted down. 
The Royal salutes on her arrival and retiring from Dunkeld were fired from Stan- 
ley hill. 

f 1. Cormac, who came out conspicuously in the stage of life Chalmers's Caled. 

Vol. i. p. 429. He was witness to two charters of David I. to the monastery of Dun- 
fermline, along with Robert, Bishop of St Andrews, consecrated 1128. See Keith's 
preface to his Catalogue of Bishops, p. 9. 

2. Gregory is found after Cormac, attesting, between the years 1147 and 1162, 
with Robert, Bishop of St Andrews, several charters of King David I. and his 
grandson Malcolm. Gregory died 1 169 — Chron. Melrose and Fordun. 

3. Richard de Prebenda. Fordun, lib. viii. c. 13, calls him « Capellanus Regis 
Willelmi." He was one of the Commissioners for Scotland in negociating whh 
Henry IT. in 1 174 for the release of King William, at that time a prisoner in Eng- 
land, Fcedera Anglias, t. 1, p. 39, and in 1176 he attended William to a council 

held at Northampton by Cardinal Huguccio Petrileonis, the Pope's Legate. Ho- 

veden, 550. Mill and Keith think he died in 1 173 or 1 174 ; but the facts mention, 
ed prove this to be a mistake. Fordun, lib. viii. c. 13, says he died in 1 178. 

A difficulty occurs as to Richard's successor. Dean Mill says it was Cormac who 
died in 1174. Keith adds nothing in confirmation of such an election, and Dal-

Ancient Chapels.— About 1420, Bishop Cardney built and de- 
dicated a chapel to St Ninian. It stood upon the ground now 

rymplc says Cormac never came to settle at Dunkeld.— Collect, p. 240-5. Suppos- 
ing Cormac to have been the bishop, his successor is another difficulty. Dalrymple 
makes Gregory to be the fourth bishop, but Keith expresses doubts on the subject. 
Mill omits Gregory altogether, and makes Walter to be Cormac's successor. If For- 
dun be correct as to the time of the death of Bishop Richard de Prebenda, which he 
says was in 1 178, Walter would then bo his successor, for his consecration takes place 
in the same year. 

4. Walter de Bidon was one of the Clerici Regis, and afterwards Chancellor otthe 
kingdom. Though elected to the See of Dunkeld, it is said that he died before his 
consecration, and cannot therefore be numbered as one of its bishops. Mill says that 
he was consecrated in 1 1 78. and died full of years and pious works. 

5. John Scot. This prelate was, in 1177, elected Bishop of St Andrews by the 
chapter. " Electus est  Fordun, lib. vi. c. 35 Rege Willelmo totis viribusreintente 
that monarch passionately exclaiming, when the election was announced to him, 
11 By the arm of St James, John Scot shall never be Bishop of St Andrews." The 
Pope, however, supported the pretensions of John, and a controversy ensued, which 
agitated Scotland, and embroiled William with the Head of the Church for several 
years. The Pope, in consequence, was about to put Scotland under interdict, but 
by Scot's entreaties that step was prevented. The dispute, however, terminated 
at last, by the nomination of John Scot to the diocese of Dunkeld, with liberty to 
retain the emoluments belonging to him as Archdeacon of St Andrews, an office 
which he previously held.— Ford. lib. vi. c. 35-38. This Bishop had great influence 
with Pope Alexander III. " eum in quamlibet partem quam vellit ratione tamen 
previa inclinavit."— Ibid. That Pope, at his request, constituted Argyle, which, till 
his time, was a part of the diocese of Dunkeld, a separate see. John Scot held the 
mitre twenty- five years, and died in 1203, and was buried in the north side of the 
quire of the Abbey-church of Newbottle, " ubi says Fordun claret miraculis." The 
Bishoprick of St Andrews was then estimated at the yearly revenue of L. 8018, 3s. 
and that of Dunkeld at L. 1206, 6s. 8d.— Chart. Aberbrothock, Vol. i. fol. 10, as 
quoted in the Annals of Scotland, Vol. Hi. p. 205. The life of Scot was written by 
William Benyng, prior of Newbattle, afterwards Abbot of Coupar, and by Bishop 
Lauder of Dunkeld. 

Richard de Pra:benda. He was one of the King's clerici, and his kinsman. It is 
said he was consecrated in 1203, and died at Cramond in 1210, and was buried 
in Inchcolm.— Fordun, lib. viii. c. 64 et c. 78. But, »-» 

According to Mill, there was a Richard Provan named John's successor, who must 
have died shortly after, and before consecration, for there is no mention of him as 
bishop in Keith or any other writer. John of Leicester, cousin to King William, 
succeeded John, and filled the see eleven years, and died at Cramond 1214. Keith 
says that Richard de Prtebenda is not designed bishop, nor is it likely that there 
should have been two bishops so near to one another of the same name and surname. 

6. John of Leicester died in 1214.— Mill, Ford. lib. ix c. 27. 

7. Hugh, called Hugo de Sigillo, a monk of Arbroath. Fordun, lib. ix. c. 47, 
calls him " vir mansuetissimus qui dicebatur puerperum Episcopus.'' Mill says, that 
Hugo died within the year, on the 2d January, and was succeeded by Gilbert. 

Mathew Scot, Chancellor of the kingdom, J227-31, is said to have been elected, 
but died before his consecration. — Fordun, Ibid. Although stated as Chancellor, 
Chalmers's Caled. Vol. i. p. 712, he died before 1231. Scot is not in Mill's Cat. of 
Bishops. 

8. Gilbert. He had been chaplain to his predecessor, Bishop Hugh. He appears 
as a witness to a deed of Alexander II. in 1227 A copy of this deed was published 
in 1771, by the late John Davidson, Esq. along with some other curious papers, in 
the Appendix to the Annals or Scotland: Though it proves that Fordun, lib. ix. c. 
47, is mistaken in saying, that Gilbert was not elected till 1229, it does not fix the 
date of that event. Gilbert filled the see twenty-two years, and was buried at Inch- 
colm 12:36. 

9. Galfrid Liverance succeeded in 1236. Mill says that he reformed the cathedral 
worship in imitation of the Church of Sarum, and the music according to the Gre- 
gorian manner. According to Fordun, lib. ix. c. 63, Galfrid died at Tibbermuir in 
1249, and was buried within the old Church, formerly the Abbey Church of Dun- 
keld, " quam praediis et possessionilnis dotavit, quam regulis et institutis informavit,

Atholl Street. It is recorded, that the bishop bought the lands of

taph was,

After Galfrid, Mill places Richard, but 

David was elected in 1250, though never consecrated — Catal. of Bish. p. 50. 

10. Richard of Inverkeithing was appointed 1250. He was one of the Regents of 
the kingdom during the minority of Alexander 111. Feed. i. 566, and Chancellor, 

1255-7 Chalmers's Caled. Vol. i. p. 713. Cardinal Ottobonus de Fieschi, in 1266, 

came as Legate from the Pope to Scotland, and required a contribution from the 
Church to defray the expense of his visitation. The King, with the advice of the 
clergy, forbade it to be levied. The Legate called a council, and Richard was de- 
puted by the Bishops to attend it : " Ne quid, ipsis absentibus in eorum prejudicium 
statueretur."— Fordun, lib. x. c. 24. He died in 1272, " vir," says the same author, 
lib. x. c. 30, " magna maturitatis et gravitatis, qui fuit fidelissimus regis et regni 
consiliarius et justitia inflexibilis." 

11. Robert de Stuteville. He was a man of high birth, and Dean of Dunkeld. 
According to Mill, he filled the see twenty- eight years with great character, and 
died in 1300. Historical facts, however, seem to disprove the time of his death, for, 

12. Mathew was elected in 1295 or earlier. In that year, he appears as one of the 
Commissioners sent to France to negociate with Philip an alliance, by the marriage 
of the daughter of the Count of Anjou with the son and heir of Baliol — Fcedera, t. 
ii. p. 695. By the treaty, L.1500 was stipulated as the lady's jointure ; and of this 
sum, L.500 was secured upon Crown lands in Scotland, " annui redditus de quibus 
mille libris Sterlingorum in locis infrascriptis. videlicet, de Lanark, de Kadioir ho- 
die, Hamilton, de Maldisley, de Cunyngham, de Haddington, et de Castro de Dun- 
de in agro Scotia affi debit eidem." Mill says, that in Mathew's time " St Michael 
killed the English Governor of Perth for oppressing the canons." The same writer 
states, that this bishop died in J312. But he must have died in 1309, as appears from 
Feed. t. iii. p. 194. A bishop of Dunkeld appears as one of the ten Scottish 
commissioners who met the twenty commissioners of the English nation, by order of 
Edward, at London, September 1305, immediately after the unjust death of William 
Wallace, to establish regulations for the government of Scotland. — Ryley, 503, as 
quoted An. of Scot. v. i. p. 312. Chalmers's Caled. Vol. i. p. 671. 

13. William Sinclair. On the death of Mathew, John de Leek was elected by the 
chapter, and Edward applied to the Pope and the College of Cardinals, Feed. t. iii. p. 
164-165, earnestly urging the confirmation of his election ; but the partisans of Robert 
Bruce, who favoured the election of William Sinclair, brother to the Laird of Ros- 
lin, prevailed. Leek was in 1311 appointed Archbishop of Dublin. In a letter of 
thanks for this appointment, written by Edward to the Pope, he is styled, " Johan- 
nis de Leek capellanus noster karissimus, nuper Dunkeldensis ecclesise electus." — 
Feed. t. iii. 258. Sinclair then was consecrated without opposition to the see of Dun- 
keld. It has been asserted, that in 1332 he assisted at the coronation of Edward Ba- 
liol,' at Scone: and that his signature is found at that disgraceful instrument, by 
which the Scottish Parliament, held at Edinburgh in 1333, surrendered the inde- 
pendence and liberty of their country to the English monarch. Lord Hailes is of this 

opinion. Vol. ii. p. 172-188. But it ought to be stated, that very shortly before the 

coronation, the bishop opposed Baliol in the held, near to Perth, and was taken pri- 
soner with many noblemen, all of whom were forced, from their desperate condition, 
to take the oath of allegiance to Baliol. — Buch. Hist. Sinclair's conduct was the re- 
sult of necessity. He was witness to an agreement in 1329, and is bishop 1334— 

Feed. An". Vol. iv. and he died 1337. Mill says Duncan succeeded. Keith says 

that, although these different dates are all well vouched, yet 

14. Walter was bishop as early as 1324. — Cart. Glasg. He is said to have this par- 
ticular and remarkable designation, w Episcopi Dunkeldensis ac conservatoris totiis 
cleri Scoticani." Keith says it is possible that William Sinclair may have died in 
1323 and Walter have succeeded, and then another bishop of the name of William 
chosen, and established in the see. It is difficult to reconcile this with Scottish 
history Mill has neither Walter nor William in his catalogue. When Walter or 
William died is unknown. 

15. Duncan. Mill says that he died in 1363. But this is an error, for 

16. John assumed the mitre in 1356. He was present in the Parliament which 
met at Edinburgh, and agreed to pay 100,000 merks to the English for the ransom

Mucklarie, and out of the rents he endowed the chaplain. By 
virtue of a grant, the dues payable to the chaplain have now been 

of David II.— Feed. t. vi. 39, 40. In 1369, he was a witness to the treaty for a truce 
between England and Scotland, for fourteen years.— Feed. t. vi. 632. Mill has omit- 
ted this bishop. , ,. , . 

17. Michael Monymusk. He was the great Chamberlain of Scotland, and died in 

1376.— Mill. , . , 

18. John Peeblis. This bishop was King's Chancellor, and intrusted with various 
important national negociations.— Feed. t. vii. p. 441. It was he who drew up the ce~ 
lebrated act of Parliament which recognized the title of Robert II. to the throne ot 
Scotland. He died in 1396. 

19. Robert de Cairdney. He showed great zeal and assiduity in adorning the ca- 
thedral, and improving the revenues of his diocese. He acquired the lands of Cra- 
mond in excambion for Ciimmo.— Catal. of Bish. p. 53. The chartulary of Cambus- 
kenneth, as quoted, Ibid., mentions that this bishop was excommunicated for re- 
fusing to comply with the formalities of ecclesiastical processes required by the Pope. 
He was one of the hostages for the redemption of James I. — Feed. t. v. p. 125. 

20. Donald Macnaughtan. He was Dean of Dunkeltl, and elected by the chapter 
on the death of Robert ; but King James opposing his appointment, he took a jour- 
ney to Rome to obtain confirmation from the Pope. On this journey he died. Nis- 
bet, Heraldry, p. 419, gravely says, " Donald Macnaughtan was by James II. rais- 
ed to the Episcopal see of Dunkeld, where he exercised his Episcopal function till 
his death, as in Spottiswood's History of the Church of Scotland." It happens un- 
fortunately for the credit of Mr Nisbet's accuracy, that, in the passage referred to, 
Spottiswood says, that " James opposed this bishop's election, and he died on his way 
to Rome." — Spot p. 100. Donald endowed the church of Clunie. 

21. James Kennedy. He was the son of Sir James Kennedy of Dunure, by Mary, 
younger daughter of Robert III. and Queen Annabel. In 1438, he was chosen bi- 
shop, and in 1448, translated to St Andrews, became a Privy Councillor, and Chan- 
cellor of Scotland, and afterwards one of the Regents of the kingdom, during the mi- 
nority of James III.— Historical Genealogy of the Royal House of Stuarts, by Mark 
Noble, p. 88. Keith, p. 18. 

Alexander Lauder, who had been rector of Ratho : kl Venerabilis vir," says For- 
dun, lib. xvi. c. 26, " et nunc morum probitate conspicuus." Mill says he died in 
October 1440, before consecration. 

22. James Bruce, first rector of Kilmeny in Fife. He became Chancellor of the 
kingdom, and was promoted to the see of Glasgow, but died before his translation 
in 1447. 

William Turnbull, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, was nominated in 1447, to suc- 
ceed James Bruce in the see of Dunkeld; but on the death of that bishop he was 
translated to Glasgow before his consecration for Dunkeld. — Keith. 

23. John Ralston, Dean of Dunkeld, Keeper of the Privy-Seal, and Secretary to 
the King, was raised to the See in 1448. He was afterwards created Lord High 
Treasurer, and employed in several foreign embassies. Faed. t. ii. p. 2420. Mill 
says, " John died about 1450 ; but it was after the 6th November 1452, for on that 
day he is witness to a charter under the great seal." — Keith. 

24. Henry Douglas, son to the Earl of Douglas, succeeded Ralston, He is said 
to have filled the see two years — Life of Leslie, Bishop of Ross. Neither Keith, 
Mill, or Spottiswood make mention of Henry. 

25. Thomas Lauder assumed the mitre in the sixtieth year of his age. He was 
tutor to James II. Mill, who lived in Bishop Lauder's time, says of him:  k This 
venerable prelate had such acquaintance with divinity, that he himself preached the 
faith to his people." He died in 1481, having in 1476 resigned the see on ac- 
count of his advanced age. After his resignation, he was styled " Episcopus in uni- 
versal ecclesia." 

26. James Livingston, Rector of Forteviot and Weem, said to have been remark- 
able for his stature — Mill. He was Chancellor, but held the office a short while. 
He erected a chaplainry in honour of St Columba, in the church of St Giles in Edin- 
burgh, and died in 1483. 

Alexander Inglis was next elected by the chapter, but the Pope annulled the elec- 
tion, because he had not been previously consulted. 

Robert appears as Bishop of Dunkeld in 1483-4-5 Catalogue of Bishops, p. 56. 

This fact is difficult to reconcile with the history of Mill, who lived at the time, and 
does not mention a bishop of that name.

conferred on the rector of the Royal School of Dunkeld. The bishop 
died 16th January 1 4:36, and was honourably buried under a stone 
monument within the walls of the chapel. See Monuments. 

27. George Brown, Rector of Tynngnham was consecrated at Rome in 1484, by 
Pope Sixtus IV. He was rigid in enforcing church discipline. He divided his dio- 
cese into four deaneries. — one for Atholl and Breadalbane, another for Angus, the 
third for Fife, and the fourth for their church lands .south of the Forth. He appoint- 
ed Gaelic preachers for the Highlanders who were unacquainted with the English 
language. He erected the parishes of Caputh and Dowally, which formerly were 
part of Little Dunkeld, and erected churches in the two former. Mill says, that this 
bishop latterly suffered great bodily distress. Previous to his death, he entered a 
solemn protest, to the effect, that, being then of sound mind and firm in the faith, if 
he should " afterwards, through bodily weakness be tempted by the Devil, or by the 
arguments of designing men," and turn from the faith, he should not be judged of, 
by what he then did. — Brown died 1514. 

Andrew Stewart, brother to the Earl of Atholl, a prebend of Craig, and not in full 
orders, got himself, through his brother's influence, postulated bishop, but Pope 
Leo X. opposed his admission — Mill. He was afterwards made Bishop of Caith- 
ness — Keith. 

28. Gavin Douglas, uncle to the then Earl of Angus, was, through the Queen's 
solicitation, his uncle's wife, preferred by the Pope. Andrew Stewart, however, pre- 
vented Gavin being consecrated till 1516. This bishop holds an eminent place in 
the literary history of his age. He was a profound classical scholar, a well informed 
antiquarian, and an elegant poet. He wrote, Aurea Narrationes, Comediat aliquot 
Sacra ; et De Rebus Scoticis ; but none of those works have descended to our times. 
His Palace of Honour, and his translation of the iEneid of Virgil, however, still re- 
main, and present very honourable monuments of both the correctness of his taste, 
and the vigour of his imagination. Living in dark and turbulent times, he enjoyed not 
the felicity of indulging his genius in security and repose. He was involved in the 
agitations and hazards of those commotions with which the disputes of the Queen 
Mother and the Duke of Albany, and of Arran and Angus, embroile i the kingdom. 
To avoid these, he retired to England, when he became the intimate acquaintance of 
Polydore Virgil. Douglas died in London, 1522, and was buried in the Hospital 
Church of Savoy. 

29. Robert Cockburn. In 1524, this bishop, with the Earl of Cassilis and Dean 
Mill, went as Ambassadors from James V. to Henry VIII. of England, to negocinte 
a truce between the two kingdoms. They were successful in the embassy. Foed. t. 
adv. p. 27. 

30. George Crichton. " A man," says Spottiswood, Hist, of Ch. of Scot. p. 101, 
" nobly disposed, and a great house-keeper; but in matters of his calling not very 
skilled." He died in 1543.— Keith. 

31. John Hamilton, Abbot of Paisley, and brother to the Earl of An an, was elect- 
ed, but by intrigue not confirmed till 1546. He was translated to St Andrews in 
1549. 

32. Robert Crichton, nephew to the former Bishop George Crichton, was pro- 
moted to this see, in which he remained till the Reformation. He was one of the 
commissioners for divorcing Karl Bothwell from Lady Jane Gray, to enabled Both- 
well to marry Mary Queen of Scots. On the necessity of this marriage, see Ty tier's 
Dissert, published J 792, in the Transactions of Antiquarian Society of Scotland, Vol.i. 

The Bishops of Dunkeld from the pei iod of the Reformation to the Revolution 

in J 688. 

. 1. James Paton was appointed to the see by James VI., in 1571, the see having 
been declared void through a process of forfaulture against Robert Crichton, who 
was then alive. In 1572, an Assembly of the church was held at Leith, where it was 
agreed to retain the order of bishops in the new -ecclesiastical constitution. This 
agreement was ratified as an interim regulation at a future Assembly, which met soon 
after at Perth.— Spottiswood's Hist, of the Ch. of Scot., p. 260, 261. In 1575, he 
was present in the General Assembly, Ibid. p. 276 ; and was deposed or surrenderee 

the bishoprick to avoid a charge of simony. He previously dilapidated the benefice

2. Peter Roilork. In 1596, he was created an extraordinary Lord of Session, and 
being afterwards removed, in order to reduce the number of extraordinary Lords to

There was another small chapel, called the Red Chapel, not 
far from St Ninians, built on the top of the eminence east of the 
town called the Billhead, which was dedicated to St Jerome. 
The chapel was principally erected for the inhabitants of Fun- 
gorth. The building is now levelled ; but its site is enclosed by a 
stone wall. From the name of the saint, the people of Fungorth are 
ludicrously called to this day Jorums. 

Monuments.— In the vestibule of the choir is an ancient monu- 
ment of the Wolf of Badenoch, in a recumbent position, clad in 
armour, with a lion at his feet. Round the stone plate is the fol- 
lowing inscription : " Hie jacet Alexander Senescalus, filius Ro- 
berti Regis Scotorum et Elizabethe More, Dominus de Buchan 
et Dns. de Badenoch, qui obit vigessimo quarto die Julii." The 
rest of the inscription is awanting. The words in Italics are cut 
on a different kind of stone, and recently added. The statue 
stood in the ancient choir, and that part of the inscription may 
have been broken off at the Reformation, in 1560, or, in 1689, 
by the soldiery. The sculptor, however, has given a wrong date : 
the Wolf died 20th February 1394. This personage was the ce- 
lebrated Mister More Mac an Righ, the third son of Robert II., 
and better known by the name of the Wolf of Badenoch. He 
appears to have been a sort of Rob Roy in his day, and consider- 
ed it no sin to plunder church lands. He was excommunicated 
by the Bishop of Moray, on account of some predatory outrage 
against his ecclesiastical possessions. The Earl, however, reta- 

four, he was readmitted in 1610.— Lord Hailes's Catalogue of Lords of Sess. p. 12, 
note 45. In 1303, he attended King James to England — Spot. Hist, of the Ch. of 
Scot. p. 476, where he was naturalized — Keith. 

3. James Nicolson. He was Parson of .Meigle, and was chosen to preside in the 
Assembly which met at Linlithgow in 1606. — Calderwood, p. 552. He was called 
to Court, for agreeing with the contentions of the clergy, He died 1607. 

4. Alexander Lindsay, parson of St Madoes; succeeded. He was deposed for ma- 
lignancy in 1638.— Acts of Assembly. It appears that he next year abjured Epis- 
copacy, and accepted his former charge of St Madoes — Unprinted Acts of Assembly, 
1 639. 

5. George Haliburton, minister of Perth, was appointed Bishop of Dunkeld by 
Charles 11. in 1662. He died in 1664. 

i, Henry Guthrie, was minister at Stirling, but deposed " for malignancy," in 
1648. — His own Memoirs, p. 299 After the Restoration he was again admitted o 
the office of the ministry, and became Bishop of Dunkeld in 1665. 

7. William Lindsay, minister at Perth, was consecrated to this see in 1677, aud 
died in 1679. 

8. Andrew Bruce, Archdeacon of St Andrews, was advanced to the bishoprick of 
Dunkeld on the death of William Lindsay, and was ejected in 1686, for his opposi- 
tion to the measures of the Court. In the year following, " his Majesty's dispensa- 
tion," says Keith, p. 180, " was issued to Or Bruce, late Bishop of Dunkeld, for ex- 
ercising the office of the ministry." Keith adds not unnaturally, " A right strange 
paper truly " In the year 1688, he was appointed bishop of Orkney. 

9. John Hamilton, son to John Hamilton, who was Archbishop of St Andrews at 
the time of the Reformation. This prelate survived the Revolution, and died one of 
the ministers of Edinburgh, and subdean of the Chapel Royal.

hated. He ravaged the bishop's diocese, burned the town of 
Elgin, its hospital, and its magnificent cathedral. For this sacri- 
legious misdemeanour he was compelled by his father to appear, 
barefoot and in sackcloth, at the door of the Black Friars at Perth' 
and afterwards to appear at the High Altar, where he promised 
before his father and the nobles there assembled to make indem- 
nification to the Bishop of Moray. Dr MacCulloch facetiously re- 
marks, if the Wolf « claims that Dunkeld shall canopy his bones 
till doomsday, it is probable that he obtained the privilege by dis- 
gorging to Bishop Moneymusk some of the good things of which 
he had robbed their fraternity in the north." 

In the centre of the vestibule is a very neat and affectionate tri- 
bute of respect to the memory of the Rev. John Robb, minister of 
Dunkeld, who perished in the wreck of the Forfarshire steam- 
ship, at the Fearn Islands, in 1838. 

In the north wall of the choir is a plain stone, bearing an in- 
scription commemorative of Thomas Bisset, late commissary of 
Dunkeld. It is a well-expressed eulogy on the strict integrity and 
blameless manners of the man, and is one of the few instances 
where a tombstone is made to speak nothing but the truth. 

In the south aisle of the cathedral is the monument of Bishop 
Cardney, lying in a recess of the wall, under a canopy adorned 
with crockets. The figure of the bishop is represented in pontifi- 
calibus, wearing his mitre. The inscription on the stone-plate is 
very much defaced. It runs thus: " Hie jacet Dns. Robertus de 
Cardony, Eppis.Dunkeldenni qui."— Three words are here defaced, 
and the inscription on the plate to the back is partly broken off. 
What remains is, ad incarnationem Due m.cccc.xx. This monu- 
ment was brought from St Ninian's chapel, and placed in the ca- 
thedral subsequent to 1464. Ancient Chapels. In the east 
aisle stands the decapitated statue of Bishop Sinclair. Around 
the outer walls of the choir and cathedral are to be seen the arms 
of the different bishops who erected the edifice. The portion 
erected by each bears the arms of his family. 

Among the tombstones within the cathedral, there are two 
which mark the resting-place of two dignitaries of the church,— 
the Dean of Dunkeld, 1476, and the Rector of Moneidie, in 1548. 

In the chapter-house there is a marble statue of John, fourth 
Duke of Atholl, attired in his Parliamentary robes. It is a very faith- 
ful likeness, and was erected by his Duchess, in 1833. To the back 
of it is a tribute to the memory of their son, Lord Charles Mur- 
ray, who died in Greece. And close to that tablet is a very taste-

ful monument to the Marquis of Atholl, emblazoned with the 
quartering of his many powerful connections. The vault of the 
chapter-house is now the burying-place of the Atholl family. 

It is traditionally reported, that the upright stone situated in a 
field near to Poll'-nan-gobhair, now called Pol-na-gates, marks 
the grave of a Highland chieftain ; but the name or cause of his 
death is Unknown. The two upright stones at the Doo's Nest, 
near Newtyle, are understood to mark the graves of two Danish 
warriors, who fell in one of the engagements that were fought 
near to Dunkeld in the tenth century. There is a natural curio- 
sity on the top of the hill to the west of Dunkeld, called in Gae- 
lic Creag-bhan-righ or Creag-nam-ban righ, but better known in 
English as Craig-y-barns. It is a huge mass of stone, supported, 
at some distance from the flat surface of solid rock on which it 
stands, by means of three fragments. Dr MacCulloch and others 
are of opinion, that it is merely the relic of a heap of fragments, 
from which time, having produced the whole, has carried off the 
smaller parts. 

Antiquities and Ancient Places.— The first is the roofless cathe- 
dral. It measures 120 by 60 feet; the walls are 40 feet high ; 
and the side aisles 12 feet wide. On each side are seven spacious 
Gothic arches with flutted soffits, resting on six plain Norman 
pillars having shafts 10 feet high, and 4| feet in diameter, and 
two half columns. Over the arches are two tiers of windows, the 
lower semicircular, the higher acute. Buttresses project between 
the windows of the side-aisles, surmounted above the church with 
traceried spiracles. The windows are all of different designs. At 
the west end rises the great tower or steeple, and adjoining it, a 
small octagonal watch-tower, which is very much admired. There 
are two upright stones on the south of the cathedral, which form- 
ed part of the old monastery. The oldest house in the town, and 
which belonged to the Dean of Dunkeld, stands not far from the 
choir. It is the only house now standing out of the three that escaped 
the conflagration of the town in 1689. Its walls are of great thick- 
ness. 

On the eminence east of the town is a very extensive terrace 
with a pyramidical-formed hill rising in the centre, called the 
Craigwood, which commands a very fine view of.Dunkeld and the 
passes leading into it. On this terrace, close to the hill, are to be 
found water-stones of various shapes and sizes. The hill where 
the bishops hanged many a lawless freebooter is situated close to 
the second lodge of the Dunkeld grounds ; and the hollow ground 



988

to the back of the lodge is the place where sorcerers were 
burned. 

The only two castles within Dunkeld were ancient Caledon, 
and the bishop's. In Dowally was the castle of Rotmel, occa- 
sionally occupied by one of the Roberts. It was removed about 
forty years ago. A number of coins were discovered under the 
foundation-stone, now believed to be in the possession of the Dal- 
guise family. 

Caves. — On the side of Craig-y-barns, overlooking the King's 
pass, there are two caves, — one called the Hermit's Cave, the 
other, Duncan Hogg's Hole. Neither of them are of any size. 
Duncan, who was a lawless character, was shot, on his return from 
the well of St Columba, on the east side of the King's Seat. The 
Duchess's Cave is on the east side of Craig-y-barns. It is partly 
artificial. At one time, it was very neatly fitted up, but it is now 
much destroyed. 

Parochial Records. — The register of discipline does not extend 
farther back than 1830. The former register has been acciden- 
tally mislaid. There is no register of deaths. The register of 
births, baptisms, and marriages go back to 1672. The inhabit- 
ants, however, are not very strict in recording their families' births, 
and baptisms ; but this may, in part, be attributed to the circum- 
stance of a division of the town lying in the parish of Caputh. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population of Dunkeld and Dowally was 1298 
1791, . . . ,1773 

1821, .... 1917 
1831, .... 2032 

1841, .... 1752 

The census of 1831 shows an increase attributable to the great 
improvements. that were commenced at Dunkeld in 1829. The 
population of Dunkeld in 1831 was 1471. In 1841, it was only 
1094, and is still decreasing. Around Dunkeld the country is 
very thinly populated. 

Character and condition of the People. — The inhabitants of Dun- 
keld and Dowally may be generally characterized as intelligent, 
moral, and industrious, frank and courteous in their intercourse 
with strangers, and among themselves obliging and neighbourly. 
To the resident poor they show great kindness. In all their tran- 
sactions they exhibit shrewd good sense. They are very particu- 
lar about having their children well educated, for which the town 
schools afford every facility. The attendance at church is uni- 
formly regular. 



DUNKELD AND DOW ALLY. 



989 



In Dunkeld there is no field for labour. During the spring and 
summer months, the labouring classes are principally employed in 
peeling oak, and in spring and harvest work in some of the adjoin- 
ing parishes. For the remainder of the year they are idle. The 
principal trade and manufactures of Dunkeld, balf-a century ago, 
were yarn, linen manufacture, and tanning, which were carried on 
to a great extent. These have now ceased. Shoemaking is now 
the chief business. There is no kind of manufactory. There are 
two slate quarries in the neighbourhood, and also a saw-mill, which 
give employment throughout the year. There are several excel- 
lent falls for machinery and ground for bleaching -fields in the 
neighbourhood of Dunkeld. 

Habits and Amusements. — There is no singularity in the habits 
of the people as regards dress or mode of living. The English 
language is spoken in Dunkeld. In Dowally, with the exception 
of 110 persons, English is spoken with fluency, but they prefer 
Gaelic. Gaelic is still preached, and it is taught, along with 
English, at school. Smuggling prevailed extensively at one time 
in the district, but after the late Duke of Atholl got the Highland 
distilleries legalized, smuggling ceased. Poaching is rare ; when 
committed, it is generally by strangers. Crimes of a serious charac- 
ter are equally rare, although petty offences do occasionally occur. 
The holiday kept in the district is Aula 1 Hansel Monday. The 
Highland games are contested for once a-year. Curling is the fa- 
vourite game during winter. 

IV. — Industry. 
From inability to obtain a sight of the plans and measurements 
of the Dunkeld grounds, it is impossible to give a table of the con- 
tents as required under this head. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, fyc. — The weekly market is held in Dunkeld on 
Saturday, and there are five annual fairs for the sale of cattle, fee- 
ing servants, &amp;c, 14th February, 25th March, 5th April, 9th June, 
and second Tuesday of November. The customs, which are small, 
belong to the Atholl family, and are collected by the tacksman of the 
markets. The post-office has a daily delivery, at which money 
orders can be obtained. There are the offices of excise, stamps, and 
taxes. The branch banks are, the Commercial Bank, the Perth 
Bank, and the Central Bank. There is no savings bank. There 
are agents for several of the English and Scotch Life and Fire Insur- 
ance Companies. There is a public library, called the Macin- 
tosh Library, containing nearly 2000 volumes of varied reading.

It dales its origin to a donation of books made in 1811, by the 
Rev. Donald Macintosh, a priest of the old Scots Episcopal 
church, and the last of the nori-jurant clergy in Scotland. It is 
managed by curators. There are two large and commodious ho- 
tels with posting establishments, at which the Inverness mail stops 
daily. Besides these, there are three secondary inns, and excellent 
summer lodgings. The lodging houses for the humbler classes 
are under the surveillance of the county police. The district jus- 
tices hold their courts in the town. Their clerk is also the fiscal 
and the sheriff-clerk for issuing small debt summonses. The quar- 
terly sheriff's small debt court, the registration court, and all 
public meetings are held in the mason lodge. The commissary 
court, before it was removed to Perth, was first held in the Bi- 
shop's castle, and afterwards in the under flat of the steeple ; in the 
room above the records were kept. The Court day was Saturday. 
The old prison was removed about 1743, but one of the land arches 
of the Dunkeld bridge is now used as a lock-up. It is a cold damp 
hole, without a fire-place, windows, or furniture, or even straw for 
a bed. It is intended to build a small prison with a court-room, 
and a room for keeping the district records. At one time there 
was a town drummer and piper, whose dress was faced with blue. 
These functionaries were supplanted by a bellman, whose insignia 
of office bears the following inscription: " Dunkeld kirk-session, 
Soli Deo Gloria, 1693." It was called the buihbean, or funeral 
bell. 

The town is well supplied with butcher-meat and all other pro- 
visions, excepting sea-fish, which are occasionally brought in carls 
from Arbroath, Dundee, and Perth. Coals sell about L. 1, 5s. 
per ton ; peats are not openly sold, as the Highland tenantry are 
restricted from disposing of them. The principal fuel is wood, 
which is purchased by the cart load. There is a brewery ; a dis- 
tillery ; and also malt barns. 

The properties in the principal street are held in feu ; but the 
rest of the town property is a branch-holding. The old feuars 
have a right to quarry stones in Newtyle hill, for building within 
the city, as a part of the consideration for their right of the com- 
monty hill of Dunkeld, which they sold to the Atholl family about 
1812, and which is now under plantation. House property in 

 On removing the commissary records to Perth, there were found, books, records, 
and warrants of the Court of Regality of Dunkeld ; and of sundry regality, barony, 
and prebendary courts, and other papers, all of which were, conform to inventory, 
transmitted to the sheriff-clerk of Perth in July 1 834. Many ancient writings relative 
to properties in Dunkeld and Dowally are only to be found in these registers.

Dunkeld does not sell readily, from the heavy expense for titles. 
Feus in Little Dunkeld are considered more valuable. 

The first bridge over the Tay at Dunkeld existed in the year 
830. In 1461, Bishop Lauder laid the foundation of one to be 
built, " partly of timber and partly of stone," but there is no evi- 
dence of its completion. In 1512, Bishop Brown laid the foun- 
dation of another bridge to be built of stone. He finished the 
first arch. His executors, in 1514, drove the piles for two arches, 
and gave Bishop Douglas L.240 Scots, with which the bridge was 
finished for foot-passengers. No account exists when it was de- 
stroyed or swept away. Its ruins, however, were visible within 
these few years. The danger and inconvenience of the ferries 
at Dunkeld, by the occasional swelling of the river, which has 
been known to rise seventeen feet above its usual level, was long 
seriously felt. To obviate this complaint, the late Duke of Atholl 
commenced the present Dunkeld bridge in 1805, and completed it 
in 1809, at an expense of L.30,000, — L.5000 of which was con- 
tributed by Government. The pontage, which still exists, lets, on 
an average, at L.700 per annum. The bridge was constructed al- 
most wholly on dry land, and the river afterwards changed in its 
course, so as to flow through its finely formed arches. It would 
be difficult to persuade any one that the channel in which the ri- 
ver now flows was not the one formed by itself. His Grace sub- 
sequently widened, embanked, and cut miles of turnpike road, and 
opened up the Atholl districts. Before 1809, the traffic was 
mostly all conducted on horseback. There was a post runner to 
Dunkeld, but there was no post beyond it, except his Grace's 
runner to Blair. Now, there are nearly twenty carriers that pass 
Dunkeld weekly to the Highland districts. There is the daily- 
mail to Inverness through Atholl, and a stage-coach to Perth thrice 
a week. In the summer months, there are daily stage-coaches 
from Dunkeld to Inverness, Dundee, Lochlomond, Perth, &amp;c. 

Societies. — To guard against the casualties of sickness and mor- 
tality there are the Carpenters, Gardeners, Highlandmen, and Ma- 
son's Provident Societies. They have large funds, and have been 
productive of much good. There are two masonic lodges, and a 
curling club. Besides a charitable society for the destitute and 
infirm of both sexes, there are a Bible and a missionary society. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The cathedral church of Dunkeld, which 
was substantially repaired in 1817, is seated to contain 700. The 
seats are let from 4s. to 2s. each. The poor have free sittings. 
The stipend does not exceed L. 180. It is paid, partly by the

teinds of Dowally, and partly by grants made to the minister by 
Queen Anne in 1704, and George II. in 1744. In lieu of manse 
and glebe the incumbent has an yearly allowance of L. 60 Ster- 
ling. Communion elements, L. 8, 6s. 8d. 

The Episcopalians, 25 in number, have no chapel in Dunkeld, 
but it has been proposed to build one. The Roman Catholics for 
years have performed worship in the house of one of their number. 
Prince Maximilian and suite went there, for worship, on their visit 
to Dunkeld, in 1815. About two years ago a small chapel was 
consecrated on the Murthley estate, where the Catholic service is 
now performed. The Congregational Union erected a chapel in 
1800 in Dunkeld; they are few in number. The Independents 
or Glassites were a strong body some years ago ; only four or five 
now reside in the town, but it is unknown whether or not they 
meet together for worship. 

Schools. — In 1567, James VI. made a grant for the erection of 
a grammar school at Dunkeld, which is designated by the charter 
" the Royal School of Dunkeld." The right of presentation is 
conferred on John Earl of Atholl, and his successors, but the exa- 
mination and admission to office of the person presented is in- 
trusted " to the superintendent of the church of God within the 
bounds of Perthshire." By the grant it is declared, that the rec- 
tor shall reside within the city of Dunkeld, and shall teach in the 
school himself. The salary, according to the grant, amounts to 
L. 67, lis. Id. Scots, exclusive of school fees. He has also an 
official residence. The school and dwelling-house are kept up by 
the Atholl family, the sole heritors of Dunkeld. The average 
number of scholars may be estimated at 80. The branches of 
education are similar to those taught in the first establishments in 
Edinburgh. There are half-yearly examinations ; one for recita- 
tion exclusively, called the " Orations," which is succeeded by 
a ball in the evening ; the other examination is general, and is 
conducted by the presbytery. 

There are in the town five unendowed schools for education, 
but there is no infant school. The fees are moderate. 

In 1788, Jane Duchess of Atholl instituted a school for teach- 
ing the different branches of female education, such as sewing, 
tambouring, &amp;c. with an annual salary to the teacher. By the 
death of the late Duchess, the patronage and support of the semi- 

 He is removable from office by a decree of the synod of the church, if found ne- 
gligent in life or doctrine, affording a scandal to the young. The rector is also the 
chaplain of St Ninian, and in virtue thereof, is the superior of the lands of Mucklarie.

nary devolved on Lady Glenlyon, who nominates a certain num- 
ber of scholars who have three years free tuition. 

The Sunday school was instituted in 1789 by Jane Duchess of 
Atholl, and is conducted according to certain regulations well cal- 
culated to impress on the youthful mind the great principles of 
religion. Two vears ago, the late Duchess built a room at her 
own expense, exclusively for the scholars. This institution is sup- 
ported by contribution. 

Bede-House. — Bishop Brown, in 1510, erected a house, called 
St George's Hospital, for the support of seven old men, who were 
each to have a free house, five bolls of meal, and five merks Scots 
yearly. In 1689, the hospital was burned; small low cottages 
were then built, but, subsequently, substantial buildings were 
erected on their site. Part of the buildings were sold ; the rents 
derived from the remainder are laid out in meal, which is equally 
divided among the bedemen. The commissary has the sole ad- 
ministration of the hospital funds. 

Poor. — The funds are derived from the church collections, 
dues of proclamation, and mortcloth dues, which, on an average, 
amount yearly to about L.60 Sterling. There is also a yearly sum 
of L.2, 6s. 8d. from Burt's mortification. Any deficiency is made 
up by the Atholl family as heritors. There are standing, at pre- 
sent, upon the poor list, 5 men and 14 women, with an allowance 
of Is. per week. They are allowed free houses and fuel from the 
Atholl family, and many of them receive assistance from the La- 
dies' Society. In 1842, there was paid to resident paupers, L.53, 
1 Is. lid.; and for lodging paupers, and passing them through the 
town, L.3, 14s. 4d. 



DoWALLY. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
About the end of the fifteenth century, Dowally was the High- 
land district of the parish of Caputh, which, prior to 1400, had 
formed part of the parish of Little Dunkeld. During the pesti- 
lence which ravaged Scotland in 1500, many persons settled in the 
haugh of Dowally, under the belief, that, from its proximity to 
Dunkeld, they would escape the calamity, — the prevailing report 
being, that the city of Dunkeld was preserved from every pesti-

lential disease by the merits of its patron, St Columba. Their 
settlement was ten miles distant from the church of Caputh, and 
five miles from the Dunkeld cathedral. That the new residents, 
who spoke the Irish Gaelic, miobt have religious instruction im- 
parted to them in their own language, Brown, then Bishop of 
Dunkeld, in 1500, erected Dowally into a parish. It is not known 
whether the parish received its name from the Gaelic Duffle, 
a neglected people ; or from Doullarh or Daullach, a second charge. 
The parish is, however, generally denominated in Gaelic con- 
versation either Dubh ailean, the block meadow ; or, Dail a charrte, 
the hough of the cairn, the name by which the " haugb" where 
the " cairn" was situated, is known. The cairn stood fifty years 
ago, a little to the eastward of the present church, and to the west- 
ward of two high upright stones called clachinmore. On removing 
thecairn, it was found to consist entirely of land-stones; in the centre 
there were an iron-chain, and a single stone-coffin, 6 feet in length, 
and 4 in breadth, with a quantity of rich black earth, but no bones 
within it. The cairn was 30 feet in diameter, and about 6 in 
height. A small distance from the cairn, were found a few rude 
stone coffins. When the late Duke of Atholl direcied the present 
turnpike road to be cut through the field on which the cairn was 
situated, the people at first refused to do it, because the pesti- 
lence had been buried there, and might renew the calamity. His 
Grace's firmness, however, overcame their superstitious fears. 

Extent and Boundaries — Dowally is situated to the westward 
of Dunkeld, from which it is separated by a small interjected por- 
tion of Caputh, The main body of the parish of Dowally 
stretches along the north bank of the river Tay, in the shape of 
a parallelogram, beginning at the " Pley Burn," a mile from the 
town of Dunkeld, and extending to the north-west upwards of six 
miles, where the parish of Logierait divides it from the barony of 
Dulcapon, which forms a part of the parish of Dowally. This ba- 
rony lies on the north bank of the river Tuminel, and extends 
three-quarters of a mile. The breadth of the parish is uncertain, 
from the hills having been placed under plantation before any 
exact measurement had been deemed necessary. The main body 
of the parish of Dowally is bounded on the east by Caputh ; on 
the north, by Kirkmichael ; on the south, by the river Tay ; and 
on the west, by Logierait. The barony of Dulcapon is bounded 
on the east and west by Logierait ; on the north, by Kirkmichael ; 
and on the south, by the river Tummel.

Topographical Appearances.— Dowally lies on the north side of 
the vale of Atholl, and consists of a range of hills running north- 
ward, with a small shelf of ground towards the river Tay. 

The public road enters the parish at the King's pass, and de- 
scends gradually for three miles along the side of a precipitous 
hill, until it reaches the low grounds at the village of Dowally. 
The declivity of the hill is frequently seamed by deep ra- 
vines, and so rapid is the ascent of the declivity, that in some 
places the wall of the bridge is not three feet above the sur- 
face of the road, while the other is above forty. The great com- 
plaint of travellers is, that several of the bridges are too narrow, 
and that the parapet walls of others are not sufficiently high to 
prevent danger. These complaints, it is believed, will speedily be 
removed. 

The haugh or low grounds of Dowally spread out in a semicir- 
cular form, and have originally been part of the bed of the river 
Tay. They are embanked. The soil is light. The soil of the 
fields upon the brow of the hill is deeper and stronger, with a 
slight mixture of clay. 

The hills to the back were at one time a common pasturage, 
where cattle and horses ran wild. They presented a barren bleak 
appearance, and an indifferent soil. These hills have now, how- 
ever, been converted into a larch forest. It begins at Craig-y- 
barns, which is elevated nearly 1000 feet above the level of the 
sea, and runs northward in a direct line a distance of fourteen miles, 
varying from three to six miles in breadth. The carriage drives 
through the forest exceed eighty miles. This forest is only apart 
of the Atholl woods. Their value, considered as individual wealth, 
or as national resources, raised from inferior soil, is incredible. We 
are, however, prevented from going into the history of these plan- 
tations, as it has been made very generally known by the Highland 
Society of Scotland, who circulated a very interesting account of 
them in 1832. 

Hydrography. — Within the forest of Dowally, there are several 
lochs. On the summit of the hill of Duchray, nearly 1900 feet 
above the level of the sea, there is a loch of half a mile in circum- 
ference. Loch Ordie, or Lochard, or in English, the highly si- 
tuated loch, is elevated about 700 feet, and is several miles in cir- 
cumference. There are also the two lochs of Rotmel. These 
lochs flow into the burn of Dowally, which discharges itself into 



PERTHSHIRE 



the river Tay. In its progress thither it drives two saw-mills, aiul 
then rolls on by the village of Dowally. 

Loch Oishnie, or the lake of many angles, also flows into the 
Tay, passing the Kilmorich distillery, and the village of Kindal- 
lachan. Loch Broom flows through the barony of Dulcapon, and 
discharges itself into the river Tummel, near to Moulinearn. 

Fishing. — Lochs Broom and Ordie are famed for trout ; the 
latter is preserved. The rest of the Dowally lochs contain perch, 
&amp;c. There is a salmon-fishing station at Dowally; and the banks 
of the river Tay, all along the parish, afford good sport to an- 
glers. 

II. — Civil Historv. 

In Dowally, the Culdees had a place of worship at the Mains 
of Kilmorick, which was subsequently possessed by the Romish 
Church. About 1340, one of the bishops of Dunkeld erected a 
house at Guay, for the entertainment of strangers, which was sup- 
ported by the rents of certain church lands. Some of his succes- 
sors, however, shut it up, and misapplied the rents, but Bishop 
Brown, somewhere about 1490, restored it. It ceased at the 
Reformation. At the present day, the Guay Inn is the only 
licensed house in the parish. Dowally, it is believed, was 
the last parish erected in Perthshire. It took place in 1500. 
At that time, the bishop built and endowed a church in 
honour of the blessed mother St Anne, among the woods 
of the church-lands of Dowallv. It was a lonff narrow in- 
elegant structure, and uncomfortably seated. It became ruinous 
in 1755, when it was repaired. There are two villages in the pa- 
rish, one at the church of Dowally, and the other at Kindallachan, 
about one mile distant. There is no post-office, although there 
might be one, most conveniently for the parish, at Guay, and ano- 
ther at Moulinearn. At present, there is a post runner from Dun- 
keld, although the mail passes daily through the parish. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners are Lord Glenlyon and the 
Duke of Atholl's Trustees. The latter are the patrons. Neither 
have a residence in the parish. 

• A singular custom existed throughout the Highlands. A hankrupt wearing the 
dyvour's dress was obliged to wait at the church-door till all the parishioners were 
seated, before he could enter to join in the worship. This humiliating dress was 
one-half yellow and one-half brown, with a hood for the head, which the supreme 
Court had the power to dispense with. It was finally abolished during the late 
King's reign.

Eminent Men. — Mr James Fraser, mill-wright, Dowally, is a na- 
tive of this parish. He is a most ingenious mechanic, plain and 
unassuming in his manners. He invented the self-propelling twin 
ferry-boats now used in various parts of the rivers Tay and Turn- 
mell, for which he received a gold medal from the Society of 
Arts. In 1822, he invented the Archimedes screw, and proved 
its value for working boats on the Atholl lochs. A model of this 
invention was sent to the War Office by the late Duke of Atholl. 
His Grace instructed Fraser, in 1830, to construct a boat with the 
Archimedes screw for Loch Ordie, but it was never finished, owing 
to His Grace's death. Fraser, however, had the mortification to find 
that his invention, with a slight alteration, had lately been se- 
cured by a patent in favour of another person. Fraser next in- 
vented the fanner hand-bellows, which another person also secured 
by a patent. At Dowally, this ingenious mechanic has erected a 
wheel, which drives at one time, a saw-mill, a thrashing-mill, &amp;c. 
turning-lathes and grinding-stone, and it also acts as a furnace-blast. 

Antiquities. — Near to the church of Dowally, are two upright 
stones, apparently Pictish monuments. They are rude blocks of 
stone, without any marks of an instrument, without carving, in- 
scription, or hieroglyphics. They are plainly the monuments of 
an early age, when letters. were little understood. The purpose 
for which they were erected is unknown. The only Druidical re- 
mains found in the parish were, a Druidical circle and a sacrificial 
flag, which were situated in the barony of Dulcapon near to Mouli- 
nearn. The mystic wells within the parish are, St Muireach's at the 
Mains of Kilmorick ; St Anne's at Dowally ; Sancta Crux at 
Crueshill: and there was one at Dulcapon, now destroyed, but the 
saint's name is unknown. The waters are not medicinal. Many 
persons, however, still believe in their efficacy. Until very lately, 
hundreds of people, for miles round, resorted to the Crux well on 
the first Sunday of May O. S. to get the cream of the water. 
Tents were erected and refreshments sold as openly as at a fair. 
Their pilgrimage uniformly ended in riotous assaults. Many mys- 
tic wells, on being cleaned out, have yielded up gold and silver 
coins and trinkets, which the more wealthy of the pilgrims had cast 
in to propitiate the saint. At each of these mystic wells in Dow- 
ally, there was a chapel, excepting at St Anne's, where the parish 
church always stood. 

Caves. — There are several in the wood and on the face of the

back hills of Dowally, which were tenanted for months after the 
battle of Culloden. They are difficult of access, and known only 
to the old parishioners. 

III. — Population. 

In 1790, the population of Dowally was 687 
1831, ... 561 

1836, ... 596 

1841, ... 658 

IV. — Industry. 
In the absence of any accurate data, Dowally may be taken, at 
a rough guess, to contain about 12,000 acres, whereof 

Arable, . . 1 200 

Pasture, . . , 300 

Woods, . . 10,200 

Lochs, . . . 200 

12,000 

The valued rent of the parish is L. 1399, 2s. 2d. Scots. The 
average rent of the arable land is L.I, 15s. per acre. There are 
thirty farms of various sizes. Of late years, the farm steadings have 
been built of stone and mortar with slated roofs. The roads are crood. 
There are three markets and three meal mills within a few miles 
of the parish. The potato mill at Tullimet, adjoining Dowally, 
which uses nearly forty bolls of potatoes per working day, is the 
mart for the potato crop of the district. There are two saw mills 
in the parish. The ancient markets within the parish were the 
Kindallachan market for sheep, and the herd's " japping" market 
at Dowally for fruit. 

A great proportion of the farmers have their lime-kilns for farm 
purposes. Limestone is to be had in the parish of Blair, twelve 
miles distant. Bone manure is now much used, and answers well 
the soil. The shifts in cultivation are in some places four, 
five, six, and seven. Oats and barley are the general produce. 
The oats are the potato and Hopetoun ; barley, Dunlop and 
English ; the Chevalier is given up. Patches of bear or bigg, 
rye, and lint are occasionally to be seen. Wheat has been tried 
without any beneficial result. Tares, potatoes, and turnips are ge- 
neral. There is no meadow hay ; it all consists of rye-grass and 
white and red clover. The principal fuel is peat. 

Farming, draining, and enclosing are well understood in Dow- 

The japping market was discontinued about 100 years ago. The herds, in the 
course of the day, arranged themselves on each side of the Burn of Dowally; on a 
signal given, they beat the water one against the other with sticks, till one of the sides 
;.'ave way. The vanquished then left the market, and the victors had the exclusive 
honour of treating the lasses to fruit, and of enjoying their society at the ball.

ally, as also the rearing of cattle. Many of the tenants keep a 
few English and black-faced sheep. 

Harvest labour has undergone a great change of late years, 
shearing having now been nearly abolished, and the scythe gene- 
rally used. The farming utensils are mostly of the newest pat- 
tern. The smith and wright work are excellent. A few of the 
farms have thrashing-mills. There is an agricultural association 
in the district, which has been productive of great benefit. 

The wages of out and in-door servants are similar in amount to 
those of the surrounding parishes. 

All the lands in the parish, excepting the barony of Dulcapon, 
were thirled to the mill of Dowally, which does not now exist. 

Farmers some years ago were sadly pestered with tinkers and 
sturdy beggars, who used to encamp in great numbers in the well- 
sheltered Bog of Dowally, but they have disappeared since the in- 
troduction of the county constabulary force. 

In 1700, there was no road through the parish. The military 
road was cut in 1739. It was made in a straight line, just sufficiently 
broad, but not conveniently formed for a horse to travel. There 
were no bridges. The Duke of Atholl, in going from Dunkeld to 
Blair, at that period, was carried in a sedan chair, The journey 
was through the low grounds of the valley of Atholl, a distance of 
twenty-six miles, and took thirteen hours even with the aid of the 
tenants. About 1760, when the roads were a little better improved, 
the Duke travelled the same journey in a carriage drawn with six 
horses, which occupied twelve hours ; the tenants assisting to get the 
vehicle over holes and rivulets. The first bridges built in the parish 
were those over the waters of Dowally and Oishnie, about seventy- 
eight years ago. When the late Duke succeeded to the title, he 
widened the military roads ; and here and there he cut out a new 
and more convenient line, and erected several bridges. There are 
now twenty-seven bridges within the parish. He compelled the 
farmers to follow a mode of rotation in cultivation, and brought t he 
locality, in little more than forty years, into its present improved 
state. At the present day, there is a daily mail to and from In- 
verness, with about twenty weekly carriers. In summer, there 
are five stage-coaches, which pass through the parish, exclusive 
of travelling carriages, &amp;c. to the northern counties. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was erected in 1818, 
nearly on the site of the old one. It is conveniently fitted up.

The iron jowgs, for confining petty offenders, which hung on the 
bit'e of the old church door, were ordered to be replaced at the 
door of the new church, where they now hang as a memorial of 
the rude olden times. On the east wall, are the family arms of 
Bishop Brown, the founder of the church. The burial-yard sur- 
rounds the edifice. 

The Rev. Donald Munro, the Gaelic assistant to the present 
incumbent, resides in Dowally. There is worship every Sunday, 
and the sacrament is dispensed once a- year. The service is per- 
formed both in English and in Gaelic. 

Education. — There was no regular school prior to 1780. The 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge fixed one of their 
schools in the parish, which was productive of great good. After 
it was withdrawn, one of the parishioners opened a school for the 
common branches of education, which he taught up to 1832. 
On an application from the inhabitants to the Atholl trustees, 
they, in 1833, appointed a parochial teacher. The salary is the 
maximum, L.34, 4s. 4|d. with school fees. He has as yet no 
dwelling-house. The school-house, erected in 1836, has been 
found too small, and is to be enlarged. The attendance is irre- 
gular. 

Poor. — The funds are derived from the church collections and 
the mortcloth dues. They are divided monthly among the poor, 
and consequently the division is greater in some months than in 
others. They receive assistance from the farmers. In sickness, 
they are visited by their neighbours, and every relief and attend- 
ance given without ostentation or parade. The Atholl family 
jsrives them fuel and free houses.

These parishes were united in the year 1806. 

Parish of Lethendy. 

I. Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries.— Lethendy is bounded on the east by the parish of 
Blairgowrie ; on the south by Caputh ; and on the west and north 
by Clunie. 

Situation and Extent.— The extent of this parish in a direct 
line from east to west, is 5 miles. Its greatest breadth from south 
to north, 1} mile. It is bounded on the east by the burn of Lu- 
nan, which divides it from the parish of Blairgowrie ; on the south, 
by Caputh, and on the west and north, by Clunie. From 
the eastern extremity, the ground rises gently westward, the whole 
length of the parish, except on the west point, where it falls 
suddenly for about half a mile. 

Soil and Climate.— The west half of the parish is a black mould 
inclining to a reddish clay, excepting some small corners, exceed- 
ingly rich, and well adapted to all kinds of crops. Towards the 
east, the soil becomes blacker, more wet, and less productive. 
From the southern exposure of the parish, the climate is perhaps 
a little milder than that of the parishes immediately adjoining. 
The difference, however, is not material. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The first register extant of the kirk-ses- 
sion of Lethendy commences at the ordination of Mr George 
Freer, 1698; the second in 1754; and the third in 1823. It 
is unfortunate that each of these registers has been devoted to se- 
veral purposes, such as acts of church discipline, collections and 
distributions for the poor, marriages and baptisms, &amp;c. Some of 
the registers have, upon the whole, been well kept, but are much 
injured by having been exposed to damp. Others of them have 
been very carelessly kept for the last twenty or thirty years, owing

very much to the circumstance, it is thought, that, although there 
was a session-clerk, there was no session for the greater part of 
the above period. 

Land-owners. — These are, Andrew Gemmel, Esq. of Lethen- 
dy, valuation L. 830, 15s. Id. Scots; Sir John Muir Mackenzie, 
Bart. Delvine, L.264, 12s. Scots; David Kinloch, Esq. of Gour- 
die, L.165, 4s. Id. 

Antiquities. — The tower of Lethendy, the property of Mr 
Gemmel, is a very old building. It is supposed to have been a 
stronghold, before the use of fire arms was introduced into this 
country; but, upon the whole, it does not appear to have been well 
defended by its situation, especially on the east and south. 

A few years ago, a pot was found in the peat moss at Black- 
loch. It is supposed that it was one of the camp pots used by 
the Romans. It is made of a compound metal, something like 
our brass or bell metal. It stands upon three feet, is about 17 
inches high, is 3 feet 4 inches in circumference, and capable of 
holding about srx Scotch pints. It was found about 6 feet under 
the surface.

the "fifth in 1783; the sixth in 1803; and the seventh in 1823. 
The first of these registers is much decayed, and in many places 
illegible. Upon the whole, they seem to have been well kept, 
but, as the same book has been devoted to different purposes, al- 
though a separate place has been assigned to each, such as acts 
of discipline, collections, and disbursements for the poor, &amp;c. 
the same remark applies here that was made as to the Lethendy 
books.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. ROBERT ALLAN, MINISTER. 

I.— Topography and Natural History. 

The parish of Little Dunkeld is a united parish, consisting of 
Little Dunkeld and the old parish of Laganallachy. Its extent 
from east to west is 16 miles. It is of an irregular form, nearly 
resembling the letter y, the narrow extremity being toward the 
east, and the broad towards the west. It is divided into three 
districts, viz. Murthly, Strathbran, and the Bishoprick, these two 
last diverging from the other near the village of Inver, and sepa- 
rated from each other by a mountainous tract of waste ground. 
Though called Little Dunkeld, it is of much greater extent and 
population than its neighbouring parish of Dunkeld, and has pro- 
bably got its name from the circumstance of there being formerly 
a small village on this side of the Tay opposite to Dunkeld. 
There is an extensive range of hilly ground throughout the pa- 
rish, with a considerable quantity of arable land in the low grounds, 
and which also extends a good way up the face of the mountains 
on each side. The celebrated hill of Birnam rises in majestic 
grandeur, on the southern extremity of the parish, to a very con- 
spicuous elevation, from the top of which there is a fine and ex- 
tensive view of the surrounding country. 

Hydrography. — There are several lakes in the parish, all 
abounding in excellent trout. In one of them Loch Skiach 
there is said to be a good deal of pike. These lakes lie in the 
mountains which separate the two western divisions of the parish. 
The river Bran, which gives its name to the district through which 
it runs, takes its origin from Loch Freuchy, at the south-west ex- 
tremity of the parish. It is precipitous in its course, and has some 
fine cataracts in its progress towards the Tay, which it joins oppo- 
site to Dunkeld. The scenery on the river Bran, for three 
miles above Little Dunkeld, is very romantic. The Rumbling 
Bridge is an object of curiosity to visitors. The bridge is thrown 



1006 



PERTHSHIRE. 



over a deep chasm, under which the river precipitates itself with 
great violence among' the rocks. Farther down is situated the 
Hermitage, as it is called, on the north bank of the river, encircled 
in wood, the property of the Duke of Atholl. Here is another 
cascade; and the place is one of great resort in the summer months 
to strangers. There are guides appointed to conduct through the 
grounds, who receive payment from the visitors. It is to be re- 
gretted that these walks have been long open to visitors on the 
Lord's day. Considerable desecration of the Sabbath is the con- 
sequence, as these Sunday pleasure-parties not only absent them- 
selves from ihe house of prayer, but set a bad example to the in- 
habitants of the district. Application was made some years ago 
to the proper authorities to have the nuisance put a stop to, by 
shutting the walks on the Lord's day. The concession granted 
was, that the gates should be shut " during divine service." 

Woods. — In the districts of Murthly and the Bishoprick, there is 
a considerable extent of woods. The planted trees are, oak, ash, 
Scotch fir, larch, and plane. The indigenous are birch and hazel. 
The oak and fir are of most extent, and also the most profitable. 
The former is divided into coppices, which are successively cut 
down once in twenty years, and affords a good return for land in 
other respects of little value. It fetches a good price for the sake 
of the bark; and, in the summer season, gives employment to a 
good many people. A considerable quantity of Scotch fir and 
larch, of large dimensions, has been cut of late, and sent to Eng- 
land for ship-building. The birch, which gives so much beauty 
to Highland scenery, is nearly extirpated in this parish, and the 
oak is taking its place. At Inver there is a powerful saw-mill, 
driven by water  which gives employment to a good many hands. 
Here there is a very large quantity of timber prepared and exported 
to England for railroads and other purposes. 

Geology. — Near Murthly, in the eastern district of the parish, 
there is a quarry of freestone, of a fine grain, and light ash colour. 
The cathedral of Dunkeld was built of this stone, and also the fine 
bridge which crosses the Tay at Dunkeld. In Birnam hill, there 
is a slate quarry, which furnishes abundance of excellent slate, of 
a deep blue colour, resembling violet. 

Soil. — There is a considerable variety of soil in the parish. 
The best seems to be in the eastern district, consisting generally 
of black loam. In the other districts, the soil is composed partly 
of black mould, and partly of sand and gravel.

II. — Civil History. 

There are but few remains of antiquity in the parish. As is the 
case in several otherHighland parishes, there are to be seen the relics 
of Druidical circles, where our rude ancestors performed their super- 
stitious rites ; and for these remains the people have still a vene- 
ration. On the farm of Balinloan, there is a remarkable stone, of 
large size, called Clach a mhoid, or the stone where the court was 
held. It is said that a baron in the neighbourhood held his court 
here for the trial of offenders, with power to " hang and drown ; 
 Comas cmiche acjus poll ; J and tradition says, that the last baron 
who exercised these functions was not undeserving of one or other 
of these ends himself. There are two very large trees near the 
church, on the bank of the Tay, and said to be the remains of the 
once celebrated forest of Birnam ; the one is oak, the other plane- 
tree, and each about 18 feet in circumference. They are objects 
of curiosity to strangers, and are interesting from their antiquity, 
being the twin survivors of a numerous family long ago departed. 

In a plain on the banks of the Bran, four miles from Dunkeld, 
are to be seen the ruins of the Castle of Trochery, once a resi- 
dence of the Gowrie family. A small circular part of the wall is 
still standing. From its weather-beaten appearance, it must have 
withstood the shock of many a pitiless storm ; but its pride and 
glory have long since passed away, like those of its original owners, 
showing nothing but the melancholy wrecks of time. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Duke of Atholl : 
Sir William D. Stewart; John Stewart, Esq. of Dalguise; and 
Mr Campbell of Kinloeh. 

The valued rent in Scots money is L. 4S05, 16s. 4d. ; and the 
real rental is said to be about L.I 1,620 Sterling 

Parochial Registers. — The register of births and baptisms be- 
gins in 1759 ; and the register of proclamation of banns for mar- 
riage in the same year. 

Mansion Houses. — The principal of these is Murthly Castle, 
the seat of Sir William D. Stewart, Bart, of Grandtully, situated 
about four miles below Dunkeld, on the south side of the Tav. There 
is a new mansion lately erected in front of the old castle, remark- 
able for beauty of design and elegance of architecture. The shell 
of the house, or mason-work, was completed ten years ago ; but 
the rest remains in an unfinished state. The present proprietor 
has expended a considerable sum in levelling the ground in front, 
and transplanting rows of ornamental trees, which, if they thrive 



1008 



PERTHSHIRE. 



will add to the beauty of the site. The situation of Murthly 
Castle, with its undulating grounds and woods, is very fine. The 
whole bears the marks of antiquity, exhibiting an interesting ap- 
pearance, and leading the mind back to the rude ages of feudal 
power. 

The family seat of Mr Stewart of Dalguise is situated in the 
Bishoprick ; the mansion-house is partly old and partly modern, and 
is prettily situated on the left of the public road which leads to Tay- 
mouth. 

Two miles above Dalguise, on the right, is Kinnaird House, 
the residence of the Lady Dowager Glenlyon, the property of the 
Atholl family. It is situated on a rising ground near the bank of 
the river Tay, and the situation is romantic. 

Besides these, there is Birnam Lodge and Birnam Cottage, 
nearly opposite to Dunkeld, — the former the residence of the Ho- 
nourable Fox Maule, the latter of Dr Smyttan, late of India. 
There is also a handsome mansion now being built, in the cottage 
style, by a Perth gentleman Mr Wallace, on the western face 
of a beautiful detached hill called the Torwood. It looks toward 
Dunkeld. The situation is very fine, and the prospect lovely. 

The Bridge of Dunkeld is so well known, that it is not neces- 
sary here to give a minute description of it. It was built in 1809 
by the late Duke of Atholl, assisted by a grant from Government. 
It is a splendid specimen of architecture, and of vast benefit, not 
only to the inhabitants of the surrounding districts, but to the 
country at large. 

Family of Stewart of Dalguise. — The following brief notice of 
the family of Dalguise has been communicated : " This family 
derives its descent from Sir John Stewart of Cardneyand Arntul- 
lie, the youngest natural son of King Robert II., by Marion or Ma- 
riote de Cardney, daughter of John de Cardney of that Ilk, and 
sister of Robert, Bishop of Dunkeld, from 1396 to 1436. 

" From King Robert III. his brother, Sir John Stewart, ob- 
tained a charter of the two Cardneys and Butterston inter lacos, 
dated 12th February 1399. There was also granted to him a 
pension  furth of the customs of Dundee.' He was knighted in 
1424 at the coronation of King James I , and married Jean Drum- 
mond, sister of Arabella, Queen of Robert III. To the Laird of 
Arntullie, bailie of the regality of Dunkeld, the descendant of Sir 
John Stewart, the Regent Earl of Murray, addressed his order 
in 1560, directing him to take down, and burn openly, all the

images in the cathedral, and to cast down the altars and purge the 
church of all monuments of idolatry; but to preserve from de- 
struction the desks, windows, and doors, .the glass and iron-work, 
&amp;c. King James VL, by warrant dated in 159'2 still extant, 
appointed the son of the preceding laird to hold the office of 
bailie, ' as his predecessors had bruicked the same.' 

" The lands of Dalguise in this parish, which had been given 
by King William the Lion, in 1060, to the church of Dunkeld, 
were, in 1543, granted by Bishop Crichton to John Stewart, the 
second son of Stewart of Arntullie, and Elizabeth Stewart his 
wife ; and from them the proprietor is descended. John Stewart, 
the first of Dalguise, who married a daughter of Alexander Stew- 
art of Grandtully, died in 1576, and was buried in the church of 
Little Dunkeld. His next younger brother, Sir Thomas Stewart, 
was vicar of Dowally. John Stewart, grandson of the first laird, 
married Isabel, daughter of William Stewart of Kinnaird. He is 
traditionally remembered in the Gaelic language as Ian Mor 
Macalastair, and was engaged, along with the Atholl Stewarts, 
in most of the military actions of the civil war, under the gallant 
and unfortunate Montrose. He was also, for some time, cham- 
berlain to the Bishops of Dunkeld, and died in 1653. His great- 
great-grandson, John Stewart of Dalguise, was born in 1689. 
Having embraced the cause of the exiled royal family, and after 
being present at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, he was subjected to 
fine and imprisonment. He built the House of Dalguise, which 
bears the date of 1716. Hew Stuart, a younger son of John 
Stewart of Dalguise, was Governor of the British settlement at 
Bencoolen in Sumatra. David Stewart, another of his younger 
sons, was a banker and merchant in Edinburgh, and Lord Pro- 
vost of that city about the year 1 778. John Stewart, the seventh 
laird, having possessed the estate during the long period of seventy 
years from 1706 to 1776, and having attained the age of nearly 
ninety years, greatly beloved and respected, died at Dalguise in 
September 1776. 

" The present proprietor, who is the great-grandson of the last 
mentioned, is employed in the Colonial Civil Service, and resides 
abroad."

There has been a gradual decrease in the population since 1 821 ; 
perhaps partly owing to the decay of the linen trade, which gave 
employment to a great many persons, and perhaps also from the 
system adopted by some of the proprietors, since the passing of 
the Reform Bill, of converting small farms into large. 

The great bulk of the population reside in villages, of which 
there are about twenty-four, the principal of which are Inver, Dal- 
guise, and Balnagard. 

The average of births for the last seven years about 70 ; of mar- 
riages, 16. There is no record kept of burials. The number of 
persons under mental imbecility, 12; deaf and dumb, 1. 

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L.50 
is 6. There is only one of these resident in the parish at present. 

Language. — The language generally spoken in the two most 
populous districts, viz. Strathbran and the Bishoprick, is the Gae- 
lic, which does not seem to be losing ground, though the English 
is more generally understood than formerly. About four-fifths of 
the inhabitants are a Gaelic population, and much attached to 
their vernacular tongue.

constantly waste, . 12500 

which might be improved, 367 

under wood, . . 3204 

Live-Stuck. — The people are chiefly engaged in grazing and ' 
agriculture. There are a good deal of black-cattle reared in the 
parish, which are sold in the southern markets. It is not a sheep 
country, though there are considerable numbers kept by some of the 
tenants, chiefly the black-faced, and some also of the white. The 
breed of cattle cannot be expected to improve while the people 
keep more than their small portions of land can well support, 
though this is chiefly done with the laudable view of meeting the 
yearly demand for rent. 

Bent. — The average rent of land may be stated at L.2, 5s. per 
acre, some of it so high as L.3, and even L.4 per acre. This 
must be far beyond the ability of the people to pay, even 
with that frugality and industry for which they are remarkable. 
When the present low price of produce is considered, the uncer- 
tainty of the crops in this district from unfavourable and late 
seasons, the inferior quality of the grain produced, and the great 
distance from market eighteen to twenty-four miles, the land in 



LITTLE DUNKELD. 1011 

t 

this parish may be set down as among the highest rented in 
the kingdom. The people ate so attached to their native sod, 
that they frequently offer more than the land is worth, which 
keeps them poor, and deprives them of many of the comforts of 
life. In the Strathbran district, until very lately, most of the te- 
nants had no lease but from year to year, nor did they care for any 
lease, considering themselves sure of their lands while they lived 
under their late kind and indulgent landlord, Sir George Stewart; 
and, in many cases, the same farms were possessed by the same 
families for three or four generations. Within the last sixteen 
years, a great extent of waste land has been reclaimed by the in- 
dustry of the tenants, which must have added very considerably to 
the value of the property. Such tenantry deserve encouragement 
and kind treatment from their landlord. Yet it may be observed, 
that letting land only from year to year can be beneficial neither 
to tenant, landlord, nor property. The system of giving leases 
has now been adopted, varying from twelve to nineteen years; and 
the larger farmers follow a rotation generally of five years. The 
crops raised are barley and bear, oats, turnips, and potatoes. 
Wheat growing is hardly ever attempted. The quantity of pota- 
toes raised in this parish is very great, and the quality excellent , 
and, from the preference given to them in the London market, 
vast quantities of them are shipped for that place. The potato 
trade is indeed the great stay of the farmer, though the carriage 
to Perth, the shipping-port, is expensive. 

There are a few as good practical farmers in this parish, per- 
haps, as in Scotland, among whom may be mentioned Mr Grant 
tacksman of Claypotts, and Mr M'Naughton, tacksman of Inch, 
both on the Duke of AtholPs property. In Strathbran there is 
some very good land, especially in the flats, and on the north side 
of the Bran, where there is a southern exposure ; but on the south 
side, the land is spouty and cold, producing late crops. 

The present proprietor in this district Sir W. D. Stewart is 
converting the small farms into large ones. The consequence is, 
that many of the small tenants are turned out of their possessions, 
to shift for themselves and families the best way they can. Some 
of them have sought farms in other parishes, and some have emi- 
grated to Canada, never again expecting to return to the land 
of their nativity, and of their early associations. 

Orchards, — In the Bishoprick, there are several orchards, which 



1012 



PERTHSHIRE. 



produce a considerable quantity of fruit ; but the price has fallen 
so very low, that they are of very little value. 

Fisheries. — Though the parish is bounded on the north for six- 
teen miles by the noble Tay, yet the produce of the fisheries in 
all that " reach" is very trifling. The cause of the failure of the 
salmon is not well understood; for although the fish have many 
snares and enemies to encounter in their progress up the river, 
yet, in spite of all these impediments, were the fish very plentiful, 
they would still find their way up our noble river in abundance 
as in days long gone by. The rents of the fisheries have fallen 
prodigiously, within the last thirty or forty years, to the great loss 
of the proprietors. This trade appears to have been conducted 
with too great cupidity and thirst for gain, and the present state 
of the fisheries may be a just retribution. For many years, most 
of the salmon caught in the Scotch rivers have been sent to the 
London market ; and for the few fish sold at home, very extra- 
vagant prices have usually been demanded ; so that the commu- 
nity in general have little reason to regret the failure. 

Manufactures. — Flax, which was at one time an article of great 
importance in this parish, and afforded employment to a consider- 
able portion of the inhabitants, is now in very few instances grown. 
The linen trade has been in abeyance for many years. There is 
but one lint-mill in the parish. The extensive use of machinery 
in this trade has given a sad blow to the domestic spinning-wheel, 
by which many females earned a comfortable livelihood. The 
vast importation of American cotton, and the increase of that trade 
has occasioned a great fall in the value, and consequently in the 
price of linen manufacture. There are only two linen manufac- 
turers in this parish, both of them active and intelligent men, and 
who are said to do business to the extent of nearly L.2000 each

Market-Town. — There is no market-town within the parish. 
Dunkeld is the chief market-town for the surrounding country. 
There are generally four held yearly. The Martinmas market 
is the chief, and usually attended by great assemblages of people 
from considerable distances. At this market there is a good deal 
of business transacted in the way of buying and selling, engaging 
servants, and other necessary matters. Still these markets are 
attended with evils, from the great gathering of idle and loose 



LITTLE DUNKELD.

characters, who have no real business to transact, and are of no 
use but to swell the number of dram-drinkers. 

Villages, Roads, §•.— There are from twenty to thirty villages 
or hamlets in the parish, with a population in each varying from 
30 to 180 inhabitants. There is a good turnpike road in each of 
the three districts of the parish ; that in Strathbran is ten miles 
long ; the one in the Bishoprick the same ; and in the eastern di- 
vision, about four miles, and all in excellent condition. There is 
a new bridge across the Bran, nearly half-way between Dunkeld 
and Amulree. It crosses the river at a romantic bend of the 
stream, opposite to a beautiful copse of birch which skirts a pretty 
cottage, or shooting-lodge erected by the Murthly family. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated near the 
south bank of the Tay, nearly opposite to Dunkeld, and was built 
in 1798. It is commodious and comfortable. The situation is 
fine. It is nearly surrounded by trees ; and for its neat and simple 
appearance, may be considered a model for Scottish country 
churches. In respect to the population, however, the site is not 
the most eligible. Though seated for upwards of 800, there is 
not the half of that number within three miles of it. The people, 
however, who reside in the different extremities of the parish, 
usually attend the nearest church in the neighbouring parish. 
The mission of Amulree, at the west end of Strathbran, is con- 
nected with this parish, and to which a district of it, comprising 
500 or 600 of Highland population, is attached quoad sacra. The 
sittings are all free. 

The manse was built in 1820, and is rather a handsome modern 
house. There are two glebes ; one at Little Dunkeld, the other 
at the old church of Laganallachy ; the former contains about 
eight acres, the latter about four, but not very valuable ; both 
may be valued at L.20. The stipend is lOgchalders nearly, partly 
meal and partly barley, and L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 
The teinds are said to be exhausted. The stipend is paid ac- 
cording to an interim locality, and is considerably less than in the 
time of the late incumbent, between whom and one of the heritors 
Logiealmond a process had been going on for years. Soon after 
the admission of the present incumbent, and for whom no appear- 
ance was made in court, an interlocutor was pronounced in favour 
of the heritor. 

There is another church in the parish, that of Laganallachy, 
which name may signify " the valley for burying from the two 



1014 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Gaelic words, Lagan and adhlaic ; or it may be connected with 
Aulachy, a traditionary saint. This church is in Strathbran, 
about three miles from Dunkeld, and near the celebrated Rum- 
bling Bridge. It contains from 400 to 500 people. Service is 
performed here once every month, and wholly in Gaelic. 

There is no Episcopalian nor Catholic chapel in the parish, if 
we except a small old and decayed chapel attached to Murthly 
Castle, and lately fitted up for service by the present proprietor. 
It is believed that there is not one other Roman Catholic in the 
parish. There are a very few families in the eastern division of the 
parish who belong to the Secession, and attend a meeting-house 
on the confines of the parish of Kinclaven. These appear to be 
diminishing in number. 

The attendance in the principal church of Little Dunkeld va- 
ries from 400 to 700; the average number of communicants, 740. 

There is a parochial association for religious purposes, which 
distributes annually about L. 20 for the spread of the Gospel at 
home and abroad, and for support of the Assembly's schools. Be- 
sides this, there are occasional collections for other charitable 
purposes, to which the people very readily contribute. 

Education. — The number of schools is seven, of which two are 
parochial, three on the establishment of the Society for Propa- 
gating Christian Knowledge, and of great benefit to the parish. 
The remaining two are private schools. The number of children 
attending these schools during winter may be about 400. The sa- 
lary of the first parish schoolmaster is L.29, 18s. llfd., of the 
other L.10, along with the fees, which are not considerable. 
The salaries of the Society teachers average L. 15; but, their 
schools being situated in populous districts, their fees are consi- 
derable. In all these the expense of education is low. Some 
are taught gratis ; and the schools are so judiciously distributed, 
that the children have easy access to them. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number on the poor 
list is 31. The lowest allowance, 5d. and 6d. weekly, the high- 
est, 2s. 6d. and 3s. The amount annually contributed for' their 
relief is about L.100 ; of which L.24, 10s. arises from church col- 
lections; L.12, 16s. of interest of money in hands of the heritors, 
and belonging to the poor. The rest is raised by voluntary as- 
sessment. 

It may be mentioned, that, " towards the beginning of last 
century, John Stewart, Esq. of Grandtully, mortified the sum of 



LITTLE DUNKELD. 10lD 



20,000 merks Scots, for the support of twelve poor men on 
his estate, of the Scotch Episcopal communion, appointing his 
own heirs, and the heirs of three other families allied to his own, 
administrators of this fund. About 1740, a building was erected 
for the objects of the benefaction in the district of Murthly ; but 
for certain reasons, the original plan was not carried out. In the 
former Statistical Account of this parish it is said that the sum 
had accumulated to L.2600 Sterling— the interest of which is dis- 
tributed among certain poor persons in this and other parishes, 
without regard to their religious creed. 

Library.— There is a small parish library, and the subscription 
is so low that the great body of parishioners have access to it. 

Fuel.— The fuel used by the common people is peat, which ap- 
pears to be abundant, but much of it of inferior quality. The se- 
curing of this necessary of life costs the people much care and la- 
bour. 0 Coals are used by those who are in better condition. These 
are a very expensive fuel, from the extent of land carriage. 

I nns —The number of inns in the parish is 14, too many for 
any parish in the kingdom. Within the compass of one mile, in 
the vicinity of the parish church, there are no less than four. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
This parish may be said to hold its place in the general march 
of improvement since the former Statistical Account was written. 
Ploughing-matches have been long ago introduced ; the rotation 
of crops better understood ; the old clumsy wooden plough has 
almost universally been succeeded by the iron one ; and on some 
of the larger farms, comfortable houses and good offices have been 
erected for the occupiers; yet, we are constrained to say that 
these advantages are, in too many cases, more than counterba- 
lanced by the very high rate at which farms in general are let in 
this parish. The roads in this parish are now excellent.

PRESBYTERY OF AUOHTER ARDER, SYNOD OF PERTH &amp; STIRLING. 

THE REV. PETER BRYDIE, MINISTER. 



■ — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name is found written variously ; formerly it was 
Fossowhey, Fossoquhey, and sometimes Fossoquich ; at present it 
is often Fossaway ;— but the more correct spelling is supposed to be 
Fossoway. The first of these modes of spelling favours the con- 
jecture, that it is composed of two Gaelic words signifying the 
" desert of the deer." Tulliebole is also thought to be of Gaelic 
origin, and to signify " the Poet's hill." 

Extent and Boundaries. — The figureof the parish is very irregular. 
The river Devon forms one of its boundaries to the extent of about 
nine miles. The course which that river here follows is not unlike 
the form of a shepherd's crook, havingthelong end in the low ground 
pointing westward in the direction of Stirling, and the other in the 
Ochil Hills, on the north, pointing nearly due west. The bend 
which the river thus makes is called the " Crook of Devon." The 
lands within its curve, are, as respects the southern and greater 
portion of them, in the parish of Muckart, and the remainder in 
that of Glendovan. Fossoway is wholly on the outside of the 
curve, and stretches from it to the opposite boundary on the north, 
east, and south, to an extent varying from about two to five miles. 
Its greatest length from east to west is about 1 1 miles, and its 
greatest breadth about 10. Besides adjoining the two parishes 
already mentioned, it adjoins Dunning on the north ; Orwell and 
Ki nross on the east ; Cleish and Saline on the south ; and Clack- 
mannan and Dollar on the west. It extends to within a few hun- 
dred yards of the Church of Cleish on the south-east, and to with- 
in about halfamileof that of Glendovan in the opposite direction. 

Topographical Appearances. — Fossoway and Tulliebole, origin- 
ally two separate parishes, were, it is supposed, united about the 
year 1614. The former consists of two extensive districts; the 



POSSOWAY AND TULLIEBOLE. 



1017 



one lying on the south side, and the other on the north side of the 
united parish. These, at the nearest points, are upwards of a 
mile distant from each other. The northern district compre- 
hends, besides several farms of considerable extent, the baronies 
of Fossowav and Carnbo. It was once entirely in Perthshire, 
but the latter barony was, with the exception of one farm belong- 
ing to Stewart of Grandtully, annexed about a century and a half 
ago to the county of Kinross. This district contains a consider- 
able portion of the Ochil Hills. These afford excellent pasture 
for sheep and cattle ; while at the same time they furnish, in the 
intervening valleys, good soil for cultivation. The hills may vary 
in height from about 1000 to 1500 feet above the level of the 
sea. One of them, called Easter Downhill, presents a very pleas- 
ing appearance, especially when viewed from the south or west. 
It is of a conical shape, clothed with verdure to the top, and skirt- 
ed with natural wood around the base, along which, in a deep ra- 
vine, the Devon pursues its winding course. At the bottom of 
this hill the bridge of St Serf, on what was the road to Perth by 
Dunning, till the present turnpike road was formed, less than 
thirty years ago, is still standing, though now much out of repair. 
The hill is of considerable height, and the view from its summit 
in clear weather is very extensive and varied. In respect of 
height and extent of prospect, however, it is surpassed by Inmer- 
downie, which is the highest hill in the parish, and commands at 
once a view of the Forth and of the Tay. 

The southern district of Fossoway is wholly in Perthshire. It 
consists of the barony of Aldie on the east ; of the barony of Sols- 
girth and the lands of Blairngone on the west ; and of the baro- 
nies of Gartwhynean and Pitfar in the middle. Here the wide 
valley, reaching from the Ochil Hills on the north to the hills of 
Cleish and Saline on the south, is divided by the Devon, between 
the parish of Fossoway and that of Muckart. The parish of Tul- 
liebole, however, lying chiefly east of the curve formed by the 
river, extends over the whole breadth of the valley. 

All of Tulliebole belongs to the county of Kinross. It includes 
the baronies of Tulliebole and Coldrain, and the farm of Brier- 
lands. Though the lands in it and the southern branch of Fos- 
soway are low, compared with the hills on the south and north, 
yet comparatively little of them are flat. They rise into ridges of 
different heights, stretching from east to west, and thus form slop- 
ing banks more or less steep.

PERTHSHIRE. 



Hydrography. — Perennial springs of pure water abound through- 
out the parish. There is a petrifying spring on the lands of Devon- 
shaw. But the most remarkable is that which was discovered fif- 
teen years ago on the lands of Blairngone, which has erroneously 
been called " Dollar Water." It has been found wonderfully effica- 
cious in healing cuts, lacerations, and several other external injuries. 

The following extract from a letter of Dr Thomson, Professor 
of Chemistry in the University of Glasgow, of date 1830, will 
show the analysis of the water and its properties : 

" Its specific gravity is 1.0109, and an imperial gallon of it con- 
tains the following ingredients : 

Common salt, . . 5.87 grains. 

Sulphate of soda, . . 170.99 

Sulphate of alumina, . .953.18 

Dipersulphate of iron, . . 1753.10 
Persulphate of iron, . . 141.55 

Silica, . . . 58.70 



Grains, 3083.39 

" It is by far the strongest mineral water I ever heard of, an im - 
perial gallon containing rather more than half a Troy pound of 
salts. It is too strong for internal use, but when diluted suffici- 
ently with water, it might be of service in the numerous diseases 
for which iron and the sulphate of alumina are useful. As an ex- 
ternal application, it would act powerfully as an astringent." 

The Devon, which rises in the Ochils, and, after a long and de- 
vious course, empties itself into the Forth, is the only current of 
water connected with the parish that deserves the name of" River." 
There are, however, several other streams which have their rise 
either in the parish or on its boundary, and which, like the Devon, 
are well supplied with trout. The chief of these are the north 
and south Queichs and East Gairney, which run into Lochleven, 
and the West Gairney, which joins the Devon below the Caldron 
Linn. 

Cascades. — To strangers, the great objects of attraction be- 
longing to this parish are the Rumbling Bridge and Caldron Linn. 
These are so fully described in the Old Statistical Account, that 
it is deemed unnecessary to say much of them here. With re- 
spect to the former, however, it is proper to state, that, while the 
original bridge remains entire, there is now another bridge cor- 
responding with the turnpike road passing that way, standing di- 
rectly above it ; and that the adjoining scenery is inspected with 
much greater convenience and effect than formerly, owing to the 



FOSSOWAY AND TULLIEBOLE. 1019 

formation of walks, which conduct the visitor in safety to the dif- 
ferent points whence the most striking views are obtained. 

Mineralogy.— There are whin and freestone quarries in several 
parts of the parish. In the west end of it there are lime rock, 
iron ore, and coal. At present three collieries are in operation. 
The colliery of Blairngone is of very long standing ; the working 
of the other two commenced but recently. The work at the iron- 
stone mine was, for a considerable number of years, till about two 
months ago, actively prosecuted. A mixture of copper is found 
in a rock near the Rumbling Bridge, but it appears that the pro- 
portion which the copper bears to the alloy is not sufficient to ren- 
der the working of it advantageous. 

Soils.— There is great diversity of soil in the parish. In some 
parts it is mossy, in others gravelly, in some places clayey, and in 
others loamy. Some of it is of good quality, while not a little of 

it is very inferior. 

Botany.— There is a good deal to interest the botanist here. 
The following are some of the plants found in the district :— 

Circa alpina Rumex saxatilis Vicia sylvatica 

Veronica montana Nymphaea alba Hieracium umbellatum. 

Gentiana campestris Butomus umbellatus 

Rumex alpinus Geranium pratense 

There are some fine old trees in the parish, but none of them of 
very remarkable size. Within these few years, much of the larch 
fir has appeared to be in a back-going state. Till then, the cul- 
tivation of it was accounted profitable. Spruce and Scotch fir, 
ash, elm, plane, and beech thrive well. Oak, till of late years, 
was not much reared ; where it has been tried, however, it promises 
well. 

II. — Civil History. 
Till the year 1729, there was a church for each parish, and the 
minister officiated every third Sabbath in the church of Tnlliebole. 
In that year, a new church was built in a more central situation, to 
accommodate the inhabitants of both parishes. The spot fixed 
on is on the south of the Devon, in the western part of Tulliebole, 
about a mile and a-half west from the former church of that pa- 
rish, and about two miles south from the old church of Fossoway. 
Soon after the erection of the church in its present situation, the 
glebe and manse of Fossoway were sold, but the churchyard was 
retained ; and in it, as well as in that of Tulliebole, some of the 



 The late proprietor of Briglands, Thomas Young, Esq., got it scientifically ex- 
amined, and had in his possession some very neat seals made of it. 



1020 



PERTHSHIRE. 



parishioners still bury their dead. But, though the manse of Old 
Fossoway thus ceased to be the residence of the minister, it has 
continued to be inhabited. It was lately thoroughly repaired and 
somewhat enlarged, and now forms a very commodious dwelling 
for a genteel family ; it is pleasantly situated on the sunny side of 
the Ochils, near the bank of the Devon. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners of this parish are numerous. 
Thirty-seven of them are severally possessed of property in the 
parish, amounting to upwards of L. 50 of yearly value. The 
principal proprietors are, Baroness Keith of Aldie ; William Scott 
Moncrieff of Fossoway; Sir James W. Moncreiffof Tulliebole : and 
Captain William Patton of Devonshaw. The two last- mention- 
ed have family mansions in the parish, the former being oc- 
casionally, and the latter constantly resident. The family resi- 
dence of the former is the castle of Tulliebole, built in the year 
1608. 

Antiquities.— The Castle of Aldie, built in the sixteenth cen- 
tury, though for long uninhabited, is still standing, with its walls 
and roofing entire. The ancestors of the Duke of Athole had 
once a family residence on the lands of Blairngone, but no trace of 
it now remains. A portion of the lands, together with the col- 
liery, however, still belongs to his Grace. 

III. — Population. 

The population by the return to Dr Webster in 1755 was 1765 
by former Account, . . \505 

by census . . 1821, 1346 

1831, 1576 

1841, 1724, 881 males, 843 fern. 

The increase of population of late years has been chiefly owino- to 
the working of the ironstone mines, and the demand for labourers 
arising from agricultural improvement. About 700 reside in vil- 
lages. Yearly average of births for the last seven years, 58 ; ave- 
rage of marriages, 10. No register of deaths is kept. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The land cultivated, or occasionally in tillage, mav 
amount to 8690 Scotch acres ; and the land which has never been 
cultivated, and which remains constantly waste or in pasture, to 
5425. So much progress has already been made in adding to'the 
cultivated land, that it is not supposed above 300 acres remain 
that would likely remunerate for the outlay required for its im- 
provement. There are about 75 acres of undivided common, and 
about 600 under wood.

POSSOWAY AND TULLIEBOLE. 



1021 



iZ.—The average rent of arable land in the parish is L. 1 per 
acre Scotch. The real rental of all the land in the parish amounts 
to about L. 9700. The average of grazing is about L.3, 15s. for 
each cow, and 4s. 6d. for each sheep per annum. 
The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 
The farm-houses, with very few exceptions, are good and com- 
fortable dwellings. The fences are generally stone dikes; the 
thorn hedge is also partly used. The wire fence, with wooden 
posts, has of late been introduced to a considerable extent on the 
estate of Fossoway. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toivns. — The nearest market and post-town to the east 
end of the parish is Kinross ; and to the west end, Dollar. The 
former is six miles from the parish church, and the latter about five. 

The principal villages are Blairngone and Crook of Devon. 
These, as stated in the former Account, are boroughs of barony. 
There is also a small village at Easter Gartwhynean. 

Means of Communication. — The turnpike road from Dunferm- 
line to Crieff intersects the parish from south to north, and that 
from Kinross to Alloa from east to west, passing near the parish 
church. Parallel with the latter, and about two miles to the north, 
another turnpike passes through the parish, being the road from 
Stirling to the eastern district of Fife. The turnpike road to 
Dunning also passes through a part of the parish. At one time a 
public coach from Perth to Glasgow, and another from Crieff to 
Edinburgh, travelled through the parish. But for some years, there 
has been no public conveyance to be had nearer than Kinross, 
Dunfermline, or Alloa. The parish does not thus enjoy great fa- 
cility of communication with other parts of the country. The 
want of a post-office is felt to be a great inconvenience. 

Bridges. — There are six bridges on the Devon connected with 
this parish. Of these four belong to turnpike roads, and two to 
county roads. All of them are kept in good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Till the opening of the Extension church 
at Blairngone, about five years ago, the parish church was the 
only place of public worship within the parish. Though it could 
not have been placed in a more central situation, yet it is above 
five miles from some of the extremities of the parish. It was built 
in 1806, and is commodious and in good repair. It affords ac- 
commodation for 525 persons, allowing 18 inches to each. The 
manse was built in 1781, repaired and a little enlarged in 1827, 



1022 



PERTHSHIRE 



and is in a good and comfortable state. The glebe is about 12 
Scotch acres in extent, and may be valued at about 12s. per acre. 
The stipend is L. 70, 3s. and about six chalders of victual, 
half meal, half barley, payable according to the fiars of the county. 

The number of householders in the parish at the time of the 
last census was 372. Of these 309 belong to the Established 
Church ; 59 to the United Secession Church ; 2 to the Synod of 
Original Seceders ; and 2 to the Roman Catholics. 

In favourable weather, divine service is well attended at the Es- 
tablished Church. The number of communicants since the erec- 
tion of the new parish of Blairngone in 1841 is upwards of 300 ; 
before that time, it was from 400 to 500. There are some con- 
tributions yearly for the General Assembly's schemes, and for the 
purpose of education in the parish. 

The Extension church already mentioned was opened for public 
worship in the spring of 1838. It is situated in the west end of 
the parish, a little east from the village of Blairngone, and about 
four miles from the parish church. The ground on which it stands 
was given gratuitously by Mark Watt, Esq.— that gentleman, in 
addition to a handsome subscription, having generously made us a 
present of half-a Scotch acre of land. The church was used for 
some time as a preaching station, the minister of the parish offici- 
ating in it when his presence was required to administer the ordi- 
nance of baptism. 

By the constitution of this church, agreed to at a meeting of the 
subscribers on 28th October 1839, the boundary between the 
proposed new parish and the parish of Fossoway was fixed ; one 
article containing these words, in reference to this point, that 
the parochial territory of the church of Blairingone shall be 
'' That part of the parish of Fossoway lying to the west of a line 
from the conflux of the Garney and the Devon, immediately by 
the east of the house of Barnhill, to the southern boundary of the 
parish." But, after this agreement, an attempt was unhappily made 
to extend the boundary much nearer to the parish church. This 
attempt, however, was successfully resisted, and the matter 
finally settled by the Presbytery, acting under a remit to them by 
the General Assembly at their meeting in December 1840, when 
they determined to hold by " the original boundary agreed upon 
by the subscribers." The population within that part of the pa- 
rish of Fossoway thus assigned was, at the last census, 558, most 

4 



FOSSOWAY AND TULLIEBOLE. 



1023 



of whom are above four miles from the church of Fossoway. 
These, and the inhabitants of the adjoining districts of the pa- 
rishes of Clackmannan, Dollar, and Muckart, form a population 
as numerous as the church of Blairngone can accommodate, it 
being seated for from 200 to 300. 

The necessary steps having thus been taken, the present in- 
cumbent was ordained minister of Blairngone in autumn 1841. 
He holds a bond for L.60 per annum, payable from the seat-rents 
and church-door collections. 

Education.— There are 4 schools in the parish. Of these, one 
is parochial, two are on the teachers' own adventure, and one is 
aided by a small sum raised by individual subscription. The 
branches taught are, Latin, English, writing, arithmetic, and prac- 
tical mathematics. The parochial teacher has the maximum 
salary, house, garden, and a few acres of land. The land was pur- 
chased with vacant stipend, and a small sum borrowed from the 
poor's funds, for which the teacher pays interest. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of paupers 
in the parish is about 11. At present there are only eight on the 
roll, the average allowance to each of whom is about L.4, 7s. 
yearly. The funds for their support, and for occasional aid to 
others, arise from the collections at the parish church, interest of 
money, donations from heritors, and burying-ground sold in the 
church-yard. Many of the poor, but not all, manifest a reluct- 
ance to apply for parochial aid. 

Pairs. — There are two fairs kept in the parish yearly, at which 
a few cattle and some small wares are exposed for sale. 

Inns, Sfc. — There are 14 inns or public-houses in the parish. 
It appears that three would be sufficient for the accommodation of 
travellers. The increased number of these houses tends very much 
to deteriorate the morals of the people. 

p ue l,— The fuel in general use in the 'parish is coal procured 
within the parish itself. Peats are also used, but to a smal 1 ex- 
tent.

extends about 9 miles in length and 4 in breadth. It is bounded 
by a section of the parish of Blairgowrie on the north ; the united 
parishes of Lethendy and Kinloch, on the east; and the parish of 
Caputb, on the south and west. 

Topographical Appearances.— The parish is supposed to con- 
tain upwards of 8000 acres, and exhibits great variety of climate, 
surface, scenery, and soil. The arable parts comprehend, pro- 
bably, about from 2000 to 3000 acres. The soil, though light 
and gravelly in many parts, affords good crops of oats, barley, and 
wheat, equal to any in the neighbourhood. Upon the estates of 
several proprietors in the parish much has been done in planting. 
Hundreds of acres, not many years ago covered with heath, furze, 
broom, and brushwood, are now crowned with beautiful thriving 
plantations of fir and larch. 

mountain in the parish, commands a 
most extensive and varied prospect. At the foot of Benachally 
is a loch of the same name, about one mile in length and a-half- 
mile in breadth. 

II. — Civil History. 
Four miles to the south is the Loch of Clunie, having a beautiful 
little island, on which stands an old castle belonging to the Earl of 
Airly. On the island is the site of an old chapel. There are the re- 
mains of three others yet visible in different parts of the parish. The 
Loch of Clunie is from two to three miles in circumference, and 
abounds with trout, perch, and pike. Its greatest depth is about 
seventy-four feet. The castle on the island is said to have been 
the birth-place of the Admirable Crichton. On the west side of the 
loch stands the old Castle Hill, a large green mound, on the top of 
which are the ruins of an old building, said to have been the sum-

mer palace of King Kenneth Macalpin. Close by this beautiful 
mound stand the parish church and manse. 

Curiosities and Antiquities. — In the face of Benachally, which 
looks towards the east, there is a cave of considerable magnitude. 
It is called the Drop, or Drop, from the water oozing through 
the crannies, and perpetually dropping from the roof. Below the 
Drop, and near the foot of the mountain, is a cove, called Henry's 
Hole, from its having been in former times the hiding-place of 
robbers or plunderers of that name. A little to the north of 
Stanley Know, there is a rising ground styled the Gallow Drum 
and about 300 yards south-west of the minister's glebe is another 
eminence, named the Gibbet Know, both which were places of 
execution in the times of baronial jurisdiction. On the east 
side of the moss, at the foot of Benachally, we find a sepulchral 
cairn which has never been opened ; and a few furlongs to the 
southward of this cairn, there is a great number of small cairns- 
There are two immense collections of stones, one on the south- 
west, and the other on the north-east extremity of the parish. 
These are said to have marked the boundary here between the 
Caledonian and Pictish kingdoms. At the east end of the Hill 
of Gourdie, in the middle of a cultivated field, may be seen a cu- 
rious piece of antiquity, called the Steeds-stalls. It consists of 
eight mounds, with eight corresponding trenches ; perhaps some 
more have been obliterated by the plough. The mounds and 
trenches are of equal length, alternate, and parallel. At the 
south end of each trench or fosse, there is a circular concave, the 
centre of which lies in the line of the fosse, and to this circular 
concavity the fosse seems to have formed the entrance. It is 
said that an advanced guard of the Caledonian army was posted 
here, to watch the motions of the Romans, when they lay en- 
camped at Inchtuthill, about two miles to the southward in the 
plain below. 

Mansion- Houses. — There are two that merit description. 
Forneth, the seat of James Speid, Esq. stands on the north-west 
bank of the Loch of Clunie, on a fine elevation, commanding a 
small but beautiful prospect of the island, the loch, and the ad- 
jacent grounds. The Lunan, washing, in gentle meanders, the 
foot of the bank, steals softly into the loch, a little below the 
house. Gourdie, the seat of David Kinloch, Esq. is a large, con- 
venient, and substantial house, beautifully situated. The prospect 
from it is delightful Immediately under the eye, you see the

cent house of that name, rising on a woody bank about a mile and 
a-half to the south.

There are 189 families in the parish. One family is Episco- 
palian, but regularly attends the parish church. Three families, 
with a few other persons, belong to the Secession church, and at- 
tend their own place of worship in the immediate neighbourhood. 
All the families, however, with these exceptions, are connected 
with the Establishment. 

IV. — Industry. 

Great improvements in agriculture have been for some time 
taking place. Wet grounds have been drained, rough grounds 
cleared, stone fences built, and hedges planted. Lime is brought 
from the quarry and lime-kilns upon the Gourdie estate, be- 
longing to David Kinloch, Esq. Rich clays are applied to sand, 
and a good permanent soil formed where there was no soil before ; 
green crops begin to be raised, and a regular rotation of crops 
begins in some places to be understood. The valued rent of the 
parish is about L.4000 Scots money. 

With one or two exceptions, the farms in general are small. 
Few of them probably rent above L 200 Sterling, and the greater 
part of them are under L.100. Each plough, at an average, turns 
annually about twenty-seven acres; and the rent of the infield 
acre varies according to the quality of the soil, &amp;c. from 10s. to 
L.2, 10s. The parish, besides supplying itself, exports a quantity 
of victual to Perth, Dunkeld, and the Highlands. The staple 
grain is oats and barley. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was erected in 1840. 
It is a most substantial building, of the Gothic style of architec- 
ture, with a handsome ornamental tower. The church accom- 
modates about 600 people, and was built entirely at the heritors' 
expense, who have shown great taste and much liberality in the 
erection of a place of worship every way so comfortable. 

The manse was built about forty years ago. There was, how- 
ever, an addition made to it in 1839, with several extensive alte- 
rations and repairs, which have rendered the present manse both 



CLUNIE. 



1027 



a convenient and comfortable dwelling. The offices were re- 
paired at the same time by the heritors of the parish, who in every 
way have been forward to promote the comfort of the present in- 
cumbent. 

A part of the stipend is payable at the term of Martinmas in 
money. The greater proportion, however, is a grain stipend. The 
amount exceeds the minimum. 

Including the area of manse, offices, and garden, the glebe 
contains about six acres of ground inclosed. The Duke of Athole 
and the Earl of Airly are vice-patrons. 

Education — There is a good dwelling-house and school-room 
for the parochial teacher, both of which were repaired in 1840. 
The school-room is large and commodious, having attached to it 
a considerable extent of play-ground for the use of the scholars. 
At present there are about 40 young people taught the ordinary 
branches of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Two only at pre- 
sent are learning Latin. The teacher receives the maximum salary. 

There is, besides, a chance school in the parish, taught by two 
females. The girls attending this school learn knitting and needle- 
work. The number of scholars at present is 51. 

A Sabbath-school is taught by the minister. The number of 
names upon his list at present is from 80 to 90. 

Library. — A library has been established for about two years 
in the parish. The wish having been expressed by the minister 
from the pulpit, that a library might be established for the benefit 
of the parish, and a collection having been intimated for that 
object, the people came willingly forward and contributed to the 
large amount of L.20 and upwards. Several handsome donations 
of books have since been given. 

Poor.— The parish supports its own poor. The number of 
poor and infirm at present upon the list is 10. There are others, 
however, receiving occasional assistance. The poor receive from 
3s. to 6s. each per month, besides aid in fuel, clothing, and house- 
rent, as circumstances require. The money is distributed by 
the kirk-session. Church-door collections, which average each 
Sabbath about 8s ; the use of the mortcloth, the purchase 
of burial-ground, occasional legacies and donations, and the 
interest of a principal of L.80 in the bank,— are the sources 
from which the session funds are derived. By the late minister, 
the Rev. William M'Ritchie, a sum of about L.50 was left in the 
hands of the kirk-session, the interest of which, according to the

intention of the benevolent donor, is annually expended in coal 
for the behoof of the industrious poor of his native parish. The 
farmers drive the coal from Perth free of expense.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. WEIR TULLOCH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name which is commonly given to this parish by 

strangers is Tibbermuir, and sometimes Tippermuir ; but the pro- 
per name is undoubtedly Tibbermore ; for we find it written in a 
charter granted by William the Lion, Tibbermoria; in Fordun's 
History, Tybbermore ; and in a very ancient tombstone in the 
wall of the church, Tibbermire. This word signifies a great well, 
referring, in all probability, to a perennial spring that once issued 
from behind the church, and was long known by the name of " the 
Lady Well," but which has lately been carried away by the drain- 
ing of the adjacent field. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is about six and a-half 
miles in length, and from one to three in breadth. It contains about 
4700 Scots acres ; and is bounded on the north by the Pow and 
the Almond, which separate it from Methven and Redgorton ; on 
the east by the Tay and Perth ; on the south by Aberdalgie and 
Forteviot ; and on the west by Gask. 

Topographical Appearances. — This parish lies behind the high 
ridsre which bounds the north of Strathearn, and falls with 
a gradual declivity down to a level plain which is watered by 
the Pow and the Almond. The greater part of it, therefore, has 
a northern exposure. On the west there are several old planta- 
tions of Scotch fir, the wood of which is said to be of excellent 
quality. There is a considerable extent of uncultivated moor, and 
a peat-moss, from which the farmers on the barony of Cultmalun- 
die have a right to cut turf for fuel. 

The eastern portion of the parish is studded with a number of 
neat comfortable houses, the seats of resident proprietors, most of 



TIBBEKMOlf E. 



1029 



which are surrounded with young thriving plantations, which add 
greatly to the beauty of the general landscape. But the most re- 
markable feature of the parish is a large plain or valley, which 
ginks down abruptly to a considerable depth below the surround- 
ing country. It is about three miles long ; and from a-quarter to 
three-quarters of a mile broad. On the south, north, and west, 
it is bounded by precipitous banks, rising from 50 to J 00 
feet high, while, on the east, it opens out into a level plain, which 
stretches onwards to the Tay. On digging a well into it lately, 
there was found beneath a thick bed of gravel, sand, and clay, a 
considerable depth of peat-moss. This fact, together with the 
general appearance of the banks, would almost seem to indicate 
that in some remote age it had been the basin of a fresh water 
lake. Now, however, it is the site of two of the most thriving es- 
tablishments in the parish. 

Hydrography. — The parish seems once to have contained seve- 
ral wells of considerable note. One of the most celebrated of these 
was situated in the eastern part of the parish, at a place called the 
" Hole of Ruthven," in the neighbourhood of Perth. The civil and 
ecclesiastical records of that city testify that this well was long the 
source of great annoyance both to magistrates and ministers. Its 
virtues were so famous, that neither the authority of the one, nor the 
admonitions of the other, although most rigorously applied, could 
deter the citizens from frequently trying their efficacy. The 
name of the place still remains, but the well has long since lost 
not only its fame, but its existence. 

The river Almond bounds the parish on the north. It is describ- 
ed at full length in the accounts of the parishes of Methven and Red- 
gorton. There is a stream of water taken orf from this river, which 
runs through the parish. The dike or weir thrown across the 
river, at the point where this stream leaves it, is called " Low's 
Wark," and none can tell the origin of this name. We find from 
various indentures written upwards of three centuries ago, that the 
stream of water which issues from the Almond at " Low's Wark," 
was then, as it still is, called the " Mill- Lead," and that the family 
of Ruthven, with the town of Perth, and the proprietor of Balhousie, 
had mills upon it. Its great object seems, however, to have been to 
drive the mills of Perth, for it appears, from a charter of confirma- 
tion granted by James VI., 15th November 1600, that this aque- 
duct was regarded as belonging exclusively to the community of 



1030 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Perth, although there can be no doubt that long before this the 
family of Ruthven and the Eviots of Balhousie had, by special 
grant or otherwise, acquired a right to mills upon the course of it. 
The community of Perth still possess their ancient rights over the 
" Lead," and a committee of the town-council perambulate its 
banks every year, to see that they are kept in proper repair. The 
utility of this Lead has been greatly extended in modern times. 
Instead of the three mills which it originally drove, it now affords 
sufficient water power to drive the machinery of Huntingtower 
bleachfield, the Ruthven mills and Ruthven printfield, in the parish 
of Tibbermore ; and the Tulloch printfield, the Balhousie mills, 
and the Perth mills, in the parish of Perth. 

Geology. — This parish, like most of the neighbouring, rests 
upon the red sandstone formation. In two or three places the 
sandstone is penetrated by trap dikes of considerable extent, 
where excellent quarries have been opened for making and repair- 
ing roads. The sandstone also is deemed of very superior 
quality, and has been quarried to a great extent. There are three 
quarries, which have been in operation for a number of years, and 
from which most of the stones used for building in Perth and the 
neighbourhood have been taken. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical events. — This parish has been the site of several his- 
torical events of no small importance ; but, as most of them are 
rather national than local, they are to be found detailed at length 
in all our Scottish histories, and, therefore, it is not necessary to 
give any particular account of them in a work of this description. 
It was here that Gowrie, Mar, Lindsay, and the master of Glamis 
perpetrated that assault upon the liberty of James VI., which is 
commonly called the Raid of Ruthven. The castle where the King 
was first seized and for a time confined, is still standing and in con- 
siderable repair. It is now the property of General Cunningham, 
and was then called Ruthven, but now Huntingtower Castle. It was 
here that the Covenanters under Lord Elcho sustained a signal 
defeat from Montrose with his Irish auxiliaries. The raw untrain- 
ed bands which had been hastily raised in Fife, Perth, and Angus 
to oppose Montrose, were encamped in the south of the parish on 
the night before the battle, where traces of this encampment are still 
in some places distinctly visible. There were indeed within these 
few years, men alive in the parish, who well remembered that it was 

3 



TIB BE K MO RE. 



1031 



in their youth no uncommon thing for those engaged in trenching 
the ground in the neighbourhood to find gun bullets, broken 
spears, and many other memorials of this disastrous battle. 

Land-owners.— Until lately, this parish was divided into two 
large baronies, Huntingtower and Cultmalundie, and, with the 
exception of about 500 acres, was entirely possessed by the Duke 
of Athole and the Earl of Kinnoul. The barony of Cultmalun- 
die is still the property of the Earl of Kinnoul, who, besides this, 
has recently purchased several other properties in the parish, so 
that he now possesses nearly twelve-twentieths of the whole pa- 
rish. He has no seat in the parish ; but Dupplin Castle, his fa- 
mily residence, is in the immediate neighbourhood. The barony 
of Huntingtower was broken down into a number of small pro- 
perties, and sold by the late Duke of Athole, upwards of thirty 
years ago. These properties were chiefly purchased by men who 
made their own fortunes, and were the founders of their own 
families. Those heritors who possess land in the parish of the 
vearly value of L.50 and upwards, besides the Earl of Kinnoul, 
are General Cunningham of Newton and Huntingtower ; the 
Glover Incorporation, proprietors of Tullilum ; Thomas Ritchie, 
Esq. of the Hill of Ruthven and South Black Ruthven ; William 
Dron, Esq. of North Black Ruthven and Marlefield ; the Rev. 
Dr Thomson of Ruthven Farm ; William S. Turnbull, Esq. of 
Ruthven mills ; Thomas Duncan, Esq. of Ruthven Field ; Mrs 
Black of Law Grove ; John Martin, Esq. of Newhouse ; Thomas 
Millar, Esq. of Letham ; James Macmillan, Esq. of Alexanderia; 
D. S. M'Lagan, Esq. of Ruthven House. Huntingtower bleach- 
field is the joint property of Robert Smythe, Esq. of Methven, 
and Sir John Richardson of Pitfour. 

Parochial Registers. — Our parochial registers do not extend 
farther back than 1724 , nor do they appear to have been kept 
with great regularity for a considerable time after that period. 
For the last thirty years, however, there has been a regular 
entry made of most of the births, deaths, baptisms, and marriages 
in the parish. 

Antiquities. — Huntingtower Castle is a very ancient build- 
ing, but it does not appear to have ever been a place of great 
strength. It is chiefly interesting as the seat of the Gowrie 
family, who long performed a conspicuous part in the busi- 
ness of the nation. Besides the Raid of Ruthven, and other 
public transactions connected with this castle, tradition has 



132 



PERTHSHIRE. 



preserved the memory of a private exploit which has contri- 
buted in no small degree to its renown. The story, as told in 
Pennant's Tour, is this, " A daughter of the first Earl of Gow- 
ne was courted by a young gentleman of inferior rank, whose 
pretensions were not countenanced by the family. When a visitor 
at the castle, he was always lodged in a separate tower from the 
young lady. One night, however, before the doors were shut, 
she conveyed herself into her lover's apartment, and some prying 
duenna acquainted the Countess with it, who, cutting off, as she 
thought, all possibility of retreat, hastened to surprise them. The 
young lady's ears were quick ; she heard the footsteps of the old 
Countess ; ran to the top of the leads, and took the desperate 
leap of 9 feet 4 inches over a chasm of 60 feet, and luckily lighting 
on the battlements of the other tower, crept into her own bed, 
where her astonished mother found her, and of course apologized 
for her unjust suspicion. The fair daughter did not choose to 
repeat the leap, but the next night eloped and was married." 
The place between the two towers is still familiarly known as the 
MaiderHs Leap. This castle, with the adjoining barony, became 
the property of the Athole family by a marriage with the Tulli- 
bardine family, who had received it from James VI. after its for- 
feiture by the Gowrie Conspiracy. It is now a mere appendage 
to a small portion of the ancient barony, and is let to a baker, who 
has converted the lower flat into dwelling-houses, and the upper 
flats into granaries for wheat, &amp;c. 

Tibbermore was the residence of several bishops of Dun- 
keld, particularly of Bishop Geoffrey and Bishop Sinclair, who 
both died here, the one in the year 1249, the other in 1337. 
During their times, the principal place of worship belonging 
to this parish was the Church of St Servanus, commonly called 
St Serf's Chapel, situated on the north side of the river Almond, 
and now within the parish of Redgorton. The desertion of this 
church is ascribed, by tradition, to the melancholy accident of a 
child of the Lord of Ruthven, who had been baptized there, hav- 
ing, on the way home, been drowned in the Almond. 

III. — Population. 
In 1841, there were in the parish 359 families, consisting of 
814 males and 847 females, in all 1661, being an increase on the 
population of 1831 of 437. This increase is to be accounted for 
by the revival of Ruthven printfield, which had been, for a num- 



T1BBEIIMORE. 



1033 



ber of years, dormant, during which the population fell from 1634, 
which was its amount in 1821, to 1223, its amount in 1831. 

Character and Habits of the People.— The employments of the 
people are very various, and their characters are in no small de- 
gree influenced by their respective avocations. They may be di- 
vided into three great classes,— agriculturists, bleachers, and 
printers. With the exception of about twenty farmers, the agri- 
cultural population consists of ploughmen and cottars. There is 
some reason to fear that these last named classes are neither so 
intelligent nor so moral as they were fifty years ago. The bothy 
system and the practice of our great landed proprietors accumu- 
lating on their estates great quantities of game, are daily producing 
havoc on the morals of our agricultural population. Migratory- 
habits also operate most perniciously upon their general character. 
Most of them change their master and also their parish every year, 
so that it is scarcely possible to bring any of the usual means of 
religious instruction to bear with effect upon them. 

The bleachers are perhaps the most moral and religious portion of 
our population. Many of them live and die in the place where they 
were born. A strong attachment exists betwixt them and their 
respected employer, who maintains an affectionate but very firm 
discipline among them. Their temperate habits, their constant 
employment, and their regularly paid, though by no means high 
wages, enable them to maintain their families in comparative com- 
fort, and to give their children a respectable education ; and the 
result of this is, that fewer cases of scandal and fewer instances of 
abject poverty are to be found among them than in any other class 
in the parish. The character and habits of our calico-printers 
are, I believe, very similar to those in other parishes where they 
are to be found. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — -The parish contains about 
4070 Scots acres. The whole is arable, and in a high state of 
cultivation, with the exception of about 200 acres, which are un- 
der wood, and about 150 acres covered with heath and peat-moss. 

Rent of Land. — In the neighbourhood of Perth, there is some 
land let as high as L.5, 10s. per acre, while there is some in the 
parish as low as L.l. There are several farms let on a grain rent, 
which, of course, varies every year. On an average, the rent of 
the parish may be said to be from L.3 to L.l, 10s. per Scots 
acre. The valued rent of the whole parish is L.4921 Scotch 



1034 



PERTHSHIRE. 



money ; the real rent, as nearly as can be calculated, about 
L. 10,700 Sterling. 

Husbandry. — There is a considerable diversity of soil in this pa- 
rish. Upon the banks of the Almond, it is a sandy loam ; in the 
neighbourhood of Perth, it becomes stronger, and approaches to clav ; 
on the higher grounds, it is light and thin, on a gravelly bottom ; 
towards the west, there is some deep dry black land, of an excel- 
lent quality ; but the greater proportion is on a tilly subsoil, which 
renders it naturally damp. Our farmers are all men of capital 
and intelligence, and in general manage their farms according to 
the most approved modern systems. Draining has already been 
carried to a great extent on the wet soils, and is still going on 
with great vigour. Turnip husbandry is universally followed on 
those soils which are fit for it ; and the practice of resting the 
land, by allowing it to be two or three years in pasture, is now be- 
come very general. By these means the average produce is great- 
ly above what it was twenty years ago. The gross value, as nearly 
as can be ascertained, is as follows : — 

Wheat, . . L.4400 0 0 

Pease, . 960 0 0 

Barley, . . 41 16 0 0 

Oats, . 5883 0 0 

Potatoes, . . 4185 0 0

Quarries, . . 600 0 0 

Miscellaneous produce, 1360 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, L 28,904 0 0 

Manufactories. — As early as 1774, Huntingtowerfield was form- 
ed for the purpose of bleaching linen cloth. This work was car- 
ried on with great spirit and success for forty years, by Messrs 
Richardson and Co., when it was let by the present proprietors, 
Sir John Richardson of Pitfour, and Robert Smythe, Esq. of 
Methven, to Messrs William Turnbull and Son. Under the 
energy and activity of the present lease-holder, the work has now 
become one of the first in Scotland. At present about 40 Scotch 
acres are covered with cloth. The quantity whitened annually is 
about a million and a-half of yards, besides from 80 to 100 tons of 
linen yarn for a power-loom factory in the neighbourhood. The 
number of people employed is about 150, of whom nearly one-third 
are women and boys. 

Immediately below this work, on the same Lead, are the flour 
and barley-mills, the property of Mr Turnbull, the tacksman of the 
bleachfield, at which a considerable amount of business is done. 



TIRBEBMORE. 



1035 



Rutbven printfield occupies the next waterfall on the Lead. 
About sixty years ago, this waterfall was employed in turning an 
oil-mill, when Messrs Ross, Barland, Meliss, and Co. obtained a 
lease of the premises from the late Duke of Atholl, and erected 
upon it a bleachfield, which they carried on for a considerable 
time. They sold their lease to Messrs Young, Ross, Rich- 
ardson, and Co., who soon afterwards became proprietors of 
the place, and converted it into a printfield. This business was 
carried on by them for many years with great success, and to a 
very great extent. From 1000 to 1200 people were constantly 
employed at it, who printed goods to the value of nearly half a 
million Sterling annually. At length this company resolved to 
wind up their extensive and very prosperous business, and to sell 
the whole of their premises ; but, as it was some time before they 
could meet with a purchaser, the work lay dormant till 1830, 
when it was sold to the Messrs Duncan from Glasgow, the pre- 
sent proprietors. These gentlemen have revived the work, and 
are now carrying it on with great spirit. Nearly 2,000,000 
of yards are printed by them, in every variety of style, for the 
home and foreign market. At no other field has the printing of 
mousselines de laine been carried on with greater success, or to a 
greater extent, than at Ruthven. About two-thirds of the whole 
are performed by block-printing, and the remainder by machine- 
printing. There are employed at this work 188 men, 67 women, 
and 113 children ; among whom there are 5 drawers, 8 engravers, 
19 cutters, and 123 printers. The average wages of the drawers 
are from L.l to L.2, 10s. ; of the engravers, from 15s. to L.l, 10s. ; 
of the cutters, from L.l to L.l, 10s. ; of the printer, from L.l to 
L.l, 15s. per week. This is, of course, when they are constantly 
employed, which unfortunately has not been the case for these 
some years past; although it is generally allowed by the men 
themselves, that employment has been more regular at Ruthven 
field than at any other field in Scotland. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villages. — The villages of this parish are now nearly all swept 
away. At one time, there was a large village of cottars and 
pendiclers at Wester Cultmalundie, who used to send to the 
moor with their herd, no less than eighty cows. Of this village, 
four small cottages are all that now remain. There was once a 
considerable village around the church, with its malt-barn and 
public-house; but this also is gone, with the exception of one house

PERTHSHIRE, 



now occupied by the church officer. There was also a village of 
some extent at the Hole of Ruthven, and there is still to be seen 
in the neighbourhood an old stone cross, where a regular market 
was wont to be held ; but the village is now no more. The only 
villages in the parish at present, are those at the two public works, 
Huntingtower field and Ruthven field. 

Means of Communication. — The roads in the parish are in ge- 
neral very good. The turnpike road to Crieff passes through it 
for about, three miles, after which the line is continued to the west 
of the parish by a statute-labour-road, not much inferior to the 
turnpike. There is also a good statute-labour-road along the 
north of the parish to the new bridge of Almond, and it is inter- 
cepted from north to south by another excellent road. The roads 
are kept in good repair, and they are all of easy access from the 
principal farm-steadings and public works. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The main body of the church is very an- 
cient. It appears to have been built as early as 1632. The 
walls are very strong, and the whole fabric is in excellent repair. 

In the year 1810, the Ruthven Field Company were permitted 
to build an aisle to the north of the church for the accommodation 
of their work-people. This aisle was purchased by the heritors in 
1835 for L.1'20, when about L.100 more was laid out in repairs 
on it and the rest of the church. The aisle is nearly as large as 
the church, and they both together contain about 600 sitters. 
This was nearly the legal amount of accommodation at that time ; 
but the population, and also the church-going habits of the people 
have increased so much since, that every seat is occupied, and 
there is a constant demand for more. A considerable num- 
ber of families reside within a mile and a-half of Perth, which 
is fully three miles from the parish church. Hence many of 
them find church accommodation in Perth. The church is 
planted very near the centre of the parish, and must have been 
commodiously situated for the population when it was built. 
The erection of the public works, however, has removed the great 
body of the people to a considerable distance, so that the ma- 
jority of the hearers travel from two to three miles to church. 
There is no Dissenting place of worship in the parish ; but there 
are two or three in the immediate vicinity, and there are in the 
parish about 70 families not connected with the Established 
Church. 

The manse was built in 1824 for the sum of L. 735. The of- 



T1BBERM0RE. 



1037 



fices are in good repair, and the accommodation very ample. The 
stipend is 17 chalders, one-half barley and one-half meal. There 
are about 10 acres of glebe land, including the garden and the 
ground occupied by the manse and offices. The land is worth 
about L. 2, 10s. per acre. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, viz. the paro- 
chial school, in the neighbourhood of the church, and another at 
Ruthven field. The parochial school is taught by an assistant 
teacher, who is allowed a small salary by the heritors, and all the 
fees. The schoolmaster has retired, being allowed to retain the 
school-house, salary, and other emoluments. The school is at- 
tended, on an average, by about 40 children. The school at Ruth- 
ven field, with the exception of a free school-house, is entirely an 
adventure school. Mr Duncan, the master of the work, guaran- 
tees L. 50 to the teacher, should the fees not amount to so much, 
but the fees are supposed to be rather above than below that sum. 
This school is attended by about 60 children through the day, and 
nearly as many in the evening. One great drawback to the edu- 
cation of this and many other parishes, is the early age at which 
children are permitted to enter public works. No one ought to 
be permitted to receive into his service any young person without 
a certificate from his minister, testifying that he can read the Scrip- 
tures with fluency, and write so as at least to be able to sign his 
own name. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are about 20 regular pau- 
pers on the roll, besides several occasional, who require assist- 
ance to pay their house rent and to procure coals in winter. The 
regular paupers receive from 4s. to 12s. per month, besides 
house-rent and coal-money. The funds from which they are sup- 
plied are raised by assessment and church-door collections. The 
assessment is levied only from the heritors and farmers, and 
amounts to about L.70, and the church-door collections average 
nearly L.50 annually. 

Ale-houses. — There are 6 public-houses in the parish, which is 
at least 4 more than there ought to be; but although it has been 
tried, it has not hitherto been found practicable to lessen their 
number. 

Fuel. — Coal is the principal article employed for fuel, which 
is brought to Perth in ships from Newcastle and the Fife collieries. 
There is a large peat-moss in the north-west of the parish, from 



1038 PERTHSHIRE. 

which a considerable number of peats are dug every year. Brush- 
wood, also, is eagerly bought up by the people for the same pur- 
pose.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. WILLIAM MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Dunblane is supposed to take its name from St 
Blane, a Culdee, and Holme Hill, an eminence or dun overlook- 
ing the cathedral. 

Extent, Sfc. — The extent of the parish is about nine miles in 
length, by six in breadth. It is bounded by the parishes of Lecropt, 
Logie, Blackford, Muthill, Comrie, and Kilmadock. Its situation 
at the western termination of the Ochill range, and reaching to the 
" braes of Doune," an offshoot of the Grampians, renders it, es- 
pecially around the " city" of Dunblane, well sheltered from the 
east wind; the climate is consequently found to be salubrious to 
persons who suffer in an eastern exposure. Its position in the 
centre of Scotland exempts it equally from the damp of the west, 
and the cold of the east wind. 

Mineral Well — The mineral well of Dunblane, two miles distant 
from the town, was casually discovered in 1814, and for a time, be- 
ing deemed more mild and safe, rivalled the well at Airthrey. The 
concourse of strangers promised to restore to Dunblane the stand- 
ing it had lost by the fall of Prelacy and loss of its bishop. The in- 
habitants used every effort to encourage this; but the refusal to do 
or permit what was necessary to render the discovery available, has 
kept Dunblane far behind its rival, — at which now has sprung up 
the beautiful and prosperous village of the Bridge of Allan. 

The analysis of the mineral spring, by John Murray, M. D., 
gave the following results : In a pint of water there are, 

Muriate of soda, . 24. gr. 

of lime, .18. 

Sulphate of lime, . 3.5 
Carbonate of lime, . 0.5 

Oxide of iron, . .17 



DUNBLANE. 



1039 



"During the summer months a supply of the water is carried 
daily to a neat lodge erected close to the town. 

Rivers. — The rivers in this parish are the Allan and the Ardoch. 

Soil. — The red sandstone formation underlies the whole of the 
parish, and its soil varies from gravel to a reddish clay. 

II. — Civil History. 

Dunblane is said to have been the residence of a Culdee fra- 
ternity. By David I. it was erected into a Bishop's See. The 
names of thirty-one bishops have been handed down, of whom 
twenty-five were Popish. One of these was canon of St An- 
drews, and one of the three first professors in the infant uni- 
versity there. Another, Maurice, obtained the see, from being 
King Robert Bruce's chaplain at the battle of Bannockburn. A 
third, Bishop Chisholme, at the Reformation alienated the whole 
lands, and, as Spottiswood angrily asserts, utterly " wracked" the 
benefice. And a fourth, Graham, was the first bishop in Scot- 
land to give up the Episcopal office as unlawful, which he did in 
the very General Assembly that condemned Prelacy as unscrip- 
tural. A sixth, Ballanden, was the confidential correspondent 
and agent of Laud in introducing his Popish novelties; and a 
seventh, was the distinguished Bishop Leighton. 

He was son of Dr Alexander Leighton, a sufferer under the tyran- 
ny of Laud, who publicly thanked God when Leighton was sentenc- 
ed to have his nose slit, his ears cut off, and his cheek burned, for an 
alleged libel, entitled Sion's Plea against Prelacy. Robert Leigh- 
ton, after being minister of Newbattle, and Principal of the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh, was, by his Popish brother, Elisha, pri- 
vate secretary to James II., then Duke of York, and at the per- 
sonal solicitation of Charles II., persuaded to accept a bishoprick, 
and took Dunblane, as the poorest. After vain attempts to re- 
concile Prelacy with Presbytery, he abandoned his office, broken- 
hearted, declaring that he " would not have Christianity itself, 
much less a form of church government, planted in a country, at 
such expense of blood." His Commentary on 1st Peter is a model of 
excellence. He bequeathed his library to the clergy of the diocese 
of Dunblane; and bis executors, being his sister, Sapphira, and 
her son, Edward Lighfmaker, erected, at their own expense, a 
house to contain the books, and mortified L.300, the interest of 
which to go to a librarian, and to uphold the fabric, and add to 
the books. After the full establishment of Presbytery, Mr 
Lightmaker constituted seven trustees,-— the Right Honourable

Viscount Stratballan, whose right is now inherited by the Earl 
of Kinnoul, Sir James Paterson of Bannockburn, Sir James 
Campbell of Aberuchill, John Graham, commissary-clerk of Dun- 
blane, and their heirs-male, the minister of Dunblane, and two 
other beneficed clergymen of the Presbytery of Dunblane, chosen 
by the Synod of Perth and Stirling. Various additions by 
will and purchase have been made to the books. L. 100 of 
the mortified money have been expended on the repair of the 
house. About 700 volumes have been lost during the last fifty 
years. The room has recently been refitted as a subscription 
reading-room. By the new catalogue it appears that there are 
excellent editions of the classics, several works of the fathers, a host 
of obscure theological writings of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and 
seventeenth centuries, a thin sprinkling of publications of last cen- 
tury, and few or no modern publications. 

Land'owners. — The land-owners, in the order and amount of 
their valued rent, are as follows : — 

John Stirling, Esq. of Kippendavie, 
The Earl of Kinnoul, in right of his second son, 
Archibald Stirling, Esq. of Keir, 
Sir James Campbell of Kilbryde, Bart. 
A. H. M. Belsher Esq. of Invermay, 
W. M. Murray, Esq. of Abercaimey, 
D. Macgregor, Esq. of Balhaldie, 
Robert Gardner, Esq. of Uottearns, 
Alexander Smith, Esq. of Glassingall, 
Lord Abercromby, 
Airs Jane Lawrence of Rottearns, 
Rev. Thomas Young of Gask, 
James Stirling, Esq. of Holmehill, 
John Finlayson, Esq. of Greenhill, 
John and James Galloch, Esqs. 

Total valued rent, 

The real rental may amount from L.l 5,000 to L. 17,000. 

Antiquities. — The battle of Sheriffmuir took place in this parish 
in 1715, between the Earl of Mar and the Marquis of Argyle, 
which established the throne in the house of Hanover. 

The great relic of antiquity in this parish is its cathedral. 
Date of its erection uncertain, possibly 1140, in the reign of 
David I. None of the diocesan records are known to exist. 
The nave is 130 feet by 58. It was unroofed probably at the Re- 
formation. The choir, which is the parish church, is 80 feet 
by .30. There were no transepts. The tower is 128 feet high, 
and seems, from its three different styles of architecture, to have 
been erected in three successive periods. Probably a church

with a tower, both in the earliest style, was afterwards enlarged 
into the nave, and had the choir added at a subsequent period. 
Some of the prebend stalls, in curiously carved oak, are placed 
in the lobby of the parish church, and the original Popish roof is 
still over the choir. The windows of the choir were renewed at 
considerable expense, in the ornamented Gothic style, in 1819, 
and the interior having been then repaired at the instance of the 
Earl of Kinnoul, the whole appearance of the parish church is 
striking and elegant. 

The ruins of the bishop's palace are still to be seen to the south 
of the cathedral, both overhanging the Allan. 

Kilbryde castle is the ancient seat of the Campbells of Aberu- 
chill, a family once honourably distinguished for support of the 
Reformation and revolution settlements. There is no mansion on 
Cromlix, the Episcopal heritage, now Lord Kinnoul's. Keir and 
Kippendavie houses are substantial modern mansions. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers have been pre- 
served with considerable care. 

The Presbvtery records of Dunblane extend back as far as 1616. 
The record of the Episcopal synod of Dunblane, from 1662 to 
1688, is extant, comprehending the whole of Leighton's Episco- 
pate. It might be interesting to some if published. 

III. — Population. 
So little encouragement having been given to public improve- 
ments, Dunblane has been as neglected a spot as any in Scotland. 
It contains 1800 inhabitants, a great number of whom are ex- 
tremely poor, and some in the lowest degradation and wretchedness. 
The population of the whole parish is 8367, including 631 in the 
portion assigned to the district of Ardoch quoad sacra. A violent 
settlement of a parish minister, about a century ago, scattered the 
Established congregation, and it has never been well gathered 
since. 

IV. — Industry. 

On the estates of Keir and Kippendavie, there has been every 
modern improvement in agriculture and buildings ; but in conse- 
quence of the tenure on which the Cromlix property is held, 
there have not been many improvements on it. 

There are three manufacturing establishments in the parish at 
Dunblane, and mill of Keir and Kinbuck, together with a con- 
siderable number of private looms in the town. At present there 
is a very great depression and want of employment.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town Sfc. — Dunblane is a market-town. Kinbuck 
is a village with 125 inhabitants. There is a post-office in 
Dunblane. Three mails and three stage-coaches pass through 
daily. The only bridge of importance is that over the Allan 
in Dunblane ; very old and very narrow, and being on the mail- 
road between Glasgow and Perth, it loudly calls for enlarge- 
ment. The parish church is the chancel of the cathedral, in 
the most convenient place for the parish ; date of erection un- 
certain ; walls in good repair, but roof very old, and not deemed 
quite safe. The accommodation does not amount to 500 sittings : 
very inadequate for so populous a parish. All the seats allocated, 
and all therefore free ; but numbers are excluded. The manse was 
built in 1829, and is one of the largest and handsomest in Scot- 
land. The glebe is four acres in extent, and having been lately 
well fenced, brings a rent of L.15. The amount of stipend last 
year was L.277. There are three Dissenting chapels belonging to 
the United Secession ; two in Dunblane and one in Greenloan- 
ing. The stipends aresaid to be L.130, L.30, L.60. A room 
in Dunblane is at present hired for a few Episcopalians. The 
number of communicants in the Established Church, in Julv 1842, 
was 444. 

Education. — There is one parochial school, besides four unen- 
dowed, and two schools supported by individual subscription. 
There is still, however, a considerable deficiency of education. 

Libraries. — Besides Leighton's library, there are two others of 
religious books. 

Savings' Bank. — A savings" 1 bank was established about a year 
and a-half ago, which the great depression of trade has kept from 
making much progress. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor on 
the roll is 45, among whom from L.6 to L.7 are divided every 
fortnight. The voluntarv assessment amounts to L.250. The 
church collections average L.30. There is little disposition among 
the poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief. 

Prison. — A new prison was erected last year by the Prison 
Board, for the western district of Perthshire. It contains eight 
cells and a house for the jailor. 

 The sheriff-substitute of the western district of Perthshire resides in Dunblane, 
Connected with his court there are a sheriff-clerk, procurator-fiscal, and four other 
practising attorneys.

Ale-houses. — Forty years ago, there were 41 houses where spi- 
rits, &amp;c. were retailed. In 1831, there were 22, and at present 
there are 16. The evils in connection with such houses have 
been incalculable.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. JAMES CRAIK, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The common name, for a long period, given to this 
parish is Scone, sometimes written and generally pronounced 
Scoon. Its vulgar pronunciation, Scin, or Skuyn, is frequently 
heard among the older inhabitants. It receives from Slezer, in 
his Theatrum Seotiae, the names both of Scoon and Skuyn. 

Scone, it is well known, became distinguished very early in 
Scottish history. It was probably a royal residence even before 
the subversion of the Pictish monarchy. Analogy would, there- 
fore, lead us to look for its name in the old British language. 
The situation of the old castle, and the grounds adjoining it, to 
which alone, properly speaking, the name of Scone applies, tend 
to confirm this conjecture. It is a gentle ascent, which, gradually 
rising from the Tay, extends into the interior of the parish with 
little interruption for a mile or two, when it attains an elevation 
of some hundred feet. In strict accordance with this topogra- 
phical fact, we find that, in the Wekh language, ysgwn, or ysgyn, 
pronounced iscoon, or iscin, signifies "a rising," "an ascending," 
" a rising or ascending ground." This seems the most probable 
etymology of the term Scone, or Scin, as vulgarly pronounced. 

The common derivation of Scone, from the Gaelic sgdin or 
skaifi, "a rent or chasm," seems altogether inadmissible, as it would 
here be perfectly unmeaning. There is no chasm in the neighbour- 
hood to which such a term could apply. 

Extent, Sfc— The superficial extent of the parish may be some- 



1044 



PERTHSHIRE. 



what above 9 square miles. It is bounded on the west and south 
west by the Tay, which separates it from Perth and Redgorton ; 
on the north, by the parish of St Martins ; on the east and south- 
east, by St Martins, Kilspindie, and Kinnoull. The ground rises 
gently from the Tay, towards the north and east. Much of the 
soil is iight, and considerable portions consist of dry gravel, but 
by far the larger proportion is in a state of high cultivation. 
There is much good arable ground included within the extensive 
parks and large plantations of the Earl of Mansfield; and towards 
the river, there are patches of strong rich clay. 

The parish is not intersected bv any river. There are one or 
two rivulets or burns, of which the Annaty may be mentioned as 
one supplying several good Waterfalls for the movement of ma- 
chinery. From the quantity of ground through which drains 
have been cut, the supply of water is somewhat irregular. A re- 
medy for this has been suggested by Professor Anderson of St 
Andrews, who surveyed the whole course of the stream ; but it 
has not yet been carried into effect. The Tay, by means of an 
artificial canal, affords an abundant supply of water for the ma- 
chinery connected with a bleachfield at Stormontfield, in the 
north-west district of the parish, and also for flour-mills in the 
same quarter. 

Geology. — The southern part of the parish is occupied by thick 
reddish-gray sandstone, which dips from the Sidlaw hills towards 
the north-west ; the same beds on the south of the range dipping 
towards the south-east. For several miles along the course of 
the Annaty Burn, the outcrop has been laid bare by the stream, 
and exhibits well-defined sections of the deposit. It is one of the 
lower members of the old red sandstone formation, which abounds 
in this part of the country. There is little variety in the aspect 
or structure of the rock, except that here and there a bed of a 
lighter and darker colour, more or less abounding in comminuted 
scales of mica, occasions slight apparent variations. Several dikes 
of whinstone or trap traverse the sandstone nearly in straight lines. 
Some of them are remarkably regular, and where worked out for 
road-metal, for which the stone is admirably adapted, leave a cut 
like an immense drain, the sides of which are scorched or semi- 
furred by fire. At Spoutwells, the sandstone may be observed 
partly lying above the trap vein in the form of an arch only a few 

inches thick, and partly as it has been mixed with the mass in a 

3 



SCONE.

state of fusion. The portions of the sandstone thus mixed with 
the vein, consist of thin laminae, varying from a few inches to half 
an inch in thickness, and afford the student of geology an excel- 
lent opportunity of observing the manner in which the igneous 
mass has been injected into the stratified deposit. 

The lower portions of the quarry at Lethendy, consisting of 
the common sandstone of the district, seem of indefinite thickness, 
and are very compact. The rock is chiefly composed of clay, 
sparingly mixed with silicious particles and mica. Above the 
hardest rock in the quarry, there is a bed of about three feet in 
thickness, remarkably well defined, chiefly composed of mica. 
It may be split up into a thousand of the thinnest laminae, between 
which the shining scales may be observed, varying from the eighth 
of an inch to nearly a quarter of an inch in diameter. The bed 
is extremely friable, and feels very unctuous when compressed in 
the hand. 

Minerals. — Further to the east, nodules of compact earthy car- 
bonate of lime, such as are burned as limestone, appear in the 
softer beds of the sandstone, especially in the line of the turnpike 
Strathmore road. Small pieces of jasper, and several of the 
more common minerals that prevail in similar situations, are also 
found. 

Botany. — The following account of the botany of this parish 
has been supplied by a reverend friend, partly from personal 
inspection, and partly from a list drawn up by another bota- 
nist. He states, that " the botany cannot fail to be interest- 
ing from the number of rare plants to be found in the parish," and 
notices particularly " Pyrula uniflora which is so singularly rare 
and so much sought after by our Scottish botanists." He has 
not himself seen the plants to which an asterisk is prefixed in the 
following list : 

'Veronica scuteilata A vena fatua Solan um dulcamara 

Scirpus sylvaticus  Radiola millegrana 'Myrrhis odorata 

Phalaris arundinacea Echium vulgaref Statice armeria 

Aira aquatica. 'Primula elatior 'Convallaria majalis 

Briza media Lonicera perielymenum „~ multiflora 

Triodia decumbens Polemonium casruleum Hyacinthus non-scriptus 

Festuca ovina Symphytum suberosum Juneus triglumis 

f This plant is often found in the corn-fields, having been sown along with the 
grain in the same manner as Agrostemma gith&amp;go, corn-cockle; Cichorium Intybim,

II. — Civil History. 

Scone is well known to have early obtained historical import- 
ance. It received, it would appear, the title of the « Royal 
city of Scone," so early as a. d. 906, or a. d. 909 ; by another 
calculation, the Pictish Chronicle informs us that Constantine, 
the son of Ed, and Kellach the bishop, together with the Scots, 
solemnly vowed to « observe the laws and discipline of faith, the 
rights of the churches and of the Gospel, on the Hill of Credu- 
lUv near the Royal city of Scoan Scone." « Here," it has been 
remarked, " we have an account, not only of a very early nation- 
al council, but of one that may be reckoned a council of Culdees. 
The very language in which the result of their meeting is expres- 
sed, indicates a very different spirit from that which characterized 
the generality of subsequent councils. We hear nothing of the 
authority of the pope or of bishops. The laws and discipline of 
faith, the rights of the churches and of the Gospel, is a style of 
writing peculiar to an age comparatively unadulterated." 

If the Stone of Destiny was transferred by Kenneth Mac Al- 
pine from Dunstaffnage, in Argyleshire, to Scone in a. d. 838, we 
may see a reason for the title of « Royal city of Scone," which 
seems to have been acquired before the meeting of the ecclesias- 
tical council. One of the most memorable of the combats with 
the Danes was fought at Collin near Scone, in the time of Donald 
IV., the son of Constantine II., for the possession of this stone. 
This must have been previous to a. d. 904, in which year Donald 
fell in battle at Forteviot. It is said that a religious house was es- 
tablished at Scone when the stone was transferred by Kenneth 
Macalpine. There seems no doubt that there was a foundation of 
Culdees at this place before the reign of Alexander I. We might 
indeed infer this from the circumstance, that the church of Scone 
at that early period was dedicated to the Holy Trinity, the esta- 
blished mode of dedication with this religious body. We learn 
from the " Chronicle of Mailros," that in 1115 the church of 
Scone was delivered up to canons regular, who deprived the CuW

dees of almost all their possessions. The abbey then founded was 
dedicated to the Trinity and Michael the Archangel. The re- 
sidents were canons regular of St Augustine, under the direction 
of a prior, and had various privileges conferred on them The 
abbey wall is supposed to have enclosed about twelve acres. Dur- 
ing the reign of Alexander, Scone seems to have been occasional- 
ly a royal residence, and, like St Andrews and other places in 
which monasteries were established, it was a market for foreign na 
lions. Alexander addressed a writ to the merchants of England, 
inviting them to trade at Scone, and promising them protection, 
on condition of their paying a custom to the monastery. This 
custom was an impost on all ships trading with Scone, from which 
it appears to have been anciently a port. About a mile from the 
river there was at a comparatively recent period, a bog called the 
full sea mere, which, according to tradition, had been covered by 
the tide, and in which, when digging for a pond, stones similar to 
those in the bed of the Tay were found. Whatever may be the 
value of the commonly received fac t, as to the transference of the 
fatal stone to Scone, there can be no doubt that many of the 
Scottish kings were inaugurated here. Here, also, during the reign 
of Culen, there was a great assembly of the states convoked for the 
purpose of oganizing the government of the nation. 

According to Buchanan, Culen was slain on his way to this as- 
sembly, near the village of Methven, by Robard, or Radend the 
thane, whose daughter he had violated.-}- At this assembly the 
bold and energetic Kenneth III. was crowned, and several import- 
ant statutes were enacted, which are said to be dated at the " Royal 
Palace of Scone." I have not, however, been able to verify this 
statement by any inspection of these statutes. It does not appear 
that any of the competitors for the throne, left vacant by the death 
of Kenneth, were crowned at Scone. Constantine IV., a son of 
Culen, is regarded as having been crowned first. He, within a 
year, was succeeded by a son of King Duff, who assumed the sove- 
reignty under the name of Kenneth IV. and is known as Kenneth 
the Grim. But neither in their coronation, nor in that of Mal- 
colm II., the son of Kenneth III., whose reign, during its earlier

portion, was spent in almost constant conflicts with the Danes, 
does there seem to have been any ceremony of inauguration on 
the fatal stone ; and the next notice of Scone is as the place at 
which Malcolm III., surnamed Canmore, was declared King 
on, according to the best authorities, the 25th of April 1057, 
the Festival of St Mark. Of the immediate successors of 
Malcolm, Edgar, his son, is said to have been crowned at 
Scone, a. d. 1098. As already noticed, the transference 
of the religious house at Scone, from the Culdees to the 
Canons regular of St Augustine, is said to have taken place 
during the reign of Alexander I. in 1115. According to Keith, 
" the Canons regular of St Augustine were first brought to 
Scotland by Atelwolphus, Prior of St Oswald of Nostel, in York- 
shire, and afterwards Bishop of Carlisle, who established them at 
Scone at the desire of Alexander I. A writer the author of 
Sconiana, Edin. 1807, asserts, without quoting any authority, 
that " the Culdees led very profligate lives, and were dismissed 
by Alexander." Sir James Balfour, under the year 1114, has 
the following statement : " After the death of Edgar, his brother 
Alexander, surnamed Ferss, succidit him. Quhill he was a priut 
man, he had at his christening, by the donatione of hes vnckell, 
Donald Bane, Earle of Gowrey, the lands of Liffe and Innergow- 
rey, quher, in the first zeire of his raing, he began then to buld 
a staitly palace and castle, bot was interrupted by the rebells of 
Meirnes and Murray, quho besett him in the night, and had 
doubtesley killed him, had not Alexander Carrone firmly carried 
the King save away    and by a small boat saived themselves, 
to Fyffe and the south pairts of the kingdom, where he raised ane 
armey, and marched against the forsaid rebells of Meirnes and 
Murray, quhome he totally overthrew and subdewed, for which 
great mercy and preservatione, in a thankful retribution to God, 
he foundit the monastarey of Scone ; and too it gave hes first 
lands of Liffe and Innergowrey, in A° 1114." 

This foundation of the monastery, in 1114, may have paved the 
way for the dismission of the Culdees in the following year. We 
have no means of ascertaining whether there was any connection 
between this step and the long contest in which Alexander was 
engaged with the English archbishops, on the subject of their as- 
sumed authority over the Scottish church ; but after Eadmer had 
been compelled to resign the bishoprick of St Andrews, and his 
petition to be restored had been rejected by the King, we find

Robert Prior of Scone appointed to that Episcopal throne. Bal- 
four informs us that David, the immediate successor of Alexander, 
was crowned at Scone ; and we learn from several sources, that 
Matilda, or Maud, the wife of David, the daughter of the Earl of 
Northumberland, and widow of Simon de St Liz, Earl of North- 
ampton, was interred here. At Scone, also, Malcolm IV., as 
yet only in his twelfth year, is said to have been crowned ; and 
here, about a. d. 1163, the Bishop of St Andrews delivered an 
address to the King on the subject of the vow of chastity, by 
which it is alleged he had bound himself, at a great national 
council held for the especial purpose of taking this vow into con- 
sideration. 

The coronation of Alexander III. took place " at Scone on 
the 13th" of July, the Bishop of St Andrews knighting the King, 
as well as placing the crown on his head.   After the corona- 
tion oath had been administered to the King, both in Latin, and 
in French, the language of the nobility, he was placed upon the 
sacred Stone of Destiny, which stood before the cross in the eastern 
end of the church ; and while he there sat with the crown on his 
head, and the sceptre in his hand, a gray-headed Highland bard 
stepping forth from the crowd, addressed to him a long genealo- 
gical recitation in the Gaelic tongue, in which, beginning, " Hail 
Alexander, King of Albion, son of Alexander, son of William, 
son of David, &amp;c. he carried up the royal pedigree through all 
its generations to the legendary Gathelus, who married Scota, 
the daughter of Pharaoh, and was the contemporary of Moses. 
It may be doubted if Alexander understood a word of this savage 
paean, but he is recorded to have expressed his gratification, by 
liberally rewarding the venerable rhapsodist." Pict. Hist, of Eng- 
land, Book iv. chap. i. 

It was at Scone that the General Convention of the States was 
held after the death of Alexander's daughter, the Queen of Nor- 
way, and of his son, Alexander, the Prince of Scotland, in his 
twentieth year. Margaret of Norway had left only an infant 
daughter. " On the 5th of February 1284, the Parliament was 
assembled at Scone, when the estates of the kingdom solemnly 
bound themselves, failing Alexander and any children he might 
have, to acknowledge for their Sovereign the Norwegian Princess, 
 the Maiden of Norway,' as she is called by the old writers." 
Her marriage with her cousin, the son of Edward I. of England, 

was afterwards agreed to; but having set sail for Britain, she fell 

4

1051 



sick on her passage, and, landing on one of the Orkney Islands, 
died there about the end of September 1290, in her eighth year. 
This event, as is well known, was most disastrous for Scotland, 
but it is not necessary to do more than refer to the competition 
for the Crown that then took place to the claims of Edward 
to be Lord Paramount of Scotland ; — and to the final decision pro- 
nounced by him on the 17th November 1292, in the great hall 
of the Castle of Berwick, " that John Baliol should have seisine 
of the kingdom of Scotland." On the 19th, " the Great Seal, 
that had been used by the Regency, was broken into four parts, 
and the pieces deposited in the Treasury of England, in testimony, 
as it was said, to future ages, of England's right of superiority 
over Scotland. The next day, Baliol swore fealty to Edward at 
Norham. On the 30th St Andrew's day he was solemnly 
crowned at Scone." Two years afterwards, that is, towards the 
latter end of 1294, we find a Parliament assembled at Scone. 
Even the degraded Baliol had been now somewhat roused against 
the unrelenting tyranny of Edward, and the nobles also became 
convinced that it was necessary to make some effort to cast off 
the yoke. This Parliament directed, " that all Englishmen 
maintained at the Court should be dismissed, and then appointed 
a council of four bishops, four earls, and four barons, without 
whose advice the King was restricted from performing any public 
act." The suspicions of Edward having been awakened by such 
proceedings, he made demands, that certain towns to the south 
of Scotland should be delivered up, and, advancing into the king- 
dom at the head of a powerful army, reduced Baliol to a state of 
the most abject submission. Edward penetrated to the north as 
far as Elgin. " It was on his return from this triumphal progress, 
that he ordered the famous stone, on which the Scottish Kings 
had been wont to be crowned, to be removed from the Abbey of 
Scone, and conveyed to Westminster, in testimony, says Heming- 
ford, an English contemporary chronicler, of the conquest and 
surrender of the kingdom. He appears to have been at St John- 
stone's, or Perth, on Wednesday the 8th of August 1296." A 
few years afterwards, a. d. 1300, in an account of the wardrobe 
of Edward, there is a particular account of the sum expended on 
this stone, in having it fixed in a new chair, &amp;c. Although not 
mentioned in the Treaty of Northampton, a. d. 1328, it was then,, 
as we shall see, stipulated that the stone should be restored. 
This, however, like the other conditions of that treaty, were never 



1052 



PERTHSHIRE. 



complied with, and, consequently, with the other articles pillaged 
by Edward, it still remains in England. " This fatal stone," 
says Sir Walter Scott, " was said to have been brought from Ire- 
land by Fergus, the son of Eric, who led the Dalriads to the 
sh ores of Argyleshire. Its virtues are preserved in the celebrated 
leonine verse : 

fallat f'atum, Scoti quocunque locatum 
Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem." 

st There were Scots who hailed the accomplishment of the pro- 
phecy at the accession of James VI. to the crown of England, 
and exulted that, in removing their palladium, the policy of Ed- 
ward resembled that which brought the Trojan horse in triumph 
within their walls, and which occasioned the destruction of their 
royal family. The stone is still preserved, and forms the support 
of King Edward the Confessor's chair, which the sovereign occu- 
pies at his coronation ; and independent of the divination, so long 
in being accomplished, is in itself a very ancient remnant of ex- 
treme antiquity." In preparing this chair for the coronation of her 
present Majesty, some small fragments of this stone were broken olf. 
I have been assured by a geological friend who contrived to obtain 
part of them, that stone, of exactly the same kind, is to be found 
in some of the quarries on the Scone property. Edward seems to 
have carried away, besides the stone, the regalia of Scotland. 
John Baliol is said to have been stripped of the regal ornaments 
when he surrendered his kingdom after the battle of Dunbar. 
When, therefore, Robert Bruce was crowned and inaugurated at 
Scone, 27th March a. d. 1306, neither the ancient crown nor the 
stone could have been used. A circlet or ring of gold, was hast- 
ily prepared for the occasion, and the Bishop of Glasgow furnished 
robes and a banner. The ceremony was performed on the 27th 
by the Bishop of St Andrews; and on the 29th, Isabella, sister 
of Duncan Earl of Fife whose family had the privilege of crown- 
ing the Kings of Scotland, and wife of the Earl of Buchan, hav- 
ing secretly repaired to Scone, placed the crown on the King's 
head, in assertion of the pretensions of her family. At this coro- 
nation there were present William of Lambyrton, Bishop of St 
Andrews ; Robert Wisheart, Bishop of Glasgow ; the four bro- 
thers of Bruce, Edward, Nigil, Thomas, and Alexander ; his ne- 
phew, Thomas Randolph of Strathdon; his brother-in-law, Chris- 
topher Seaton of Seaton ; Malcolm, fifth Earl of Lennox; John 
of Strathbogie, tenth Earl of Athole; Sir James Douglas; Gil-

Durino- the rein of Robert Bruce, that Parliament was held 
at Scone, in December 1318, at which it was enacted that, in the 
event of the King dying without issue male, his successor should 
be Robert Stewart, son of the Princess Marjory and of Walter, 
the Lord High Steward of Scotland ; and that, should Robert be 
a minor at the time of the King's death, Randolph, Earl of Mo- 
ray, should be his tutor. In this Parliament many other laws were 
passed. All were required to assume military attire, which was 
minutely described. Churchmen were prohibited from purchasing 
Papal bulls, and absentees residing in England were required to 
draw no money out of Scotland. The enactment respecting the 
succession was, in some measure, rendered of no avail by the birth 
of a son to the King at Dunfermline 1323, who, after a long mi- 
nority, became King of Scotland under the title of David II. In 
the various conferences that were carried on about this time be- 
tween Scotland and England, the coronation stone that had been 
removed from Scone by Edward was demanded, but at that period 
the negociations were broken off without any settlement of the 
disputes. The restoration of the stone, though omitted in the 
treaty of Northampton, of which the original duplicate is preserved 
among the archives in the general Register- House in Edinburgh, 
was stipulated by a separate instrument. The stone, as is well 
known, was never restored. This treaty was most unpopular in 
England ; and so much opposition was felt to the restoration of 
the fatal stone, that the populace of London " arose in a riotous 
manner, and would not suffer that emblem of the conquest of Ed- 
ward I. to be removed." In the treaty, it was agreed that all in- 
struments and charters having relation to the independence of 
Scotland should be delivered up to Robert Bruce. Edward, when 
at Scone, had mutilated the ancient chartulary of that Abbey, 
and carried away some of its charters, his object being to destroy 
every monument connected with the antiquity and independence 
of the nation. The treaty, though ratified by Parliament, was 
never promulgated, nor does it appear among the ancient records. 

The coronation of David II. took place at Scone with the usual 
solemnities, in 1331, when that prince was in his eighth year, on 



1054 



PERTHSHIRE. 



which occasion he was knighted by the Regent Randolph, and 
then conferred this distinction on several of the nobility. 

When the assistance of the English King had enabled Edward 
Baliol to invade Scotland, and his success in the battle of Dupplin 
emboldened him to take possession of Perth, where he was joined 
by many of the disaffected, he was crowned at Scone on the 24th 
September 1332. After the restoration of David II., who returned 
from France in his eighteenth year, and, with his wife, landed at 
Inverbervie on the 4th of May, Scone is mentioned as the place 
where the Parliament assembled. It was in a Parliament held at 
Scone in March 1363, that David Bruce, whose weakness con- 
trasts so unfavourably with the gallantry of his illustrious father, 
and whose wife had. died childless the year before, proposed that 
Lionel, Duke of Cambridge, Edward's third son, should be chosen 
to fill the Scottish throne in the event of his dying without issue. 
The proposal was rejected with indignation. After the death of 
David in February 1371, his nephew Robert, the Steward of Scot- 
land, ascended the throne. During his reign, a Parliament was 
held at Scone, in which the succession of his children by his first 
wife, Euphemia, was set aside in favour of his former children by 
Elizabeth More. This king was succeeded by his son John, who 
was crowned at Scone under the name of Robert III., the name 
John having been unfortunate for kings, both of England and 
France ; and here also, it is said, was the Parliament held at 
which David, the King's eldest son, afterwards starved to death 
in Falkland, was created Duke of Rothsay, and Robert, the King's 
brother, Duke of Albany. Buchanan, however, states, that this 
Parliament was held at Perth, and notices, that these were the 
two first Scottish dukes. " Hie sane honoris titulus turn pri- 
mum inter Scotos, magno ambitionis, nullo virtutis incremento, est 
celebratus : nec cuiquam postea feliciter cessit." — Buch. Lib. x. 

The next interesting incident at Scone was the coronation of 
James L and his queen. He had married, on the 24th of Fe- 
bruary 1424, the Lady Joanna Beaufort, the daughter of the 
Duchess of Clarence by her first husband, the Duke of Somerset, 
and the descendant of Edward III., to whom he is said to have 
become attached some years before. The treaty for his liberation 
from his long imprisonment in England had been concluded in 
September 1423, but he is said to have seen and admired his fu- 
ture queen from his prison in the Round Tower in Windsor Castle, 
and that this suggested his poem of " The King's Quhair." " He 



SCONE. 



1055 



arrived in Scotland on the 5th of April 1424, and on the 21st of 
May was solemnly crowned with his queen in the usual venerated 
sanctuary, the Abbey Church of Scone." From this time the 
importance of Scone greatly diminished. It was neither the place 
at which the immediate successors of James were crowned, nor 
where the legislative assemblies were held during their reigns. 
The abbey must have given it some importance in an ecclesiastical 
point of view, but Edinburgh had now become the seat of civil 
government, as it was the metropolis of Scotland. Passing over 
more than sixty-four years, the next coronation which took 
place at Scone was that of James IV. After the funeral of his 
father in the Abbey of Cambuskeneth, James was overwhelmed 
with remorse for his undutiful conduct. He immediately pro- 
ceeded to Perth, and thence to Scone Abbey, where he was 
crowned with the usual rejoicings on the 26th of June 1488, in 
his sixteenth year. Both James V. and Mary were crowned at 
Stirling, so that the next notice of Scone occurs after the lapse 
of more than seventy years. On the 11th of May 1559, John 
Knox preached a sermon at Perth against the mass, idolatrous 
worship, and the adoration of saints and images. From the .zeal 
of the people in the Protestant cause, and the daring opposition 
of the Roman Catholics to the doctrines delivered by Knox, the 
altar, images, and other ornaments of the church were torn down 
and destroyed. In their subsequent destruction of the monasteries, 
the people acted in conformity with the wisdom said to have been 
inculcated by Knox, " that the best way to keep the rooks from 
returning, was to pull down their nests." On the 14th of June, 
the church at St Andrews was stripped of its images and pictures, 
and the monasteries overthrown ; and on the 27th of the same 
month, it would appear, the abbey and other religious houses at 
Scone were burned to the ground by a furious mob, who had come 
from Dundee on this work of destruction. This has been de- 
scribed as having been done " under the auspices of Knox f but 
it is right to quote his own words from his " Historic" Having 
mentioned the provocation given to the populace by the Bishop 
of Murray and his friends, who were living there, "and noticed 
what seems to have been the Bishop's palace, he adds, « So was 
that abay and plaice palace  appointed to sackage ; in doing 
whereof, they tuk no lang deliberation, but committed the nolle 
whole to the merciment of fyre, whereat no small number of us

were offendit." About this period, all the rights and possessions 
of the Abbey of Scone passed into the hands of the family of 
Gowrie. Such was the state of affairs until 1600, when the 
whole was forfeited to the Crown, in consequence of the myste- 
rious conspiracy, as it is called, of John Earl of Gowrie and his 
brother Alexander, the sons of William, Earl of Gowrie, who had 
been beheaded in 1584, for his share in the Raid of Ruthven. 

This affair occurred in August 1600, and soon after an act of 
annexation was passed by the legislature, by which the lands, lord- 
ships, baronies, &amp;c. which pertained to the abbacy and monastery 
of Scone, were annexed and incorporated to the Crown. In 1605 
or 1606, a considerable portion of the Gowrie estates was taken 
from the Crown's patrimony, and erected into a temporal lordship 
in favour of David Lord Scone. He had been Sir David Murray 
of Gospertie, a descendant of Sir William Murray of Tullibar- 
dine, also ancestor of the Dukes of Athol. Previous to this, he 
had received various marks of distinction, having enjoyed, besides 
his other honours, the office of Ranger of the Lowlands and Fo- 
rester of the Woods. He was Master of the Horse, Captain of the 
Guards, and cup-bearer to James VI., and was created Lord Scone 
in 1604 or 1605, and Viscount Stormont 1621. In a charter, 
of date 1616, he is styled David Lord Scone. The represen- 
tative of the family is William David Murray, Earl of Mansfield, 
lineal descendant of Sir David Murray, and through him, enjoy- 
ing all the Scottish titles and property, to which large additions 
have been made, together with the English honours of his great- 
grand-uncle, the Chief- Justice. There seems to be no authority, 
by charter or otherwise, for the title of Hereditary Keeper of the 
Palace of Scone, commonly assigned to the representative of the 
family. The property was erected into a temporal lordship in fa- 
vour of Sir David Murray, but neither in this, nor in any subsequent 
charter, is there any reference to this office, the whole property, with 
all rights and privileges appertaining, having been entirely severed 
from the Crown, with the following reservation in the statute of 
1606 : " Reservand and exceptand allways furth of this present 
act and erection all regalities, and all privileges thereof, possessed 
by the abbots and titulars of Scone of before, to remain with our 
Sovereign Lord and his Highness' successors, and their Crown, in- 
separable in all time hereafter." 

Subsequently to this period, Scone was not marked by the oc-

currence of many public events. The ecclesiastical palace 
and abbey having been destroyed, the rest of the town may have 
also suffered. It is probable, however, that, as soon as the rights 
and possessions of the ancient abbey passed into the hands of the 
Gowrie family, a residence would be built. It seems to have 
been erected between the abbey and the river, and perhaps was 
called a palace, as being nearly on the site of the palace occupied 
by the Bishop of Murray, and burned to the ground. At all 
events, the Gowrie family appears to have had a residence at Scone 
in 1593. The lands erected into a temporal lordship in favour 
of David Lord Scone, ancestor of the Stormont family, have ever 
since continued in their possession. They consequently belonged 
to Viscount Stormont in 1651, when the coronation of Charles II. 
took place at Scone. The circumstances of this coronation are 
minutely detailed in a small quarto printed at Aberdeen, entitled 
" The Form and Order of the Coronation of Charles the Second, 
King of Scotland, England, and France and Ireland, as it was 
acted and done at Scone, the first day of January 1651." From 
this account, it appears that the house partially built, probably 
by the Gowrie family, and subsequently by Lord Scone or his de- 
scendants, was regarded in some respects as a palace. We read 
of the King being conducted from his bed-chamber to his " cham- 
ber of presence," and that he was there placed in a chair, under 

• From a List of the Magistrates of Perth, with such occurrences as happened 
under their magistracy, printed in the second volume of " The Muses Threnodie, 
Perth, 1774," we learn that John Earl of Gowrie was provost of Perth from 1592 
to 1600, although during part of that time he was abroad. Sir David Murray of 
Gospetrie is entered under that title as provost in 1601, 1602, and 1603, but, in 
1604, he appears as David Lord Scone, and, in 1621, for the first time, as David 
Viscou.it Stormont. The last year in which he filled that office was 1627. He was 
elected provost on 6th October 1628, but by a decree of the Lords of the Secret 
Council of the 21st February, the election was declared illegal. The Viscount was 
Laid aside, and Peblis of Chapelhill elected in his room. There were laws which 
prohibited noblemen or gentlemen not resident, nor bearing burden as citizens, to 
be elected into the magistracy — Vid. Muses Then. Vol. ii. p. 113. 

Lord Scone, together with Lord Binning and Lord Carnegy, were his Majesty's 
Commissioners to the Genetal Assembly, that met in the Old or St John's Kirk 
on the 2jth August 1618. « The Assembly met in the Little Kirk; Mr Spotiswood 
Archbishop of St Andrews, placed himself in the moderators chair without election 
which was objected to. The Archbishop answered, that the Assembly was convened 
within his diocese, and he hoped no one would take his place." The Kia«'fl letter 
to this Assembly was somewhat stern : He says, « Do not think we will be satis6ed 
w.th refusals, or delays, or mitigations, and we know not what other shifts have been 
proposed, for we will content ourselves with nothing but with a simple and direct 
acceptation of these articles in the form by us sent unto you." On the 27th the 
five articles received the suffrages of all the members except one nobleman, one doc- 
tor and forty-five ministers. They were ratified in Parliament at Edinburgh',

a doth of state, by the Lord of Angus, " Chamberlaine ap- 
pointed by the King for that day." He was afterwards conducted 
to the Kirk of Scone. Of this " kirk" there remains now only 
an aisle, which was probably erected by the first Lord Scone. 
On the north side is his monument, finely executed in marble and 
alabaster, and on which there is a long inscription. Here, also, is 
a statue of his Lordship in armour. He is represented kneeling 
on a cushion at an altar, with a book lying open before him. 
On either side of the large statue is a man in armour; the one 
said to be the Marquis of Tullibardine, and the other the Earl 
Marischal. 

This kirk, we are told, was prepared for the coronation, with a 
table, whereupon the honours were laid. " A chair was also set 
in a fitting place for his Majesty's hearing sermon, over against 
the minister, and another chair on the other side, where he sat 
when he received the Crown, beyond which there was a bench 
decently covered. Besides these, there was a stage for the throne. 
All being quickly composed into attention," the sermon was 
preached by Master David Douglas, Moderator of the Commis- 
sion of the General Assembly. His text was 2d Kings xi. 12, 17. 
After the King had been solemnly sworn, he signed the National 
Covenant, the League and Covenant, and a copy of his oath. 
Having taken the coronation oath, and having been invested with 
the royal robes instead of the prince's robe with which he entered, 
the Kinof was brought to the chair on the north side of the kirk, 
and then Archibald Marquis of Argyle, having taken the crown 
in his hands, and the minister having prayed, the said Marquis 
put the crown on the King's head. " It was remarkable," says 
Sir Walter Scott, " that upon this occasion the crown was borne 
by the unhappy Marquis of Argyle, who was put to death in no 
very legal manner, immediately after the Restoration, using upon 
the scaffold these remarkable words, ' I placed the crown on the 
King's head, and in reward, he brings mine to the block.' " It 
is supposed that the seat of the Scone family, now removed to the 
parish church in New Scone, was used at this time, and that 

 These honours, consisting of the crown, sceptre, and sword of state, &amp;c. were 
soon after this carried to Dunnottar Castle. After being preserved in a remarkable 
manner by the dexterity of Mrs Granger, wife of the minister of KinnefF, they con- 
tinued to be produced in public, during the sittings of the Scottish Parliament, down 
to the Union, when it was stipulated that they should be kept in Scotland in all time 
coming. It was, however, supposed by many, that they had been removed to Lon- 
don, until on February 4, 1818, they were found in the Crown- Room of Edinburgh 
Castle, deposited in a chest, in the very state in which they had been placed there in 
1707. ' Vide " Description of the Regalia of Scotland" by Sir Walter Scott.

the chair on which Charles sat, either when hearing sermon, or 
when the crown was placed on his head, stood behind the bench 
in front of this seat. It is made of elegantly carved oak, having 
towards one end of the front of the canopy, the arms of Lord 
Scone, with the motto " Meliora spero," and beneath, the words 
' David Lord Skone." Towards the other end, in the cor- 
responding place, carved also in the oak, is a different coat of 
arms, with what seems to have been intended for the motto, " nec 
temere, nec timide" and beneath, " Elizabeth Lady Skone," 
with the date 1616. The star and crescent had formed part of 
the ornaments, and seem to have been highly gilded. Lord 
Scone, as appears from the inscription, married Elizabeth Beaton, 
said to have been an ancient baron's daughter of Crich, i. e. 
Criech, in Fifeshire. 

After mentioning several additional ceremonies, the account 
concludes in these words, " Then did the King's Majesty descend 
from the stage with the crown npon his head, and receiving ao-ain 

° 1  ©to 

the sceptre in his hand, returned with the whole train in solemn 
manner to his palace, the sword being carried before him." It 
does not appear in what sense the house or castle was called " his 
palace." He may, perhaps, have appointed it to be so, like the 
chamberlain, " for that day;" but the whole seems to have been 
in the possession of Viscount Stormont, who is not mentioned 
among the nobility then present. In these troubled times, the 
authority of the Assembly and of those noblemen who adhered to 
the Church was triumphant. There is no reason to suppose that 
there was any other house in Scone in which the King could have 
had a bed-chamber and presence-chamber except that castle or 
palace begun to be built by the Gowrie family, afterwards enlarged, 
though never entirely completed, by their successors, and almost 
wholly removed when the present splendid house was built, about 
the beginning of this century. 

It was probably in the same palace that the Pretender fixed his 
residence, when, after embarking at Dunkirk, he arrived at Peter- 
head on 22d December 1715. Having reached Dundee, he hast- 
ened to Scone, and there held a council on the 16th January 1716. 
When he received intelligence that the royal army had reached 
Auchterarder, a council of war was held on the 30th of January, 
when the question was proposed, whether to fight or fly  The 
council came to no decision ; but a few hours afterward it was de- 
termined by a select committee to fly, when the Pretender hast- 
ened to Perth, supped and rested, and next morning fled with hie

rebel army over the Tay on the ice towards Dundee. Prince 
Charles also visited Scone in 1745. 

The residence of Lord Stormont had been chiefly built by Lord 
Gowrie and the first Lord Scone, but considerable additions were 
made by David, seventh Lord Stormont, and Earl of Mansfield, 
as heir to his uncle William, Lord Chief-Justice. The arms of 
the first Lord Scone were painted on the ceilings and walls, with 
the date 1627. The gallery, which was about 167 feet in length, 
with a wooden ceiling painted in water-colours, and representing 
the hunting and hawking of James VI., is said to have been erected 
by this nobleman. But the house was never finished, nor entirely 
furnished. There was no communication between some of the 
adjoining buildings, which made it necessary to pass through the 
outer court to reach several of the apartments. 

Palace. — The present " Palace of Scone," as it is now generally 
called, was built about the beginning of the present century, having 
been begun in 1803 and finished 1808. The design was by the late 
William Atkinson of Grove-end, London, and the erection might 
cost about L.60,000 or L.70,000. The ground on which the 
former house stood is occupied by this splendid mansion ; but in its 
imposing Gothic style of architecture, and magnificent halls and 
spacious apartments, the modern palace is incomparably superior. 
The late Earl of Mansfield, the grand-nephew of the Chief-Jus- 
tice, spared no expense on this edifice. In most instances, the 
walls of the former house were entirely taken down and rebuilt. 
A new front, facing the river, 240 feet in length, was an entire 
addition. The apartments were greatly enlarged, with the excep- 
tion of the gallery, which is now 150 feet long, part of it having 
been taken off for an entrance by a porch. It is a very elegant 
room. The floor is of tesselated oak, the dark having been found 
in the beds of the Tay and the Earn. On the windows, partly of 
stained glass, are represented the various coats of arms of the fa- 
mily. The roof still retains somewhat of an antique form. It is 
splendidly furnished, having at the upper end a large and richly- 
toned organ, and in different parts of the room several very valu- 
able cabinets, lately purchased, of the age of Louis XIV. Amono- 
the ornaments are marble busts and vases of great beauty, both 
as to material and workmanship. Almost the only portions of the 
old walls not taken down but merely incased, are in that part of 
the house immediately under the dining-room and the draw- 
ing-room. The dining-room, music-room, and Library, are ele- 
gant and spacious apartments, containing, in the midst of many 



SCONE. 



1061 



modern ornaments, some antique cabinets that had been in the 
former house. In these rooms there are several valuable paintings 
by Vandyke, Titian, Guido, Paul Veronese, Teniers, &amp;c. There 
is a " Dutch Burgomaster" by Rembrandt, and a portrait of Bas- 
sano by himself ; a " Denial of St Peter," and a " Judith and 
Holofernes," by two old masters. There are some excellent por- 
traits by Sir Peter Lely, exhibiting all the softness, beauty, and 
delicacy of his style. Among the family portraits are those of the 
first Earl of Mansfield, the second Earl, the late Earl, the Coun- 
tess Dowager, &amp;c. As a modern room, the drawing-room is the 
finest. It commands one of the most magnificent views that can 
be found, from any point, of the richest parts of Perthshire, and 
its interior is fitted up with great elegance. 

There seems to have been an intention to combine with the 
splendour and comfort of the present age, some remembrance of 
the simplicity of the past. The entrance, for example, has an air 
of antiquity, having an ancient knocker with the initials D. V. S. 
The door-way is surmounted with the arms of Lord Mansfield in 
stone, and the motto, " uni cequus virtuti." The house is par- 
tially surrounded by terrace walls, and bastions, one of which com- 
mands a very extensive view. There are several large trees at a 
short distance, one of them an ash, said to have been planted by 
James VI., and many ash and sycamore trees about 300 years of 
age. One is commonly known as Queen Mary's tree. The 
ground slopes gradually to the Tay, which flows within about 600 
yards of the palace. The house may be approached either through 
an ancient gateway on the east, or by the modern terrace gate on 
the south, to which there is a drive entering the park at the dis- 
tance of about a mile from Perth. This new drive passes over 
a bridge which crosses a ravine at no great distance from the ter- 
race gate. The gardens lie to the south-east of the palace. At 
the recent visit of the Queen to Scone Palace, the royal cortege 
entered by the terrace gate, and were received at the grand en- 
trance by the Earl of Mansfield, the Countess Dowager, and the 
Ladies Murray. Apartments were fitted up with great elegance 
for her Majesty and Prince Albert. The Queen reached Scone 
Palace about seven o'clock p. m. on Tuesday, September 6, 1842, 
and leftearly next day for Dunkeld and Taymouth. Among the va- 
rious costly preparations made for her Majesty's reception may be 
mentioned two magnificent chairs, quite unique, procured from Lon- 
don, on which the Queen and Prince Albert sat at dinner. The carv- 
ing and other rich ornaments of the royal bed, with the furniture 



1062 



PERTHSHIRE. 



and decorations of the private rooms prepared for her Majesty and 
the Prince, are of a beautiful and magnificent description. Be- 
fore the Queen's departure, the magistrates of Perth sent a depu- 
tation to the palace to solicit the honour of her Majesty's signa- 
ture in the guildry books of Perth, where James VI. and Charles 
II. had written their names ; the former thus: " J601, Parcere 
subjectis, et debellare superbos.- — James R." And the latter as 
follows: " Nemo me impune lacesset, July 24, 1650. — Charles R." 
Sir Robert Peel carried the book to the Queen, when her Ma- 
jesty and Prince Albert recorded their names. 

Among the remnants of antiquity within the palace may be men- 
tioned an old bed of dark-brown Genoa velvet embroidered, which 
is said to have been worked by Queen Mary. The Queen, when 
at Falkland, is supposed to have given the bed to one of the ances- 
tors of the family, to whom she showed great favour. It was pro- 
bably conveyed to Scone at the time when the Balvaird branch 
succeeded to the title of Viscount Stormont. The bed and furni- 
ture of a room are preserved, which was called the King's room, 
and in which there is a tradition that James VI. slept, but it was 
more probably the " bed-chamber" of Charles II., of which notice 
is taken in the account of his coronation. The bed and furniture 
are handsome, and more conformable to his age than to an earlier 
period. The bed on which the celebrated William, first Earl of 
Mansfield died, was put up in the room in whichjie is said to have 
been born. 

Village. — The village, or " royal city," of Scone was built in the 
immediate neighbourhood, and partly during the era of the monas- 
tery. One street was named the chanter gate. Near this street 
there were some trees that are said to have stood in the garden of the 
monastery. Among them were some remains of a wall. At the end of 
the chanter gate was the gallows knowe s and in another direction the 
prison-house, which would suggest that extensive rights were attached 
to the place. Some of the houses of the village, which had belong- 
ed to the abbey, were appropriated to the courtiers who accompanied 
James VI., who is said to have been wont to come to Scone for the 
purpose of hunting. One house was called, at a comparatively 
recent period, the Earl of Errol's stables. He probably attended 
on the king as hereditary grand constable of Scotland. Part of a 
wall which stood between the palace and the village still remains, 
together with an ancient gateway. A little to the east of this is 
the cross, the only vestige now of the village. It consists of an up - 
right pillar, 13 feet high, slightly ornamented at the top, standing

on a pedestal, surrounded by steps, and gradually diminishing to a 
small flat octagonal stage from which the pillar rises. 

Antiquities.— The greater part of the ground in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the palace seems to have been disturbed at a for- 
mer period, probably about sixty years ago. In making some altera- 
tions on the terraces in 1841, andup tothepresent date, variousfrag- 
ments of grave and other stones have been found. In 1841, the 
workmen came upon what may have been the foundations of the 
monastery. One apartment, which seemed to be a sort of cell, was 
found in pretty good repair. It was surrounded by stone seats, 
about 15 inches broad, and might be from 10 feet to 12 feet in di- 
mension. Near the same place was two stone-coffins in good pre- 
servation, but from the appearance of the skeletons, they appeared 
to have been previously disturbed. They were of different shapes 
and covered with flat stones, but with no inscription. Between the 
present palace and the church-yard, there were a great many stone- 
coffins, some rough, and others in some degree hewn, in which the 
skeletons were very entire. In one of these were found a piece ofgold 
lace, a piece of a leathern belt, and some buckles. Above these were 
large stones,rising like a ridge in the middle, and bearing inscriptions, 
but so much defaced as to be illegible. At no greatdistance were many 
skeletons without any coffin, and apparently committed to the dust 
in the most confused manner. Very recently a coffin was found com- 
posed of various stones, and covered with a large flat, stone, on one 
end of which there is apparently part of an inscription. There is 
no date, but the form of the letters strongly resembles that used 
about the year 1216, as given, for example, on the great seal of 
Henry III. The first line is " Alexander Mar" — the second 
seems to contain the following letters : " Abbassex de m;" the 
letters beyond the d, and the m are unknown. It is probably the 
grave of an early abbot of the monastery. One of the oldest grave- 
stones bearing date, lately found, is that of " ane honest voman, 
Bessy Ferry, spouse of Gilbert Couper, quha depertit this 1607." 
The ancient gateway on the east is supported on either side by a 
round tower. Walls at one time seem to have run from each of 
these towers towards the house. The royal arms are cut in 
stone immediately above the gateway, and in the towers there are 
the same arms and mottos as those represented on the seat in the 
church. The only additional pieces of antiquity dug up are parts 
of a rude leaden water-pipe, in the neighbourhood of what seems 
to have been the site of the monastery ; and an old bell found about 
a hundred years ago. 



1064 



PERTHSHIRE. 



The old churchyard, still used by those who claim the right in 
consequence of their relations having been interred there, lies at 
some distance from that part of the grounds in which these stone- 
coffins were placed. 

It is stated in the old Statistical Account, that " the Roman mi- 
litary road leading from the camp at Ardoch to the bottom of the 
Grampians, enters this parish on the west, a little above a farm- 
house on the Tay, and passes through till it leaves it on the north- 
east quarter. On the other side of the river opposite to the place 
where the road enters the parish, stood the ancient town of Bertha, 
now a hamlet bearing that name ; and it is said that, in former 
tiroes, there was a bridge over the river, and that several large 
beams of oak yet to be seen under the water formed a part of it," 

" About a quarter of a mile up the river from this place are the 
vestiges, it is supposed, of an encampment. It is a spot of ground 
inclosed on the west by the Tay, and on the other sides by a fosse. 
Its figure is nearly an oblong, and its circumference about 535 
yards. A small brook runs through it ; and on the south side of 
this brook, about 30 yards up from the river, are the vestiges of a 
fortification called the Silver castle ; probably from a vulgar idea 
that money was hid in it. This place is situated nearly about 
half-way between the Roman military road, and a place on the 
opposite side of the river, where the battle of Luncarty was fought 
between the Danes and the Scots. But time, and the recent ope- 
rations of the plough, have now almost obliterated those monu- 
ments of ancient times." This last remark, made about fifty years 
ago, is still more applicable now. 

What was vulgarly called the " boothill" or i omnis terra," 
every man's land, remains to be noticed. It is evidently a corrup- 
tion of Motehill or Moothill. " The term," says the late Dr 
Jamieson,"is evidently Gothic, denoting a place of meeting. Skene 
calls it " the Mute-hill of Scone ;" verb, signifying vo. Mote, vide 
Etymol. Dictionary of the Scottish language vo. Mote." In the 
history of the House of Douglas and Angus, written by Master 
David Hume of Godscroft, Ed. 1644, it is said, " Robert Bruce 
was crowned at Scone in the year 1306 in Ap. at which Sir James 
Douglas assisted, casting into a heape, as others did, a quantity of 
earth of his lands of Douglas, which making a little hill, is called 
yet omnis terra. This was the custom of those times, by which ho- 
mage they that held the King of Scotland supreme under God 
were distinguished from others." This story Dr Jamieson cha~ 
ractes izes as " a palpable and very silly fable." According to the 



SCONE. 



1065 



old Statistical Account, this hill was between 60 and 70 yards 
north from the old Abbey church. Of this church there were 
scarcely any vestiges when that Statistical Account was writ- 
ten. " Such changes," it is there said, " does time introduce, 
that on that spot where our ancient kings were crowned, there no w 
grows a clump of trees." The church, of which the aisle remains, 
seems to have been built on the Mote-hill by the first Viscount 
Stormont about the year 1624. " The people in the Highlands," 
it is said, " call the Boothill at this day Tom-a-mhoid, i. e. the 
hill where justice is administered." Is the " gallows knowe" con- 
nected with this  or the fact that Macbeth, the earliest sheriff in 
the shire of Perth, was styled Sheriff of Scone  

On the farm of Bonhard, which lies on the eastern side of the pa- 
rish, are two circles of large stones. Each circle is about 7 yards 
in diameter, and contains nine stones, placed at unequal distances. 
They are said to be Druidical temples. There are also the re- 
mains of an old castle in Lower Springfield, the greater part of 
which is now in ruins. It has been twice burned to the ground. 

Eminent Characters connected with the Parish. — Of the eminent 
characters connected with the parish by birth, residence, or burial, 
may be mentioned the gallant Hay, so distinguished at the battle 
of Luncarty, who is said to have been born here. At no very re- 
mote period, the inhabitants were wont to point out the remains of 
his humble habitation. They are now entirely obliterated. Ac- 
cording to tradition his name was originally Deluce, for the change 
of which to Hay, a ludicrous and silly reason is assigned, in con- 
nection with his fatigue after the battle. The families of Errol 
and Kinnoull are generally said to have had their descent from this 
individual. According to the common story, this " husbandman, 
who chanced to be busy at work in a neighbouring field, having, 
accompanied by his two sons, armed only with their plough-beams, 
opposed a chief division of their countrymen, when flying from 
the fight in a moment of panic, and " drove them back to victory." 
In this, it is said, originated the nobility of the Hays of Errol. 
" The armorial bearing of this family, which exhibited three escut- 
cheons, supported by two peasants, carrying each the beam of a 
plough on his shoulder, is appealed to in proof of the story ; but 
it is just as likely that the story may have been invented to explain 
the arms. At all events, the arms are of much less antiquity than 
the battle of Luncarty, at the date of which event armorial ensigns 
were unknown. It is well established that the Hays are a branch 
of the Norman de Hayas, whose ancestor came over to England

with the Conqueror ; that they did not come to Scotland till more 
than a hundred years after the battle of Luncarty ; and that they 
only obtained the lands of Errol from King William the Lion of 
Scotland about the middle of the twelfth century. It was not till 
the middle of the fourteenth century that they were ennobled." 

The celebrated William, first Earl of Mansfield, was born at 
Scone, according to common report, on the 2d of March 1704, 
O. S. By some authorities, however, he is said to have been born 
at Perth. He was the fourth son of Andrew, one account says, 
but, according to Debrett, of David, fifth Viscount Stormont, and 
Margery, daughter of David Scott of Scotstarvet, in Fife. He 
was removed in his infancy to London ; admitted a King's scho- 
lar at Westminster school in 1719; entered at Christ Church, 
Oxford, in 1723; and called to the bar in 1731. He soon rose to 
great eminence, and after conducting the defence in a cause in 
which his leader was prevented by sudden illness from appearing 
in Court, so great an amount of business flowed on him that his 
income rose at once from a few hundreds to thousands a-year. In 
1743, he was appointed Solicitor- General, and obtained a seat in 
the House of Commons, where his brilliant eloquence and legal 
knowledge raised him to the greatest eminence. He was made At- 
torney-General in 1754, and two years afterwards he was appoint- 
ed Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and raised to the peerage 
by the title of Baron Mansfield of Mansfield, in the county of Not- 
tingham, becoming at the same time a member of the Cabinet. 
Strong inducements were held out to lead him to devote his talents 
entirely to politics, but he firmly refused to abandon his position 
as Chief Justice. For a short time he held the seals of office as 
Chancellor of the Exchequer on the resignation of Legge, and 
was then entrusted by the King with full power to negociate re- 
specting a new administration. He incurred much popular odium 
on the trial of the publishers of Junius's letter to the King, but 
he did not court popularity. 

Lord Mansfield's house in Bloomsbury Square was attacked and 
set fire to during the riots of 1780. The superb furniture, flung 
into the streets, was destroyed by fire, together with some thousand 
volumes, many capital manuscripts, mortgages, papers, and other 
deeds, besides the rich wardrobe and some very valuable paintings. 
On this occasion, Lord and Lady Mansfield made their escape 
through a back-door only a few minutes before the rioters entered 
and took possession of the house.

Having sat at the head of the King's Bench for upwards of 
thirty-two years, his Lordship retired in 1788. On September 
20th 1738, he had married Elizabeth Finch, sixth danghter of 
Daniel Earl of Winchelsea and Nottingham. He left no issue. 

On October 31st 1776, he had been created Earl of Mansfield 
with remainder to Louisa Viscountess Stormont, wife of David 
Viscount Stormont, his nephew, it being then held that a Scots 
peer was disqualified from taking a peerage of Great Britain even 
in remainder. Her ladyship still survives, having become Countess 
of Mansfield on his death. A different opinion, however, was after- 
wards established respecting the descent of a British peerage, and 
in August 1792, the Earl was created Earl of Mansfield of Caen- 
wood, in the county of Middlesex, with remainder to his nephew 
David, seventh Viscount Stormont, K. T., who consequently be- 
came Earl of Mansfield at his uncle's death, in the eighty-ninth 
year of his age, on the 20th of March 1793. This second Earl 
of Mansfield dying September 1st 1796, was succeeded in his 
Scotch and English honours by his son William, born March 7th 
1777. At his death in February 1840, the present Earl succeed- 
ed. He was born in 1 806 ; married in 1 829 Louisa, daughter of 
Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. who died November 24th 1837, leaving a 
daughter, Lady Louisa Nina, born 1830, and a son, Viscount Stor- 
mont, born 1835. 

The seventh Lord Stormont and second Earl of Mansfield was 
much engaged in the political transactions of his time, and filled 
the offices of ambassador at the courts of Vienna and Versailles. 
The canopy of state which his Lordship then used has been con- 
verted into a bed, which is still preserved. He was appointed am- 
bassador in the room of Lord Harcourt, who succeeded Lord 
Townsend as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1772. In October 
1779, Lord Stormont was appointed one of the Secretaries of State, 
in room of Lord Suffolk. Lord Stormont went out with his party, 
when the Marquess of Rockingham was appointed first Lord of 
the Treasury ; but was President of the Council during the Duke 
of Portland's administration, when the Earl of Mansfield was made 
Speaker of the House of Lords, and the great seal was put in com- 
mission. This coalition ministry was formed April 2, 1783. Be- 
fore his appointment as an ambassador at Paris, Viscount Stormont 
had spent much of his life in a diplomatic capacity. He married 
first, Henrietta Frederica, daughter of Henry Count Bunau, who 

" The first Earl of Mansfield survived his elder brother David, sixth Viscount 
Stormont, for the long period of /orty -five years.

died March 16, 1766. He married second in 1776, Louisa, daughter 
of Charles ninth Lord Cathcart, and sister to William, the present 
venerable Earl of Cathcart. She still survives, Countess of Mans- 
field in her own right, as already mentioned. 

Among the individuals deserving remembrance connected with 
the parish, may be mentioned the Rev. John Honey of Blairhall, 
and at his death minister of Bendochy, in the presbytery of Meigle. 
He is well remembered by many of the parishioners of Scone, not 
merely for his piety and professional attainments, but also for 
his active exertions in the cause of humanity. His name in St 
Andrews continues to be associated with the dangers and the 
preservations experienced on that coast, in several instances of which 
his intrepid humanity was displayed. He married, on September 
20, 1809, a daughter of the Rev. D. Adamson, one of the minis- 
ters of St Andrews, and Professor of Civil History in the Univer- 
sity. He was ordained minister of Bendochy in 1812, but was cut 
off by fever in the prime of life on the 14th October 1814, being 
then only in his thirty-sixth year. 

The celebrated bonanist and traveller, Mr David Douglas, was 
a native of Scone. He was born in this parish in 1798. His fa- 
ther, John Douglas, was a working mason. David was chiefly edu- 
cated at the parochial school of Kinnoul, and at an early period 
became apprenticed as gardener in the garden of the Earl of Mans- 
field, where his activity and obliging disposition were soon per- 
ceived. He was afterwards employed in the garden of Sir Robert 
Preston of Valleyfield, whence, in about eighteen months, he re- 
moved to the botanic garden of Glasgow. Having here attracted 
the notice of Dr now Sir W. J. Hooker, Professor of Botany, 
and accompanied him in his excursions through the Western 
Highlands, assisting in collecting materials for the Flora Scotica, 
Douglas was recommended, through Dr Hooker, to Joseph Sa- 
bine, Esq. the late Secretary of the Horticultural Society, as a 
botanical collector. In consequence of this, he was despatched 
to the United States in 1823, where he procured many fine plants, 
and greatly increased the Society's collection of fruit-trees. He 
returned in the autumn of that year, and again, in July 1 824, he 
sailed for the purpose of exploring the botanical riches of the 
country adjoining the Columbia River, and southwards towards 
California. He collected many rare orchideous plants, when the 
vessel touched at Rio de Janeiro ; shot many curious birds in his 
voyage round Cape Horn ; visited and sowed a collection of gar- 



SCONE. 1069 

den seeds in the Island of Juan Fernandez, and arrived at Fort 
Vancouver on the Columbia, on the 7th of April 1825. The 
vast collections of seeds which he transmitted home from this lo- 
cality, amply proved his talents and assiduity. He traversed the 
country across the Rocky Mountains to Hudson's Bay in 1827, 
and returned to England in the autumn of that year. Having 
been then introduced, through Mr Sabine, to the Literary and 
Scientific Society in London, he was elected, free of expense, a 
member of the Linnnoan, Geological, and Zoological Societies, 
and contributed some valuable papers. After remaining two years 
in London, he again sailed for Columbia in the autumn of 1829. 
Here he continued his favourite pursuit. Afterwards he visited 
the Sandwich Islands ; and when his return was expected, intel- 
ligence was received of his death in very shocking circumstances. 
He had fallen into a pit made by the natives of the Sandwich 
Islands, for the purpose of catching wild bulls, and a bull being 
in the pit at the time, this celebrated botanist was killed in the 
most horrible manner. This event took place on July 12, 1834, 
in the thirty-sixth year of his age. 

The Chief Land-owners. — The land-owners of the parish are 
as follows : The Right Honourable the Earl of Mansfield ; An- 
drew Murray, Esq. of Murrayshall Murrayshall is in the parish 
of Kinnoull, but part of Mr Murray's property is in the parish of 
Scone ; Alexander Macduff, Esq. of Bonhard ; Jelf Sharpe, Esq. 
of Kincarrochy ; Rev. John A. Honey of Blairhall ; Patrick 
Matthew, Esq. of Barclayhills; George Grant, Esq. of Limepotts; 
and the Trustees of Scone's Lethendy. — Vid. New Stat. Account, 
Perth, p. 128. There are many feuars, who hold chiefly of Lord 
Mansfield and Mr Murray. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are very defective. 
The earliest entry is dated 17th February 1622, and goes on to 
7th November 1647. There is no register of any kind for the 
next twenty-seven years. From 1673 to 1688, there are some 
memoranda of births, &amp;c. ; but from 1688 to 1716, nothino- 
whatever. From 1716 to 1740, there is a book containing some 
brief notices, and again, after a gap from 1740 to 1762, there are 
registers from 1762 to 1772. Minutes of session seem to have 
been kept from 1773 to 1787. Subsequently to that date they

tanical Magazine may be consulted, and also the Gardeners' Magazine, Vol xii"

yard of Scone, may be found in t'.ie MS. of this article.

are very rare, the only registers, then, beingthose of births and mar- 
riages. Regular session records have been kept since 18.32 to 
the present date February 1843 together with registers of births 
and marriages, when parties apply to have the birth of their chil- 
dren registered and pay the fee. Since 1838, a register of deaths 
has also been kept, stating the age and the disease that proved 
fatal when known. 

The only apology for the loss of any part of the session records 
appears in the following entry: " Feb. 5, 1716, After sermon, 
session met and was constituted with prayer, and were present the 
Rev. Mr Tho. Schaw, minister, and the elders. This being the 
first Sabbath after dispersing the rebels, they having banished 
many ministers of this corner from their flocks, and that confusion 
and disturbance occasioned the loss of the session minutes from 
November 25, 1713, to February 5, 1716." 

On the north-west of the parish, there is the large bleachfield 
of Stormontfield, together with the requisite buildings. There is 
an abundant supply of water, as it is on the banks of the Tay, 
and suitable fields for carrying on the operations. This field has 
long maintained a high reputation under the present tenant, John 
Maxton, Esq., who makes'every provision for the comfort of those 
workmen and their families who conduct themselves with propriety. 
There is accommodation for between twenty and thirty families, 
all the members of which, able to work, are generally employed. 
The late Earl of Mansfield erected a neat and commodious school 
for the children in the neighbourhood. Stormontfield, with the 
land for a great extent on the east side of the Tay, belongs to the 
Earl of Mansfield. 

III. — Population. 
Formerly the population was more scattered over the parish ; 
but as the land has been divided into larger farms, the village has 
increased. Several valuable farms are now in grass, forming the 
extensive parks around and beyond the palace. The population 
has increased progressively. The village of New Scone has been 
almost entirely built within the century. Much of it is occupied 

 The session seems to have exercised complete control over education within 
the parish. " Oct. 25, 1676, — This day it is inacted, that no person nor persons 
whatsomever, to wit, naither men nor women, shall have libertie, nor be permitted 
within Scone nor the paroch thereof, to teach nor instruct children, that is to say, 
neither male nor female to sylabicat nor reade directly nor indirectly, to the hurt and 
prejudice of the publick school and schoolmaster." And over the seats in the church, 
" Sep. 13, 1675, This day it is inacted that every seat or chair standing in the kirk 
floore that is found emptie two Sabbaths together, shall bethrowen to the church door 
by the kirk officer, except upon reasonable excuse made to the minister,"

by feuars. The late Earl of Mansfield, partly by purchase and 
partly by giving an equivalent in land, obtained possession of the feus 
at Old Scone. The village of New Scone has been greatly extend- 
ed, containing between 1200 and 1300 inhabitants. Many of the 
feuars have sub-feued their properties ; and other proprietors have 
increased the village by encouraging feuing on their ground. A 
large part of the village stands on the property belonging to An- 
drew Murray, Esq, of Murrayshall, and some on that of the pro- 
prietor of Kincarrochie. 

The only nobleman connected with the parish is the Earl of 

Mansfield. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The average number of acres, either cultivated 
or occasionally under cultivation, may be as follows: 

Wheat, about 200 Scotch acres. 

Barley, . 400 

Oats, . • 700 

Potatoes, . 380 

Turnips, . 300 

Hay, . 600 

The average rent of the cultivated land may be about L.2, 10s. 
per Scotch acre. The average rate of a cow's grazing may be 
about L.3, 15s. Ordinary ploughmen, engaged for the year, have 
from L. 11 to L. 14 wages, besides board and lodging; foremen 
have from L.15 to L.20. Day-labourers earn from Is. 4d. to 2s. 
in summer, and from Is. to Is. 8d. in winter, per day ; artisans 
from 2s. to 3s. in summer, and from Is. 8d. to 2s. 6d. in winter. 

The general duration of leases is for a period of nineteen years. 
The farm- buildings are generally good; but the cottages, in seve- 
ral places, very uncomfortable. Some part of the parish is well 
enclosed, but there are considerable portions where enclosures are 
but little attended to. A great improvement has taken place in 
•the whole economy during the last thirty or thirty-five years. The 
produce of oats, at an average per acre, may be rated at 46 bu- 
shels ; of barley, 38 ; of wheat, 34 ; of potatoes, 8£ tons per 
Scotch acre. Neither beet nor cabbage are cultivated in the 
field. The average value of an acre of turnips may be about 
L.9; of hay, about L.6 ; and land for pasture may bring from 
L I, 15s. to L.2 per Scotch acre. 

The above was furnished in 1837. There has been since then 
a diminution in the value of all kind of farm-produce, and, in some 
degree, of wages, both for farm-servants and labourers. The dif- 
ficulty of obtaining employment as hand-loom weavers has increased 



1072 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the number of out-door labourers, and consequently brought down 
their wages. 

Fisheries. — The fisheries in the parish belonging to Lord Mans- 
field extend from opposite the palace to Cambusmichael, and were 
let last year for about L.100. Lord Kinnoull has a fishing in the 
lower park above Quarry Mill-dam, let for about L. 20, making 
about L. 120 of rent. About eighteen years ago, the rent was 
about L.I 100. The reason for the extraordinary diminution is to 
be sought for in two causes, — the greater keenness with which 
the lower fishings are worked, and the reduction of the value of 
the fishings above the tide-way, occasioned by the alteration of 
the close-time. The close-time, formerly from 26th August to 
12th December, is now from 14th September to 1st February. 1 
am assured by the intelligent gentleman R. Buist, Esq., Perth, 
to whom I am indebted for this information, that " our ancestors 
were right in their close-time, and that the sooner we return to it 
the better for the fishings on the Tay." 

The fish got in the Tay opposite Scone are, salmon, grilse, 
sea-trout, yellow-trout, pike, perch, eels, and, occasionally, trouts 
that frequent burns and streams running into the Tay. The fish 
are seen going down the river after spawning, the males very early 
in the season, in December and January, and the females and fry 
in the latter end of March, April, and beginning of May. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The market-town is Perth. There is no village of any extent 
except New Scone, which is within two miles of Perth, thus ren- 
dering any market-town within the parish unnecessary. There is 
in the village a sub-post-office to Perth, and a delivery of letters, 
free of expense, on the arrival of the south mail. The turnpike 
road from Perth to Coupar- Angus passes through the parish for 
more than four miles, on which the Defiance coach travels north 
and south daily. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Before the village was transferred to New 
Scone, the parish church was situated in the old village. It had 
been built in 1784, but in 1804 it was removed to New Scone, the 
same materials being as much as possible made use of. The pre- 
sent situation is not very centrical, but being near the village, it is 
much more conveniently situated than it would have been at Old 
Scone, now that the bulk of the population are in New Scone. 
The whole seating of the church, exclusive of Lord Mansfield's 
seat is said, in a minute of a meeting of date 1786, to be 677 feet, 

 The information as to agriculture was supplied by a very intelligent farmer, and 
may be relied on so far as it goes.

4 inches. Of this, the communion seats, which are free, take up 
106 feet, 8 inches. In the year 1834, it was found that the pa- 
rish church, though in good repair, was too small to accommodate 
the members of the congregation, whereupon some of the heritors 
and a number of the feuars agreed to build an additional aisle by 
subscription. This was done at an expense of above L.280, and 
furnished about 180 additional sittings, besides greatly improving 
the appearance of the church. The manse was built at the time 
at which the church was removed. Considerable repairs were 
made on it in 1832-3, but it is deficient in accommodation. The 
stipend is as follows : barley, 105 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 lippie, one-half 
peck ; meal, 1 13 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 lippies, one-quarter peck. Money, 
L.61, 3s. 4d. ; for communion elements, L. 10. The glebe is about 
27 Scotch acres. Nearly twenty-four of these are let at a money 
rent 

There is a Dissenting congregation in connection with the 
United Associate Synod. The parish church is, in general, very well 
attended, as also the Dissenting chapel. The average number of com- 
municants at the Established Church is about 600. In 1833, there 
was a society established in connection with the parish church, for 
the purpose of raising contributions in aid of the schemes under 
the direction of the General Assembly, and for procuring Bibles 
for gratis distribution, and at a cheap price. The collections for the 
poor at the church-door amount to between the sum of L.50and L.60 
a year ; the collections for the schemes to somewhat above L.20. 
For some years, there was a collection for the Infirmary at Perth, 
but the scheme of parochial subscription was adopted last year, 
realizing about L.35. There are also from time to time collec- 
tions for the Sabbath school. 

The late Earl of Mansfield and his ancestors exercised the 
right of patronage up to a recent period. 

On the 12th November 1828, a summons of declarator, at the 
instance of his Majesty's Advocate against the Earl of Mansfield, 
was raised for the purpose of having it declared, " that the right 
of patronage of the churches and parishes of Redgorton, Kinfauns, 
and Scone," belongs to, and is invested exclusively in, the Crown. 
The Lord Ordinary, in 1830, decided in favour of the pursuer. 
This decision was acquiesced in without appeal to the House of 
Lords. So far as can be ascertained, the following were ministers of 
Scone : Before 1673, Mr John Liddell. He seems to have died end 
of June 1686. In 1687, Mr John Murray was minister. In 17 16, the 

PERTH. 3 Y

minister was Mr Thomas Schaw. On August 15, 1754, Mr 
James Knox, probationer, whose predecessor had been admitted 
on a call, was admitted minister of this parish on a presentation 
bv the Viscount of Stormont's commissioner. On 27th October 
1777, Mr Charles Wilson,f Mr Knox's successor, was admitted 
minister on a presentation by the Viscount of Stormont. On 15th 
August 1782, Mr James Hunter, Mr Wilson's successor, was 
admitted minister on a presentation by the Viscount of Stormont. 
On 25th September 1793, Mr John Wright, Mr Hunter's suc- 
cessor, was admitted minister on a presentation by the late Earl 
of Mansfield. On November 19, 1795, Mr William Aitken, 
who succeeded Mr Wright, was admitted minister on a presenta- 
tion by the late Earl of Mansfield. The present incumbent, who 
succeeded Mr Aitken. was presented by the Crown, and ordained 
September 20, 1832. 

Education. — There is a parochial school exceedingly well at- 
tended, and admirably taught by the present teacher, Mr William 
Keay. His salary is the maximum. The fees are not high. 
The branches required, according to minute of election, are Eng- 
lish reading, writing, arithmetic, and Latin; but mathematics, 
French, &amp;c. are also taught. There are other schools for girls 
in the village, but the attendance is very small. The teacher 
at Stormontfield has always had an allowance of L.4 from Lord 
Mansfield, and L.2 from Mr Maxton ; but this is purely gratui- 
tous, and may be withdrawn at any time. By a sermon preached 
at Stormontfield annually, a small addition is made to his salary, 
and his fees are rather higher than at the parish school. He has 
in winter about fifty scholars. There are at the parish school in 
winter from 130 to 150. The Sabbath school is numerously at- 
tended. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of poor re- 
ceiving parochial aid may be about 28 or 30. The allowance va- 
ries from L.2, 8s. per annum to L.4, 16s. or L.5. The funds 

 Mt Knox was descended from William Knox, minister of Cockpen, brother of 
John Knox the Reformer. William had three sons, who were all ministers of 
Cockpen, Kelso, and Melrose respectively. William, the eldest, succeeded his father 
as minister of Cockpen. Simon Knox, minister of Girton, was his third son by the 
second marriage. Simon's son was William Knox, minister of Dairsie, and his third 
son was James Knox, minister of Scone. His grand-daughter married the late Rev. 
John Johnston, first of the Relief, and, at his death, of the Established Church, in 
Edinburgh. 

t Mr, afterwards Dr Wilson, had been minister of Auchtermuchty before he 
came to Scone. From Scone he went to St Andrews as Professor of Hebrew, and 
is well known as the author of Uie " Elements of Hebrew Grammar,"

are derived from church door collections, nearly L.60 ; interest 
of money, above L.45 ; fees on mortcloth, and for the last two 
years, a voluntary assessment, on the part of the heritors, amounting, 
in 1841, to L.80, and in 1842, to L.60. The sum of L.40 is 
paid by the trustees of the Cupar Angus turnpike road, as interest 
on L.1000 lent them. This sum of L.1000 was the price paid 
by Lord Mansfield for some ground belonging to the poor at Old 
Scone, and which was sold to his Lordship at the time of the re- 
moval. Continued privation seems to prevent the poor from feeling 
that it is degrading to accept relief. With a few exceptions, those 
who once begin to receive parochial aid, continue to take it without 
much hesitation. A number of individuals, not on the list of or- 
dinary poor, have been in the habit of receiving from the family 
at Scone Palace, for many years, assistance in the way of coals 
and flannel, besides other benefits. This is continued in all its 
fulness up to the present date. The Earl of Mansfield has given 
much employment to those inhabitants of the parish able to un- 
dertake out-of-door labour, — a method of doing good still better 
than merely giving charity. 

Inns, Sfc. — There are within the parish nine taverns in which 
ardent spirits may be procured. There can be no doubt that 
they have an injurious effect on the morals of the people. 

Fuel. — The fuel generally consumed is sea-coal, procured from 
Perth, at the rate of from 15s. to L.l per ton, besides the cartage 
and toll. Scotch coal is also used, being brought for sale, during 
the summer and autumn months, from the collieries in Fife. A 
considerable quantity of oak, from which the bark has been re- 
moved for the use of the tanner, is also consumed, together with 
brushwood from the plantations.

PRESBYTERY OF WEEM, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER STEWART, M. A., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of this parish is variously derived. It 
may signify " the chapel, churchyard, or burying-place of the 
pool," — the ruins of an old chapel and church-yard being si- 
tuated on the bank of the river Lochey, and having one of 
the deepest pools in the river just behind them. But a more 
romantic derivation has been given. A spot near the village 
of Killin has, from time immemorial, been pointed out as the 
grave of Fingal. This was once the site of the church, and also 
of the church-yard. The name agrees with either derivation, Cill- 
linne, or Cill-Thinn. There are considerations, however, which 
lead the writer to adopt the latter. One of these is, that the 
church and churchyard of the parish were near the site of Fingal's 
grave, and therefore at a considerable distance from the pool. 
Another circumstance deserves to be mentioned. The course of 
the Lochay seems to have been at one time considerably distant 
even from the present churchyard, and still more so from the old 
one referred to. There is additional strength given to the tradi- 
tionary derivation, by the fact, that the ancient seat of the Bread- 
albane family, which is situated near Killin, is called Finlarig, or 
the field or plain of Fingal. That the tradition has been occa- 
sioned by the name of the parish, as the writer of the former Ac- 
count seemed to believe, and not the name by the tradition, is by 
no means probable, and indeed can scarcely be entertained for a 
moment. 

Extent, Sfc. — The parish is of great extent ; the extreme points 
Inverarnan, near the head of Lochlomond, and Ardeonaig, on Loch 
Tay, being distant from each other about twenty-eight miles, while, 



KILL1N. 



1077 



in breadth, it varies from 5 to 9 miles. It comprehends about 
160 square miles. 

The figure or shape of the parish is very irregular, and several 
isolated portions of the parishes of Kenmore and Weem intersect 
it on Loch Tayside and in Glenlochay, so that though the dis- 
tance between the extreme points be as above, the greatest length 
of the parish of Killin, quoad civilia, may be reckoned about 24 
miles. It is bounded on the east by the parish of Kenmure ; on 
the south, by Comrie and Balquhidder ; on the west, by Arrochar 
and Glenorchay ; and, on the north, by Glenlyon, which forms 
part of the old parish of Fortingall. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish is ir- 
regular, presenting a succession of mountain ranges, and fertile 
glens and valleys. The highest mountain is Benmore, situat- 
ed in Glendochart, about ten miles from the village of Killin. 
It rises, in a majestic conical form, to the height of 3900 feet 
above the level of the sea, and presents an object of the most at- 
tractive interest to the eye of the traveller. The mountain-range, 
from Benmore to the head of Lochlomond, is unquestionably one 
of the most magnificent in the Highlands, and the admirer of 
Grampian scenery will rarely find his taste so highly gratified, 
and his toil so amply repaid, as by travelling up Glenfalloch on a 
summer evening, and from the summit of the road which passes 
through that most romantic of Highland glens, gazing on the 
grand chain of mountains which extend, as in a continuous line, 
from Benmore to Benlomond. Another range of exceeding inte- 
rest and grandeur is that of Craig -Chailleach old wives' craig, 
in the immediate neighbourhood of Killin, rising abruptly and 
richly wooded more than halfway up from the noble plain of 
Finlarig, at the head of Loch Tay, and stretching westward into 
Glenlochay. It forms the grandest by far of all the objects which 
combine to render the scenery of Killin so rich in the variety of 
its parts, and so splendid in its general aspect. The turretted 
peaks of this mountain-range may be seen to great advantage by 
moonlight from any spot near the church ; and the tourist who is 
fortunate enough to obtain this view, will confess that it is grand 
beyond expression. 

The hills, though rising to a great height, are, generally speak- 
ing, clothed with verdure to their summits, The principal val- 
leys are, Glendochart, stretching westward from Killin about ten

miles; Strathfillan, which may be considered a continuation of 
the same valley, extending about eight miles further till it meets 
the parish of Glenorchay, at the boundary between the counties 
of Perth and Argyle : Glenfalloch, branching off from Strathfillan 
in a southerly direction, and extending to the boundary between 
Perthshire and Dumbartonshire, near the head of Lochlomond ; 
and Glenlochay, stretching from Killin to a distance of about 
fourteen miles in a line nearly parallel to Glendochart, from which 
it is separated by a fine range of hills, called the Mid- Hill. These 
valleys are rich and fertile, yielding good crops of corn, pototoes, 
and turnips ; and in the more marshy districts, on the banks of 
the river, bearing meadow hay of excellent quality in great abun- 
dance. Their scenery is in many places highly picturesque, being 
enriched with thriving plantations, and a considerable quantity of 
natural wood. With the exception of these valleys, which in few 
places hardly exceed a mile in breadth, there is very little fiat 
land in the parish. The fine plains of Finlarig, Kirmell, and 
Dall may, however, be mentioned. 

Meteorology.— The temperature of the atmosphere in this pa- 
rish varies to an extraordinary degree, according to the changes 
of season. During the winter and spring months, it is generally 
very low ; towards the middle of April, a change often very mild 
takes place ; and generally during the summer months, the heat 
is great, sometimes excessive, causing the most rapid vegetation. 
There is in general much cloudy weather, especially in the latter 
end of autumn, and in the winter and spring months, when there 
are frequent and heavy falls of rain. As might be expected in so 
elevated a region, far removed as it is from the sea, the snow, 
which falls in great quantities, remains long, especially on the 
high grounds. In the beginning of the year 1838, there was a 
storm of uncommon severity ; the whole surface of the ground 
being covered in some places to a depth of several feet for eight 
weeks, while the ice on the river Lochay was ascertained to be 
about fourteen inches in thickness. It is no uncommon thing to 
observe considerable quantities of snow on the high grounds till 
far on in the summer, and traces of the old snow have sometimes 
been noticed even in August. 

The prevailing winds are the west and south-west ; but in the 
spring months, there is a good deal of northerly wind, which is 
peculiarly keen and piercing. In summer, there is often a loner

tract of very calm weather, in which, for days together, scarcely 
a hreath of wind can be felt. 

Climate.— The climate is, during a great part of the season, 
decidedly damp. It is also very variable, except during the sum- 
mer months, and after long-continued frosts of winter and spring. 
It is, however, decidedly healthy, and many of the inhabitants 

live to a great age. 

We have before us a register of the state of the barometer and 
thermometer at Killin, at 8 a. m. and p. m., kept by the late Mr 
M'Gibbon, schoolmaster, from the year 1800 till his death, and 
since that time by a member of his family. The following table 
gives the average for 1820, for each month, and for the whole 
year : —

summers quite so warm now as they were then ; but the average 
is still the same. The state of the thermometer, for May 1840, 
was 50.9, and for November, 43.1. 

Hydrography. — The principal lake connected with the parish 
is Lochtay, at the west end of which Killin is situated. It extends 
eastward from Killin to Kenmore, about fifteen miles, varying 
from one to two miles in breadth. It is generally of great 
depth, and has never been known to freeze. The scenery 
of Lochtay is much admired, especially at the two extremi- 
ties. The mountains on either side, and especially on the 
north, are lofty, and rise abruptly from the edge of the loch. 
Its shores are also tastefully skirted with wood, and the slop- 
ing sides of the mountains are cultivated to the height gene- 
rally of about half a-mile from the margin of the lake. To the 
tourist in search of views and romantic scenery, the road by the 
south side of the lake is recommended. Into Lochtay, two rivers 
discharge their waters, the Dochart and the Lochay. The for-

mer takes its rise about twenty miles to the west of Killin, at the 
boundary of the counties of Perth and Argyle, then flowing through 
Strathfillan, under the name of Fillan, for a distance of about seven 
miles, it enters a small lake called Loch Dochart, and thence is- 
suing, enters Lochure. These two lakes are nearly joined. It 
then, under the name of the Dochart, flows rapidly through the 
romantic glen of that name, and, after a course of about ten miles, 
joins the Lochay, and falls into Lochtay. The river Lochay rises 
in the braes of Glenlochay, through which it flows for about four- 
teen miles. There is another stream, the Falloch, which runs 
through the beautiful glen of that name, and discharges itself into 
the queen of British lakes, Lnchlomond. 

Cascades.— In times of rain, thousands of cascades dash down 
the sloping sides of the mountains. The falls of the Falloch, as 
it pursues its way through the lovely wooded glen, will richly re- 
pay a visit. The falls of the Dochart at Killin are much admired 
by the traveller of taste. From the bridge, looking upwards, few 
scenes present a more striking and grander appearance. The falls 
of Lochay, about three miles from Killin, are uncommonly grand. 
The glen is naturally divided into two parts, and the river has 
forced its way through the solid rock of the precipitous defile 
which separates the upper from the lower glen. This part, 
extending to about a mile in length, is not inferior in grandeur or 
richness of scenery, in rugged knolls and wooded dells, to the far- 
famed Trosachs, while the falls have been pronounced equal to 
those of Clyde. The different points from which the best views 
may be got, are accessible by romantic winding walks formed 
through the woods. From these points, at one time high above 
the foaming cataract, and sometimes near its edge, it may be seen 
tumbling and dashing in majestic grandeur, sending clouds of spray 
to a considerable distance. 

Mr Pennant thus describes the view from a hill above the manse : 
" A most delicious plain," he observes, " spreads itself beneath, 
divided into verdant meadows, or glowing with ripened corn ; em- 
bellished with wood, and watered with rivers, uncommonly con- 
trasted. On one side pours down its rocky channel the furious 
Dochart; on the other glides between its wooded banks the gentle 
Lochay, forming a vast bend of still water, till it joins the first, 
both terminating in the great expanse of Lochtay." — " Killin," 
says Dr MacCulloch, "is the most extraordinary collection of ex-

traordinary scenery in Scotland, unlike every tiling else in the 
country, and, perhaps, on earth, and a perfect picture-gallery in 
itself, since you cannot move three yards without meeting a new 
landscape. A busy artist might here draw a month and not 
exhaust it. Fir-trees, rocks, torrents, mills, bridges, houses, — 
these produce the great bulk of the middle landscape, under end- 
less combinations, while the distances more constantly are found 
in the surrounding hills, in their varied woods, in the bright ex- 
panse of the lake, and the minute ornaments of the distant valley, 
— in the rocky and bold summit of Craig Cailliach, and in the 
loftv vision of Ben-lawers, which towers like a huge giant to the 
clouds, the monarch of the scene." 

Geology. — The predominating rock is mica slate in the greatest 
variety of mineral character. The talcose, chloritic, and horn- 
blende rocks are of frequent occurrence, and of considerable thick- 
ness. Limestone, of a highly crystalline character and greyish co- 
lour, is abundant. Trap veins are also to be met with, and por- 
phyry and syenitic greenstone. Lead-ore is abundant. The 
Tyndrum mines have been re-opened and carried on with spirit 
for some years past, under the direction of experienced German 
miners. Cobalt is found, and is so rich as to yield sixty ounces 
of silver in the ton. In Craig- Chailliach, near Killin, there is a 
rich vein of sulphuret of iron. It has been examined with the 
view of working it for the manufacture of sulphur. Specimens of 
rock-crystal, amethystine quartz, smoke quartz, and imbedded 
garnets, are to be met with. A large crushing-mill has been 
erected at Tyndrum, and rails laid for conveying the ore down 
the steep descent to the mill. 

The country is rich in metallic veins, though the great distance 
from coals and from the market may render them less valuable. 
The working of them would be highly beneficial to the people ; 
and this is the object chiefly in view in the researches of the noble 
proprietor. 

Pearls. — In the Dochart the pearl-muscle is found, from which 
beautiful and valuable pearls are extracted. 

Soil. — The soil is generally on limestone, and is light and dry, 
A considerable part of the arable land is wet and marshy, particu- 
larly in Glendochart and Strathfillan, and the crops are often en- 
dangered or swept away by the overflowing of the river ; so that 
an autumnal flood, converting our valleys into lakes of many isles, 



1082 



PERTHSHIRE 



though liighly interesting to the passing traveller, is very alarming 
to the anxious farmer. The soil, though capable of producing 
good crops of oats, barley, potatoes, and turnips, is best adapted 
for pasture. The hills afford the richest sheep-walks. 

Botany. — The following valuable paper, on the Botany of the 
district, we owe to the able pen of Sir William Hooker. 

There is not, perhaps, in all Britain a more interesting 
field for the botanist, than the vast mountain tracts of the 
Breadalbane range, so large a portion of which is imbedded in the 
present parish. It may, indeed, in this point of view, be looked 
upon as classic ground ; for here the lynx-eyed Dickson, the inde- 
fatigable Don, Mackay, Stuart, Rev. Dr, the friend of Lightfoot, 
and a most important contributor to his valuable Flora Scotica, 
Turner, Borrer, Wilson, Hooker, Graham, and a host of compe- 
tent students of the two professors now mentioned, have scaled 
the highest peaks, and explored the deepest glens with such ar- 
dour, that no part of the Highlands has been better investigated 
as to its vegetable riches, than the district in question. Our li- 
mits will only allow us to give a brief notice of the rarer, and es- 
pecially the alpine species.

An equally rich catalogue might be made of the rare ferns,

b~e occupied which requires to be devoted to subjects of more ge- 
neral interest. 

Plantations. — There are about 1000 acres of wood in the pa- 
rish, and of these a great part consists of very thriving plantations. 
In the higher parts of Strath fillan, where there is now rather a 
want of wood, it is evident it once abounded, as the trunks of large 
trees are very frequent in the ground. The following kinds of 
wood are indigenous, and grow to a large size : oak, ash, moun- 
tain-ash, birch, elder, hawthorn, and hazel. The plantations con- 
sist chiefly of Scotch and silver fir, spruce, and larch. At Finla- 
rig, some fine specimens of yew may be seen, and a plane proba- 
bly three hundred years old. Laburnum and holly are also abun- 
dant. The following table of trees, measured about three feet 
from the ground, will give some idea of the adaptation of the land 
to the growth of wood : —

Zoology. — The following animals abound : roe-deer, brown 
and mountain-hares, rabbits, black-game, grouse, ptarmigan, 
pheasant, brown and white partridges, woodcocks, snipes, plovers, 
&amp;c. The following, which are found in this country, are reckoned 
rare : the scaup-duck, the water-rail, the ring-ouzel, the greater 
spotted woodpecker, the uut-hatch, the greater and lesser red 
pools, &amp;c. There are the following quadrupeds : foxes, badgers, 
wild martin, and polecats : — of birds of prey : eagles, kite-glade, 
buzzard-glade, falcon, hawk, hen-harrier, kestril, mertin, spar- 
row-hawk, owls, white, brown, and horned : — of aquatic birds: the 
swans, wild geese, sea-gulls, and herons. 

Fisk. — The following abound in the lakes and rivers : salmon 
and trout, also pike, char, and eels. Salmon of thirty-six pounds 
have been killed in Lochtay; and pike, weighing upwards of twenty 
pounds. The angler may have excellent sport in the lochs, or 
in the rivers and mountain streamlets. The salmon-fishing is 
worth about L.150 per annum. At the Bridge of Killin, the vi- 
sitor may see a curious mode of fishing. Standing on a rock beside 
the deep foaming pool, may be seen an aged weather-beaten fish- 
erman, having in his hand a rod fourteen feet long, with a strono- 
twine attached with a sinker of half a pound weight, and a large 
steel hook two and a-half inches wide. In the dark pool the sal- 
mon rests after ascending the lower rapids, and before he ventures 
to attempt the raging cataracts above. The fisherman throws 
his line into the foaming linn, and the moment the sinker reaches 
the bottom, he gives the rod a sudden jerk, and not unfrequently 
the hook gets fastened in the side of a large salmon, when the 
deadly but unequal struggle begins, and the fish is speedily landed 
on the rock. Neither fly, nor worm, nor minnow is used; and 
yet the fishing, though in dark and troubled waters, is often verv 
successful. From the spot where the fisherman stands, the lover 
of the sublime may obtain a grand view of the descending river, 
and of the towering Benmore in the distance. Several sketches 
of this scene have been taken from the Innisbuidhe, but none from 
the spot pointed out.

Family of Breadalbanc. — The history of the Noble family of 



KILLIN. 



1085 



Breadalbane is connected with this parish from very remote times. 
Finlarig, one of their ancient seats, is near Killin. It occupies a 
fine site, embosomed in wood of a venerable age at the north-west 
end of Lochtay, with the river Lochay sweeping past its base. The 
castle was built by Sir Duncan Campbell, seventh Laird of Glen- 
orchay. The following incidents are from the " Black Book of 
Taymouth." 1. Sir Colin Campbell, first Laird or second son 
of Duncan, in a Knight of Lochaw, " conquessit the takis of the 
ten mark landis of Auchmore." 

2. Sir Duncan Campbell, second Laird of Glenurquhay, who 
was at the Field of Flodden with King James IV. " He con- 
quessit the heritable tytill of the barony of Finlarig." 

3. The third Laird, Sir Colin Campbell, son to the second, 
who died 15-23. " He biggit the Chapel of Finlarig to be ane 
burial for himself and posteritie." 

6. The sixth Laird, Sir Colin, who succeeded 1550, and died 
1583, " conquessit the superiority of M'Nabb, his haill landis." 

7. Sir Duncan Campbell, " sevint Laird of Glenurquhay," 
who died 1631, " in his time biggit the Castle of Finlarig, Pitt, 
and office-houses thairof ; repaired the chapel thairof, and decored 
the same inwardlie with pavement and paintine ; for the bigging 
and workmanship quhairof he gaiff ten thousand poundis." " Item, 
in the zeir of God 1627, he causit big ane brig over the watter 
of Lochay, to the great contentment and will of the countrie." 
" Ke was ane great Justiciar all his tyme, throch the quhilk he 
sustenit the deidly feid of the Clangregour ane long space. And 
besydes that, he causit execute to the death mony notable lym- 
maris. He behiddit the Laird of Macgregor himself at Kand- 
moir, in presence of the Erie of Athole, the Justice- Clerk, and 
sundrie other nobilmen." 

Several other families of the clan Campbell, such as Glenfal- 
loch, Lochdochart, &amp;c, connected with, or cadets of, the family 
of Breadalbane, long resided in the parish, and owned extensive 
properties. Many scions of these houses have distinguished them- 
selves in the service of their country. 

M'Nab of M'Nab. — Kinnell, on the banks of the Doharr, was 
long the residence of M'Nab of M'Nab, who was descended from 
the abbots of Glendochart. A manuscript in our possession gives 
a minute account of this ancient family. In the reign of David 

• For an interesting account of the Breadalbane family, sec the able Account of 
Kenmure. 



1086 PERTHSHIRE. 

I., 1124, it states that they were called M'Nab Eyre or Oighre, the 
son and heir of the abbot. The Baron of M'Nab fought with Baliol 
against the Bruce at Dalree. The manuscript quotes several an- 
cient charters ; one is by King David Bruce, under the Great 
Seal, dated 1336: « Gilberto M'Nab et haeredibus suis, &amp;c. de 
Bovain in dominatu de Glendochart," &amp;c. Another is by King 
James III. to " Finlao M'Nab et filio, &amp;c. de omnibus et singu 
lis terris de Bovain, Ardchyle, &amp;c, dated i486." Another date, 
1502, is, « Finlao M'Nab de Bovain et ha-redibus suis terrarum 
de Ewar Leiragan," &amp;c. From another deed, confirmed by a char- 
ter under the Great Seal from Queen Mary, dated 27th June 
1553, it appears the Laird of M'Nab mortgaged a great part of 
his lands to " Colino Campbell de Glenurchy et haeredibus suis, 
&amp;c. de omnibus et singulis terris de Zeuir et Leragan cum suis 
pertinent, ac etiam de terris de Bovain, Ardchyle," &amp;c. John 
M'Nab of that Ilk suffered much for his adherence to the cause

This ancient family intermarried with some of the best and

Land-owners. — The land-owners are, The Most Noble the 
Marquis of Breadalbane; W. L. Campbell of Glenfalloch ; T. H. 
Place of Glenure ; Miss Campbell of Coninish ; Mr M'Naugh- 
ton of Suie ; Dr W. Shaw of Craignavie. They are all non-re- 
sident except Mr Place, who occasionally passes a part of the 
autumn at Glenure House. 

There are several genteel residences in the parish. Besides 
Auchmore House though quoad civilia in Weem and Kinnell, 
there is Achlyne, beautifully situated on the Dochart ; Glenure, 

Tnterest was used to have his sequestrated estates restored to his infant son, and 
the following was the reply of General Monk. 

" I do hereby declare that it was not intended by my order for reparing the Laird 
of Glenurchy's leases by the M'Nabs out of their estates, that the same should extend 
to the molesting and intermeddling with the estates of any of the M-Nabs who live 
peaceably ; and, for as much as I understand that the widow of the Laird of M'Nab 
hath lived peaceably, you are hereby authorized, and I desire, in case any vexation 
be offered to the outing or dispossessing of the said widow or her children of the said 
lands, or anything that belongs to them under color of the said order, to preserve the 
rights that to them belong, as if the said order had never been made and to enter 
and receive them into their lands : and this favor also is to be extended for Archibald

16o4. S. S. George Monk. Directed to Captain Gascoigne, Governor of Fin 
larig." But, adds the manuscript, " it had no effect." 

At the Restoration a considerable part of their lands was recovered. The whole 
property was sold some years ago.

Ministers ofKillin.—\. The Rev. Robert Stewart was minister 
of Killin before the Revolution, and till the year 1728. 2. He 
was succeeded by Mr Adam Ferguson, who was translated to 
Moulin in 1736.' 3. Mr James Stewart, who died in the year 
1789. 4. His son, Mr Patrick Stewart, had been ordained as- 
sistant and successor to his father in 1781. He died 1796. 5. 
He was succeeded by Mr Hugh M'Dougall, who died in 1827. 
6. Dr Hugh M'Kenzie, M. D., who was translated from Clyne in 
Sutherland, and died in 1834. 7. Mr Robert Elder, who was 
translated from Kilbrandan, and was called from Killin to St 
Paul's in Edinburgh in October 1838, and w3,s succeeded v 
present incumbent in July 1839. 

In the manse of Killin the present version of the Gaelic Scrip- 
tures was begun. The Gaelic Testament was executed by Mr 
James Stewart, from whom his son, the well-known Dr Stewart 
of Luss, obtained that knowledge of and taste for Gaelic literature 
which enabled him so faithfully to finish the Gaelic translation of 
the Bible. Killin may then fairly lay claim to the honour of this 
great work. 

Parochial Registers. — The register for proclamations commences 
in 1687, and the register of baptisms in 1689 ; and, with the ex- 
ception of ten years, from 1717 to 1727, they have been re- 
gularly kept to this date. The meetings of session are not re- 
corded till 1771. Cases of discipline appear to have been 
were very frequent. One person was publicly rebuked eight times. 
Fines also were imposed on culprits. These went to the poor's 
funds. It appears also, that it was usual to make a collection for 
the poor after the marriage-service, as, along with the sum paid by 
a party " for the benefit of marriage on one proclamation," there 
is, almost uniformly, another entry, " collected at said marriage." 
Such entries as- the following, showing the charity of the session, 
and the number of strange poor which visited the district, are very 
frequent : " To a travelling object. To a poor object. To a poor 
object from the Isles. To a poor object from the Highlands. To 
17 objects from different quarters. To the Presbytery sexton for 
three years. Given out for a Gaelic Testament for a poor orphan. 
Quire of paper for certificates for the begging poor." 

Clandestine marriages were then frequent, but are now unknown.

Antiquities.— We have already mentioned the fine old ivy-co- 
vered castle of Finlarig. In Loch-dochart there is a ruin, said 
to be one of the seven towers built by Sir Duncan Campbell. 
This castle was once taken by the M'Gregors, who approached 
it on the ice, and having surprised the inmates, put them all 
to the sword. There is at Strathfillan the ruins of a building, 120 
feet long and 22 broad, which is said to have been a cathedral. 
Parts of the walls are still standing. The time when it was built 
is very uncertain. There are several Druidical circles. One may 
be seen near Kinnell. Old coins have been frequently dug up, 
some of which are now preserved at Taymouth. 

At Strathfillan there is a deep pool called the Holy Pool, 
where, in olden times, they were wont to dip insane people. 
The ceremony was performed after sunset on the first day of 
the quarter, O. S., and before sunrise next morning. The dip- 
ped persons were instructed to take three stones from the bot- 
tom of the pool, and walking three times round each of three 
cairns on the bank, throw a stone into each. They were next 
conveyed to the ruins of St Fillan's chapel, and, in a corner 
called St Fillan's bed, they were laid on their back, and left tied 
all night. If next morning they were found loose, the cure was 
deemed perfect, and thanks returned to the saint. The pool is 
still visited, not by parishioners, for they have no faith in its vir- 
tue, but by people from other and distant localities. We have 
not heard of any being cured ; but the prospect of the ceremony, 
especially in a cold winter evening, might be a good test for per- 
sons pretending insanity. 

The bell referred to in last Account was about the size of a 
hand-bell, and was an ancient relic of the chapel. It was stolen 
by an English antiquarian about forty years ago. Popish tradition 
endowed it with the power of returning to its resting-place : but it 
would seem England is deemed a congenial home. At the mill 
of Killin, there were long kept a stone called Fillan's Chair, and 
seven small round stones that had been consecrated by the saint, 
and endowed with the power of curing diseases. Each of them 
had its peculiar merit. They got a fresh bed every Christmas 
eve from the straw and weeds cast ashore by the river. Five of 
th em are still preserved at the mill, where they may be examined 
by the curious. 

• Beside it is the Breadalbane mausoleum, embosomed in the dark shade of trees 
of a venerable age.

KIIiLIN. 



1089 



There is in the possession of Mr Sinclair, tenant of Inverchag- 
gernie, an old rifle, four feet long, .with an octagonal bore. It was 
long the property of M'Nab of Innis-Ewen. It was afterwards 
used by the celebrated Gaelic poet, M'Intyre, when one of Lord 
Breadalbane's foresters. In his classic poem " Beinn dourain," 
he thus praises his companion: 

" Ochd-shlisneach gun fheall 
Stoc d'en fhiodh gun mheang, 
Lotadh an damh seang 
Sa leonadh e." 

It had, however, been used for other purposes than wounding the 
antlered monarchs of Coire-cheathaich .and Beinn dourain. A 
party of soldiers had, in 1745, been sent from Finlarig Castle 
to burn the House of Coire Chaorach near Benmore. They were 
watched by M'Nab of Innisewen from the opposite side of the glen. 
After setting fire to the mansion, they were again on their march 
to Finlarig, when, happening to look back, they observed that the 
fire had gone out. One of them was sent back to rekindle it. He 
was observed by M'Nab, who, from his place of concealment, fired 
and killed the red-coat. The rest of the party, seeing the fate of 
their companion, rushed down to the river, but ere they had reach- 
ed it, other three were made to kiss the earth. M'Nab then re- 
treated to the rocks above, still watching his pursuers, and, from 
the heights, he killed three more of his enemies, when the rest be- 
came terrified, and gave up the destructive pursuit. In the stock 
of the rifle there is a recess for a supply of bullets. The same 
person has the celebrated bottle, known to many of M'Nab's 
friends as the Bachelor, and containing nine gallons. It was long 
in use at Kinnell. He has also a very handsome gold brooch, 
which used to adorn the shoulder of Rob Roy M'Gregor: also 
his powder-horn, elegantly mounted in silver. 

There is in the possession of the minister a copy of Bishop 
Beddell's Bible in the Irish Gaelic, with this inscription, " 1688. 
The donation of the honorable, pious, and lairn'd Rob. Boyle, 
Esquire, a principal Member of the Royal Society, bestowed on 
the church of Killin, to continue there as a church-Bible for the 
use of the present minister and his successors, ministers of that 
parish."

Of these, 817 are males, and 885 females. There are 394 fami- 
lies, giving 4j nearly to each family. There are 23 miners, 14 
shoemakers, 12 tailors, 11 smiths, 14 wrights, and 18 weavers. 

In the village of Killin, there are 26 persons above seventy ; 
one is ninety-two, and another one hundred and five, with all their 
faculties entire. 

Owing to the number of burying-places in the parish, there is 
no register of deaths kept. Many also neglect to register the births 
of their children ; but the following may be taken as an average of 
births, deaths, and marriages: Births, 35 ; deaths, 20 ; mar- 
riages, 1 0. 

There are 6 fatuous persons and 7 insane. 

Language. — Though nearly the whole population can under- 
stand and speak less or more of English, Gaelic is still, and will 
long be the language of devotion and of the affections of the 
people.

There are no undivided commons. 

Rent.- — The valued rent is L.31 15, 6s. 8d. Scots, but the real 
rental is about L.8640. The average rent for grazing a horse is 
L.I, 10s. ; an ox or cow, 15s. ; ewe or wether, 4s. 

Live-Stock. — The number of sheep is about 30,290 ; black cat- 
tle, 1138 ; horses about 200 ; and swine about 250.

of 2s. Cd. each, or L.12, 10s. a hundred. About a fourth of the 
stock is usually wintered from home. Allowing five fleeces to the 
stone, the wool will amount to about 6000 stones. The sheep are 
the black-faced, and of the best kind. A few Leicesters and South- 
downs may be seen in the parks. The cattle are of the pure West 
Highland breed. There are also a few Ayrshire cows introduced 
for dairy purposes. 

Wages. — A ploughman gets from L.12 to L. 15, and a female 
servant from L.5 to L.7 a-year ; the wages of a common labourer 
are from Is. 2d. to Is. 6d. a-dav without victuals: masons and cor- 
penters, from 2s. 3d. to 3s. 

Husbandry. — The husbandry is undergoing rapid improvement. 
Draining is carried on to a considerable extent, also blasting, the 
proprietor paying one-half of the expense. Could the rivers be 
embanked, an immense benefit would accrue to the farmer. The 
deepening of the channel has been attempted with some success. 

The farm-houses and offices are still in many places very infe- 
rior, but they are gradually giving place to neat slated accommo- 
dations. The five shift rotation, though adopted with advantage 
by many, is still disliked by some. The leases generally are from 
seven to fifteen years. 

Manufactures. — There is a wool-mill, where spinning and card- 
ing are carried on. There are two saw- mills, and two mills for 
meal and barlev. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — There are no market-towns in the parish. The 
nearest is Crieff or Stirling ; the former being twenty-seven, and 
the latter thirty- eight miles distant. 

Villages Sfc— There are two villages, Killinand Cliftown. Kil- 
lin contains a population of 400. It has a sub-office of the Cen- 
tral Bank of Scotland, and also a savings' bank. There are seve- 
ral shops where goods can be purchased at a reasonable rate. 

There is a daily post to and from the south, so that the Glasgow 
papers may be read at Killin at five or six o'clock p. m. of the day 
of publication. There is a post three times a-week to and from 
Kenmore and Aberfeldv. 

J 

Means of Communication. — The roads and bridges are in excel- 
lent repair, and the means of communication very good. There 
is a weekly carrier to Stirling, &amp;c. and one monthly to Glasgow 
via Dumbarton, also one monthly to Crieff. In summer, there is 
a daily or thrice a-week coach running between Killin and Dun-

keld, while a coach leaves Killin everv morning for Lochlomond 
to meet the steamer on that lake. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The site of the chnrch is, on the whole, 
very convenient, especially as there is a church at each extremity 
of the parish, where ordained clergymen officiate every Sabbath. 
The church was built in 1744, and repaired in 1832. It has 905 
sittings. Of the population, 488 are attached to the mission or 
quoad sacra parish of Strathfillan, and 288 to the mission of Ar- 
deonaig, leaving 926 to Killin. To this may be added 473 be- 
longing to the adjacent parts of Weem and Kenmore, who attend 
the church of Killin, receive ordinances there, and are under the 
pastoral superintendence of the minister. Except about 45 per- 
sons, the whole population belongs to the Established Church. 
The Dissenters are Baptists and Independents, who worship in a 
hired room in the village. They ha\e no stated pastor. There are 
no Episcopalians. The manse and offices are good, and the heri - 
tors evince every disposition to make the minister comfortable. 
The stipend is 1 6 chalders, half meal and half barley, at the highest 
fiars of the county, and L.10 for communion elements. There is 
a considerable amount of free unexhausted teinds, and the lastauc- 
mentation was given in 1815. The glebe extends to about thirteen 
acres, and may be worth about L.13. The solemn ordinance of 
the Lord's Supper has since 1840 been administered twice a-year, 
and the additional opportunity has been gratefully appreciated. 
The number of communicants in the whole parish may be about 
600. The present incumbent has, for the last eighteen months, 
been in the habit of occasionally officiating on the Sabbath even- 
ing in the remote districts of the parish, particularly at Ardchyle, 
where the school-house is always crowded. 

There are several Sabbath schools in active operation. The 
minister of Strathfillan has L, 60 per annum, arising from a sum 
mortified by the pious lady Glenorchay, for the maintenance of a 
chaplain in that district. He has also a manse and glebe, with a 
valuable hill pasturage. The minister of Ardeonaig has also a 
stipend of L. 60, with manse and a glebe, consisting of 17 acres. 
The half of his stipend is paid by Lord Breadalbane, and the 
other half by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. 
The noble family of Breadalbane have long been distinguished 
church and school extensionists. 

Education. — The parish is well supplied with schools, viz. 1 

parochial ; 3 societies for Propagting Christian Knowledge ; 2 

t 



KILLIN.

supported by the Marchioness, and taught by females ; 2 adven- 
ture schools. In the parish school, besides the ordinary branches, 
Greek, Latin, mathematics, and book-keeping are efficiently 
taught. In March the number in attendance at all the schools was 
485, being one in four of the population. The parish school is en- 
dowed with the maximum salary, with a commodious house and 
garden. The Society's teachers have from L. 15 to L. 17, with a 
free house, croft, and cow's grass. Lady Breadalbane's schools 
are also endowed. The teacher at Killin receives L. 20, with a 
free house, garden, and fuel. In this school about 50 girls and 10 
boys receive their education gratis. The girls, in addition to the 
usual branches, are taught sewingand knitting. There is also adame 
school in the village, where very young children attend, and are 
taught the rudiments of English and Gaelic with knitting, and we 
are not sure but the venerable teacher might lay claim to the ho- 
nour of havincr invented the infant school system ; she has a free 
house from the Marchioness. 

All the children above six years of age can read, and nearly all 
in Gaelic and English. Among the aged, especially the females, 
there are many that cannot write, but of the young, both boys and 
girls, almost all learn writing and arithmetic. The expense of edu- 
cation may average for the whole year about 10s. We must 
add that nearly all the people, even the poorest, make an effort 
to give to their children the benefits of education. Most of the 
teachers bestow much care on the communication of religious 
knowledge to their pupils. 

Literature. — There is a library in the parish, consisting of about 
800 volumes, principally of religious books. The Breadalbane Phi- 
lanthropic Association has been in existence for several years, and 
has been of great use in furnishing the Scriptures and school books 
to the people at a low rate. 

Savhvjs Bank. — It was instituted in 1832, and its advantages 
are felt and acknowledged by the population, for it often stands 
in good stead when rent-day comes round. The following gives 
a view of its progress for the first three years : 1832, amount de- 
posited, L. 91, 15s.; depositors, 17. 1833, amount deposited, 
L.158, 9s.; depositors, 17. 1834, amount deposited, L.201,2s. 
10£d.; depositors, 23. Total deposited in eleven years, L.237I, 
18s. 5£d. ; withdrawn, L.1479, 12s. llfd., leaving due the depo- 
sitors, L.1128, 5s. lid. 

Poof. — The average number of poor receiving aid from 1836 



PERTHSHIRE. 

to 1841 is 81, being 1 in 21 of the population. Almost all of 
them have a free house, and many of them a small garden, rent- 
free. They have the liberty of cutting peats, and occasionally 
get a supply of fuel. The average money expenditure for six 
years is L.180, being L.2, 4s. to each pauper. Besides the above, 
several persons have private pensions from the Marquis ; and the 
Marchioness causes a yearly distribution of clothes to be made 
about Christmas among the most necessitous poor. In addition 
to the above, about L.40 worth of meal is annually allowed to the 
poor. The old feeling of independence and unwillingness to be 
on the "box" is, we regret to say, fast disappearing. 

Fairs.— There are several fairs held at Killin. One for gene- 
ral business on the third Tuesday of January: the first Tuesday 
of May for business, and the 12th for cattle; and the first Tues- 
day of November O. S. for general business and for cattle. There 
is a market at Tyndrum for lambs and wool on the third Thurs- 
day of July. 

Inns.— There are six excellent inns in the parish; and at five 
of them post-horses and carriages are always kept. They have 
been lately much enlarged and improved. Streethouse Inn is re- 
ceiving very extensive additions, which will make it a very com- 
modious house. 

Fuel— Fuel is scarce and expensive. A cart of peeled oak 
costs 5s., of peats, 3s.; and a ton of coals, L.l, 10s. 

It may here be mentioned, that this parish was visited by her 
Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, and his Royal Highness 
Prince Albert, on the 10th September 1842. The' day was all 
that could be wished. The lake, about to receive its Queen on 
its bosom, though sometimes rude and boisterous, assumed a holi- 
day placid appearance. All classes of the people, from the infant 
lisping the name of its sovereign, to the gray-haired sire of 92 
and the venerable dame of 105, in their gayest attire, hastened to 
see and welcome their Queen. Royalty had not visited the parish 
since the illustrious Bruce fought at Dalree. 

In addition to the sums arising from collections, donations, mortcloth and pro- 
clamation-dues, about L. 130 has been raised by voluntary assessment, according to 
the valued rental of property. The sum annually collected for the poor averages about 
L.40. This is inclusive of the collections at Strathfillan, and of about the half of 
those at Ardeonaig.

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, §c. — This parish is not known to have ever had any other 
name. The principal of the landing-places of the Priory of Inch- 
mahome and of Talla, a seat of the Earls of Menteith, was natu- 
rally called, by eminence, Port, a word of the same meaning in 
Gaelic as in English ; and, when a church was built here, it gave 
its name to the parish. 

In the Parliamentary erection of the abbacies of Dryburgh and 
Cambuskenneth and priory of Inchmahome into a temporal lord- 
ship in 1606, the parish of Port is mentioned as having anciently 
belonged to the Priory. 

In January 1615, the parish of Lany was dismembered, and 
part of it annexed to that of Port ;f of which the dimensions have 
since been, in extreme length from east to west, about 9 Eng- 
lish miles; and in breadth, 6. The southern confine is nearly 8, 
the northern 3 only. The general shape is an irregular square. 

Topographical Appearances. — About half of the parish is moun- 
tainous moor and level peat-moss; and the productive surface 
is farther diminished by lakes, the largest of which is in the 
centre, and towards five miles in circumference ; and the rest, 
five in number, amount jointly to a third of the other. The 
mountainous tract is on the north, at the commencement of 
the Scottish Highlands, to which the transition from the low- 
lands is here abrupt. The lake of Inchmahome, close to the

foot of the mountains, is not more than fifteen feet above the 
high-tide mark in the river Forth, into which it sends the sluogish 
stream of the Guidie. 

The mountainous tract above-mentioned is part of the Gram- 
pian. The highest point, being that of Craig Dhu or Black 
Oaig, is from 1800 to 2000 feet. This mountain, of which the 
general form is that of a sow's back, and which is harshly cut into 
five or six parts, is composed of conglomerate rock and of lime- 
stone. The Uuter, blue and streaked with white, is fit for being 
cut into chimney-pieces ; and specimens are, as is believed, to be 
seen in the house of Ballikinrain, distant from the quarry about ten 
miles. When burnt, it affords a quick-lime of the purest white. 
In another mountain, which stands on the east, and is, by the 
lowlanders, called the Craig of Port, but, by the Highlanders, 
from its colour, as seen from the north, Craig Dhereag or Red 
Craig, there occurs, on the south side, in the lands of Auchrig, 
a rock avalanche a quarter of a mile long. Masses of rock, detached 
from the mountain, and interspersed with ivy of ancient growth, 
are piled in rugged disorder, and resorted to by the fox and the 
badger. F rom their base, a copious stream of limpid water issues 
in the driest weather. Of Craig Dhereag the height may be esti- 
mated at from 1 500 to 1 600 feet. Immediately above the rock ava- 
lanche now described, and within 300 feet of the highest point of 
the mountain, a lake occurs about half a mile in circumference, 
and of which the outlet is towards Loch Venachar, which bounds 
the greater part of the parish on the north. This sheet of water, 
from its being invisible from the lower parts of the country, is 
ealled Lochan-falloch, or "hidden little loch." South of Craig 
Dhereag about half a mile, and in a moor considerably higher than 
the country south of it, is Loch Rusky, about a mile in circum- 
ference, having a small island, on which are the ruins of a house, 
partitionally assigned to that noted Sir John Menteith of Ruskv 
by whom the patriot Sir William Wallace was apprehended In 
the neighbourhood of this lake are some medicinal springs which 
have never been scientifically examined. 

Geology.— the strata in the mountainous tract above-men- 
tioned, the dip is towards the south-east. In a ravine, a quarter 
of a mile north of the lake of Inchmahome is a deep fissure, cut 
by the stream of Glenny, in a tortuous direction, and to the length 
ol about a hundred yacds. The sides, about thirty feet high and

separate five or six feet, lean, one of them backward, and the other 
in the same proportion forward. 

In the champaign district, there is a deposit of blnish-gray sand- 
stone, of a close texture, and of great use for pavements and stair- 
cases. This, indeed, is part of a deposit which extends diagonally 
across Scotland many miles. It has the same clip as the strata 
of the Grampian range. 

The soils of this division of the parish are various. Of the peat- 
mosses the principal is part of the extensive Moss- Flanders; another 
is the mossofGartur ; and a third, smaller than either, is Talla-moss. 
There are some tracts tilly and difficult to drain ; others gravelly and 
ferruginous, and comparatively barren ; others consisting of mea- 
dows and swamps, more or less fertile ; others of a shallow loam, 
very fertile ; others of a shallow loam on rock, and considerably 
productive; and, along the Forth, which bounds the greater part 
of the southern frontier, and intersects the parish on the south- 
west, so as to have the barony of Gartmore wholly on its southern 
bank, there is a rich carse, part of which has been acquired by float- 
ing oil the incumbent peat. Some fields include, each of them, 
several of the soils above mentioned. 

The climate inclines to moisture, owing, as is supposed, to the 
proximity of the Grampians, to the profusion of peat-moss, and to 
the want of acclivity. 

Hydrography. — Of the lakes, namely, Inchmahome, Rusky, 
Lochanballoch, Loch-lettir, and Loch-macanree, the first is by far 
the principal. A sixth lake, Loch Drunky, principally in the parish 
of Aberfoyle, and three-quarters of a mile long, runs a short way 
into the parish of Port, through which its rivulet finds its way into 
Loch Venachar. The lake of Inchmahome is, for the most part, 
shallow, but in some places abruptly deep. Nigh shore, opposite 
the porter's lodge of itednock, the sounding is 46 feet ; and be- 
tween Inchmahome and the north shore, 88. Half-way from 
Inchmahome to the old ferryman's house at Gateside, it is 63 ; 
and in the large bay south of Talla, south-west of it, and more 
than half-way to the shore, 42. This sheet of water quickly 
freezes; and the ice, in even the deepest parts, is sometimes 
so strong as to bear loaded carts. Its scenery is of a tranquil 
character; and the epithet classic has been applied to it. The 
island of St Columba, as luch-ma-home is supposed to signi- 
fy, constitutes the leading feature. It consists of about five 
acres, surmounted by a forest of ancient trees, of which the

principal are the Spanish chestnut, several centuries old, and 
mostly in a state of decay. These, interspersed with planes 
and ashes, considerably old, and with a profusion of under- 
wood, more particularly the Spanish filbert, form an appropriate 
accompaniment to the ruins of the priory, which, embosomed in 
this forest, is seen in glimpses from the northern shore, where from 
twenty to thirty full-grown park trees, the plane, the Spanish 
chestnut, and the oak, scattered over the fields, and around the 
richly-wooded hill of Coldon, heighten the effect. From an emi- 
nence north-west of the lake, and over which the public road passes, 
the whole prospect, including the islet of Talla, which, too, is pro- 
fusely wooded, and contains the ruins of a castle of the late Earls of 
Menteith, is enhanced by Stirling Castle in the remote distance, 
with a considerable tract of country still more remote, seen over 
the hills of Inchy covered with thriving plantations, and Lochend, 
adorned by an extensive grove of full-grown trees. 

Tradition, as intimated by an intelligent statist, who wrote an 
account of this parish above a century since, asserts that the vale 
of Monteith contained an arm of the ocean as far as the south-west 
confine of the parish, the hill of Gartmore ; and thisis countenanced 
by the lowness and flatness of the surface to that point, where, as 
stated by the author now referred to, there was in his day a stone 
with a hole in it, and in which there was an iron rincr for tvino- 
boats to ; " which stone," he says, " is to this day called clach-nan- 
loang, or the  ship or boat-stone.' " This name, it may be added, 
still marks a place or small farm on the hill of Gartmore. 

It may be mentioned that, above twenty years since, in driving 
a level in a ditch which, due east of the church port, forms the 
march betwixt the estates of the Duke of Montrose and General 
Graham Stirling, the exuviae of the marine mussel, the periwinkle, 
and other shell-fish, were thrown up from seven feet below the sur- 
face of the incumbent soil, consisting of from three to four feet of 
gravel, and, next, of a substance resembling pipe-clay, and appli- 
cable to the same domestic use. 

Zoology. — The osprey built, till lately, in a tall oak at the east 
end of the ruined church of Inchmahome, but, scared by the re- 
peated plunder of her nest, has deserted the lake. The white- 
horned owl builds in the ruins of both islands. Various species of 
the hawk hover about the lake. The Falco genlilis has his eyrie

in Craiff-Dhu. The common heron frequents this lake, but builds 
in a desert isle of Loch- Con, and nowhere else in Monteith. The 
wild-duck and the diver abound more in the lake of Inchmahome 
than in any of the known Highland lakes ; attracted, as would seem, 
by the vast profusion of aquatic plants on a shallow bottom. The 
cormorant and the swan are occasional visitants. The otter is an 
inhabitant. 

The lake of Inchmahome contains a variety of fish. 1 he staple 
is the perch, which, of late years, has been much diminished by 
the steeping of flax, and by the increased use of lime as a manure. 
This lake has trout also, and of the same quality as the Lochleven 
in Kinross-shire. Its pike has, in man's memory, been much les- 
sened in both number and size by the draught-net, whilst the 
trout has proportionally increased in both respects. The eel, too, 
which was numerous and gigantically large, has been swept away 
by that destructive implement. Salmon is said to have come into 
the lake before the erection of mills on the Guidie. 

Botany. Of the plants of Inchmahome and the vicinity, the fol- 
lowing may be noticed. The Arum maculatum, or wake robin, grows 
profusely in Inchmahome. The Typha latifolia is found on the shore 
of Talla, and at the efflux of the Guidie. The great bulrush oc- 
curs in great abundance on the northern shore of the lake. The 
Littorella lacustris grows within the water- mark of the western 
margin of Inchmahome. The Lysmachia, or loose-strife, occurs 
in Talla, but in no great quantity. The shore of Inchmahome 
abounds in the Lythrum salicaria, or willow-herb. The water- 
lilv, yellow and white, adorns the shores of both islands. The com- 
mon reed, once in requisition by the weavers of Glasgow and Pais- 
ley, but, now by the flyshuttle rendered of no estimation, grows 
profusely on the shores of the lake. 

The principal plantations of trees in the parish have lately been 
made by General Graham Stirling on his estate and residence 
of Rednock, in forming an extensive park, consisting of a highly 
diversified surface. They are in a very thriving condition. 

Of the lawn tree, the most venerable specimens occur in the 
park of Cardross, anciently the seat of the priors of Inchmahome, 
on whom it is said to have been bestowed by Sir Malcom Drum- 
mond of that ilk, one of the heroes of Bannockburn. 

• For the notices of animals and plants, the writer was indebted to the late Rev. 
Patrick Graham, D. D. minister of Aberfoyle, who had made botany one of his par- 
ticular studies.

Historical Notices.— The only known account of the parish of 
Port, previously to the very short one in the former Statistical Ac- 
count, is that by Alexander Graham, Esq. of Duchray, It was, 
as stated by the author, composed in the year 1724, and, along 
with accounts of sixteen others of the parishes around, is inserted 
in the valuable collections of the late Walter MacFarlan of Mac- 
Farlan, deposited in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. 

Timothy Pont's Map of the Lennox, from a survey made early in 
the seventeenth century, includes the parish of Port, and pari of 
that of Aberfoyle, neither of which belonged to that ancient divi- 
sion of Scotland. 

A much more particular map of the parish of Port, surveyed 
above half a century since by James Stobie, along with the rest 
of Perthshire, and with Clackmannanshire, was soon after pub- 
lished, and is a model of minute correctness. 

Some letters and other papers, illustrative of local antiquities, 
and preserved, amongst others, in the archives of the Earls of Men- 
teith, and latterly in the house of Gartmore, have been in print 
since 1815. 

In regard to the early history of this part of the vale of Mon- 
teith, one of the points occurring for consideration is the site of a 
town of the Picts, as stated by an English historian, the venerable 
Bede, in the earlier part of the eighth century. This topic is na- 
turally suggested by the stream of Guidie, being that by which 
the lake of Inchmahome discharges its superfluous waters into the 
Forth eight miles east of the efflux. To claim the site of the an- 
cient town of Guidie to the parish now treated of, is no part of 
the writer's intention. It may, however, be, from a concurrence of 
circumstances, inferred, that Guidie was situate near a stream 
which, at even the present hour, bears its name. Correspond- 
ing to Bede's intimation of the extent of the Friths of Forth 
and Clyde, and their joint intersection of Britain till each of 
the parts could be said to be nearly contiguous, is the tradition 
above-mentioned, that the eastern arm of the ocean anciently ex- 
tended along the vale of Monteith as far as Gartmore. The stream 
of Guidie, indeed, till drained artificially, which it was at no very 
distant epoch, formed a lake, and, in old writs, is styled " the lake 
of Guidie." It hence occurs, as not only not unlikely but most 
highly probable, that the Pictish city of Guidie was situate near 
the water bearing the same name. That no vestige of a city should

now exist in this quarter, is certainly no reason why it had not ex- 
isted in the eighth century. 

The well-known Sir John Monteith, Commissioner of Edward I. 
of England, and the individual who delivered Sir William Wal- 
lace into Edward's hands, was younger son of Walter Stewart 
Earl of Monteith, and took his mother's surname, having obtain . 
ed part of her lands, the barony of Rusky. Between his sons, John 
Menteith of Rusky and four others, on one part, and Sir John 
Drummond of Drummond, aided by Sir Walter Murray of Tulli- 
bardine, a feud arose, from the slaughter in 1330 of Bryce Drum- 
mond, procurator, son of Gilbert Drummond of Balquhapple, a 
\ounger son of Sir John Drummond's family ; and this led to a hos- 
tile rencontre at Tor or Tar of Rusky, as reported by tradition, 
when, as from an extant document certainly appears, three of Rus- 
ky's brothers, namely, Walter, Malcolm, and William were killed. 
Mutual outrages followed ; nor was the difference adjusted till 17th 
May 1360, when Robert Erskin and Hew Eglinton, Justiciaries of 
Scotland, Sir Robert Graham, and others of the nobles of Scotland, 
at the command, as is said, of King David II. met on the banks 
of the Forth, near Stirling, as arbitrators, and, amongst other ar- 
rangements, awarded Rosneth, belonging to Sir John Drummond, 
to the only survivor of Rusky's brothers, Alexander, as a compen- 
sation for the slaughter of the others. It is a fact worth noticing, 
that Sir John was father of Anabella, Queen of Robert III. 

North-west of the lake of Inchmahome, at the Moss of Talla, 
where the Earl of Lennox, at the head of an army levied to avenge 
the death of King James III., had, after marching from Dum- 
barton Castle, held by him against King James IV., pitched his 
camp, — a skirmish took place, and ended in a chase, in the night 
of the 11th or morning of the 12th of October 1489, when the 
Sovereign in person, with Lord Drummond as his Commander- 
in-Chief, attacked Lennox unexpectedly. This affair is known 
in popular history as the battle of Tullimoss, which Bishop Lesly, 
in ignorance, as would seem, of the topography of Menteith, speaks 
of as fought at a morass near the Castle of Touch. Buchanan, 

 The learned Stukeley supposes that Guidie might have been a wooden fort on 
Inchgarvey. It is quite necessary, indeed, both in this case, and in the hypothesis of 
its being in the vale of Menteith, to have recourse to a perishable material. A more 
celebrated writer, but an inferior antiquary, has fixed on Camelon as the site in ques- 
tion. — Buchanani Historia, iv. 37. The Itinerary of Hardinge, who visited Scot- 
land in the fifteenth century in the service of Henry VI. of England, is the basis of 
the theory of Sir Robert Sibbald, that the site of Guidie was the rock on which the 
castle of Edinburgh stands.

on the other hand, a native of the Lennox, and durino- some of 
his earlier years resident in the lands of Cardross, in Menteith, 
affirms expressly that Lennox crossed the Forth, not far from the 
foot of the Grampians, and is seconded by Hawthornden. 

One of the principal of the prisoners was Thomas Galbraith 
of Culcreuch, who was executed on or before the 18th instant, on 
which day James IV., at Stirling, granted to his household ser- 
vant, Adam Hepburn, brother-german of Patrick Earl of Both- 
well, and to his heirs, a charter of Culcreuch, &amp;c. in Stirlingshire, 
of Millegs, &amp;c in Dumbartonshire, and of some lands in Renfrew- 
shire, which had belonged to the deceased Thomas Galbraith, 
formerly of Culcreuch, and were in the King's hands by the death 
of the said Thomas, who, for his treasons, had been justly exe- 
cuted. 

The village of Port was, by King James III, on 8th February 
1466-7, erected into a burgh of barony, as appears from the re- 
cord of the Great Seal of Scotland, which contains a chaiter bv 
that sovereign at the above-mentioned date, to Malise, Earl of 
Monteith, and his successors, erecting this village, as above-stated, 
for the accommodation of the King and his lieges, in the bounds 
of Menteith. 

The Priory of Inchmahome was, from before September 
1547, to the end of February following, the seat of the Scottish 
Court. Soon after the disastrous battle of Pinky, the Re- 
gent Arran, by advice of the Queen mother, the Earls of 
Angus, Argyle, Rothes, Cassilis, and others at Stirling, sud- 
denly conveyed the infant Queen Mary to Inchmahome, and 
committed her to the joint care of the Lords Erskine and Li- 
vingston. This measure was intended to secure, as far as pos- 
sible, the safety of Queen Mary's person, which now ran great 
risk of falling into the hands of the victorious English. Of Mary's 
residence in this sequestered spot, the particulars have already 
been some years before the public in the elaborate biographv 
of Queen Mary by the author of Caledonia, who, from record, 
has fixed the time, as above-stated, of her departure. Whilst 
here, she enjoyed the company of her mother as her more im- 
mediate guardian. Lady Fleming, natural sister of Queen Ma- 
ry's father, acted as her preceptress, aided by John Erskine, Com-

-.idator of Inchmabome, afterward Lord Erskine, and more 
lately Earl of Mar and Regent of Scotland, together with the 
parson of Balmaclellan. From Inchmahome, the Court moved 
to Dumbarton Castle, that Queen Mary might be in the way 
when a fleet should arrive from France, to transport her thither. 
The Queen-mother, indeed, had, during her residence m Inch- 
mahome, gone to Stirling for the arrangement of the voyage, and 
of her daughter's marriage to the Dauphin. 

About this time, a scuffle took place in the neighbourhood, be- 
tween the Appin Stewarts and the Grahams of Monteith. The 
principals in the quarrel were the Earl of Monteith and Stewart 
of Invernaheil, Tutor of Appin, tvnd, from his faculty of beating 
with a couple of forehammers at once on the smith's anvil, known 
popularly as Donald nan Ord, or of the hammers. An illustrious 
author, in his very curious history of Donald the Hammerer, has 
omitted what local tradition reports, that the Stewarts were re- 
turning from the defeat of Pinky. He was unaware, when he 
wrote, that the scene of the scuffle was close to Tobernareal, the 
Clare Fontane of the district, being a remarkable spring of water 
on the top of the ridge, as the traveller goes from Monteith to 
Strathgartny, and comes in sight of Benledi and Loch Venachar. 
The occasion of the broil, indeed, as reported by tradition, and 
stated by the author above alluded to, was unworthy of human 
nature. The mountain strangers, retreating from a hard-fought 
but disastrous field, had, under the pressure of hunger, help- 
ed themselves, unceremoniously, in a tavern at the Church of 
Port, to some poultry on the spit, which were intended for the 
dinner of a marriage party, of which the Earl of Monteith was 
one, and had set off, on their way home, without stopping till the 
arrival of those for whom the dinner was intended, and without 
leaving an apology. The Earl, conceiving that an affront had 
been deliberately offered him, pursued them, and came up with 
them at Tobernareal. To a taunt from one of his atten- 
dants, the reply by "one of the Highlanders was a speech in the 
same taste, and an arrow through the heart. The Earl himself 
fell by the ponderous arm of Invernaheal, or Donald of the Ham- 
mers. Nearly all the Lowlanders were killed. One of the slain 
was Alexander Graham, paternal ancestor of John Graham of Duch-

ray and Rednock. The tutor of Appin, favoured by the shades 
of night, escaped with but a single attendant. 

Under 6th September 1653, in the Government newspaper of 
the period, the following notice occurs, from a correspondent at 
Dalkeith : " Colonel Reid yet lies in a field near Port, by the 
Isle of Menteith, near which the engagement was." The conflict 
alluded to seems to have been at the Pass of Aberfoyle, of which 
a well known memoir of William, ninth Earl of Glencairn, gives 
an account.f 

The largest of the islands in the principal of the lakes of this pa- 
rish, seems to have very anciently been a seat of the Culdees. This, 
which in itself is highly presumeable, appears from what David 
Camerarius says of St Berchan, that he was renowned in Stirling- 
shire in the eighth century, and spent part of his youthful days in 
the Convent of St Columba, not far from Stirling; an assertion 
applicable to Inchmahome. 

Whether the Culdees ceased to have a footing in Inchmahome, 
when the monks of St Augustine were planted here, is unknown. 
Middleton, in his List of the Religious Houses of Scotland, 
says that Augustinian monks were planted here by King Ed- 
gar, probably about 1107, the year of that sovereign's death. 
Conformably to this intimation, an authentic document, dared 
a. d. 1238, being a warrant to Walter Cumin, Earl of Menteith, 
for building a church in this island, states that the edifice is in- 
tended for the religious men residing there, meaning, obviously, 
that they had already been settled. Connecting this information 
with that given by Middleton, we are led to the inference that 
the monks of Inchmahome had no suitable place of public worship, 
according to the Romish ideas, during at least a hundred and 
thirty years from their settlement, and were confined to the hum-

f A most illustrious author, in a foot-note to his edition of Duchray's Memoir, 
says that " Graham of Duchray's Castle, situate about a mile to the eastward of the 
Pass, was burnt by the English the morning before the action." This statement is 
probably meant for Duchray's Castle of Rednock, which, however, is seven miles 
east of the Pass of Aberfoyle. The Castle of Duchray stands above a mile west of 
the Pass, and was the point whence, as his head quarter, Glencairn marched to en-

Besides the parochial church of Lany over the door of the mu- 
tilated remains of which may still be read, in Arabic numerals, 
" a. d. 1214," are the parochial churches of Kilmadock, Port, 
and Lintreathan, which, in the Parliamentary Act 1606, already 
referred to, are, along with Lany, stated to have been granted by 
the sovereign to John, Earl of Mar, and his heirs and assignees 
hereditarily, as having " pertenet of auld" to the priory of Inch- 
mahome. Four chapels were attached to it. 1. That of Inchy, 
about a furlong north of the exit of the stream of Guidie, on a 
gentle eminence close to the lake of Inchmahome, and now form- 
ed into a garden. Here, according to local tradition, the Earl of 
Monteith who fell by the hand of the tutor of Appin was 
with a wedding party, when he received the news of that petty 
depredation which led to the scuffle in which he lost his life. 
2. The chapel of Arnchluy, about a mile west of the lake, and 
whose name is by Gaelic scholars interpreted " Portion of the 
cell or burying -ground." 3. Chapellaroch, in the parish of Dry- 
men, barony of Drummond, and in that part of the modern Stir- 
lingshire which was anciently part of the earldom or county of 
Lennox. 4. Balquhapple, or " Town of the Chapel," in that part 
-of the quondam parish of Lany now annexed to Kincardine. Of the 
priory of Inchmahome, the buildings are still so entire, that the uses 
to which each of them respectively was applied may be guessed at. 
The nave and the choir measure together fifty paces by twelve. The 
former had in the north wall four arches, two of which fell about 
fifty years ago. One of the entire arches, being the western, is 
covered by a tower or belfry ; a quadrangle corresponding to which 
on the south side, is erased, as are the cloisters on the same side, 
and of which the corbels are visible. The rest of the arches had 
an aisle outside, of which the ragling is discernible on the tower. 
The western entrance is entire ; and some of the hewn stones of a 
window above are visible. The oriel window of the choir is filled 
up with rubble- work of modern date. The side walls of this part 
of the building are almost entire. 

South of the church, at the distance of a few yards, are the 
ruins of an edifice, consisting, on the ground floor, of the refectory, 
nineteen paces by eleven ; and to which was an entrance from the 
dormitory on the north, another from the kitchen on the south- 
east angle, and a third about the centre of the east wall, and de-

scending by a few steps from the stairs leading to two or more 
apartments above the kitchen. Of part of all these apartments the 
materials seem to have been used for the construction of the more 
modern of the edifices in the neighbouring island of Talla, and of 
a mausoleum in Inchmahome, which, consisting partly of a vault 
and an apartment above, and partly of an avenue, shut in by 
two walls, and at the west end by a gateway, and running 
obliquely from north-east to south-west, surmounts part of 
the foundations of the church and dormitory. For the awk- 
ward position of this more recent structure no reason can be as- 
signed, but a total absence of design. It seems to have been 
hurriedly got up to receive the remains of Lord Kilpont, who was 
killed by James Stewart of Ardvorlich in Montrose's camp at Col- 
lace in 1644, and whose corpse was by Montrose dispatched to the 
deceased's father, William, eighth Earl of Monteith of the 
Grahams, then a state prisoner in Talla. The two walls and the 
gateway above-mentioned were built in consequence of the testa- 
ment of Kilpont's son, William, the last of the Earls. 

Towards the centre of the choir, and in a horizontal position, is 
a sepulchral monument, assignable to the end of the thirteenth 
century, being that of Walter Stewart, Earl of Monteith, and his 
Countess, in whose right he enjoyed the earldom. The church, 
of which the building was commenced in or soon after the year 
1238, by Walter Cummin, Earl of Monteith, was probably fi- 
nished by his immediate successor, viz. Walter Stewart, and re- 
ceived from either him or his Countess this appropriate decora- 
tion. 

Near this beautiful sepulchral remain is another of inferior 
workmanship. This, as intimated by the legend, is that of Sir 
John de Drummond, son-in -law of the connubial pair commemo- 
rated as above-mentioned, and father of Sir Malcolm de Drum- 
mond, to whose bounty Inchmahome, the burial-place of his father 
and mother, and its principal messuage, the estate of Cardross, in 
its close vicinity. 

The island on which this very ancient religious house stood, 
was formerly divided into two nearly equal parts, one on the east, 
containing the priory with its gardens, and the other on the 
west, and occupied by the gardens of the Earls of Monteith. 
These, indeed, are still distinguishable by a piece of neutral ground 
or common road, from north to south, and having a rude stone 
wall on either side. In the part occupied by the Earls of Mon-

teith, at the south end, stands the Nun's hill, as it is called, 
though for what reason cannot be conjectured, for the name is 
the only symptom of a nunnery in the island. 

Westward of this island, and distant about a stone's throw, is 
another, but much smaller, island, named Talk, signifying" hall" 
or " mansion," and containing the ruins of one of the seats of the 
Earls of Monteith. 

At the nort-west extremity of Moss Flanders is a Roman cas- 
tellum, about fifty paces in diameter, and irregularly square. 
There seems to have been in this direction a Roman iter from the 
great Roman causeway which ran along Scotland from south to 
north, from the wall of Antonine at Camelon, by Stirling, Dun- 
blane, &amp;c. to Brechin. This iter is supposed to have crossed the 
river Forth at the ford of Drip, and next to have crossed the stream 
of Guidie, near where the Forth receives this minor and tributary 
body of water. Here, as is supposed, the iter branched off towards 
Garfarran, another Roman castellum, which is situate south of the 
Forth, which the iter recrossed, and south of the Kelty, a short 
way from the influx of the stream into the Forth. In the moss of 
Kincardine, a Roman way has been discovered, twelve feet broad, 
and formed by trees crossing each other in two distinct strata of 
beams ; and in Moss Flanders, another from south-east to north- 
west. Several logs of wood lying across each other, in the form 
of a raft, and squared by the axe, as appeared from the marks of 
this implement, were, several years since, found in this moss. In 
the banks of the Guidie, several large oaks, about twenty feet un- 
der the surface, appear projecting ; and, at the union of this 
stream with the Forth, one tree, nearly six feet in diameter, ap- 
pears equally deep, and extending nearly twenty feet. Again, 
south of the Forth, and west of the places above mentioned, a 
road has been discovered about twelve feet broad, and formed of 
trees laid across each other. These notices connected with the 
Roman Castella at Garfarran, below Gartmore, and in the an- 
cient Lennox and modern Stirlingshire, and at Flanders Hill, 
seem conclusive of the Roman footsteps in the vale of Monteith. 

A house in the barony of Rusky, about a mile north-east of the 
castellum of Flanders Hill, is named Keirhead. It is situate on 
an eminence resembling some others in Monteith, which are called 
Keirs, and seems to have anciently been a military post overlook- 
ing the plain on the south, and to have been, partly at least, form- 
ed by the hands of man.

Land-owners.— The principal land-owners of the parish of Port 
are, in the order of property, David Erskine, Esq. of Cardross, 
Patron; General Graham Stirling of Duchray and Auchyle ; 
His Grace the Duke of Montrose ; William Cunningham Cun- 
ningham Graham, Esq. of Gartmore; James Graham, Esq. of 
Leitchtown; G. B. Home, Esq. of Argaty ; Mrs Eastmont of 
Drunkie; James Forrester, Esq. of Polder, &amp;c. There are 
twelve other land-owners. 

Parochial Registers. — Those of the parochial registers which 
are extant commence on the 14th September 1664; and contain, 
in the earlier part, some curious intimations of manners, some of 
which appeared in print some years ago. 

Mansion- Houses. — The principal mansion-houses in the parish 
are Cardross, Rednock House, and Gartmore, all of them large 
and commodious. Of the other houses of this class, the most 
worthy of notice is Leitchtown, the property of James Graham, 
Esq., which is very favourably situated on a well-wooded bank, 
with a southern aspect. Mrs Eastmont is at present erecting a 
mansion on her property of Drunkie, in the northern part of the 
parish, which will command a fine view, including Loch Venachar, 
&amp;c. The name of the property has lately been changed to In- 
ner- Trosachs. Rednock House has received a great addition with- 
in these few years. The proprietor, General Graham Stirling, 
had previously formed an extensive and beautiful park from the 
lake of Inchmahome on the west, through the hills of Inchy, in 
which he has two artificial sheets of water, amid the plantations 
with which he has embellished those elegant though small rising 
grounds. These, however, are but a small part of the improvements 
which this spirited proprietor has made on his barony of Rednock.

The language generally spoken in the parish of Port in 1724 
is, by one of the land-owners of those days, stated to be the Gaelic. 
When, accordingly, a minister came to be settled in 1726, the Earl 
of Buchan, then proprietor of the estate of Cardross and the patron 
of the parish of Port, listened to the application of the parishioners 
for a Gaelic minister. A native of Cowal, Mr John Fergusson, 
was appointed, although from 1694, the Presbyterian charge in 



PORT OF MENTEITH. 



1109 



this parish was held by an individual who did not preach in that 
tongue. Nor is there the slightest reason to think that either of 
the Episcopalian clergymen, from the Restoration downward, 
namely, Mr James Donaldson and Mr Patrick Bell, ever officiated 
in the Gaelic tongue. 

IV. — Industry. 

The example of the late Lord Kaims, and of his successors in 
the lands of Blair-Drummond, in the neighbouring parish of Kin- 
cardine, has been followed in the parish of Port by Mr Erskine of 
Cardross, in the establishing of a colony for clearing off the peat 
from the south-west extremity of Moss-Flanders by runs of water 
into the Forth, and acquiring, as in the case above-mentioned, a 
rich alluvial soil. Mr Erskine's operations on the Forth were 
commenced about ten years since. 

The prevalent breed of cows in the parish is a cross of the 
Highland and the lowland ; and of sheep, the black-faced. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The amount of the stipend is L. 269 ; the 
value of the glebe about L. 8 per annum. The number of Dis- 
senting families in the parish is about 18. The manse was built 
upwards of half-a-century ago. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish is 4. The 
parochial teacher's salary is the maximum ; and the amount of 
his school-fees yearly may be from L. 15 to L. 20. 

p oor , — The average number of poor on the roll is 16 ; amount 
of funds for their relief, L. 45 ; whereof there are, from Church 
collections, L. 10, and marriage dues, L. 35. 

Five public-houses in the parish.

PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. WILLIAM RAMSAY, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of this parish and village has remained 
without material change from the earliest period to which it can 
be traced; and in the very oldest documents in which it occurs 
the spelling is exactly the same as at present. In the parochial 
records and other documents, it sometimes appears in the forms 
of Alicht, Elicht, Elith, &amp;c. ; but these variations are evidently 
accidental, and can only be regarded as instances of the loose or- 
thography of ancient times. The name is probably derived from 
the Gaelic aileadh, a slope or ascent dh in the Gaelic language 
being pronounced like the English th, and seems to refer to the 
slope on which the old church and the more ancient part of the 
village are situated. At least, no more plausible etymology has 
been suggested. The same name, with precisely the same spell- 
ing, belonged to one of the suppressed bishoprics in Britany, where 
a Celtic dialect was spoken. 

Boundaries, 8fc. — The parish is bounded on the north, by Glen- 
isla; on the east, by Airlie and Ruthven ; on the south, by Mei- 
gle; and on the west, by Bendochy, Blairgowrie, Rattray, and 
Kirkmichael. It is separated from the parishes of Airlie and 
Meigle by the river Isla, and from Kirkmichael and a detached 
part of Bendochy by the Ericht or Blackwater. It is of an 
irregular oblong form, narrowing from south-east to north-west, 
with a length of 15 miles, and a transverse breadth varying 
from less than 1 to above 6 miles. The whole extent of the 
parish is 53.375 square miles, or 34,160 statute acres, much 
the greater part of which is uncultivated. It is divided by 
the hills of Alyth, Loyall, and Barry, into two districts of 
unequal extent, differing completely in their character and 
features. The lower and more fertile district lies on the south 
of these hills in the valley of Strathmore, and forms an ir- 

6 



ALYTH. 



1111 



regular square of nearly four miles a-side. The northern district 
may be again subdivided into three parts ; 1. a tract of cultivated 
ground immediately behind the hills ; 2. the forest of Myth, an 
extensive tract of moor and moss, separating'the lowland from the 
Highland part of the parish ; and, 3. the Blacklunans, a small 
fertile district lying along the side of the Blackwater. The dis- 
trict of Blacklunans belongs to the county of Forfar. 

Elevation and Climate.— The elevation of the parish, from the 
banks of the Isla on the south to the summit of Mount Blair at 
the northern extremity, ranges from about 130 to about 1600 or 
1700 feet. Mount Blair, the most considerable eminence in this 
neighbourhood, belongs partly to this parish and partly to Glen- 
isla, the line of march running across the summit. The hill of 
Kingseat, 1178 feet above the level of the sea, is picturesquely 
situated on the side of the Ericht, about three miles south from 
Mount Blair. The elevation of Barryhill was calculated by the 
late Principal Playfair at 668 feet; and the hills of Alyth and 
Loyall are somewhat higher. The climate is bracing and salu- 
brious ; and there is no distemper to which the inhabitants are 
subject in a more than ordinary degree. Fevers and other infec- 
tious diseases are comparatively rare. The whole of this district 
is a good deal exposed to easterly winds, particularly in the spring 
months, but in this parish the north-west wind is, on the whole, 
the most prevalent ; so much so, that trees in unsheltered situa- 
tions frequently receive a permanent bend to the south east. 

Rivers and Streams. — This parish, as has been already stated, 
is bounded in part by the Isla and Ericht; and it is also traversed 
by several minor streams. The most considerable of these is the 
burn of Alyth, which rises in the mosses of the forest, and falls 
into the Isla at Inverquiech, about two miles east from the village. 

Geology. — With regard to its geological formation, the parish 
is divided into three districts, which are chiefly occupied, respec- 
tively, by the crystalline slates, trap, and the old red sandstone. 
The first of these comprehends the Blacklunans and the forest of 
Alyth. Towards Mount Blair, the rocks exhibit the character of 
mica-slate, and, in the southern part of the forest, that of clay- 
slate, the intermediate space presenting the usual gradations, 
interspersed with quartz, hornblende slate, and other ana- 
logous species. Beds of limestone, although generally of rare 
occurrence in the Grampians, are frequent at Mount Blair, and 
farther down on the side of the Blackwater.

PERTHSHIRE. 



The ridge of high ground behind Bamff House consists of a 
band of trap rock, generally about a mile in breadth, with fronts 
stretching down into the hollow behind the hill of Myth. On the 
north side of the ridge, the trap rocks are conglomerate in their 
structure, the pebbles being also trap ; but towards the south they 
are more homogeneous, and of a felspathic texture. Within this 
series, some narrow beds of light-grey sandstone occur; and to- 
wards the north of the trap beds, there is a large nucleus of yel- 
lowish compact limestone, which is well adapted for building. A 
little to the south of Bamff House, the trap range is intersected 
by a dike or vein of well-defined serpentine, about a hundred yards 
in width, forming a prolongation of that which traverses the district 
to the eastward. 

The southern part of the parish, with the range of hills behind 
the village, is occupied by the old red sandstone strata, intersected 
by narrow dikes of trap, two of which are laid open by the chan- 
nel of the burn. These strata, at their commencement on the 
north, are generally conglomerate, the pebbles ranging from one 
to six inches in diameter, and consisting of quartz, porphyry, &amp;c 
As they descend towards the south, the strata become more ho 
mogeneous and of finer grain, and are occasionally of a soft marly 
texture. The synclinal line of Strathmore passes near the village, 
from north-east to south-west. On the south of the line, the dip 
is to the south-east; on the north, to the south-west. On the 
north side of the line, the amount of dip is very great, ranging in 
the conglomerate beds from seventy to ninety degrees. No fossil 
remains have been observed. 

No ornamental stones are found in the parish. The beautiful 
agates, formerly well known under the name of Alyth jaspers, 
were found in the Burn of Kilry, in the adjacent parish of Glen- 
isla, and derived their name from the circumstance, that they were 
generally searched for by persons from Alyth. 

The flat grounds or haughs, on the side of the Isla, consist of 
a fine deep loam, with a subsoil of sandy alluvial silt, and are very 
productive. With the exception of these alluvial loams, the best 
soils are where the rocks are thinly covered by their own detritus, 
which forms a warm dry porous subsoil. When the cover is 
deeper, it is chiefly composed of detritus from the Grampians, 
forming an impervious mixture of clay and stones of all sizes. 
The subsoil is generally of this kind, in the hollows behind the 
hills of Alyth, &amp;c, and in the Muir of Alyth, an extensive com-

mon King on the south of the village. On the faces of the hills, 
the soil is a fine sharp gravel, producing good crops of oats, po- 
tatoes, &amp;c. In the Blacklunans, the arable land is generally a 
light fertile black loam ; but some parts are very moorish. There 
is an extensive peat-moss in the forest, called the Culpanach, and 
several smaller ones in other parts of the parish. A deposit of 
marl, being the only one known to exist in this immediate neigh- 
bourhood, was lately discovered in draining a small loch on the 
farm of Nether Balloch, near the village. A pair of antlers, con- 
siderably larger than any now seen on the living animal, were dug 
up some years ago in a peat-moss at Ballach. 

Botany and Zoology. — From its situation, this parish exhibits 
both the vegetation characteristic of alluvial and highly cultivated 
districts, and also that which is peculiar to upland and subalpine 
regions. Its Flora has not been minutely examined, but the fol- 
lowing plants, interesting from their beauty or rarity, have been 
gathered within its limits. In the lower part of the parish, the 
Alisma ranuncidoides, the Scrophularia vernaHs, the Senecio sara- 
cenicuS a doubtful native, the Astragalus glycyphy/lus, on the 
banks of the Isla, near Inverquiech, its only habitat, so far as is 
known, in the basin of the Isla. The banks of that river are also 
adorned with the Trollivs Ewopcsus, the Campanula latifolia, and 
the Gallium boreale, which last, though rare in many districts, is 
abundant on the Isla and its mountain tributaries. In the upland 
districts, the Orobus sylvaticus, the Habenaria albida, and H. vi- 
ridis, the latter sparingly, the Trientalis Europaia, the Alche- 
milla alpina, in rocky and elevated situations, and the Saxifraga 
aizoides, and S. stellaris, along the brooks. The white heath, 
{Erica vulgaris alba, is said to be of unusually frequent occur- 
rence. The right bank of the Den of Airlie is in the parish of 
Alyth, but it is the left bank which is peculiarly interesting to the 
botanist. Both banks are clothed with a fine stool of natural 
wood of every species indigenous to this country. The native 
wood in the rest of this parish, of which there is not much, is 
chiefly birch, hazel, and alder. 

The rivers and larger rivulets are well stored with trout, and, 
in some seasons, a considerable number of salmon ascend the Isla. 
There is also excellent pike-fishing in an old channel of the ri- 
ver, on the property of Mr Whitson of Bardmony. Roe-deer 
and the common kinds of game are plentiful. Pheasants have 



1114 



PERTHSHIRE. 



been introduced, and thrive very well. Ptarmigan is occasionally 
met with in the higher part of the parish, and white hares have 
been shot in severe winters. 

II. — Civil History. 
The earliest document in which the name of this parish occurs, 
is a charter of the lands of Bamff, &amp;c. granted by King Alexander 
II., in the year 1232, to Nessus de Ramsay, the lineal ancestor 
of the present proprietor, Sir James Ramsay, Bart. The rest of 
the property in the parish has repeatedly changed hands since 
that period. The Lyndesays, afterwards Earls of Crawford, be- 
came connected with it in 1303, when Alexander de Lyndesay 
received a grant from Thomas, Earl of Marr, confirmed by a 
charter from King David U. of the lands of Balwyndoloch, now 
Ballendoch. By successive charters from the Scottish Kings, to 
whom they were nearly related, the family came into the posses- 
sion of the whole of the parish of Alyth, or at least of all the land 
in it worth occupying, with the exception of the estates of Bamff 
and Balhary, the latter of which was then much less extensive 
than at present. About the beginning of the fifteenth century, 
they fell into straitened circumstances, and sold or pledged their 
lands piecemeal, until, in 1630, they disposed of all their remain- 
ing property in this district to the family of Airlie, who were al- 
ready the chief land-owners in this parish. 

The village of Alyth is a place of considerable antiquity, and 
has enjoyed the privileges of a burgh of barony since the reign of 
James III. The family of Airlie, who have also the title of Ba- 
rons of Alyth, are the superiors. At a much earlier period, it 
seems to have been a place of some importance. In the History 
of Dundee, published 1803-4, it is said that David Bruce, who 
reigned from 1341 to 1371, granted an edict in favour of that 
town, prohibiting Kirriemuir, Alyth, &amp;c. from holding weekly 
markets, as being within the liberties of Dundee. The people 
of this village, with Thomas Greig, Prebendary of Alyth, took an 
active part in the tumultuous election of the celebrated Gavin 
Douglas to the Bishopric of Dunkeld, a. d. 1516, and are even 
said to have taken up arms in his favour En. Brit, new edition, 
Art. Douglas. Stewart, the defeated candidate, obtained the 
livings of Alyth and Cargill, as a solatium for his disappointment. 

This parish had a considerable share in the commotion and 
turmoil of the troublous period, from 1640 to 1660. Notwith- 
standing the prevalent malignity of the district, and the proximity 
of powerful royalist families, the people of Alyth seem to have 



ALYTH.. 



1115 



adhered rigidly to the cause of Presbytery. In the session re- 
cords for the years 1645-6, there are several intermissions of 
public worship, " because of the common enemy." From Febru- 
ary to August 1646, Montrose's army was stationed in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood, to the great consternation of the inhabitants, 
as appears from the following entries in the session book. " July 
5 day 1646, first Sabbath. Given to Hendrie Cargill, x sh" for 
to go to the camp to trie and search some news from the malig- 
nants, and that he may be for warnisse of their cuming upon us. 
July the 2 Sab. This day no preaching, because of the common 
enemie. July the 3 Sab. and 4 Sab. : No preaching, because 
Montrose was so near us. August the first Sab. and 2 day : 
Ther was no preaching with us since the last Fast, Feb. 1st. 
because the enemie was quarterit in our bownds. This day our 
minister taught." 

When Dundee was besieged by General Monk in 1651, 
the Committee of Estates and of the Kirk met at Alyth with 
other lords, gentlemen, and ministers, to concert measures for 
raising the siege ; but the meeting was summarily dissolved 
by a detachment of the English army, who surprised them and 
took a number of prisoners. This occurrence is generally stated 
by Hume to have happened near Dundee ; but in Gumble's Life 
of General Monk, it is expressly said to have taken place at Alyth, 
near the Highlands. The writer has not given his authority for 
the statement, but it is confirmed by several entries in the parish re- 
cords. It appears from the following, that Mr John Rattray, who 
was minister of this parish from 1637 to 1678, was among the pri- 
soners. u August the last day 1651 : This day no preaching, be- 
cause our minister was taken on Thursday last by the Englishes, be- 
ing the 28 of August 1651." Mr Rattray was carried with the army 
into England, and was not restored to his parish till the month of 
June in the following year. Mention is also made in other places 
of persons taken or wounded in the ' onfall of Alyth." The fol- 
lowing entry seems curious enough to be quoted, as illustrative of 
the state of the country at that period. " March the 28, 1652 : 
No preaching, except only ane Englishe trouper went up to ye 
pulpit, and made ane forme of ane preaching, who hade no war- 
rant to preach, whose text was upon the 45 Psalm, 13, 14 vs." 
After the Restoration, the minister and parishioners of Alyth ap- 
pear to have submitted quietly to the altered state of things 
 March 15, 1663: This day, the clerk writter hereof, being ap- 



1116 



PERTHSHIRE. 



pointed and ordained be the minister and session to read everie 
Sab before the incoming of the minister to the pulpit, red this 
day," &amp;c. In 1667, Mr Th omas Robertson was inducted as as- 
sistant and successor, with the usages and ceremonies of the Epis- 
copal Church. 

The Forest of Alyth was so called, as having been a hunting- 
ground of the Scottish Kings. In the Register of the Great 
Seal, published by Thomson, p. 134, No. 40, Roll 5, there is 
a charter dated in the sixth year of the reign of Robert II., vest- 
ing John de Roos in the_office of Justiciary of the King's Forests 
of Clunie and Alvth. 

Before the Reformation, the benefice of Alyth was attached to 
one of the prebends in the Cathedral of Dunkeld, and the patron- 
age seems to have been exercised by the bishop down to the Re- 
volution. There was also a chapel dedicated to St Ninian, de- 
scribed as situated " infra coemeteriam ecclesiae parochialis de 
Alyth." The chaplainry was likewise in the gift of the Bishop of 
Dunkeld. The vicarage of Alyth and the chaplainry of St Ni- 
nians were unquestionably distinct offices, although they might 
sometimes be held by the same person. It seems most probable 
that the chaplainry was a provision for the clergyman who dis- 
charged the duties of curate of the parish in the absence of the 
incumbent. The lands of Balwhyme, in the neighbourhood of 
Alyth, formed part of the provision of the chaplain. In a dispute 
with respect to the teinds of Balwhyme, which took place about 
thirty years ago, the Earl of Airlie produced a deed, executed in 
1554, by Robert Fowler, Chaplain of St Ninians, with consent 
of the Dean and Chapter of Dunkeld, the see being then vacant, 
conveying the lands of Balwhyme, with the teinds, &amp;c. to Ogilvy 
of Clova. A charter of confirmation was granted by the bishop 
in 1546. There is also extant a deed of cognition and infeftment, 
dated 1670, vesting Mr Thomas Robertson, assistant minister of 
Alyth, in the chaplainry and altarage of St Ninians, to which he 
had been presented by the bishop, on the demission of that be- 
nefice by the incumbent of the parish. In this document, the 
chapel is said to have been situated " on the north side of the 
kirk-yard." The site is still pointed out. The feu-duties of 
Balwhyme were drawn for a long time by the minister of Alyth, 
as part of the stipend, but they are now merged in the Teinds. 

Remarkable Persons. — Nessus de Ramsay, the founder of the 
family of Ramsay of Bamff, was a person of considerable note in 
the thirteenth century. He held the office of Physician to King 



ALYTH. 



1117 



Alexander II., and received a grant of lands in this parish, which 
his descendants still hold, in reward for having saved the life of 
the King by a critical operation ; according to popular tradition, 
by " cutting a hair-ball from the King's heart." One of his de- 
scendants, James Ramsay, attained to eminence in the same pro- 
fession, and was Physician to James L and Charles I. Mr Tho- 
mas Aiton, who was minister of this parish in the earlier part of 
last century, was a man of considerable learning, and the author 
of a Treatise on the Original Government of the Church. James 
Sandy, a bed-ridden cripple, who died here in 1821, attained 
great local celebrity by his extraordinary mechanical genius. 

Land-owners.— The chief land-owners in the parish, in respect 
of valued rent, are, the Earl of Airlie ; John Smyth, Esq. of 
Balhary ; Sir James Ramsay of Bamff, Bart. ; George Knight, 
Esq. of Jordanstone ; Captain Clayhills Henderson, of Hallyards ; 
and the Honourable William Ogilvie of Loyall. In respect of 
real rent, Mr Smyth of Balhary is the principal heritor. The 
family of Airlie have a special grant from the Crown for the name 
of the lands of Loyall, in commemoration of their fidelity to 
Charles I. and II. during the great Rebellion. 

Antiquities. — On Barry Hill from the Gaelic Bar-ra, a hill 
fort, there are the remains, still in very perfect preservation, of 
an ancient Pictish entrenchment of great strength. The summit 
has been levelled into an area of an oval form, about 150 yards 
in circumference, and surrounded with a rude rampart of unhewn 
and uncemented stones. It is protected on the east and south by 
a deep fosse about ten feet in width ; the other sides of the hill 
being so steep as to render such a defence superfluous. The ap- 
proach was from the north-east, along the verge of a precipice, 
and the entrance was protected by a bulwark of stone. There 
are some remains of a narrow bridge thrown over the fosse. In 
the different accounts of this fort which have been published, the 
stones of the bridge are said to have been cemented by the action 
of fire ; but the slight marks of vitrifaction, which may probably 
be accidental, are not sufficient to warrant the statement. There 
is no vestige of a well ; but, on the west side of the entrenchment, 
between the base of the mound and the precipice, there was a 
deep pond, apparently artificial, which was filled up about fifty or 
sixty years ago by the tenants in the neighbourhood. On the de- 
clivity, about a quarter of a mile to the eastward, there are some 
less perfect remains of a smaller entrenchment of the same kind. 
The fort on Barry Hill is considered by Chalmers as coeval with 



ins 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the Roman Invasion. Like other places of the same kind, if, i s 
the scene of innumerable legends, which agree in representing it 
as the residence or prison of the infamous Vanora or Guinevar, 
the wife of King Arthur, who appears in the local traditions under 
the more homely appellation of Queen Wander, and is generally 
described as a malignant giantess. This tradition perhaps arose 
from the vicinity of the celebrated sepulchral stones at Meigle, 
which are generally considered as remains of the monument of 
Vanora. Even with respect to these famous tombstones, the le- 
gendary account, which connects them with the Vanora of tradi- 
tion, is certainly more than doubtful. A more satisfactory account 
of them has been suggested by Captain T. P. Mitchell, a gentle- 
man distinguished by his research and sagacity in investigations 
of this nature. He considers them as neither more nor less than 
the monuments of the Knights Templars, who unquestionably 
had a burying-ground at Meigle. At the top of the south face 
of the largest stone, the armorial bearings of the kingdom of Je- 
rusalem may be distinctly traced, and the group of figures, now 
almost obliterated, which has been supposed to Represent Vanora 
torn in pieces by wild beasts, and on which the popular tradition 
was very probably founded, may be considered, with great pro- 
bability, as an allegorical representation of Judea rescued by the 
Crusaders. 

In the barony of Alyth, on the south of Barry Hill, there are 
several rude obelisks, or « standing-stones," probably intended to 
commemorate some long-forgotten conflict. They are referred 
by tradition to the time of King Robert the Bruce ; but there 
can be no doubt that they belong to a much more remote period. 
On the most remarkable, about three miles to the east of the vil- 
lage, there is the mark of a large horse-shoe, rudely cut out with 
indistinct traces of other figures. There is no vestige of sculpture 
on any of the others. Stone coffins, containing human bones, are 
said to have been occasionally turned up ; and about fifty years 
ago, an artificial cavity, of considerable size, partly filled up with 
ashes, was discovered in a field on the farm of Loyall. 

The ruins of the old Castle of Inverquiech are situated at the 
junction of the Burn of Alyth with the Isla. In a charter granted 
by Robert II. in 1394, to his nephew, James de Lyndesay it is 
mentioned as « the King's Castle of Inucuyth," and appears to 
have been even then in ruins. At Corb, on the north-west of the 
forest, there are also the remains of a castle, probably a hunting, 
seat of the Scottish Kings, or of the Earls of Crawford.

The old church, which is now unroofed, and will soon be en- 
tirely demolished, is a building of considerable, though uncertain 
antiquity, having been in a ruinous state for upwards of two hun- 
dred years before it was disused. It was probably dedicated at 
its erection to St Molonoch, or Malachi, Bishop, as the original 
fair of the village is still called St Malogue's, apparently a cor- 
ruption of the latter name, and coincides with the day consecrated 
to that saint in the old Scottish Calendar. St Molonoch was a 
disciple of St Brandon, and is mentioned in Keith's Catalogue of 
Bishops as having flourished or deceased, a. d. 629. The build- 
ing had never any pretensions to architectural beauty. Some 
pillars and arches, in the Saxon style of architecture, are appa- 
rently much more ancient than the rest of the building. It was 
originally intended to preserve them when the church was pulled 
down ; but this, it is feared, will be found to be impracticable. 
Near the pulpit is a plain stone monument, to the memory of the 
Rev. Thomas Lundin and his wife, who died in 1636, within a 
few days of each other, and were buried in the same grave. It 
was erected in 1748, by the Rev. J. Robertson, then minister of 
Alyth ; and it is a singular coincidence that his own death took 
place under the same circumstances which had affected him so 
much in the case of his predecessor. 

Modern Buildings. — The new church was completed in 1839, 
from a design of Mr Hamilton of Edinburgh, at a great expense. 
It is a remarkably handsome and commodious structure, in the 
Norman style of architecture, and bears ample testimony to the 
taste and skill of the distinguished architect. There are few ru- 
ral parishes in Scotland, and not many even in towns, which en- 
joy the advantage of possessing such an appropriate and splendid 
edifice for the services of the sanctuary. Bamff House, the seat 
of Sir James Ramsay, Bart, about three miles to the north-west 
of the village, is a respectable mansion of considerable antiquity, 
and sufficiently improved in later times to render it the eleo-ant 
and commodious residence of a country gentleman. The prin- 
cipal houses in the lower part of the parish are, Balhary, the seat 
of John Smyth, Esq. ; and Jordanstone, George Knight, Esq. 
The former is a large and commodious mansion, erected about 
twenty-five years ago by the present proprietor. The church 
and most of the houses are built of a durable red sandstone, of 
which there are several quarries in the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish records are in general full 
and well kept. The register of births and marriages commences 



1120 



PERTHSHIRE 



in 1624, and the minutes of session in 1637. They are comprised 
in nine volumes of different sizes, some of which contain fine spe- 
cimens of old-fashioned penmanship. Many of the earlier entries 
some of which have been already quoted are extremely curious, 
either as referring to passing events of historical importance, or as 
illustrative of the rigorous discipline and exhorbitant pretensions 
of thejKirk. One of the most remarkable is the entry for the 9th 
of February 1651, which is as follows: "This day, my Lord 
Ogilvygdeclared his repentance before the congregation, in the 
habit of sackcloth, in presens of Mr Georg Patillo, minister at 
Newtyle£and Mr Robert Crightoun, minister at Essai; and Mr 
David Patton, minister at Kettyns; who were appointed be the 
presb ne and, in sackcloth, confessed his sinful accession to General 
Major Middleton's rebellion, and for his sinfull miscarriages against 
the Covenant, and gave great evidence of his heartie grief for the 
samine, to the full satisfaction of the whole congregation." On 
the 18th of August, and 1st of September 1649, fifteen soldiers, 
who had taken arms in what is called " the unlawfull enp-agrement," 
professed their repentance, and were admitted to the renewal of 
the covenant as a necessary preliminary to their participating in 
the communion. The page containing the entries for the Sab- 
baths immediately after the 29th of May 1660, the day of the 
Restoration, have been torn out, whether by accident, from pru- 
dential motives, or by some rancorous Covenanter, it is now im- 
possible to conjecture. There are instances of persons being re- 
quired to " sit the stool" for periods of more than twenty and even 
thirty Sabbaths. It is remarkable, that two cases of this unprofit- 
able rigour took place during the temporary establishment of the 
Episcopal form of government after the Restoration. In addition 
to the classes of offences which usually fall under the cognizance 
of a church court, the kirk-session seem to have been frequently 
occupied with cases of " fechting and flytting," slander, &amp;c, with 
occasional investigations into charges of witchcraft. The cases of 
contumacy are numerous. In some respects, the ecclesiastical dis- 
cipline of that period appears to have been less rigorous than is 
generally supposed. Under January 20th 1650, there is the fol- 
lowing entry : " The minister did intimate ane ordinance of the 
presb rie , that in time coming, when people shall burie their deid 
upon the Lord's day, they doe it timouslie ; in the winter season 
before sermon, and in the simmer time after the afternoon's ser- 
vice." On the whole, however, if we may judge from the eccle- 

 " October b, Sab. last, 1o7j. This day the merchants in Aligth being chairgcil, 



ALYTH.

siastical records of this parish, the parochial police of that period, 
to which many are disposed to look back as a golden age of purity 
and piety, can hardly be regarded in any other view than as most 
injudiciously and unjustifiably rigid, and rather calculated to irri- 
tate and harden the offender than to win him to repentance. 

III. — Population. 

The only means of estimating the ancient state of the popula- 
tion, is by comparing the present average of births and marriages 
with the number of former periods, of which very accurate ac- 
counts have been preserved in the session books. If we may 
judge from these, the population seems to have continued nearly 
stationary down to the end of the last century, since which it has 
slightly increased. There is a marked diminution in the number 
of births and marriages from 1630 to the Restoration, and an 
equally marked increase for some years after that event; but this 
is easily accounted for without supposing any variation in the 
number of inhabitants. We have no exact account of the popu- 
lation before 1774, when it was found to be 2680. In the year 
1792, the date of the former report, it amounted to 2734; in 
182i, to 2387 ; in 1831, to 2888; and in 1841, to 2913. 

The number of inhabitants within the limits of the baronial 
burgh of Myth is 1738; in the country part of the parish, 1175. 
The population of the village has increased very much within the 
last sixty or seventy years. In 1774, it amounted to only 555;. 
in 1792, to 1060. The great increase between these dates is ex- 
plained by the circumstance, that, during the intervening period, 
several additional acres had been feued by the superior. The 
decrease in the rural population is owing to the abolition of the 
class of small farmers, and to the smaller number of hands now 
required in agricultural operations. 

It is impossible to state the number of births with perfect accu- 
racy, from the remissness of members of Dissenting congregations 
in registering their children. Taking the number of children not 
registered at one-tenth of the whole, the average annual number 
of births may be stated at 77 ; the average number of marriages 
at 1 6. Within the last seven years, there have been 36 illegiti- 

were called and compell ed, and promised not to sell any wares to any person upon 
the Sabth, between or after sermons, except it be upon necessitie, and that to any 
sick person ; or that it be of necessitie to help to give our some necessaries for bure- 
ing of the dead or such like needful thing, ;md for performance of the promiss they 
held up their hands in presence of the session ; nor to sell unnecessarie things as they 
did formerlie upon the Sabth, except neidfull, tobacco or bread."

mate children born. No obituary has been kept till very lately. 
The number of burials in 1842 was 56, which is probably rather 
above the average. 

Four families of independent fortune reside in the parish. The 
number of proprietors of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards 
resident in the parish, is eight; not resident, six. There are 6 
blind persons ; and 5 insane or fatuous. 

Until lately, the Gaelic language was generally used in the 
northern part of the parish. English, or rather the dialect of this 
part of the lowlands, is now universally spoken. 

Smuggling and poaching were at one time prevalent; but the 
former is now entirely suppressed, and the latter has become com- 
paratively rare. 

IV. — Industry. 

The inhabitants of the country part of the parish are almost ex- 
clusively engaged in agriculture, those of the village in weaving 
and the retail trade. There are 53 farmers, and 109 males re- 
gularly engaged as farm servants. There are seven master manu- 
facturers, and 404 weavers, besides a number of old men, women, 
and children employed in winding. 

Agriculture. — It is impossible to give a strictly correct state- 
ment of the extent of land under cultivation, as no accurate mea- 
surement has been made of the principal estates, but as nearly as 
can be ascertained, the number of arable acres may be stated at 
8, 100 ; under wood, 1070 ; leaving 24,990 in waste, pasture, sites 
of houses, roads, &amp;c. There are two undivided commons ; the 
Muir of Mornity, extending to about 330 acres, and the hill of 
Alyth, 120 acres. Two extensive commons have been divided 
within the last fifty or sixty years ; the forest of Alyth, and the 
lands of Bardmony and Aberbothrie. These lands, extending to 
about 600 acres Scots, were, till forty-five or fifty years ago, pos- 
sessed by two proprietors in run-rig. By the division, their value 
has been more than tripled, and the whole of them, in place of less 
than half, is now under tillage. The moor of Alyth might still 
be added to the cultivated land with a reasonable expectation of 
profit. From the nature of the subsoil, furrow draining would in 
general be necessary to render the ground of much value. A 
considerable extent of uncultivated ground in the upland dis- 
trict might also be profitably brought under tillage. A consi- 
derable part of the moorlands in the forest is not inferior in na- 
tural capability to those parts which have already been brought 



ALYTH. 



1123 



under cultivation, but it would be exposed to great disad- 
vantages from the want of shelter, unless planting on an extensive 
scale were resorted to as a preliminary step. 

Great improvements have been effected since the last Statistical 
Account in reclaiming waste land, fencing, and draining. On the 
property of Balhary, since the present proprietor succeeded to the 
estate, the extent of arable land has been increased by one-half, 
and the land formerly under cultivation has been very much im- 
proved in value by the liberal and judicious application of capital. 
The greatest liberality has been shown by the landowners in ac- 
commodating their tenants with commodious houses and steadings. 
Both the farm buildings and the cottars' houses have been greatly 
improved of late years. The old thatch roofs are daily giving 
place to slate, and a stone and turf cottage is now looked upon as 
a relic of bygone times. The lands near the Isla were formerly 
much exposed to inundation, and still are so to some extent, but 
the evil has been remedied in a great measure by straightening 
the channel of the river, and by the erection of embankments which 
have been raised by the proprietors at considerable expense. 

Most of the land in the lower district, and some farms in other 
parts of the parish, are in a high state of culivation under the most 
approved system of husbandry, and the whole of the arable land 
may be generally said to be under good management. The ro- 
tation preferred by the best farmers on good land is the com- 
mon one of five years. The six years' rotation, embracing 
three years in grass, is not unfrequently followed. The practice 
of taking two successive grain crops after lea is still kept up on 
several farms, although reprehended by every good practical far- 
mer, not less decidedly than by the scientific agriculturist. A 
considerable part of the cultivated land is at present thrown per- 
manently into grass parks, and only occasionally ploughed up. 

Live-Stock. — From 2000 to 3000 sheep, all of the black-faced 
breed, and 200 or 300 cattle of the Angus and West 
Highland breed are kept on the hill and moorland pastures. Sheep 
are seldom seen on the cultivated land, except those which arc 
put upon bone-dust turnips. A considerable number of cattle are 
reared and grazed on the arable farms. In the upland district 
these are generally of the native Angus breed, but on the finer 
soils, a cross between that breed and the Teeswater is found to be 
more profitable. 

Plantations. — The plantations consist chiefly of larch and other 



1124 PERTHSHIRE. 

firs, sometimes without any other kind of trees, but more frequent- 
ly interspersed with the different kinds of hardwood generally cul- 
tivated. A great part of the wood in the parish has been recent- 
ly planted. The younger larch plantations have suffered severely 
by the prevalent blight, and threaten in many instances to disap- 
point the hopes of the proprietors, who naturally expected that 
they would become in a few years, a shelter and ornament to their 
estates, as well as a direct source of profit. 

Rental and Wages. — The average rent of arable land is about 
L. 1, 3s. per acre, some of it near the village being let as high as 
from L.3, 10s. to L.4, 10s. The valued rental of the parish is 
L. 8233, 14s. 4d. Scots. The real rental, by a valuation made 
in 1837, amounted to little less than L. 12,000, including the 
value of the houses in the village. The land cannot be looked 
upon, in ordinary times, as excessively rented, although in the pre- 
sent depressed state of agricultural markets, several of the tenantry 
have some difficulty in fighting their way. The rate of wages has 
been lately reduced in consequence of the low prices of agricultu- 
ral produce. The wages of a farm servant at present, range from 
L. 8 to L. 12 per annum, with lodging, meal, and milk. Ordi- 
nary day labourers make from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. per day; masons 
in full employment, 12s.; and carpenters, 10s. per week. The 
general duration of leases is nineteen years, except on the estates 
of the Earl of Airlie, who is prohibited by the terms of the entail, 
from granting leases for a longer term than fourteen years. The 
greater part of the cultivated land is now enclosed, but there is 
still room for improvement in this respect. 

Manufactures. — There is no manufacturing establishment, but 
a great part of the inhabitants are employed in weaving coarse or 
brown linen for the Dundee trade. This branch of manufacture 
has been established here for more than a century. The quan- 
tity made annually is about 10,500 webs, of 150 yards each. The 
depression of the linen trade has been severely felt in this village. 
The present average weekly gain of a weaver is only from 2s. 6d. 
to 3s. ; of a winder, Is. 2d. Many families have, in consequence, 
great difficulty in providing themselves with a supply of the bare 
necessaries of existence ; and a great number would be in a state 
of melancholy destitution, if they had not an opportunity of eking 
out their scanty means by assisting in the harvest work on the 
neighbouring farms. There is a fulling mill in the village, and 
one at Inverquiech. 



ALYTH.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Alyth is, or rather was, a market town, and there is still a kind 
of weekly market held on Tuesday. The nearest regular market- 
town is Blairgowrie, distant, five miles. Dundee, the nearest sea- 
port, and the principal mart for this district, is seventeen miles from 
the village, and fourteen from the southern boundary of the pa- 
rish. The situation of the village is healthy, and the inhabitants 
are well supplied with excellent water. A system of police has 
been established, and a baronial court isjield on the first Tuesday 
of every month. 

There is no turnpike road in the parish, but the inhabitants en- 
joy tolerable facilities of communication by means of county roads, 
which have been much improved of late years, and are generally 
kept in good repair. There are three stone bridges in the village 
over the burn ; the newest and best of which was built a few years 
ago by Sir James Ramsay, with the view of improving the approach 
to BamfF house. About twenty-four years ago a bridge was built 
over the Isla at Crathie, on the road from Alyth to Dundee, at an 
expense of L. 3500, raised by subscription. By means of this 
bridge, and of the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, the inhabitants 
are enabled to keep up a constant intercourse with Dundee, and 
have thus facilities for disposing of their produce, and for provid- 
ing themselves with many of the comforts of life, which would 
otherwise be beyond their reach. There is a sub-office in the 
village of Alyth, in connection with the post office at Meigle, four 
miles distant. 

Fairs. — There are six annual fairs held at Alyth, but two of 
these, St Malogue's, and another about Christmas, known by the 
unaccountable name of Troit Fair, have fallen into disuse, and 
are now merely nominal. The others, two of which continue for 
two days, are held in the Muir of Alyth, for the sale of sheep and 
cattle. They have been very much improved under the manage- 
ment of John Hill, Esq. of Cotton, the present baron bailie. 

Public Houses. — There are eight public houses and four shops 
licensed for the sale of spirits, all in the village. They are in ge- 
neral decently conducted, but their effect on the morals of the 
people is decidedly prejudicial. The number is less than it was 
some years ago, but it might still be advantageously reduced by at 
least one-half. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the vil- 
lage, one mile from the western, three from the southern and east- 



112G 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ern boundaries of the parish, and upwards of twelve from the north- 
ern extremity of the Blackl unans. It is seated for 1290. There 
is consequently no want of church accommodation. The inhabi- 
tants of Blacklunans and the northern part of the Forest, amount- 
ing to about 250, very seldom attend, even at communion seasons. 
Their ordinary place of worship is a chapel at Persie, in the pa- 
rish of Bendochy, supported by the seat rents and voluntary con- 
tribution. It would be a great boon to the inhabitants, and a con- 
siderable relief to the neighbouring clergy, if the whole of that dis- 
trict were disjoined from the six parishes with which it is ecclesi- 
astically connected, and placed under the superintendence of an 
ordained and legally recognized minister. 

The manse was re-built in 1821, part of the old house being 
retained. The stipend is 18 chalders, half meal and half barley, 
with an allowance of L.10 for communion elements. The glebe 
is about four acres of good land, worth about L.2. 10s. or L.3 per 
acre. There is no grass glebe. The minister has a right of pas- 
turage on the moor of Alyth, casting peats in the moss of the 
Culpanach, and to a small quantity of teind yarn. 

There is a Dissenting meeting house in the village in connec- 
tion with the United Associate Synod. The emoluments of the 
minister amount to L. 80 per annum, from seat rents, collections, 
and voluntary contributions, with a free house and garden. There 
was some years ago another place of worship belonging to the Ori- 
ginal Seceders, but it is now disused. A meeting house is at pre- 
sent building for the accommodation of the adherents of the recent 
secession in this and the adjoining parishes. The Episcopal cler- 
gyman at Coupar Angus has a chapel in Alyth, in which he offi- 
ciates once a fortnight. The number of sittings in the Dissen:- 
ing meeting house, is 270 ; in the Episcopalian chapel, 92. The 
new meeting house is intended to accommodate between 700 and 
800 sitters. 

No exact account, has been taken of the different religious de- 
nominations since 1835. Making allowance for the few changes 
which have since taken place, there are probably about 300 be- 
longing to different bodies of seceders ; 50 Episcopalians, includ- 
ing the families of the two chief resident heritors; 30 Roman Ca- 
tholics from Ireland and the Highlands ; and 50 not known to be- 
long to any religious denomination. The ordinary congregation 
in the parish church is at present about 800. Several are pre- 
vented from attending, and not a few from sending their children 



ALYTH. 1127 

by the want of proper clothing. The sacrament is administered 
twice a-year. On the last occasion about 800 communicated, but, 
as a considerable number attend only once a-year, the whole num- 
ber of communicants maybe stated at 1000. Both the attend- 
ance at the parish church and the number of communicants have 
been affected to some extent by the late disturbances in the Church 
of Scotland. Four out of eleven elders, and a considerable sec- 
tion of the people, probably equal in number to the other dissen- 
ters collectively, are understood to adhere to the seceding cler- 
gymen. 

A parochial association for religious purposes was established in 
1836. The annual contributions have varied from L.23 to L. 30. 

Education. — The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is the 
maximum of L. 34, 4s. 4|d., with a good house and an allowance 
for garden ground. Anew school-room was erected in 1835, with 
accommodation for 150 pupils. The number attending this school 
at the last examination was 98. The fees of the parish school 
are, for reading alone, 2s. per quarter ; reading and writing, 2s. 
6d. ; reading, writing, and arithmetic, 4s. ; Latin, with the com- 
mon branches of education, 7s. 6d. ; mathematics, 10s. 6d. One 
of the General Assembly's schools is situated at Drumfork, in the 
Blacklunans. It is very efficiently taught, and was attended last, 
spring by 101 children. There is also a school at Gauldswell, 
supported by Sir James Ramsay, and nine unendowed schools, all, 
with one exception, in the village. The total number of children 
attending the different schools in February last was 547. The 
people are in general attentive to the instruction of their children, 
and few or none are allowed to grow up destitute of the benefit of 
education. 

Sabbath Schools, conducted by the elders and others, have been 
in a flourishing state for many years. They are at present attend- 
ed by about 350 children. A class for young men and women is 
taught by the minister during part of the year, and is generally at- 
tended by about 50. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons who re- 
ceived regular parochial aid during the last year was 107, and 79 
including 55 of those on the permanent roll received occasional 
relief from the poor's box. The total amount raised for the relief 
of the poor was L. 511, 0s. 9d., of which L. 445, 3s. 6d. was 
raised by assessment, and L. 65, 17s. 3d. from collections and 
other sources, including about L. 14 from mortifications, mortclot

dues, and penalties. The assessment is levied according to the va- 
lued rent of each heritor, the half being laid on the tenants according 
to the real rent. A commission of 5 per cent, is allowed to the collec- 
tor. Of the sum collected, L. 412, Is. 6d. was expended in the sup- 
port of the regular paupers. There is a mortification of L. 30, sub- 
ject to the annuity tax on the Ballindoch estate, administered by trus- 
tees, for clothingand educating five boys and fivegirls. The interest 
of various sums, amounting in all to L.90, is placed at the disposal 
of the kirk-session for the education of poor children, and a consi- 
derably greater sum is annually applied to this object. The me- 
thod of assessment was resorted to so early as 1776, and has since 
been continued without intermission. It is a curious fact, that it 
was then debated whether the poor were to be relieved in this way 
or by a system of licensed begging. Whatever may be thought of 
the latter alternative, it may be safely said that the former is a very- 
bad one, and only to be justified on the plea of insurmountable ne- 
cessity, which certainly did not exist here at the time when an as- 
sessment was first imposed. Pauperism, an evil which " grows by 
what it feeds on," has for many years been advancing rapidly and 
steadily in this parish. Many persons still make most praiseworthy 
exertions to keep themselves and their families from what they 
justly regard as a degradation, but the aversion to receive parochi- 
al aid is perceptibly diminishing. It is to be hoped that the Com- 
mission at present inquiring into this subject may be able to sug- 
gest some means for checking the progress of this alarming evil, 
which threatens, in this and many other parishes, to become a se- 
rious burden upon property, and which has already exercised a de- 
basing influence on the character of the population.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. HENRY HENDERSON, MINISTER. 

I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name. The word Kinclaven seems to be derived from the 

three Celtic words, Caen, a head or headland ; Cil or Kil, a church 
or churchyard ; and avon, a flowing stream or river, — which is an 
etymology perfectly descriptive of the local circumstances on the 
north-east corner of the parish. 

Extent, Boundaries, Sfc. — The parish is of an irregular oblong 
form, and may be nearly 5 miles in length, and may average 2 
miles in breadth. The superficial extent may be estimated at 10 
square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Tay dividing it 
from Caputh ; on the east and south, by the same river dividing it 
from Cargill ; on the south-west and west, by the parishes of Auch- 
tergaven and Little Dunkeld. A ridge of elevated ground stretches 
through the middle of the parish from the Castle of Kinclaven on 
the north-east to the village of Arntully, on the south-west; and 
from this ridge, the fields lie in an easy descent towards the Tay 
on the north and south. Seen from the higher grounds on the 
Cargill side of river, this parish has a very agreeable appear- 
ance, from the intermixture of farm-houses and cottages with 
the thriving plantations and oak coppices that are scattered over 
its surface. 

Climate. — Judging from the healthy state of the inhabitants, 
the climate must be considered highly salubrious. There 
are many instances of very aged persons, who have spent their 
lives in this parish in the enjoyment of a course of good health. 
This may, no doubt, be partly owing to their temperate habits 
and their out-door occupations ; but there can be no doubt that the 
situation of the parish, washed as it is by the rapid course of the 
Tay on its northern and southern boundaries, contributes also to 
the general health of its inhabitants. On the eastern corner of 



1130 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the parish, the air is peculiarly mild and temperate, owing partly 
to the drier nature of the soil, and partly to the shelter afforded 
by the Meiklour woods, and the oak coppices on the neighbour- 
ing eminence called the Court Hill. 

Hydrography. — At the eastern extremity of the parish, the 
Tay is joined by the Isla, which, descending from the lower range 
of the Grampians, flows to the westward through the fertile vale 
of Strathmore, until it runs into the Tay. In rainy weather, these 
rivers, after their junction, still retain, for a considerable space, 
their peculiar appearance ; the Tay, on the one side, being clear, 
while the Isla, on the other side, is thick and muddy. There 
are several small lakes in the parish, in which pike, perch, and 
very large eels are found. 

About eighty years ago, in consequence of an extensive flood 
from the Highland mountains, the Tay was swollen to a great 
height, and forced out to itself a new channel on the northern 
side of the parish ; for instead of flowing in a circuitous course 
along the south side of the farm of Haugh of Meikleour, 
then a peninsula, it burst through the narrow isthmus in a 
straight form and course, and completely separated that farm 
from the parish of Caputh to which it belongs. The old course of 
the river was about three miles, whereas its new course does not 
exceed half a mile in extent. Although the old bed has now 
filled up to a considerable extent, and in some places affords 
excellent pasture, or has even been put under crop, yet in great 
floods it is also covered with water, which sometimes ascends so 
far up on the farm, as to assume the appearance of a large lake. 
In ordinary seasons, the pools in the old bed of the river are much 
frequented by wild ducks, and other wafer fowl. It may be men- 
tioned that it is this farm of Haugh of Meiklour, which in large 
maps is designated the " Bloody Inches," but no satisfactory ori- 
gin of the name can now be assigned. 

Botany. — The plants peculiar to the different kinds of soil are 
also to be found here, in the spots where these soils prevail. On 
the 1 ow banks of the Tay, some alpine plants may be met with 
supposed to have been brought down by the river. All kinds of 
forest trees seem to thrive remarkably well, where the soil is at all 
congenial. There are some splendid specimens of fine oaks, ashes, 
plane, beech, limes, and firs of various kinds, to be seen in the 
policy grounds of Meiklour, betwixt the church of Kinclaven, and 
the ruins of the old castle.

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — At no very distant period, there were several 
resident proprietors in the parish. Their mansion houses have 
now disappeared ; but the situation of these houses is still strongly 
marked out by the fine old yews, and other large trees, which then 
surrounded their dwellings. At present all the proprietors are non- 
resident, and taken in the order of their valued rent, they are as 
follows: viz. The Earl of Mansfield, L. 1296, 8s. Id.; Major 
Richardson, L. 1100; Sir William D. Stewart, Bart., L. 840 : 
Baroness Keith and Nairn, L. 466, 6s. Id.; Duke of Athol, 
L.299, 5s. lOd ; total, L. 4002 Scots. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers, consisting of six 
volumes, commence in 1725, and do not appear to have been kept 
with sufficient care, — several of the volumes being a good deal 
torn, and the writing defaced. It is to be regretted that parents 
are not sufficiently sensible of the importance of registering the 
births and baptisms of their children. Among the Dissenters, es- 
pecially, great negligence in this respect still prevails; although, 
to induce them to do so, it has been the practice, during several 
years, to exact no fees for such registrations. 

Antiquities. — The royal castle of Kinclaven, now in ruins, is 
the only object interesting to the antiquarian in this parish. It 
stands in a beautiful and picturesque situation, on an eminence 
above the Tay, and immediately opposite to the mouth of the Isla. 
It is said to have been built by Malcolm Canmore, and continued 
to be occasionally occupied by the royal family during several cen- 
turies, after it was erected. Various charters granted by the Scot- 
tish kings are still in existence, that are dated from this royal resi- 
dence. 

One of the chapters in the well-known metrical history of Sir 
William Wallace is partly devoted to a description of the manner 
in which " he won Kinclaven." It is related by Holinshed that, 
during the wars arising out of the rival claims betwixt Bruce and 
Baliol for the Scottish throne, this castle was occupied by an Eng- 
lish garrison, who, proving troublesome neighbours to the Highland 
barons, were surprised by them, while off their guard ; and the cas- 
tle having been taken, was dismantled so far as that it could no 
longer be occupied as a place of strength. The Duke of Athol 
possesses the title of keeper and constable of the royal castle of 
Kinclaven, and as such receives a small sum annually from Baro-

ness Keith, the noblb proprietrix thereof, in name of constabula rv 
duty. 

III. — Population. 

Like many other agricultural parishes, the population is on the 
decrease. 

In 175a, by Dr Webster's account, the population was 993 
In Sir John Sinclair's in 1790, . ] 15J 

In 1801, by census, . . . 1035 

In 82, • .... 986 

J°}g' 890 

In 1841, . ... 878 

This decrease in the population, since the beginning of the pre- 
sent century, has been owing to emigration, to the enlargement of 
farms, and more recently to the removal of a number of families 
to the thriving village of Stanley, in the immediate neighbourhood, 
with the view of finding employment for their children at the ex- 
tensive cotton factory established there.

The number of inhabited houses in the parish is 194; of unin- 
habited houses, 8. 

There is one insane person, and one fatuous. 

In regard to language and personal appearance, there is nothing 
peculiar in the inhabitants of this parish. The prevailing names 
are Duncan, Watson, Young, and Galletly. In some families 
there seems to be a very strong hereditary attachment to their na- 
tive soil, several of the farms and pendicles having descended from 
father to son, from time immemorial. The natural consequence is, 
that they are closely connected by intermarriages, especially the 
Dissenters. 

IV. — Industry. 

The state of industry in the parish may be estimated from the 
occupations of the male inhabitants, as ascertained at the last 
census: Farmers and pendiclers, 62; agricultural labourers, 72 
weavers, 38; fishermen, 6; wrights, 10; tailors, 4 ; masons, 5 
smiths, 4 ; shoemakers, 5; publicans, 2; grocers, 2 ; boatmen, 2

miller, I ; wood forester, 1 ; gamekeeper, 1 ; schoolmasters, 2 ; 
sawyers, 2; thatcher, 1; ministers, 2. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The whole superficial ex- 
tent of the parish may amount to 6400 imperial acres, of which 
3900 are arable ; 800 in moorland or improvable pasture; 1500 
under wood, of different kinds, and the remainder in lakes or moss. 
The valued rent of the parish amounts to L.4002 Scots. The real 
rental is about L. 4800, including fishings and cuttings of wood. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of land varies from 15s. to L.2, 10s. 
per acre, according to soil and situation. Two-thirds of the arable 
ground being upon an impervious subsoil of red till or mortar, a 
considerable extent has been furrow-drained to great advantage ; 
the other third is on sand and gravel, with some rich haugh or al- 
luvial soil on the banks of the Tay. 

Leases. — The leases are for the period of fifteen or nineteen 
years ; and on several of the farms the rent is calculated by the 
fiars of the county. 

Farm-Ruildings. — Several excellent and commodious steadings 
have been erected during the last twenty years, especially on the 
Arntully estate, where some of them are equally substantial and or- 
namental. 

LiveStock. — The cattle are of a mixed breed. Greater atten- 
tion is now paid by all the farmers to their stock of cattle. On 
some farms, Ayrshire cows have been introduced, along with bulls 
of the Teeswater breed, so that several fine-looking herds of cattle 
may be seen in different parts of the parish. Till of late years, 
the horses were rather small in size ; but, by holding out encou- 
ragement for Clydesdale stallions to travel in the district, the stock 
is now much improved in size and strength. 

Wages. — The wages of common ploughmen vary from L. 10 to 
L. 14, with the usual allowance of oatmeal and milk, viz. 6 bolls 
of oatmeal, and a Scotch pint of sweet milk per day. The female 
servants receive from L. 4, 10s. to L. 6. Day-labourers are paid 
at the rate of from 7s. to 10s. per week. Women engaged in out- 
door work get 8d. in summer, and 6d. in winter, without vic- 
tuals. 

Rotation of Crops. — The rotation of crops on the different 
farms is adapted to the nature of the soil. The five-years course 
is that which is generally in practice on light soils, viz. 1. green 
crop, that is, potatoes or turnips, either with dung or bone-dust ; 
2. barley and grass seeds; 3. hay; 4. pasture; 5. oats. This 



1134 



PERTHSHIRE. 



course is found to succeed remarkably well, especially if a little 
manure is given to the ground on sowing the barley or grass seed. 
The good effects of doing so are very visible on the succeeding 
crops of this rotation. 

Produce. — On the clay soils, fine wheat is raised at about eight 
or nine bolls per imperial acre ; and as the tenants of such farms 
depend chiefly thereupon, they regulate their rotation and manage- 
ment accordingly. On other farms, barley and oats are chiefly 
raised, producing from five to eight bolls per acre. Much less 
barley is now sown than formerly, oat-straw being greatly pre- 
ferred for feeding cattle. A great extent of potatoes is annually 
planted for the London market. It seems to be upon these, and 
upon fat cattle, that the farmers now depend for their remunerat- 
ing prices. Turnip husbandry is much cultivated ; and, if raised 
from bone-dust, the one-half of the crop is consumed by the cattle 
in the byres or cattle sheds, and the other half is eaten on the 
ground by sheep. The rearing of horses for sale is now much 
less attended to, owing chiefly to the want of due encouragement 
from the increased travelling by railways. 

Improvements. — Very extensive improvements have recently 
been made on the estate of Arntully, and are still going on. A 
sum of nearly L. 4000 has been spent by Sir W. D. Stewart in 
trenching and improving 284 impe'rial acres of moorland ; and it 
is gratifying to remark that the crops of potatoes, wheat, &amp;c. that 
have been raised, are such as promise to remunerate the proprie- 
tor for his great outlay. Embankments at different places along 
the Tay on the property of Baroness Keith are at present in pro- 
gress ; partly for the purpose of improving the scenery, and partly 
to protect the fields against the sudden and sometimes destructive 
inundations that take place, after extensive meltings of the snow on 
the Highland mountains. 

Plantations. — Several plantations of common fir are found in 
different parts of the parish. One of these on the Kinclaven es- 
tate was lately cut down, and although growing on very inferior 
soil, brought upwards of L. 1 per acre per annum during its 
growth. It is to be regretted that the larch plantations that, have 
been formed, during the last twenty or twenty-five years, have nearly 
all failed, from the effects of that inexplicable disease which has 
appeared so generally to attack the larches planted about that pe- 
riod. On the Taymount estate, twenty acres have recently been 
cut down in a state of entire decay. There are many thriving and 



KINCLAVKN. 



1135 



valuable oak coppices on the different properties, which are cut 
down every twenty or twenty- five years. 

Fisheries. — The salmon fishings are highly valuable at several 
stations on the Tay, particularly at Ballathie, and below the ce- 
lebrated Linn of Campsie. In the early part of the season, this 
latter station is one of the best on the upper part of this fine river. 
The angling on the Tay for several miles below the junction of 
the Isla has long been celebrated, and is noticed as such in the 
late Sir Humphry Davy's ' Salmonia." The salmon are nearly all 
sent to Perth for the London market. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — Perth may still be regarded as the market-town, to 
which the inhabitants of this parish chiefly resort, both for the 
disposal of their agricultural produce, and for the purchase of 
their clothes, merchandise, and other articles of domestic economy. 
It may be mentioned, however, that, since the neighbouring vil- 
lage of Stanley has so much increased in size and population, 
shops of an improved description have been opened there, and a 
considerable portion of that mercantile business is now transacted 
at Stanley, which used formerly to be done in Perth. 

In one respect, the recent increase of the village of Stanley 
has been of great benefit to the farmers and pendiclers in its im- 
mediate neighbourhood, by affording them a ready and convenient 
market for the daily sale of their milk, which is by far the most 
advantageous way of disposing of the produce of the dairy. 

Villages. — At a former period, there were several small villages 
in this parish, of which the sites are now known only by the trees 
by which they were adorned. The village of Arntully, however, 
still remains, of which rather a graphic and ludicrous description 
is given in the former Statistical Account. It is now greatly di- 
minished in size and population, and, in a few years, will, in all 
probability, also disappear. Its inhabitants are all linen weavers, 
who occupy a small portion of ground sufficient to maintain a cow, 
and produce meal and potatoes for their families, and who receive 
their webs from agents employed by the manufacturers of Cupar- 
Angus, Blairgowrie, Newburgh, and other places. 

Means of Communication. — There are three principal roads 
which traverse the parish, and meet in a triangular form. One, 
on the west side, leading from Perth to the boat of Caputh, and 
kept in an excellent state of repair ; another, passing along the 
south-eastern side of the parish, from the boat of Kinclaven to the 



1136 



PERTHSHIRE. 



road previously mentioned, and joining it near Stanley ; and a 
third road, formed within these few years, and running through 
the northern side of the parish, from the ferry boat to the Perth 
and Caputh road, and intended to be carried straight forward un- 
til it joins the Dunkeld road, near Murthly Castle. If this third 
line of road were, by a branch, extended over to Bankfoot, in the 
parish of Auchtergaven, which might be done at no great expense, 
a direct and easy line of communication would then be opened up 
betwixt that populous part of the country and the towns of Blair- 
gowrie, Coupar-Angus, and other places in the valley of Strath- 
more, by the boat of Kinclaven, as also to the fertile district of 
Stormont by the boat of Caputh. The first of these roads is 
turnpike ; the other two are statute labour roads. 

Post-Town. — Perth may be regarded as the post-town for the 
eastern part of the parish, by means of a runner three times a- 
week from the Bridge of Isla. A sub-office to Perth and Dun- 
keld has recently been established at Stanley, which is more con- 
venient for the inhabitants of the western part. 

Bridges. — At Kinclaven Ferry, there is a passage boat, on 
the same construction as those used at Logierait and Caputh. 
The length of the chain here is 136 yards, and that the boat, 
although loaded, may effect the passage in five minutes, even 
when the river is not more than one foot in depth, — such is 
the buoyancy imparted to the boat or flying bridge, by the mode 
and principle of its construction. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is most inconveniently 
situated for the bulk of the population, being at the eastern ex- 
tremity of the parish, while the greater portion of the people re- 
side at the distance of three or four miles towards the west, or 
south-west. It is also in a very indifferent state of repair, so that 
it is hoped the heritors will soon erect a new one in a more 
centrical situation. The present church contains accommodation 
for 320 sitters, and the sittings are all free. In the east end of 
the church, there is a large monument, erected to the memory of 
Alexander Campbell, Bishop of Brechin, who is stated on the 
monument to have been " the Laird of Kerco," in this parish. 
He died in February 1608. The inscription, now scarcely legible, 
makes mention of the marriage of his two only daughters, — the 
" elder to Sir John Hubleton of Lerwick, and the younger to the 
Laird of Weem." Keith, in his History of the Scottish Bishops, 
blames this prelate for having " alienated most part of the lands 



KINCLAVEN. 



1137 



and tithes of the bishopric to his chief and patron, the Earl of 
Argyle, retaining for his successors scarce so much as would be a 
moderate competency for a minister in Brechin." The church 
bell has long been celebrated in this neighbourhood for the loud- 
ness and mellowness of its tones. There are upon it the two fol- 
lowing inscriptions, viz. " Joannes Bourkerhouis me fecit and 
" John Young of Touchet-hillocks gifted me to the kirk of Kin- 
claven in September 1656;" — Touchet-hillocks is the name of a 
small hamlet, now forming part of the farm of Innernytie. 

Manse, Glebe, c. — The manse was built in 1802, and received 
repairs and additions in 1 830, so that it now forms an ample and com- 
modious dwelling-house. The offices are also in good order. 
The manse, church, and church-yard, are all very beautifully si- 
tuated on a rising ground above the Tay, which is here a fine river 
of about 120 yards broad, flowing in a full and majestic stream 
through the richly adorned policy grounds and woods of Meikle- 
our. 

There are eleven acres of glebe, which may be worth L.16 or 
L.18 per annum. The stipend is as follows, viz. L.225, 14s. 5 I 7 2 d. 
Sterling, and 38 bolls 3 firlots 2 pecks 3{§ lippies of oatmeal, 
and 19 bolls 1 firlot 3 pecks 1}§ lippies of barley, amounting on 
an average to about L.275 annually. There is no allowance for 
communion elements, as the teinds are exhausted and surrendered. 

The number of communicants at the sacrament generally 
amounts to 180. There are 86 families, including 413 individuals, 
belonging to the Established Church, and 96 families, including 
465 individuals, who belong to the United Secession. It may 
also be mentioned, that, within these few months, three Roman 
Catholic families have been brought to the parish, as servants to 
the Rev. Mr Mackay, the clergyman of the Roman Catholic 
church in Perth, who has obtained in lease a farm of seventy acres 
on the Arntully estate, which he is improving at great expense. 

Ecclesiastical History. — It appears, both from authentic ancient 
records, and from the old charters and title deeds of the present 
patron, that, at a very remote date, anno Domini 1260, the teinds 
of this parish were appropriated, with certain deductions, and under 
certain obligations, to the maintenance of the precentor in the ca- 
thedral church of Dunkeld : and also that this arrangement con- 
tinued with incidental alterations until the period of the Reforma- 
tion. One of these obligations was, that the precentor should 
find both a chaplain and a vicar to officiate in the parish church.

During several years subsequent to the Revolution, this and the 
other parishes of the presbytery of Dunkeld were annexed to the 
presbytery of Perth. It is only on the 29th October 1706, that 
the Dunkeld records state, that the ministers of said presbytery 
met for the first time after their disjunction from the presbytery 
of Perth, and " that Mr Alexander Glass, minister at Kinclaven, 
was, by a plurality of voices, chosen moderator." This Mr Alex- 
ander Glass was the father of Mr John Glass, the celebrated 
founder of the religious denomination called after his name, and 
whose history is familiar to every one acquainted with the eccle- 
siastical transactions of the period in which he lived. Mr Alex- 
ander Glass was succeeded in 1725 by Mr James Fisher, of 
whom we shall afterwards speak ; and, on his deposition, he was 
succeeded in 1742 by Mr James Bishop, who, dying in 1774, 
was succeeded in 1775 by Mr John Scott. At his death, in 
1800, Mr Robert Keay succeeded as minister of this parish, and 
was, in 1811, translated to the Canongate Chapel in Edinburgh, 
but, in a few years, returned to the West Church Parish in Perth, 
where he died in 1819. Mr Keay was succeeded at Kinclaven 
in 1812 by Mr Robert S. Walker, the present respectable mi- 
nister of Longforgan, to which he was translated in 1822; and, 
in the following year, he was succeeded by the writer of. the pre- 
sent article. 

This parish is rather remarkable as being one of the original 
seats of the Secession. The Rev. James Fisher, minister of the 
parish, was the son-in-law of the Rev. Ebenezer Erskine, and 
warmly espoused his cause. In the session records, under date 
8th October 1 732, the following short notice occurs : " Service 
here this day by Mr Ebenezer Erskine, minister of the Gospel at 
Stirling f and on the Tuesday following, Mr Erskine opened the 
Synod at Perth. On that occasion, he preached the sermon which 
was the cause of the proceedings against him in the ecclesiastical 
courts, which terminated in the Secession. The kirk- session of 
this parish seems to have taken a zealous interest in all these pro- 
ceedings against him and his reverend coadjutors and brethren, 
many protestations and resolutions relative thereto being inserted 
in the records ; and on the 25th October 1736, they formally re- 
solved to adhere to the Associate Presbytery ; "and upon a leet, 
they made choice of Thomas Watson, as their ruling elder, to at- 
tend the meetings of the Associate presbytery for the ensuing 
half-year." The minutes of session subsequent to July 1738 un- 



KINCLAVEN. 



1139 



til the"period of his ejection in 1741, are all in the neat and dis- 
tinct hand-writing of Mr Fisher. From all accounts, he seems 
to have been a man of talent, intelligence, and worth. His expo- 
sition of the Assembly's Catechism is still deservedly held in high 
repute. It is rather a remarkable circumstance, however, and 
well fitted to convey an instructive lesson of mildness and modera- 
tion in these days of ecclesiastical strife, that, in a few years, Mr 
Fisher was not in communion with his old flock, whom he had 
been instrumental in carrying off from the Established Church ; 
for, while he attached himself to that party in the Secession who 
were denominated Burghers, they chose to connect themselves to 
the Anti-burgher party. Under the faithful ministry of his suc- 
cessors, Messrs Blythe and Pringle, the Secession Church in this 
parish continued to flourish, and has long been one of the most 
prosperous country congregations belonging to that body. In ad- 
dition to those belonging to this parish, it is understood that they 
have always drawn a considerable portion of their members and 
hearers from the neighbouring parishes of Little Dunkeld, Auch- 
tergaven, Redgorton, and Caputh. The Rev. David Young is 
their present pastor, having been elected two years ago on the de- 
mise of the late Rev. James Pringle, who had been minister of 
the congregation upwards of fifty years. He was, in all respects, 
a good man, and, emphatically, " a lover of peace." 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, one paro- 
chial and the other unendowed. The average number of scho- 
lars attending the parochial school may amount to 40. The 
salary is the maximum. The branches of education taught, 
and the school fees are as follows, viz. English reading, 2s. 
6d. ; writing, 3s. : arithmetic, geography, and preceding bran- 
ches, 3s. 6d. ; book keeping and preceding, 4s.; for practical 
mathematics, Latin, and preceding, 5s. In 1833, the heri- 
tors expended L.200 in erecting a neat and commodious school- 
room, and in making a thorough repair on the schoolmaster's 
dwelling-house, which now contains much more than the legal ac- 
commodation. There is also a good garden attached to the school- 
house. The unendowed school is situated in the village of Arn- 
tully, in the west end of the parish. The average number attend- 
ing the school may be estimated at 50. It is principally sup- 
ported by the Dissenters, who are numerous in that part of the 
parish. Parents, in general, seem to be fully sensible of the bene- 
fit of giving their children all the schooling which they can afford.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of paupers 
on the roll is 6. At present, there are only 4, and all of them 
residing in other parishes, although their settlement happens to 
be in this. It mav therefore be stated as a remarkable fact, that 
there is not a single pauper resident in this parish. If we cannot 
boast of much wealth, we are thus happily ignorant of the evils 
and miseries of pauperism. The usual monthly allowance to a 
pauper varies from 4s. to 10s. according to circumstances; and 
at Martinmas, each pauper receives 5s. additional for the purchase 
of their winter coals. There has never been any legal assessment 
for the poor ; and during the last twenty years, it has been only 
once found necessary to solicit a small voluntary assessment of 
L. 16, which was chiefly occasioned by the expense of a law-suit 
relative to the aliment of a pauper. Several of the heritors are, 
however, attentive to present donations from time to time, especi- 
ally Baroness Keith, who gives L. 2, 2s. annually. The funds 
that are placed at the disposal of the kirk-session may average, 
from collections at church-doors, L. 18; from dues for mortcloth, 
proclamations, &amp;c. about L.6; in all L.24 per annum, from which 
sum must also be paid the salaries of the precentor, church-officer, 
and various other claims. The above statement is highly credit- 
able to the frugality, as well as to the provident and independent 
spirit of the parishioners. Even widows left with several helpless 
children have refused to accept of regular aid offered to them by 
the kirk-session, but have expressed great thankfulness in getting 
the fees paid for " the winter's schooling to the bairns." Miss 
Stewart of Newbigging in this parish, who died last year, be- 
queathed a legacy of L.20 to the poor's fund ; and instructed her 
executors, after paying several other legacies, to give the residue 
of her free estate, supposed to amount to L.900, to that excellent 
institution the Perth Infirmary. 

Inns or Ale-houses. — There are two inns or ale-houses ; one 
near the Secession meeting-house, intended for the accommoda- 
tion of the more remote attendants at that congregation ; the other 
at the ferry boat, for the use of travellers in general ; and which 
is also frequented by gentlemen from a distance, whom the excel- 
lent salmon angling in its immediate neighbourhood attracts to this 
part of the country, during the summer months. 

Fuel. — Coals, both Scotch and English, are brought from Perth, 
or purchased at a trifling additional expense in Stanley, at a de- 
pot recently established there. Firewood may also be obtained

on reasonable terms at the sales of decayed timber, brushwood, 
&amp;c. that frequently take place. The tenants on the property 
of the Duke of Athole are entitled to a certain quantity of 
peats from the moss of Craigleith, on the western boundary of the 
parish. It is understood that the parochial minister has also this 
privilege; but during many years, it has not been exercised, owing 
to the distance of the moss, and the trouble and expense of pre- 
paring the peats.

PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS. 

THE REV. PATRICK J. STEVENSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish of Coupar- Angus lies in 
the centre of Strathmore. By far the larger portion of it belongs 
to the county of Perth ; but the original part of the town being in 
Forfarshire, the parish takes its distinctive name from that county. 
It is bounded on the north-west, by the parish of Bendochy, from 
which it is separated by the river Isla ; on the north-east, by 
Meigle ; on the south-east, by Keltins ; and on the south-west, 
by Cargill. Its length is about 5 miles, stretching from north- 
east to south-west. Its breadth varies from 1 to 2£ miles. 

The parish is divided, in the direction of north-east, by a ridge 
of some height; along which the road to Aberdeen runs; and 
which commands a splendid view of the Sidlaw, or perhaps Sud- 
law, hills on the south ; the lower range of the Grampians on 
the north, with the distant summits of Ben More, Schihallion, 
and Ben Voirlich. 

The river Isla forms the north-west boundary of the parish. 
It is supposed to take its name from Yllif, a flood. In the twelfth 
century, Giraldus Cambrensis calls it Hylef. This supposition 
derives some corroboration from the whole of the haugh-land, 
which is of considerable extent on the south side of the river, hav- 
ing been formerly liable to be overflowed. After continued rain, 



1142 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the river, swelled by the waters of the Dean and Ericht, rises lo 
a great height. Embankments, however, have been erected with- 
in the last ten years, by the proprietors; and these, unless in 
very extraordinary seasons, are sufficient to prevent the mischief, 
which was occasioned every year to a greater or less degree. 
These embankments average in height about seven feet ; in 
breadth, thirty-six feet at the base, and three at the top. Their 
base is at a considerable height above the ordinary bed of the 
rivers. The Isla abounds in trout ; and in favourable seasons, a 
large number of salmon are taken in it. It rises in Canlochan- 
glen, on the confines of Aberdeenshire ; and after a winding 
course of upwards of 40 miles, falls into the Tay, about 3 miles 
beyond the western boundary of the parish. 

Botany. — The only plants rare in the district and found in the pa- 
rish are the following : Stratiotes abides, Lysimachia thyrsiflora, 
Tragopogon major, Teucrium chamaedrys, Hyoscyamus niger, Sam- 
bucus ebulus. The rarest of these, the Stratiotes abides, was planted 
in the loch of Forfar, by George Don. It is found in this parish in 
a stagnant piece of water, which formerly formed part of the chan- 
nel of the Isla ; and in all probability found its way into its present 
locality from the former, in one of the many overflowings of the 
Isla, which communicates with the loch of Forfar by the Dean. 
The Lysimachia thyrsiflora grows in the same locality. The 
Teucrium chamaedrys is found on an old wall by the ruins of the 
Abbey. The Tragopogon major in the den of Keithick. The 
Hyoscyamus niger and Sambucus ebulus in the church-yard. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The chief land-owners in this parish are, W. 
E. Collinswood, Esq. of Keithick ; F. Stewart, Esq. of Balme- 
rino ; George Kinloch, Esq. of Kinloch ; Patrick Murray, Esq. 

of Simprim ; Cunninghame, Esq. of Cronan ; Miss Geekie 

of Balbrogie. 

Parochial Registers. — The date of the oldest of the parochial 
registers is 1682; and they appear to have been regularly and 
carefully kept. 

Antiquities. — The remains of a Roman camp are still to be seen, 
immediately to the east of the churchyard. Maitland, in his His- 
tory of Scotland, describes it as a square of 1200 feet, fortified 
with two strong ramparts and large ditches. The eastern ram- 
part is the only one that has not been levelled. It is generally 
supposed to be one of the camps of Lollius Urbicus. 



COUPAR-ANGUS. 



1143 



Coupar was once the seat of a rich and flourishing abbey of Cis 
tertian monks. It was founded in 1 164 by Malcolm IV., grand- 
son and successor of David I., whose liberality to the church led 
King James to remark, " That Saint David must have been 
a sore saint to the Crown." Fordun Scotichronicon, lib. viii. 
cap. 7, says, " Anno mclxiv. de consilio Waltheri, Abbatis de 
Melros, rex Malcolmus, fundavit nobile monasterium de Cupro- 
in- Angus;" and lib. ix. cap. 48, "hoc anno 1233 dedicatee 
sunt ecclesiaj de Newbotil, Abirbrothoc, et. Cupro." 

Wynton, in « De Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland," tells us, 

« A thowsand a hundyre and sexty yhere 

Andfowre     

Malcolme, Kyng of Scotland, 

And pesybly in it regnand, 
- De elevynd yhere of his crown e, 

Mad the fundatyowne 

Of the Abbay of Culpyre-in-Angws, 

And dowyt it wyth his almws, 

In honoure of the may kles may 

Relygyws munkis there dwellis ay, 

All lyk to Cystwys in habyt, 

We oys to call thame mwnkys qwhyt."— Book vii. Cap. vii. 

The revenues of the abbey appear to have been great. Boece 
says, " Ea est abbacia divas virgini sacra amplissimis dotata reddi- 
tibus. Inhabitant earn viri religiosi ordinis Cistertii, multa pietate 
celebres ; nec in hunc usque diem ullo notati manifesto flagitio." 

There are two rentals of the abbey ; one in the Book of As- 
sumptions, where it is valued at L.1886, 8s. 6d. ; and another by 
Keith, as follows: money, L. 1238, 14s. 9d. ; wheat, 7 chalders, 
12 bolls, 1 peck; bear, 75 chalders, 10 bolls, 3 pecks; meal, 
73 chalders, 4 bolls, 3 pecks, 3 lippies ; oats, 25 chalders, 4 
bolls, 2 pecks, 2 lippies. 

It possessed, in the parish of Coupar, the estates of Keithick, 
Arthurstone, Denhead, Balgersho, Cronan ; in the parish of Ben- 
dochy, — Coupar Grange, probably the home-farm of the abbey, 
where the abbot had a country seat, and to which the monks oc- 
casionally retired when sick, Drimmie, Persic, and Cally, com- 
monly called Monks'- Cally, to distinguish it from another Cally 
in the same neighbourhood. The abbey appears to have pos- 
sessed land in the parish of Fossaway also ; as we find that, in 
the year 1572, " John Edmonstoun, minister of Tullibole, had 
his stipend, L.73, 15s., out of the third of the Abbey of Coupar, 
be the taxmen or parochiners of Fossaway." The Hays of Errol, 



1144 



PERTHSHIRE. 



as we learn from Keith, were great benefactors to this abbey. 
" W illiam de Haya grants thereto the lands of Liderpole or Ed- 
derpole," in the Carse of Gowrie. David de Haya, his son, 
grants also, " pro anima Wilhelmi patris sui et Elenae sposse suae 
cum consensu Guilberti heredis sui unum rete super aquam de 
Thei ; with three acres of arable ground, — " Guilbert de Haya 
miles, dominus de Errol," grants to the monks of this place, " li- 
berum transitum sine impedimento cum bobus suis super terras 
suas per omnes vias et semitas." And Guilbert Hay, Constable 
of Scotland, grants to this monastery, " in quo progenitores sui 
sepulti erant et ipse etiam elegerat sepeliri jus patronatus ecclesiee 
de Errol et capellae du Inchmartin cum earum juribus et pertinen- 
tiis." This gift is confirmed by Pope Clement. 

Donald Campbell, the last Abbot, had five sons, for whom he 
made handsome provision out of the estates belonging to the ab- 
bey, assigning to them the ' properties of Balgersho, Keithick, 
Denhead, Cronan, and Arthurstone. Two of them lie buried in 
the churchyard of Bendochy. Leonard Leslie, commendator of 
the abbey, was also buried in the same church. His tomb is very 
entire. He died in 1605, aged 81. 

The extent of the abbey buildings may be guessed at, but can- 
not be accurately defined. The only fragment now remaining is 
in the south-west corner of the churchyard, on the side of the 
turnpike road leading to Dundee. In 1780, a part of the abbey, 
consisting of an arch, of beautiful architecture, situate near the 
centre of the present churchyard, was demolished for the purpose 
of furnishing stones for building the present church  Till within 
these few years, the base of a pillar was to be seen to the eastward 
of the present church. The northern wall of the oldest part of 
the present church rests on part of the foundation of what appears 
to have been the northern part of the abbey. 

III. — Population. 
The population of the parish in 1831 was 2615; in 1841, 
2532; of whom 1173 are males, and 1359 females. The de- 
crease during the last ten years may be ascribed principally to 
emigration. This statement in regard to the population does not 
include the estate of Kinloch, which, though in Coupar quoad 
civilia, has always been taken up with the census of the parish of 
Meigle. 

The average number of births and deaths cannot be accurately- 
ascertained, from the unwillingness of many to register their chil- 



COUPAR-ANGUS. 



1145 



dren, and from there being no regular register of deaths. The 
average of marriages for the last seven years is 22. 

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards is 21. 

There are 3 insane persons, 2 fatuous, 3 blind, I deaf and dumb, 

and 1 deaf. 

IV. — Industry. 
The cultivated lands in the parish may be classed under the 
different varieties of soil in nearly the following proportions : 

Under a low-lying clayey soil, too stiff for profitable cultivation of the 

different species of green crops, - Acres 100 
Under a deep soil, chiefly of alluvial formation, rather stiff, but natu- 
rally fertile, " 300 

Under a free soil of moderate depth, and of every degree of fertility 

from the useful sands to a medium loam, ... 1300 

Under a gravelly soil, - - - - " 

Under the inferior dry sands, - - - 20 

Under a soil of medium quality, resting upon a close subsoil, - 290 
Under poor sandy clays and low-lying wet sands, - • 230 

Under peaty soil, - - - 50 

The unoccupied land consists of 

Very inferior wet sands about - - - - 30 

Poor gravelly soil, - - - - - 5 

There are, besides, several patches of useful pasturage along the 

old course of the Isla. 

About 80 acres are under wood. 

The average rent of land is about L.2, 3s. ; and the general 
duration of leases nineteen years. 

The general system of cropping is by a rotation of four years. 
This system is more generally adopted than is consistent either 
with the nature of the soil or the practice of good husbandry. A 
large proportion of the arable land consists, as has been stated, of 
a dry fine soil, and is peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of tur- 
nips and the artificial grasses. Such a soil would require a rota- 
tion, embracing in its course a period of rest in pasture suitable 
to the nature of the land, and to the state of its fertility. The 
number of small farms may, to a certain extent, account for the 
general adoption of the system usually followed. The amount of 
capital laid out in stock and implements of husbandry being 
greater, when the farms are small, than what is required for the 
cultivation of the same amount of land when divided into large 
farms, holds out an inducement to the proprietors to impose as 
little restraint on the mode of cultivation as is consistent with the 
ordinary rules of good husbandly. The rotation of four years, 



1146 



PERTHSHIRE. 



therefore, as imposing the least restraint, and offering the greatest 
inducement to a wide competition, is readily agreed to. The 
larm-buildings are very various in point of design and accommoda- 
tion. On most of the smaller farms, they are deficient, while on 
the larger they are excellent. Those on Keithick, Balgersho, and 
Denhead may be noticed as affording illustrations of the latter. 

Grazing, as a system, can scarcely be said to belong to the hus- 
bandry of the parish,— the grass-parks of Keithick being the only 
land under permanent pasture. They let at about L.4 per acre. 

Wages. — Farm-servants are engaged for twelve months ; and 
the average wages of a ploughman, qualified to work a pair of 
horses, are about L.12 in money, 35 lbs. of oatmeal per week, and 
three chopins old measure of milk per day. Good day-labour- 
ers receive, on an average, 10s. per week during the period when 
they can work ten hours per day. After that period, the hours 
of work are counted, and the rate of wages per hour is slightly 
raised. 

Livestock. — There is no pure or distinct breed of cattle in the 
parish; but, since the institution of the Agricultural Association, 
the emulation excited by the exhibition of stock at its annual 
shows, and the introduction of the short-horn breed of cattle, a 
great improvement has been effected on the existing mixed breed ; 
and now many useful animals, of considerable value, are to be met 
with among them. 

An Agricultural Association was formed, upwards of twenty 
years ago, for the breeding and feeding of stock. Most of the 
principal proprietors in the district take an interest in it. Its meet- 
ings are held twice a year ; and the stock exhibited, though not 
numerous, is generally of very excellent quality. The number of 
members at present is about 50. 

Improvements. — The chief improvement in agriculture consists 
of draining, which is now carried on to a considerable extent. 
The embankment above-mentioned has also rendered the low-ly- 
ing lands much more valuable. 

An ingenious plan of the late Lord Douglas Gordon Hallibur- 
ton for effecting the drainage of a considerable extent of flat but 
valuable land, is also well worthy of notice. In heavy rains, the 

standing water could not find any vent, the only drain, a small 

stream skirting the land, — serving to increase the evil. In these 
circumstances, his Lordship planned the following remedy : A 
level was brought up from a point in the bed of the stream, 1180 



COUPAR-ANGUS. 



1147 



feet 8 inches below the farm subject to inundation. In dry wea- 
ther the stream was confined to one side of its usual channel, and 
a conduit of 18 inches square, well-built, flagged, and puddled on 
the top, to prevent any water getting in, was constructed below 
the bed of the burn. Above that, a complete coating of broken 
metal was laid to render the conduit more secure, and the burn 
was then allowed to run in its former course. The rise is one inch 
in 42 feet 2 inches. The cost of the whole was L.220. It was 
constructed in 1831, and has been found, with occasional trifling- 
repairs, completely to answer the purpose for which it was in- 
tended. 

Manufactures.— The chief employment of the labouring classes 
is weaving, principally of the coarser articles of linen manufacture. 
In the present depressed state of trade, the remuneration is ex- 
tremely small. Able-bodied men cannot earn, on an average, 
above 5s. or 6s. per week. The privations which this imposes are 
borne, with a most praiseworthy spirit. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is a weekly market held here on Thursdays. The amount 
of business done is less than formerly, owing to similar markets 
having been, some years ago, originated in the neighbouring vil- 
lages of Meigle and Blairgowrie. 

There were formerly villages, containing a considerable popu- 
lation, at Keithick and Caddam. These are now entirely extinct. 
At Balbrogie there still is a population of about 70. 

Coupar is a post-town. Letters are delivered daily. 

The means of communication are abundant. The Defiance, 
one of the best conducted coaches in the country, passes daily be- 
twixt Edinburgh and Aberdeen. There is also a railway to Dun- 
dee, on which coaches run four times a day. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated very conveniently 
for the great mass of the people, being close to the end of the 
village. It was built in 1681. It was nearly rebuilt in 1780, and 
received a large addition in 1831. It affords accommodation for 
upwards of 800 persons. 

The manse was built in 178, and has received twoadditions; ren- 
dering it now a comfortable and convenient residence. The glebe 
consists of about seven acres; part of it is, at present, let at L.4 per 
acre. The stipend is sixteen chalders ; half meal, half barley ; pay- 
able by the fiars prices, with L.10 for communion elements. There 
are four Dissenting places of worship, Episcopalian, United Seces- 



1J48 



PERTHSHIRE. 



sion, Relief, and Original Secession. Divine service in the Es- 
tablished Church is generally well attended. The number of 
communicants is between 600 and 700. 

Education. — There is one parochial school and two unendowed 
schools. All the usual branches of education, with Latin, Greek, 
and French, are taught at the parochial school. The salary of 
the schoolmaster is the maximum, L. 34, 4s. 4|d., and the 
amount of school-fees is about L.70. He has the legal accom- 
modation undoubtedly, viz. two rooms, including a kitchen, but 
little more. The school-room is also bad, in point of size, situa- 
tion, ventilation, and repair. A majority of the heritors are at 
present desirous of building a new one. 

Charitable Institutions. — There are two Friendly Societies, one 
of masons, the other of gardeners. Both have for their object, 
the granting assistance to members during sickness, and an an- 
nuity to their widows or children, when destitute. A small sum 
is given also to defray funeral expenses. There are about 60 
members belonging to the one and 80 to the other. There is al- 
so a Ladies' Society for assisting Indigent Old Women. To these 
a small monthly allowance is given. 

Savings Bank. — A Savings Bank, in terms of the Act of Parlia- 
ment regulating these institutions, was opened in 1839. It pro- 
mises to answer well the purpose for which it is intended. Since 
its commencement, the sums paid into it amount to L.2220 ; those 
taken out to L.1145, — leaving a balance in the bank of L.1075. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons receiving 
a stated allowance from the poor's funds, during the last year, was 
48. These received, on an average, 5s. per month. Those who 
received occasional aid amounted to 19. About L. 20 was dis- 
tributed among them. There are, besides, three lunatics in the 
Dundee Asylum. For these, about L. 54 is paid per annum. 
The sum required for the maintenance of the poor is provided for 
by a voluntary assessment among the heritors, and by the collec- 
tions at church door, mortcloth dues, &amp;c. The assessment for 
the last eight or nine years has been voluntary. Previously to 
that time, it was compulsory. But at the period mentioned, with 
the view of getting quit of an assessment altogether, it was pro- 
posed and unanimously agreed to by the heritors, that they should, 
by voluntary assessment, maintain the whole of the poor at that 
time on the roll; leaving the kirk-session to provide, from the 
collections and other funds, for those who subsequently to that 

4 



COUPAR-ANGUS. 



1149 



date might require parochial aid. It was hoped that the kirk-ses- 
sion would be able, from the increase of the contributions at the 
church doors, and the small number of poor, who, for some years 
at least, were likely to require assistance, to realize such a sum 
as would render an assessment unnecessary beyond the period, 
when those, for whom the heritors engaged to provide, should 
cease to require support. The scheme seemed to work well at 
first ; but the funds which the kirk-session calculated on receiving 
have not equalled their anticipations, and the probability is, that ere 
long a legal assessment will be again resorted to. One thing, how- 
ever, may be noticed as the result of this experiment, viz, that 

the poor are less disposed to refrain from asking parochial aid 

when there exists a legal assessment, than where the funds for 

their maintenance arise solely from voluntary contributions. 

Markets, Sj-c. — There are yearly markets for horses and cattle, 

besides those which are held weekly. These are now much less 

frequented, than they formerly were. 

Alehouses. — The number of houses at present licensed to sell 

spirits, &amp;c. is 24, — a number most unnecessarily large for the size 

of the parish. 

p ue l — The chief fuel employed is English coal, which is brought 
by the railway from Dundee. It costs from L.l, Is. to L.l, 2s. 
per ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Almost all the houses and the streets are now lighted with gas, 
a gas company having been established a few years ago. 

The steeple, which marks the town at a distance, is unconnect- 
ed with the church. It was built in 1767, by a subscription among 
the inhabitants. It stands on the site of the old prison, when 
Coupar was a burgh of regality. The lower part of it is still em- 
ployed as a temporary place of confinement. 

There is a reading-room, provided with a daily London, and 
several provincial newspapers.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. ROBERT C. GRAHAM, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— It appears from the public records of Scotland, that 
in 1485, the name of this parish was Abirfull ; and in 1505, Abir- 
fule. It is mentioned in the books of the Lord High Treasurer, 
that on the 22d August of that year, 1505, " Maister William 
Ogilvy gaif, by the King's command, to the priestis of Aberfule, 
xiiij. s." The modern name of the parish is Aberfoyle— some- 
times written Aberfoil. It is suggested by the confluence of a 
stream of water with the Forth, about a quarter of a mile to the 
east of the church ; which stream is called in Gaelic the Poll. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The utmost length of this parish is 13 
miles; its utmost breadth, 6. It is bounded on the north, by 
Callander parish ; on the west, by part of Buchanan parish ; on the 
south, by the parishes of Drymen and Gartmore ; and on the east, 
by Port of Menteith. 

Topographical Appearances, fyc— Aberfoyle is situated in the 
Stewartry of Menteith, and on the southern verge of Perthshire. 
The general aspect of the country is marked by features very 
different from those which characterize the district to the east and 
south. Here, the extensive plain and grassy eminence cease, and 
the rugged precipice and lofty mountain commence. There are, 
however, only two mountains in this parish worthy of particular no- 
tice, viz. Benvenue and Ben-chochan. The former rises to the 
height of 2800, and the latter to 2000 feet above the level of the 
sea. Both of these mountains command extensive views to the 
north, west, and east. The celebrated scenery of the Trossachs 
lies immediately beneath them ; and from their summits can be 
distinctly traced " the windings of the Chase," so beautifully de- 
scribed by the late Sir Walter Scott in his Lady of the Lake. The 
valleys in the vicinity of these mountains are of small extent, none 



AUERFOVLK. 



1151 



of them exceeding a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in 
breadth. They are, in fact, mere strips of land recovered from 
heath, and which, if allowed to remain for a few years uncultivated, 
would be covered with heath again. 

Climate, fyc. — The climate of Aberfoyle, though rainy, on ac- 
count of the vicinity of the mountains, is upon the whole healthy. 
That part of Aberfoyle where the manse and church are situat- 
ed, is only about forty- five feet above the Frith of Forth at Stir- 
ling ; and being completely sheltered by hills on every side, the 
climate is mild and warm. In summer, the thermometer is fre- 
quently known to rise to 80° in the shade, and has been seen even 
as high as 84. 

Hydrography. — There are five lakes in Aberfoyle, of conside- 
rable extent, — Loch Katrine, Loch-ard, Loch Con, Loch Au- 
chray, and Loch Drunky. The first of these, which runs into 
Buchanan parish, at its western extremity, and extends to Callan- 
der parish on the north, is about nine miles in length, and one in 
breadth. It was stated some years ago, in an Edinburgh newspa- 
per, that a party of scientific men had visited three of the Scottish 
lakes, — Loch Lomond, Loch Tay, and Loch Katrine, for the pur- 
poses of sounding and ascertaining the temperature of the water at 
different depths. According to this statement, the deepest part of 
Loch Katrine is about the middle, nearly opposite to the farm of 
Letter. The lead is here said to have struck the ground at seven- 
ty-eight fathoms from the surface, the thermometer showing forty- 
one degrees by the register, the surface being sixty-three. Onlv 
small portions of this lake have ever been known to freeze. 

Loch-ard is next in extent, being four miles in length, and one 
in breadth. No measurement of its depth has been taken, but that 
it does not reach to that of the former, appears from the circum- 
stance, that in severe winters it is so completely frozen, that not 
only is it frequently crossed over, but heavy loads of fuel are carried 
on the ice from south to north. Loch-con, which lies farther to the 
west, is two miles and a half in length, and three quarters of a mile 
in breadth. It lies immediately under high and precipitous hills, 
and appears to be of considerable depth. It is seldom known to 
freeze completely over. Loch-Auchray and Loch Drunky, which 
are each about two miles in length and half a mile in breadth, are 
of inconsiderable depth, and consequently soon affected by frost. 

The river Forth has its rise at the western extremity of this pa- 
rish, — at a place called in the Gaelic language Shid-n'uir, or the 



1152 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ridge of Yewtrees, where it is probable a wood of yews formerly 
grew, though no vestige of it now remains. Here there arises a 
pretty copious spring, which divides itself into two branches, the 
most considerable running eastward through Lochcon and Loch- 
ard, and communicating with the German Ocean ; the other run- 
ning westward into Lochlomond, and communicating by the Clyde 
with the Atlantic. About half a mile to the east of Loch-ard, the 
Forth receives an important accession to its streams by the water 
of Duchray, which has its rise near the summit of Benlomond, and 
which may seem to have an equal claim to the source of the Forth. 
It mav be observed, however, that the branch which issues from 
Skid-n'uir, by passing through the above-mentioned lakes, and re- 
ceiving the streams poured down by a much larger tract of coun- 
try, sends forth a body of water, which, upon an average of the 
whole year, may be estimated larger than the other nearly by one- 
third. For the first four miles after the junction of these branches, 
the Forth is a shallow and narrow river. After passing Gartmore, 
however, it increases in depth ; but the fall from that to Stirling, 
during a course of twenty miles, is not more than eighteen feet, as 
found by a measurement taken under the direction of the late Lord 
Cathcart, when it was proposed to carry the great canal up by the 
bed of the Forth, and to join it to the Clyde by Lochlomond and 
the Leven. That scheme, however, was abandoned on many ac- 
counts, and it is not likely that any great benefit will ever be de- 
rived to this neighbourhood, from the navigation of which the Forth 
may be rendered capable, above Stirling. 

At the farm of Ledard, near the western extremity of Loch- 
ard, there is a very beautiful cascade, formed by a mountain stream 
of considerable size, passing first over a height of twelve feet into 
a magnificent basin formed of the solid rock, and so transparent, 
that, at the depth of ten feet, the smallest pebble may be seen. 
From this basin, dashing over a ledge of rock, it precipitates it- 
self again over an irregular slope of more than fifty feet. The sides 
of this stream are closely covered with oak copse, birch, and moun- 
tain ash, so that in approaching the fall, you enter, perhaps, one of 
the finest scenes of the grand and beautiful to be met with in High- 
land scenery. This cascade is rendered peculiarly interesting from 
its having been made the subject of description in two of the cele- 
brated works of Sir Walter Scott, — Waverley and Rob Roy. 
There is another cascade about a quarter of a mile to the north of 
the inn ; but as it is supplied by a much smaller mountain stream, 



ABKRFOYLE. 



1153 



it makes little appearance, except after aheavy fall of rain. When 
a flood occurs, however, which is frequently the case during autumn 
and winter, there is a splendid fall of at least ninety feet. The 
sides of this cascade are also covered with natural wood, oak, 
birch, and hazel. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The valley of Aberfoyle is inclosed 
on the south, south-east, and east, by that celebrated range of 
mountains called the Grampians, which traverse the whole breadth 
of Scotland from south-west to north-east. 

In the line of these mountains, and uniformly on the west side, 
limestone of a superior quality is found. It is traced from 
Leny, in Callander parish, through Aberfoyle to Auchmar, 
and some of the islands on Lochlomond in Buchanan parish, a 
course of near thirty miles; and it is probable that the same 
rock formation may be traced much farther in the same direc- 
tion. The limestone in Aberfoyle is blue, with veins of white, is 
hard, and admits of a fine polish. It is wrought near the 
eastern extremity of the parish, and is considered equal to the 
best Irish limestone for the purposes of building and plastering. 
As a manure, the use of it is principally confined to the tenants 
of the proprietor, the Duke of Montrose. 

To the west of this range, there is an extensive mountain, con- 
sisting almost entirely of slate. It lies in regular strata, is of ex- 
cellent quality, and regularly wrought, giving employment to about 
twenty men. The want of water carriage, however, and the dis- 
tance of a market, are serious drawbacks. Conglomerate, and 
trap, or whinstone, are the prevailing rocks in this neighbourhood. 

Zoology.— It cannot be said that any of the rare species of ani- 
mals now exist in this parish. Several names of places indicate, 
that at one period, the wolf and wild boar were not unfrequent in 
the district; but the native quadrupeds are now of a less ferocious 
and destructive kind, viz. roe-deer, hares, foxes, badgers, martins, 
polecats, wild cats, otters, weasels, hedgehogs, &amp;c. It is stated in the 
former report of the parish, that the black eagle built in some of the 
more inaccessible rocks. It is now, however, unknown in this quar- 
ter. The osprey or water eagle has also departed. Kites, hawks, 
and ravens, are at all times seen hovering around the cliffs. The 
falcon, too, is occasionally seen ; and during winter, some of the 
rarer species of Colymbi or divers; and flocks of swans have been 
observed. The ptarmigan Tetrao lagopus, Linn. is now rarelv 
to be found, even on our highest mountains ; but the moors still 

PERTH. 4 u

PERTHSHIRE. 



abound with black and red game. Partridges and snipe are com- 
mon on the low grounds ; and pheasants, unknown in this parish 
till about twenty years ago, are now plentiful. 

The fishes in the lakes and rivers are, trout, pike, perch, and 
eel. In Loch Katrine alone, the Salmo Alpinus or charr is to be 
found. The trout of Loch-ard and Loch-con, which weigh from 
one to three pounds, are of the same quality with those of Loch- 
leven in Kinross-shire; the flesh is red and of a high flavour. 
They run up the streams connected with the lakes about the end 
of September. Pike are often caught, weighing from fifteen to 
twenty pounds. The spawning season of this fish is in the month 
of March, and it is not in good condition again till the beginning 
of June. 

Plants. — A great variety of plants, some of which may be con- 
sidered rare, are to be found in this parish and neighbourhood, 
such as the following : 

Civcaea lutetiana Parnassia palustris Adoxa moschatellina 

Scboenus albus Allium ursinum Pyrola rotundifolia 

Montia fontana Triglochin palustre Saxifraga 

Alchemiiia Alpina Trientalis Euroj;aa Comarum palustre 

Sanicula Europasa Paris quadrifolia Orchis 

Athamanta meum Osmunda regalir; Rubus chamaemorus, &amp;c. 

Sison inundatum Vaccinium 

The native woods consist of oak, ash, birch, alder, hazel, moun- 
tain-ash, holly, the birds'-cherry, willow, wild apple, &amp;c. Larch 
has been lately introduced, but to no great extent, although it 
thrives remarkably well. The native shrubs are numerous. The 
juniper, broom, furze  Ulex Europceus, honeysuckle, ivy, gale, &amp;c. 
everywhere abound. 

II. — Civil History. 
Aberfoyle appears to have depended in former times, quoad 
sacra, on the monastery of Inchmahome, some beautiful remains 
of which are to be seen in the Isle of Menteith, in the neighbour- 
ing parish of Port. In the genealogical tree of the Earls of Men- 
teith, we find a Patrick Graham, a descendant of the family, en- 
titled " Vicar of Aberfoyle." About the period of the Revolution 
a Mr Robert Kirk was minister of the parish. He was a man of 
learning, and had a principal share in the translation of the Psalms 
into Gaelic verse. His grave-stone, which may be seen near the 
east end of the church of Aberfoyle, bears this inscription, " Ro- 
bertus Kirk, A. M., Linguae Hiberniae Lumen." He died in 1692. 
To him succeeded Mr William Fisher, who, during the establish- 
ment of Episcopacy, had been minister of Eastwood, near Glasgow.

ABERFOYLE. 



1155 



During his incumhency there, he had saved the life of Maxwell 
of Pollock, one of the Senators of the College of Justice, by af- 
fording him shelter when under proscription for his adherence to 
Presbytery. On the ejection of the Episcopal clergy, under King 
William, Lord Pollock procured from the Montrose family the 
office of domestic chaplain for Mr Fisher. Under cover of that 
title he officiated unmolested at Aberfoyle for thirty years, and 
was, beyond question, the last Episcopal clergyman who enjoyed 
a benefice in Scotland. He died in 1732. To him, in the same 
year, succeeded Mr James Richardson, a man whose learning 
rendered him respectable in the church. Pie died in 1770, leav- 
ing an only son, who, at an early period of life, was appointed 
Professor of Humanity in the University of Glasgow, and who, in 
that situation, highly distinguished himself as an accomplished 
scholar and successful teacher. Mr James Dymock was ordained 
minister of Aberfoyle in May 1773, and resigned his charge in 
April 1786. He was succeeded in April 1787 by Mr Patrick 
Graham afterwards Dr Patrick Graham, who died in Septem- 
ber 1835, in the forty-eighth year of his ministry. He was emi- 
nent for the variety and extent of his literary acquirements, a 

profound scholar, an able divine, and elegant writer, and publish- 
ed several works of well-known merit. He was, besides, long en- 
gaged, as a member of the committee of the General Assembly, in 
revising the new edition of the Gaelic Scriptures. 

Land-owner. — His Grace the Duke of Montrose is the sole 
land-owner in the parish of Aberfoyle, being, at the same time, 
patron, proprietor, and superior. 

Parochial Registers. — One of the parochial registers is dated 
as far back as 1698, but it is now nearly illegible. The other 
registers, which are not voluminous, appear to have been kept with 
tolerable regularity since 1753. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population of Aberfov'le was 895 
1792, . . .790 

1821, . . .730 

1831, males, 331 j females, 329; . 660 
1841, . . .549 

The census taken in 1821 is believed to be incorrect, but how far 
cannot now be stated. When the last census was taken, some fa- 
milies were absent from the parish at wood-cutting and other em- 
ployments; but these, had they been present, would not have 
added above 20 to the population. 

This decrease may be attributed in a great measure to the sys- 



1156 



PERTHSHIRE. 



tern, now so general over the Highlands, of throwing several small 
farms into one. The families thus dispossessed of the land on 
which they had found employment, emigrate to the manufacturing 
towns and villages in order to procure a livelihood.

IV. — Industry. 

The upper part of the parish, which occupies by far the great- 
est superficial extent, consists of sheep-farms, and the lower part 
of cultivated grounds. The occupiers of the sheep-farms seldom 
raise so much grain as is sufficient for themselves and for their 
shepherds. The farmers in the lower district are generally able 
to send a small quantity to the market. 

The cultivation of sown grasses is now much more attended to 
than formerly ; and good crops of rye-grass and clover are gene- 
rally raised in the lower parts of the parish. It appears, that, when 
the former report was drawn up, the culture of field turnip was 
almost unknown. Of late years, however, this crop has been ex- 
tensively introduced into the parish, much to the benefit of the 
farms. 

The average rent of grazing is at the rate of L.3 for a cow, and 
4s. for a ewe or full-grown sheep per annum ; but the business 
done in this way is trifling. 

The rate for farm labour, if you engage a man by the year, is 
from L.1'2 to L.15. For day-labourers, Is. in winter, and Is. 6d. 
in summer, besides maintenance. The rate of carpenter-work is 
2s. ; and of mason work, 2s. 6d. when the day admits of working 
from six o'clock in the morning till six o'clock in the evening. 



A.BERFO YLE. 



1157 



Breeds of Sheep and Cattle. — The breed of sheep reared in this 
parish is the black-faced, and great attention is paid to the im- 
provement of the stock. On most of the farms, the sheep are qf 
a very superior quality, and bring high prices in the market. 
Highland black cattle are chiefly reared in the upper part of the 
parish, and the Ayrshire breed in the valley. 

Leases. — The leases on the grain-farms are given for twelve 
years, those on the sheep-farms for nine years, and are considered, 
upon the whole, as favourable to the occupier. 

Farm- Buildings and Enclosures. — With one or two exceptions, 
the farm-buildings in the parish are new and commodious, and 
very superior to those generally found on Highland estates. The 
enclosures, so far as they extend, and they are now extending ra- 
pidly, are strong and sufficient. If applied for by the tenant, and 
if built of stone, six per cent, of interest is charged on the outlay. 
The principal improvements which have recently been introduced 
into the parish are, the proper rotation of crops, fencing, draining, 
and liming, and rearing better breeds of sheep and of cattle. 

Produce — The grain raised is, as formerly noticed, consumed 
chiefly in the parish, but no accurate calculation has been made 
as to the gross amount. A considerable profit is sometimes made 
by the wintering of black-cattle, for which many of the farms are 
peculiarly adapted by the shelter which the woods afford against 
the inclemencies of the weather. Wool, too, is a considerable 
article of commerce ; and a few of the farmers are' assisted in 
making up their rents by the sale of butter and cheese. 

Woods. — The whole woods, consisting principally of oak, from 
the head of Loch-con to the lake of Menteith, in the parish of 
Port, all the property of the Duke of Montrose, are divided into 
twenty- four portions, one of which is cut down annually, and care- 
fully defended by enclosures, till it has grown beyond the reach of 
cattle. It is, in. the meantime, properly thinned; and, at the end 
of twenty-four years, when the whole woods are cut down, the 
same rotation is ready to commence. Before a lot of wood is cut, 
the wood-forester marks out a certain number of trees which are 
to be left as standards, viz. in a lot of ordinary size, 400 trees of 
24 years' growth, 8 of 48 years, and 8 of 72 years. 

V. — Pahochial Economy. 
Market-Town, fyc. — The nearest market-town to Aberfoyle is 
Stirling, which is twenty miles distant. To Glasgow, which is 



1156 



PERTHSHIRE. 



twenty-eight miles distant, there are regular weekly carriers, which 
proves a great convenience. There is also a post-office now es- 
tablished in the parish, by which letters are received on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Fridays, and transmitted on the other days of 
the week. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is by 
no means convenient to the greater part of the population, being 
placed within a mile and a-half of the eastern extremity of the 
parish, and consequently more than eleven miles from the western 
extremity. It was built in 1744, and was for many years in a 
very uncomfortable state. It was thoroughly repaired, however, 
in 1839, and is now a neat and comfortable place of worship, 
having a session-house at one end, and a porch at the other. It 
affords accommodation for about 250 persons. The sittings are 
all free. 

The manse was built in 1732, and has undergone several re- 
pairs. A considerable sum was last year laid out by the heritor 
in building a new front, and in altering and greatly improving the 
principal rooms. 

The glebe consists of fifteen Scotch acres of ground of good 
quality, partly arable and partly meadow. The stipend amounts 
to L.147 in money, together with a chalder of barley and a chal- 
der of oatmeal. 

The parish church is the only place of worship, except a school 
house, where the clergyman generally officiates once in two months. 
Although the population is very scattered, the roads, in some di- 
rections, of the worst description, and the distance great to which 
several families are removed from church, it is generally well at- 
tended. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, one parochial 
school, and one on the foundation of the Society in Scotland for 
Propagating Christian Knowledge. The common branches of 
instruction only are taught in these schools, viz. reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and the knowledge of the Scriptures. 

The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L.28 per annum, 
and the amount of school fees from L.5 to L.6. He is provided 
with a house and garden. The salary of the teacher of the So- 
ciety school is L.15 per annum; the school fees seldom amount 
to more than L.l, 10s. He is allowed by the heritor a house, 
garden, and cow's grass. 

It is not believed that there are any persons in the parish, be- 



AHKKFOYLE. 



1159 



tween six and fifteen years of age, who cannot read; and if there 
are any in this unhappy state of ignorance above fifteen years of 
age, they are not natives of Aberfoyle, but must have lately come 
into it from some other parish. 

Charitable Institutions. — The kirk-session can, in terms of 
deeds of settlement by the late Professor Richardson of Glasgow, 
and Mr John Stewart, merchant, Fintry, recommend two patients 
annually for admission to the Royal Infirmary of Glasgow. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is from 12 to 16. The average amount 
of contributions for their relief, from L.30 to L.35, arising from 
the collections in church, an annual donation from his Grace the 
Duke of Montrose, proclamation fees, and tax for the use of the 
mortcloth. 

Until lately it was considered degrading to receive assistance 
from the parish fund, and consequently this was the last resource 
of the infirm and indigent. At present, however, there is seldom 
to be found a disposition among the poor to refrain from seeking 
parochial relief. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs held in this parish in the course 
of the year : one in April, for the sale of cattle ; one in August, 
for the sale of lambs ; and one in October, for hiring servants. 

Inns, Sfc. — There is only one inn in the parish, kept by a most 
respectable family from England, and which is found quite suffi- 
cient to supply the wants both of travellers and of the inhabitants. 

Fuel. — Peat is the common fuel, and is found in abundance in 
every quarter of the parish. Of wood, also, there is a consider- 
able supply ; but coals of good quality are not to be had nearer 
than Greenyards, beyond Bannockburn, at the distance of twenty- 
four miles, and consequently are procured at a great expense. 

MlSCELLANEOUvS OBSERVATIONS. 

Since the time when the former Statistical Account of the pa- 
rish was drawn up, various changes have taken place in the state 
of the country, the mode of cultivation, the value of land and 
farm produce, and in the circumstances of the people. In regard 
to the state of the country and mode of cultivation, a change to 
the better may everywhere be observed. A spirit of improvement 
has been lately excited among the tenants in general, which, if 
suitably encouraged, must add greatly to their comfort and re- 
spectability. 

It is stated in the former report, that some of the- sheep farm 



1160 



PERTHSHIRE. 



rented as high as L.70, L.80, .and even L.150, and that the me- 
dium rent of the grain farms was from L.20 to L.30. With one 
exception, none of the sheep farms are at present under L.150, 
while some of them rent at L.300, L.400, andeven L.500. The 
rents of the grain farms have risen in proportion, being now con- 
siderably more than double what they were in 1792. 
The real rental of the parish is as follows : — 

Rental of lands, including slate quarry, . . . L.2900 0 0 

Average produce of woods for three years past, less expense of work, &amp;c. 430 0 0 
Game, . . . . . . . 100 0 0 

Gross amount, L.3430 0 0 

In regard to the circumstances and character of the people, it 
may be observed, that a very great improvement has taken place 
within the last twenty years ; and one great cause of the improve- 
ment certainly is, the complete suppression of smuggling, which, 
at one period, was carried on to a great extent in the parish, and 
which was attended by its usual ruinous effects on the morals and 
comfort of the inhabitants.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. PETER M'LAREN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Situation, Extent, Surface, Sfc. — About two-thirds of this 
parish are situated within the county of Perth, and one-third 
in the county of Stirling. The river Teath bounds it on the 
south-west, where it meets the Forth and the Allan on the 
east. The southern point is where the Allan falls into the united 
streams of the other two. From east to west it extends about 3 
miles, and nearly about as much from north to south. It con- 
tains about 2000 acres, one-half of which is a rich clay, the other 
half upland, or what is generally called dry- field. The clay soil 
on the south is divided from the upland by a beautiful bank, which 
crosses the parish almost parallel to the north side, and nearly at 
one-third of the distance between it and the southern extremity. 



LECROPT. 



1161 



From the bank at Lecropt, there is one of the finest prospects 
in this part of the island. The Forth, the Teath, and the Allan 
unite their streams, and form the largest river in North Britain, 
in the champaign country, on the southern borders of the parish. 
Their banks clad with the richest crops, the snug steadings of farms, 
the hedges neatly trimmed, and the lofty trees, through which 
the smoke ascends from dwellings, beautify and enrich the scene. 
On the opposite side of this fertile valley, the castle of Stirling 
rears its head in rude magnificence on the summit of a rock. 
The huge rock of Craigforth on the one side of the castle, and the 
Abbey Craig on the other, form, with the castle itself, three vast 
and detached piles, about the distance of a mile from each other; 
and look down on an extensive tract of flat country. The tower 
of the abbey of Cambuskenneth, where the ashes of the weak and 
unfortunate James HI. rest in peace ; the stately bridge of Stir- 
ling, through which the Forth holds his majestic course to the 
ocean ; his long circuitous links, through innumerable farms and 
thriving villages ; and the sloops sailing along these links in all 
directions, amidst trees and houses, gratify the eye, and delight 
the mind with the appearances of industry and wealth. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — An artificial eminence, on the east side of this 
parish, seems to have been a post of the Romans, near their great 
road to Ardoch. Kier is one of a chain of rude forts that 
run along the north face of the Strath or valley of Monteath. 
These forts are at present in ruins, and are discernible only by 
knolls of a green surface, covering a great heap of loose stones. 
There are also Kiers at Achinsalt, at Borland, at Balinackader, at 
Tar, and in many other places in that direction, all similar to one 
another, in respect of situation, construction, prospect, and materi- 
als ; which is a strong presumption at least, if not a clear proof, that 
their use was the same. There is, in the neighbourhood of the 
church of Lecropt, a hill, where the baron used to hold his court, 
during the prevalence of the feudal system. The Gallow Hill is 

near the Court Hill. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners and their valuations 

are as follows :

in addition to the elementary branches. There is no other public 
school in the parish.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND ST1RLTN 

THE REV. DAVID BLACK, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

There were originally two parishes, Kilspindie and Rait ; 
but at what period their union took place, has not been ascertain- 
ed : it must have been prior to 1634. The walls of the church of 
Rait are still standing. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The form of the parish is oblong; 
its length, from south-east to north-west, being about 5 miles ; and 
its greatest breadth, from south-west to north-east, about fy miles. 
It is bounded on the south and south-east, by the parishof Er- 
rol; on the south-west and west, by Kinfauns; on the north-west 
and north, by St Martins and Collace ; and on the east, by Kin- 
naird. The parish lies, partly in the Carse of Gowrie, and partly 
among the Sidlaw hills, about half-way between Perth and Dun-

dee.. The general appearance of the ground is pleasing, and pre- 
sents to the eye an agreeable variety of moor and cultivated land. 
Towards the southern extremity, the ground is flat ; at about a 
quarter of a mile farther north, it rises with a slope, for two miles, 
till it reaches an elevation of more than 600 feet ; intersected in 
three different places, by the burns of Rait, Kilspindie, and Pi- 
trodie. The remaining part has a northern aspect. The hills 
are generally barren ; in many places, the surface is covered with a 
short heath, wet, and full of those whitish or grey whinstones 
which indicate a poor unkindly bleak soil. The bottom is a bad 
sort of clay, commonly termed mortar or till. But though, in 
general, the summits of the hills are barren and heathy, there are 
many pleasant spots, in hollows and glens, where the soil is good 
and fruitful in a high degree. All those parts of the hills which 
slope towards the Carse are well cultivated, producing crops of 
every kind that is to be found in the low country, and of equal 
quality, — potatoes and turnips in much greater quantity. That 
part of the parish which lies in the bottom of the Carse is gene- 
rally very wet, but of a deep rich soil — a mixture of clay and moss 
— producing in good seasons very luxuriant crops. The Hill of 
Evelick, the highest in the parish, and not far from its centre, has 
been calculated, from barometrical observations, to be 832 feet 
above the level of the sea. Viewed from the south, it has a coni- 
cal appearance, and is covered with a fine green. This hill com- 
mands from its top a most extensive and delightful prospect in 
every direction, embracing within the range some of the richest, 
most magnificent, and beautiful landscapes in Scotland. In look- 
ing towards the north, east, and west, a splendid scene everywhere 
meets the eye. In the foreground lies the extensive vale of Strath- 
more, seen almost from end to end, behind which tower the Gram- 
pian mountains, with the loftier Benglo, Shechallion, and Benvor- 
lic, rearing their snow-clad tops in the far distance. On the south- 
east, south, and south-west, the Carse of Gowrie, with its spacious 
fields and fine orchards, clothed with the richest gifts of Ceres 
and Pomona, lies directly below ; and, beyond that, the Tay, the 
coast of Fife, the Lomond hills, and the hills near Stirling. 

Geology. — Nearly the whole of the parish, and especially 
the hills, is composed of amygdaloid trap and sandstone. The 
trap is found at different depths, and varies in its degree of hard- 
ness, being softer and more brittle where it comes near the surface, 
and becomes exposed to the influence of the weather. The sand.

stone is coarse in the grit, of a greyish colour; dip north-west, at 
an angle of about three degrees. Beautiful pieces of agate are fre- 
quently found among the. hills, and, in the hands of the lapidary, 
these become valuable articles in the shape of brooches and watch- 
seals. There is a whinstone quarry wrought in the Den of Pit- 
rodie, the stones of which are used in building, in metalling roads, 
and in filling drains. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — On the summit of the Hill of Evelick are the re- 
mains of an ancient fortification. It appears to have been formed 
of two concentric circles or walls of stone, enclosing an area of 
about half an acre. The vestiges of a fosse are still visible. A 
little to the south-east of the hill stands the Castle of Evelick, 
now in ruins, the ancient seat of the Lindsays, Knights of Eve- 
lick. It was evidently originally built as a place of strength, and 
must have commanded the pass through that place from Strath- 
more to the Carse. In digging near this place, some tumuli were 
lately discovered, which contained human bones. 

Mansion-Houses. — The only gentleman's seat in the parish is 
Fingask Castle, the residence of Sir P. Murray Threipland, Bart, 
beautifully situated on the braes of the Carse, and commanding an 
extensive prospect over the rich and fertile vale below, which 
here opens in one vast amphitheatre, with the river Tay rolling 
through it for upwards of fourteen miles, till it is lost in the 
German Ocean a few miles below Dundee. The grounds around it 
are tastefully laid out in flower-gardens, shrubberies, and extensive 
walks. The Castle, which is built on the brink of a deep glen, 
amidst wooded eminences, bears in one part the venerable date of 
1 194. It is now, however, greatly enlarged and modernized by addi- 
tional buildings, but the castellated form is still preserved in its ex- 
ternal appearance. This ancient mansion was formerly used as a 
place of strength, and, in 1642, stood a siege during the civil war 
in Oliver Cromwell's time. Here the Chevalier St George, son of 
James II., slept, January 7th 1716, on his way from Glammis to 
Scone, where he was proclaimed king. In 1746, the castle was 
completely ransacked by the Government troops, the fortalices 
demolished, and a great part of the building razed to the ground, 
in consequence of the attachment of the Threipland family to the 
cause of the unfortunate House of Stuart.

Parochial Registers. — The registers of this parish consist of se- 
veral volumes, in which are also included the minutes of the kirk- 
session. The earliest entry is dated July 27, 1656. They are in 
pretty good order, and appear to have been regularly kept down 
to the present time. 

III. — Population. 

From the returns made to Dr Webster in 1755, the population was 828 

in 1791, . . 718 

Since 1801, it has continued nearly stationary, with the excep- 
tion of a small decrease since 1831, owing chiefly to emigration.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — It is impossible to state, with any degree of ac- 
curacy, the number of imperial acres in the parish ; they may pro- 
bably amount to about 6500. Of these, about 3500 are arable, 
and in a state of high cultivation, producing excellent crops of all 
the ordinary kinds. Potatoes are cultivated to a considerable ex- 
tent, chiefly of the red variety, and great quantities are yearly 
shipped for the London market. Much attention is also paid to 
the feeding of [cattle, and a considerable breadth is annually laid 
out in turnip, for that purpose. More than 200 acres of ground 
are under plantation, consisting mostly of larch, Scotch fir, and 
ash. These plantations are in a thriving state. About 200 acres 
are in a state of undivided common. The remaining part of the 
parish, with the exception of small portions, partially cultivated, is 
in a state of permanent pasture. 

Husbandry. — Agriculture is in a flourishing state, and the sys- 
tem of husbandry that has been pursued, for many years, is very su- 
perior. The farms are kept under excellent management, and all

provided with thrashing-mills. Furrow- draining, both by tiles and 
small stones, is successfully carried on, and bone-dust is occa- 
sionally used in raising turnips. Farm-buildings are, in general, 
both substantial and commodious. The usual duration of leases 
is nineteen years. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — Perth and Dundee are the nearest market- 
• towns, distant about eight and thirteen miles respectively from the 
church. The turnpike-road from Perth to Dundee is distant 
about half-a-mile from the southern boundary of the parish. The 
nearest post-town is Errol. 

Villages. — There are three small villages: Rait, containing 47 
families; Kilspindie, 18; and Pitrodie, 16. In each of these a 
few hands are employed in the manufacture of linen fabrics for the 
Dundee market. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, with its surrounding burying- 
ground, encompassed by spreading elm and ash trees, stands in 
the village of Kilspindie, on a rising piece of ground, formed by 
the junction of two small rivulets. The situation is delightful and 
well-chosen for the convenience of the majority of the population. 
It is a plain modern building, comfortably seated for about 350, 
and in a good state of repair. The manse, which is old, is situated 
within a hundred yards of the church. The stipend consists of 
15 chalders, half meal half barley, payable according to the fiars' 
prices. There are two glebes, and the rent of both may amount 
to L. 13. 

Education. — The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum sa- 
lary, a free house, and an allowance in lieu of garden ground. 
He is also session clerk. The school-fees are — reading, 2s. ; 
writing, 2s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 3s. ;— the higher branches in propor- 
tion. There is a private school in the village of Rait, the teacher 
of which is supported by the fees, and by voluntary subscription. 
The people are in general alive to the benefits of education, and 
manifest a laudable desire to have their children instructed in the 
useful branches. 

Library. — A library, consisting of more than 300 volumes, has 
been in the parish for upwards of thirty years. It is chiefly com- 
posed of biographical, historical, and religious works. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial re- 
lief is about 8. The average weekly allowance to each varies 
from Is. 6d. to 3s. besides a yearly supply of coals of 2£ bolls.

The collections at church, including mortcloth and marriage dues, 
amount yearly to L.25. Any deficiency is made up by contribu- 
tions from the heritors. 

Inns. — There are two public-houses in the parish. 

Fuel — The only fuel used, except small quantities of brush- 
wood, is sea-borne coal.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. WILLIAM C. ROSE, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Cargill takes its name from Caer, signifying in the 
Celtic language a village, and Cill, a place of worship, or burial. 
It was formerly called the W est Parish, and is said to have been 
part of the parish of Cupar of Angus, but has long since been 
disjoined from that, and erected into a distinct parochial district. 
Bishop Spottiswood mentions, that, as far back as the year 1514, 
Andrew Stuart, brother to John Earl of Athole, got the benefices 
of Cargill and Alyth. 

, Situation, 8fc. — This parish is situated in the large vale of Strath- 
more, and is bounded on the north, by the river Isla ; on the 
north-east, by the parish of Coupar- Angus; on the east, by Ket- 
tins ; on the south-east, by Collace ; on the south, by St Martins ; 
and on the west and north-west, by the river Tay. 

Extent, fyc. — It extends from west to east about 6 miles, 
and from north to south about 4, — on an average, forming 
nearly an oblong square. This parish exhibits a surface diver- 
sified by wood and water, and variegated by ascents and de- 
clivities. Rising gradually in the form of a ridge for about a mile 
from the river Tay, it reaches a plain of near four miles in 
breadth, which, with some unevennesses, it preserves till it comes 
to the Sidla hills, which form part of its eastern boundary. 
Excepting the woodlands, it is mostly all arable. The soil is 
extremely various and different. In the lower part of the parish, 



1168 



PERTHSHIRE. 



along the banks of the river, it is a wet rnortary clay, which 
produces strong crops ; inclining as you rise in elevation to a rock 
marl, which is cold and unproductive. The level grounds on the 
top of the ridge are partly loamy and partly moorish. Towards 
the foot of the hills, the soil is a light dry gravel. 

Rivers, Woods, Hills. — The river Tay forms the west and north- 
west boundary of this parish, and abounds with salmon, trout, and 
pike. Near the west end of the parish, this river forms what is called 
the Linn of Campsey, by falling over a rugged basaltic dike, 
which crosses the water at this place, and is found to extend in a 
right line many miles to the east and west of the Tay. At the dis- 
tance of twenty miles westward, Drummond castle stands on a simi- 
lar rock, which is supposed to be a continuation of the same range. 
The most romantic and magnificent views on the Tay are in this 
parish. About half a mile above the village of Cargill, the river 
Isla runs into the Tay. The fisheries of this parish are of consi- 
derable value, those on the Tay especially, being considered se- 
cond to none in the kingdom for rod- fishing. 

Minerals. — Several quarries of freestone of an excellent qua- 
lity, and good colour, have been wrought to a considerable extent. 
Limestone also is to be found, and might, it is said, be wrought 
to great advantage. Rock marl of a reddish colour is found here 
in great abundance. Little use has hitherto been made of it as a 
manure ; but it is thought that it would be of service to the light 
moorish grounds in the upper part of the parish.

Land-owners. — These, with their respective valuations, are as 
follows :

Antiquities. — There are several tumuli in this parish, in some 
of which, when opened, human bones have been found, and near 
them the remains of some military weapons. Druidical temples also 
have been discovered in different places. Near the confluence of the 
Tay and Isla, and exactly opposite to the ancient castle of Kin- 
claven on the other side of the river, are discovered plain vestiges 

 About fifty years ago.au attempt was made to find coal ; but after much labour, 
and not a little expense, the project was abandoned from want of the necessary funds

of a Roman station, now called the Castlehill ; on one side, this 
encampment is defended by the steep banks of the Tay ; on an- 
other, by a deep ravine ; a high breast-work and strong entrench- 
ments guard it on all other sides where it was accessible. 
The fossae are perfectly discernible, and the aqueduct by which 
they were filled from a neighbouring rivulet, is still in high pre- 
servation ; but the site of this encampment is now converted into 
a corn-field — Et seges est ubi Troja fuit. In this camp, accord- 
ing to Bcethius, the Romans took up their winter-quarters under 
Tribellius, after Agricola left him, and preserved their communi- 
cation with other detachments of their troops who had advanced 
farther into the country, towards the foot of the Grampians. 
Upon the top of a high rock which rises perpendicular above the 
Linn of Campsey, in a most romantic situation, stand the ruins of 
an old religious house, dependent on the Abbey of Cupar. Next 
to our Kings, the Hays of Errol were the principal benefactors 
of this monastery, and some stones picked up from the ruins 
still bear the arms of that family. Stobhall, a seat of the family 
of Perth, is situated on the banks of the Tay in this parish. It 
is an old fabric, most fancifully situated on a narrow tongue of 
high land, and seems to have been built at different times and 
on different plans. It has been in the possession of the family of 
Perth since the year 1360, when Sir John Drummond, by marry- 
ing Lady Mary, the eldest daughter and coheiress of Sir William 
de Montifex, Justiciar of Scotland, and head of a most ancient 
family, with her obtained the lands of Cargill and Stobhall, 
which then became the designation of the family. A Roman 
road or paved way runs along the high grounds in this parish, 
which deserves particular notice. This road, which is about twenty 
feet broad, and composed of rough round stones rudely laid together, 
can be plainly traced from Innerpeffry, through the parish of 
Gask, where there is a camp, to Duplin : from thence to Ber- 
tha, few vestiges of it can be discovered. About a quarter of a 
mile above Bertha, which seems to have been a Roman station 
from the number of urns that have been discovered there, a 
ridge of stones, which extend far into the river, and a great num- 
ber of large oak trees, which have been dug up there, and many 
of which still remain in the water, give strong appearances of a 
military Roman bridge over the Tay there. From thence the 
road is to be traced to Rome, which probably got its name at 
that time, passed Sherifftown and Innerbuist, where there is a

large camp and several tumuli, through the parish of St Martin's 
to Byres, keeping the ridge of the hill through the estate of Stob- 
hall; and passing near Gallowhill, where it is very discernible, it 
bends its course to the Isla at Windyedge, where the remains of 
another military bridge are distinctly to be traced, and the houses 
adjacent to which are still known to the old residenters by the 
name of Bridgend. This bridge seems to have communicated 
with different Roman stations which are to be seen on different 
places on the extensive plain on the other side of the river towards 
Blairgowrie, where the Romans fought a bloody battle with the 
united armies of the Caledonians and Picts. When this military 
road was made is uncertain ; probably by the army at Ardoch, to 
preserve a communication between their different camps, and as 
convenient for their after marches, had they conquered the coun- 
try. Old Statistical Account. 

Eminent Persons. — The family of Drummond, which has always 
been ranked among the most ancient and illustrious of the Scottish 
nation, and who had for a long time their chief residence here, 
gave birth to many characters, not more distinguished by their 
high stations than by their personal merit ; among a variety of 
these which might be specified, the brevity of this sketch per- 
mits only one to be mentioned. Annabella Drummond, daughter 
of Sir John Drummond and Lady Mary Montefix. She was a 
lady of the most exquisite beauty and distinguished accomplish- 
ments, and had the honour of being married to Robert III. King 
of Scotland, and crowned at Scone with him in the month of Sep- 
tember 1390. She was the ornament of the Court of which she 
was the Queen; and her death about the year 140J, was con- 
sidered and lamented as a public loss. Queen Annabella was 
mother to James I. King of Scotland, and from her are lineally 
descended all the royal race of the Stuarts. 

_ " Near the village of Cargill were, until lately, to be seen some erect stones of con- 
siderable magnitude, having the figure of the moon and stars cut out on them, and 
probably the rude remains of Pagan superstition. The corn field where these stones 
stood is called the Moonshade to this day, or Moonstane Butts. 

There are several round artificial little hills or conical mounds, in this parish cat- 
led Laws, particularly one at Lawton, the property of James Wright, Esq which 
as it is situated in the near neighbourhood of Macbeth's Castle, on Dunsinnan hill, is 
said to have been the place where Macbeth dispensed laws and settled differences 
among his subjects. 

Near the village of Gallowhill is a field called the Gallowshade, which was a place 
of execution under the feudal system, and in a field about a hundred yards north from 
the school house is a well, said to have been used by the executioner for washing his 
hands after being engaged in his bloody work, and which still goes by the name of 
" Hangie's Wall."

Agriculture. — Most of the recent agricultural improvements 
have been introduced into this parish. Much, however, still re- 
mains to be done. The land being generally of a cold damp bot- 
tom, thorough draining must be resorted to before thorough pro- 
ductiveness can be expected.

122, which, added together, amount to nearly half the population 
of the entire parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church of Cargill, which was 
erected in 1831, is a neat substantial fabric, without ornament, 
stands on the banks of the Tay, at the base of a sloping bank, and 
is unseen until close upon it. The manse stands adjacent, and is 
one of the most delightful parsonages in the country. The amount 
of the stipend is L. 224, 9s. ; value of the glebe per annum, L.14. 
There is a chapel at Burrelton. 

Education. — The parochial teacher's salary is the maximum. 
Besides, he has L.10 per annum from Lady Willoughby d'Eres- 
by for teaching the poor gratis ; and in addition to all, has 
a glebe of about three acres Scots. There are two private schools, 
— one at Burrelton, the other at Woodside. 

Poor. — The average number of poor of all classes is 37. The 
average annual amount of church door collections for their be- 
hoof is L.14. Besides, there is a legal assessment for their sup- 
port which has been in force for three years. Total expenditure 
for poor last year, L 158, 13s. 4d.

PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. R. J. ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

This parish is composed of three widely detached portions. 
The middle part, in which is the village of Forteviot, in the val- 
ley of the Earn, situated on both banks of that river, is bounded 
on the north by Tibbermoor : on the east, by Aberdalgie on 
the north side of the Earn, and by Forgandenny on the south 
side ; by Forgandenny on the south ; by Gask on the west, north 
of the river, and by Dunning south of it. This division is the 
largest. A smaller portion, lying in the Ochils, is bounded on 
the east by Arngask ; south, by Orwell ; north and west, by For- 
gandenny. A still smaller part lies on the east of Aberdalgie, 
bounded by it on the west ; by Dumbarnie on the east ; by the 
Earn on the south ; and by the East Parish of Perth on the north. 
The first and last portions are fertile, highly cultivated, and richly 
wooded ; the other, in the Ochils, comprehends some of the dis- 
tinguished summits belonging to the northern division of that well- 
known ridge of mountains, and is chiefly in the hands of the pro- 
prietors, small lairds, each farming and improving his own land. 

Rivers. — The river Earn or Earne flows across the breadth of the 
parish, from west to east. It frequently overflows its banks, and is 
thereby the occasion of great damage to the low grounds through 
which it runs. The May is a rivulet that takes its origin among the 
Ochil-hills, at the distance of about eight miles from the Earn, into 
which, after a greatly variegated course, it is lost. The water and 
banks of the May exhibit some natural curiosities, that deservedly 
attract the attention of strangers. The Humble Bumble, in parti- 
cular, is extremely remarkable. This name is given to a narrow 
course which the water has cut for itself a considerable way through 
a rock, the sides of which meet almost together, especially near 
the top. This passage is both deep and dark. A rumbling noise, 



FORTEVIOT.

which the water makes in its passage through it, is believed to 
have given rise to the name by which this remarkable place is 
known. A little above the Humble Bumble is the Linn of Muck- 
arsey, about thirty feet perpendicular, which, when the water is 
high, and comes foaming from the hills, exhibits a beautiful cas- 
cade. The banks of the May, and several other places in the pa- 
rish, abound with plants not frequently to be met with, as the Li- 
thospermum officinale, Astragalus uralensis, &amp;c. a great many of 
which have been discovered by Lieutenant- Colonel Murray Bel- 
shes, brother of the proprietor of Invermay, and an eminent florist. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — This parish affords not a little matter for the in- 
quiries of the antiquary. Here, it is said, was the residence of 
some of the kings of the Picts in remote periods j and here King 
Kenneth, after the Pictish kingdom was annihilated, departed this 
life, as narrated in the MSS. of Melross, and Andreas Vintonius, 
who wrote in the time of Robert Duke of Albany. 

Halyhill, near the present church, was the summer residence 
of Malcolm Canmore, and others of the Scottish kings, who 
granted many charters from this place. At certain distances 
from the palace were erected large stones, by way of pillars ; 
as the Standing-stane of Bankhead and Cross of Dronochy. Se- 
veral urns and stone-coffins, with fragments of human bones, 
were found some years ago in different parts of the parish. The 
mill of Forteviot, and the Coblehaugh, mentioned by Andrew 
Wyntoun, yet remain. At Coblehaugh was the boat for ferrying 
over the Earn. The miller's daughter was mother to Malcolm 
Canmore. 

The Halyhill, as it is commonly called, a small eminence at the 
west end of Forteviot, was once the site of a royal residence, first, 
it would appear, of the Pictish, and afterwards of some of the 
Scottish kings. Here Kenneth II., having reigned in peace six- 
teen years, after revenging the death of his father Alpin, whom 
the Picts beheaded, by exterminating that people, and entirely 
subjugating their territory, died of a fistula. This place seems to 
have been a favourite residence of King Malcolm Canmore, and 
many charters are said to bear date from it. Near to this place, 
Edward Baliol encamped his army, 31st July 1332, on the Mil- 
ler's Acre, immediately before the bloody battle of Duplin. There 
is a stone cross, quite entire, a good way up the rising ground

north from the ford by which Ballot's army crossed the river ; and 
another on the south of Forteviot, upon a rising ground, called 
Dronachy, lying broken over at the pedestal, on which are many 
emblematical figures. About half-a-mile north from the first of 
these, a large tumulus or cairn was opened about thirty years 
ago, by the people repairing a road in the neighbourhood, and in 
it were found some coffins formed of rough flat stones, containing 
many fragments of bones, and some trinkets in various figures, of 
a vitrified substance and blackish colour ; and, a few years ago, 
some urns were dug up at the west boundary of the parish, when 
the road was repairing between Invermay and Dunning. 

The ruinous buildings on the Halyhill were visited as an object 
of curiosity, so late as the reign of Charles I. ; but nothing now 
remains of these buildings, and only a part of the eminence where- 
on they stood, as the water of May, by undermining below, is con- 
tinually washing away less or more of the rubbish. The King's 
Haugh, a little east from the place, still retains the name. Tra- 
dition informs us, that some houses in the neighbourhood have 
been built, or rebuilt, of the stones of the palace at Halyhill ; and 
some of these are easily distinguished by the antiquated figures cut 
thereon, in the possession of Lord Ruthven.

Mansion- House. — Invermay House, the residence of the old 
family of Belshes, is the only mansion in the parish. It is a mo- 
dern structure, plain and neat, beautifully situated on a risina- 
ground overhanging the May a rivulet that takes its rise among 
the Ochils, flows through the length of the grounds, and intersects 
them in its course and commanding an extensive view of the ro- 
mantic and picturesque scenery around, and of the rich vale of 
the winding Earn. The walls of the ivy-clad tower, all that re-

mains of the ancient residence, now bearing all the marks of a 
complete ruin, although a few of the apartments are still entire, 
contrast strikingly with the light and handsome appearance of the 
modern building very near it. About a mile above the house, 
near the banks of the May, is the burying-place of the family, 
called the " Chapel of Muckersey." In former times, it was used 
as the church of Muckersey before the union of that parish with 
the parish of Forteviot. The approach to it is tastefully formed, 
lined on each side with fine trees, and well kept. The whole 
policy of Invermay, in addition to the beauties of nature, is laid 
out with such exquisite taste, and kept in such excellent order, 
that it is a great attraction to all strangers, and especially to those 
at Pitcaithly Wells, who are once a-week permitted to visit this 
delightful spot. 

Parochial Registers.— There is a register of births, commencing 
in 1710 ; and, excepting a blank from 1713 to 1720, it has been 
regularly kept from that time to the present.

Agriculture. — Draining is now carried on to a very considerable 
extent, and is evidently producing great improvement in agricul- 
ture. The whole of the lands in the lower parts of the parish 
are well farmed. The farms are large, and the farmers are men 
of capital. Among the farm-servants, the bothy system univer- 
sally prevails, and is attended here, as everywhere, with a demo- 
ralizing effect.

Education. — The salary of the parochial teacher is L.34, 4s. 4d., 
and in lieu of a garden he has L. 2, 2s. 9d. He has also L.3 as

THE REV. J. S. BARTY, MINISTER. 



• — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of this parish has been written variously, 
In the parochial registers the following different spellings occur : 
In 1642, Bendochie; in 1692, the same; in 1704, Bennathie; 
in 1731, Bendochie; in 1760, Bendochy. On the communion 
cups the inscription is Bendothy, a. d. 1786. This last spelling 
is clearly unwarrantable, and without authority, as far as can be 
discovered, and apparently has been adopted from a mistaken 
reading of Bendochy, which is so written in the parish records 
sometimes as to resemble Bendothy. Bennethy or Benathy best 
" expresses the vulgar pronunciation at the place, and also the 
etymology Nether-Hill," Old Statistical Account. In this lat- 
ter remark I cannot agree with my predecessor. I do not believe 
that there can be any good precedent for such a hybrid, such a 
compound of Gaelic and Saxon, as the conjecture of the former 
statist supposes ; while the existence of two hills implied in the 
etymology seems in a great measure imaginary. Bendochie ap- 
pears the most ancient and correct spelling ; but it has been found 
very difficult to ascertain the true import of the name, arising from 
the great uncertainty of Gaelic etymology. The curious in such 
matters are referred to a note below. 

An ingenious and learned friend writes me as follows : «« I suppose the name to 
be a compound of three Gaelic syllables, Ben, a hill, do, a verbal particle prefixed to 
the preterite or future, and chi, the future of the verb to see. Ben-do-chi the hill 
of the good prospect." The rising ground on the southern base of which the church 
and manse stand is midway betwixt the Sidlaw Southlaw and Grampian ranees 
and equidistant from Forfar and Perth, the limits of Strathmore proper. The view 
from it is extensive, varied, and beautiful. « It would with the same meanine " 
adds my correspondent, « admit of being written Ben-a-chi, or Ben-a thi " This is 
fortunate, giving authority for the supposed vulgar pronunciation of the natives 
and meeting to some extent the predilections of my predecessor for « Benathie " But 
what is to be done with « Bendothy," the spelling on the communion cups, and retain- 
ed by the writer of the former account  Here is the solution—" Ta is old Gaelic for 
water, The Tay is water par excellence. Ben-do or da- tha would be the hill of two waters " 
"Do or da means two, and tha would be the objective case of Ta." The rising ground

Extent, Divisions, fyc. — This parish lies towards the eastern 
boundary of Perthshire, and the church stands in north latitude 
56° 33", and longitude 5' from Edinburgh, being two miles from 
Coupar- Angus, nearly fifteen miles from Perth, and seventeen 
from Dundee. As an approximation to the truth it may be stated, 
that the whole extent of the parish is in imperial acres 10,000, in 
square miles 16. The length of that part of the parish which is 
contiguous is about 7 miles, and its greatest breadth about \ miles. 
The parish consists of two great divisions, the highland and low- 
land, and each of these again admits of a very natural subdivision. 

The lowland part of the parish is divided into two nearly equal 
parts by the river Ericht. That portion lying west of the Ericht, 
in which the church, manse, and school-house are situated, is se- 
parated from the parish of Coupar-Angus on the south by the river 
Isla, with the exception of a small slip of land belonging to the estates 
of Bendochy and Mudhall, which is on the south of the Isla; while 
on the north and west it is bounded by the parish of Blairgowrie. 
It consists chiefly of a ridge sloping gradually upon the one side 
towards the Isla, and on the other towards the Monk Mire. Its 
greatest height may be 90 feet above the level of the Isla, and 190 
above the level of the sea. The summit and sides of this rising 
ground are varied by gentle undulations, and there is a good deal 
of perfectly level ground along the banks of the Isla, and towards 
the confluence of the Ericht and Isla. The other part of the 
lowland division of the parish lying eastward of the Ericht, after 
stretching out into a level haugh from the banks of the Ericht 
and Isla, rises with a gradual ascent, and finally forms a part of 
the frontier of the Grampians. The highest part of this ridge 
may be 800 feet above the level of the sea. It is bounded on the 
east and north, by the parish of Alyth ; on the west, by Rattray ; 
and on the south the Isla flows betwixt it and the parish of Cou- 
par-Angus. 

Betwixt the Highland and lowland divisions of the parish, the 
two parishes of Rattray and Blairgowrie intervene ; and that part 
of the Highland division which is nearest to the parish church is 
about eight miles distant, while its remotest point is upwards of 
thirteen miles off. The Highland division is bisected by a small 
portion of the parish of Blairgowrie. It is thus not only widely 

why called a bill I know not is bounded on the north by the Monk Mire, and on 
the south by the Isla; or the church is on the base of the eminence, bounded on 
two sides by the Isla and Ericht. Select for yourself, reader, and acknowledge 
with thankfulness the plastic powers of Gaelic etymology

separated from the lowland division, but consists itself of two dis- 
tinct parts. The western portion of this part of the parish lies in 
the angle of confluence between the Ardle and Blackwater. The 
Ardle separates it on the south from the parishes of Blairgowrie 
and Kinloch ; and the Blackwater, on the east and north, from 
the parishes of Blairgowrie and Alyth. On the west, it is bounded 
by the parish of Kirkmichael; and on the north-west, by a small 
dissevered portion of Caputh parish. It consists of an elevated 
ridge, ascending more or less abruptly from the banks of the two 
rivers, and having its northern terminus in the hill of Persie, the 
highest locality in the parish, being probably 1400 feet above the 
level of the sea. On the banks of the Ardle at Cally, there is 
some arable soil. The arable portion on the Blackwater is chiefly, 
the elevated flat at Persie, which is considerably higher than that 
on the Ardle; and, from this cause, and the character of the sub- 
soil, the crops are considerably later there than at Cally. The 
valley of the Ardle Strathardle runs nearly due east, while that 
of the Blackwater, with its parallel ridge, comprising this portion 
of the parish, runs nearly due south. The other portion of the 
Highland division of the parish, and which is not marked in the 
map of Perthshire in this ivork, being the estate of Drimmie, is a 
large shoulder of hilly ground, composed of two parallel wavy 
ridges. It lies on the left bank of the Ericht, being the united 
waters of the Ardle and Blackwater, and about half a mile below 
their junction ; and it is embraced on the south and west, by the 
parish of Blairgowrie ; and on the east and north, by the parishes 
of Rattray and Alyth. 

Meteorology. — I regret that I have taken no observations with 
the barometer or thermometer with such care and regularity as 
to be worth recording. It may be mentioned, that in the severe 
winter of 1837-8, the mercury in the thermometer stood as low 
here, perhaps, as in any district in Scotland. On the 3d of Fe- 
bruary, at 8 o'clock a. m., it stood at zero. On Thursday the 15th, 
a memorably cold day, it ranged from from 8° to 5° below zero 
betwixt six and eight o'clock a. m. On the morning of that day, 
water spilt in a bed-room, in which there had been constant fire 
night and day for ten days previously, almost instantly congealed. 
The effects of the long-continued intensity of the cold were re- 
markable. Partridges became so enfeebled as scarcely to be able 
to fly ; and wood-pigeons, which had become very numerous and 
very troublesome to the farmer, were all but exterminated. I saw

them shot at, as they were feeding upon the tops of the turnips, 
and though some of them fell dead, others beside them kept their 
position unscared, so completely had the rigors of the season 
altered the nature of this shy and chary bird. On the vegetable 
world, the effects of the cold were even more remarkable. Lau- 
rels and bays, of twenty years' standing, were cut to the ground. 
The Laurus nobilis, arbutus, and Laurestinus were killed. The 
native holly and common whin, in very many cases, were destroyed. 
There have been as severe winters which were followed by no such 
effects; nor is it to the intensity of the cold alone that the whole 
destruction is to be ascribed. Up to the beginning of January, 
the weather had been unusually genial and warm. On the 8th of 
January, a sudden and decisive change took place. At that time, 
the trees were perhaps as far advanced as they generally are in 
March. The sudden transition was fatal. The violent expansion 
caused by the intense frost burst the tender vesicles containing the 
sap, and vegetable life was destroyed. Plants in warm and shel- 
tered situations, being more forward, were injured most; and in 
more elevated and exposed localities, evergreens suffered less, not 
probably because the season there was less severe, but because, 
being later, they were better prepared for enduring it. As a 
counterpart to the severe winter of 1838, and as by far the most 
remarkable season that has occurred since the last Statistical Ac- 
count was written, the extremely hot and dry season of 1826 may 
be mentioned. That vear, the harvest commenced on the 14th 
of July, and finished with the month. 

The antagonist winds are the west and east, and the lie of the 
trees seems to indicate that the former prevails. The east wind 
is generally accompanied with rain, except in the spring months. 
In the months of March and October, we have generally two or 
three days of a strong dry gale from the north. In a wet har- 
vest, a breeze off Loch Brandy, due north, goes through stack 
and stook, and cheers the farmer's heart. 

From the difference of elevation and geographical position, the 
climate, as might be expected, is various. The climate of the 
lower part of the parish where the manse is situated, is probably 
as good as any in Scotland. The incessant rains which deluge 
the western shores of the island are unknown here, while, on the 
other hand, the cold eastern winds are broken and modified by 
the intervening barrier of the Sidlaw hills. The eastern haars t so 
annoying to the invalid, seldom penetrate into our comparatively

inland position. We observe them filling the opposite valleys in 
the Sidlaw range, and pausing there as if their commission went no 
farther. Nature, however, confers her boons with no indiscrimi- 
nate hand, and it must be mentioned, what might be expected, 
that the hoar frosts are at once more frequent and copious here 
than in the more elevated parts of the parish. This, however, is 
the only meteorological advantage enjoyed by the Highland part 
of the parish, and forms a poor compensation for a longer winter, 
a colder spring, and a later harvest. Indeed, the northern parts 
of the parish are only a little removed from that truly Highland 
region, where scattered patches of potatoes and bear in the midst 
of surrounding barrenness, too plainly mark that man is strug- 
gling with a sterile soil, and a deteriorated climate. 

There are no diseases peculiar to the climate. 

Hydrography.— The Isla bounding the lower part of the parish 
on the south, runs with an insensible fall, and the stranger who sees 
it meandering gently and harmlessly " at its own sweet will," 
through the vale in summer weather. 

■ In many a winding bout, 

Of linked sweetness long drawn out, 

can scarcely imagine the altered form it assumes when autumnal 
rains or the melting snows of winter have roused the genius of 
the stream. At high floods, it rises thirteen or fourteen feet above 
its summer level. In 1774, it rose to within six inches of the top 
of the lowest arch at the bridge of Couttie, and on one occasion I 
saw it oozing over the top of the church-yard dike into the burv- 
ing ground. Below the church it is seventy-five yards broad, and 
at the ford there by which there is a right of road to Coupar- An- 
gus, is, in summer, three feet in depth. The Isla takes its rise 
in the Grampians, and runs south-east with a rapid current, un- 
til it is joined by the Dean from the Loch of Forfar, about seven 
miles to the east of this, after which its direction is south-west to 
the Tay, into which it falls at Kinclaven. The river Ericht, bi- 
secting the lowland part of the parish, debouches fiercely from the 
Grampians, and runs in a rapid and straight forward course until 
it reaches the middle of the great strath, where it falls into the 
Isla about one and a-half mile east of the church. It well merits 
its old name, " ireful Ericht," and although it loses its name the 
instant it joins the Isla, it nevertheless communicates to that river 
something of its own character, turning the torpid Isla into a brisk 
stream, and imbedding its channel for some way with gravel, of 

4

1181 



which, above their junction, the Isla for miles is altogether des- 
titute. After rains, the Ericht rises and subsides much more ra- 
pidly than the Isla. . The Ericht is composed of the united 
streams of the Blackwater and Ardle, which, as has been men- 
tioned, bound on two sides one division of the Highland district 
of the parish. The Monk Mire may be about a mile in circum- 
ference. Its size was diminished by a drain taken from it to the 
Ericht, for the purpose of facilitating the removal of the marl 
which it contained. The marl is supposed now to be exhausted. 
There are several chalybeate springs in the parish, particularly a 
very fine one in Persie hill, the healing virtue of whose waters it 
is said drew at one time pilgrims to it from afar. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — rThis parish includes in its geology 
rocks of the primitive, transition, and secondary series. In the 
lower part of the parish, we have the sandstone of that gray co- 
lour which is supposed to be of an earlier formation than the red 
sandstone. It is wrought at the hill of Couttie and Coupar- 
Grange, and in the quarries there no vegetable or animal im- 
pressions have been noticed. At Pictfield the sandstone is red, 
and a little farther up, at the hill of St Phink, it passes into con- 
glomerate. Below the house of St Phink, a dike of trap appears 
in juxtaposition with red sandstone. At Drimmie, the bed of 
transition clay-slate which crosses the island makes its appearance, 
and was at one time partially wrought. In the same neighbour- 
hood, a seam of Fuller's earth is to be found, and has been used 
for cleansing purposes. The rocks at Persie belong to the pri- 
mitive class. Erratic blocks of gneiss, mica-slate, granite, &amp;c. 
are found throughout the parish, and are gradually undergoing a 
second transportation to dikes and cottage walls. Limestone is 
not found in the parish, but in its vicinity near Persie and Tully- 
fergus. 

The low haughs on the estates of Bendochy, Coupar- Grange, 
and the Grange are evidently transported soils, being the alluvial 
deposit of a former era. In many places, they are of a clayey na- 
ture, but in them all at a certain depth, there is a substratum of 
sand keeping them dry, and rendering them capable of imbibing 
with impunity more moisture than much shallower soils. The as- 
cending fields rest on a basis of red clay mortar, keeping them 
wet, when not thoroughly drained,— and in some parts on gravel, 
and in the latter case, when there is sufficient depth of soil, the 
ground is extremely early and fertile. The lands of the Grange 



1 182

are of a tenacious whitish clay, generally incumbent on sand, and 
retain marks of old tracts of the Ericht. 

Zoology. — There is nothing very peculiar or interesting in the 
zoology of this parish. Among the rarer species of birds may be 
mentioned the Muscicapa grisola, the fly-catcher. A pair of these 
built, for many successive seasons, in the cleft of a weeping birch, 
immediately before the manse. A felonious squirrel plundered 
their nest three years ago, when they shifted their quarters to a 
jargonelle pear tree on the end of the manse. This bird has in- 
creased very much within these last fifteen years, and perhaps 
twenty pairs of them now may be found scattered throughout the 
warmer localities in Strathmore. It is the latest of all our sum- 
mer migrants, and is singularly punctual to its time, having arriv- 
ed for many years on the 31st of May. On the morning of that 
day, I now infallibly expect to be greeted by the appearance of this 
gentle mannered bird. The Haematopus ostralegus, the oyster- 
catcher, builds regularly on the gravelly banks of the Ericht, and 
yet ornithologists say, that " this bird is never found inland." I 
observe that Dr Fleming, in his British Animals, notices the 
error. We have flocks of Sturnus vulgaris, the starling, in au- 
tumn and winter, but a pair or two of these birds have for two or 
three seasons built in the cavities of some elm trees at Coupar- 
Grange. The Parus caudatus, the long-tailed titmouse, builds 
near the Strone of Cally, and the parents, with their brood, gene- 
rally a numerous one, keeping together until next spring, may be 
seen during autumn and winter flitting from tree to tree, — a happy 
family party. The Fringilla spinus, the siskin, is a frequent winter 
visitant, and I have noticed a distinctly marked variety of this 
bird. The Loxia curvirostra, the cross-bill, has of late years been 
frequent in our pine woods, and I have reason to suppose that they 
breed sometimes with us. The Regulus cristatus, the golden- 
crested wren, abounds in our woods, although at one time appa- 
rently rare. The Alcedo ispida, the kingfisher, is seen occa- 
sionally on the banks of our rivers, dazzling the patient angler with 
the brilliancy of its plumage. The Fringilla montiftingilla, com- 
mon. Emberiza nivalis, rare. Mergus merganser, frequent, and 
as stragglers may be mentioned, the Podiceps cristatus, and rubricol- 
lis, Anser ferus, Cygnusferus, and Aha Torda. Partridge and phea- 
sant are found, the former abundantly, and in the Highland part 

 See Bewick, and Wilson's American Ornithology, edited by Professor Jameson.

of the parish, grouse and blackcock. In the hill of Persie, the 
Tardus torquatus, the mountain ouzel, builds. The mountain 
ouzel, and the spotted flycatcher, I consider our ornithological ex- 
tremes, and the fact of their being found in the parish may indi- 
cate its variety of climate and altitude above the level of the sea, 
to the attentive student of ornithology. 

The fox, badger, otter, weasel, ermine, foumart, and squirrel 
are found in the parish, and rarely the Felissylvestris, or wild cat. 
The mole is nearly extirpated, but in its place another " miner of 
the soil," the rabbit, has made its appearance, and is multiplying 
rapidly. The common hare abounds, and sometimes the Lepus 
variabilis, alpine hare, is to be met with in the Highland part of 
the parish. The roe Cervus capreolus is frequent in the planta- 
tions on Persie hill where it breeds, and in the same neighbour- 
hood occasionally in the winter season, a red deer, Cervus Ela- 
phus, that has wandered from the herds of Caenlochan. 

In the Isla and Ericht the Salmo Salar, the common salmon, is 
found in considerable abundance ; the Salmo Trutta and Eriox 
more sparingly. New light has been lately shed on the natural 
history of the Salmonidaj by the discoveries of Shaw and Young, 
and the ichthyologists will require to alter their terminology to 
meet the new facts that have been elicited. The par, long of 
doubtful extraction, seems now, as the precursor of the samlet, to 
merit the protection of an act of Parliament. The Salmo Trutta 
and the S. Eriox frequent our streams, but not in great numbers. 
The common trout, pike, perch, and eel are found in our rivers, and 
very rarely the Petromyzon Jluviatilis, the river lamprey, and 
Platessa \Jtesus, or flounder. 

Botany. — 1 have examined with much care the phanerogamous 
botany of this parish, and believe that the following catalogue con- 
tains almost every plant found in it, of interest to the botanical col- 
lector. From its geological features, from its variety of climate and 
altitude above the level of the sea, the botanist will infer that its 
flora must necessarily be various and extensive. If he will add to 
it the adjoining parish of Coupar Angus, in which five or six plants 
occur not found in this parish, he will have the botany of a sec- 
tion of country extending from the base of the Sidlaws, across 
the valley of Strathmore, and over the first tier of the Grampian 
range. It may be considered important, as embracing the vegeta- 
tion of a large central district in Strathmore, the botanical trea- 
sures of which have, as far as I know, never been recorded. In

drawing up his catalogue of Angus-shire plants, Don's researches do 
not seem to have extended so far westward. To the east of this 
his practised eye has left little to be discovered by future observ- 
ers. I give the plants not in Linnean order, but as the botanist 
would find them, were he to perambulate this parish, beginning at 
its western extremity. At Hill of Couttie, near the boundary of 
the parish, the Hieracium sylvaticum, a rare plant in Strathmore ; 
and in the fields on the same farm, the Dianthus deltoides. On 
the arable gravelly soil at Mayriggs, Teesdalia nudicaulis and 
Cerastium arvense ; and on the moorish pastures the Vicia angus- 
tifolia and Astragalus hypoglottis. Along the margin of the 
Monk Mire, the Radiola millegrana, Bidens cernua, and Saxi- 
fraga aizoides. Botanists seem to have supposed that this latter 
plant was to be found exclusively in subalpine regions. The 
Monk Mire is not probably above 150 feet above the level of the 
sea. No Alpine stream runs into it, and yet this saxifrage grows 
in great abundance on its western shore, flowering a month earlier 
than in the Highland part of the parish. The Epilobium hirsutum 
grows in the drain leading from the Monk Mire, and is by no 
means common in this quarter. In the dry fields about the manse 
the Ornithopus perpusillus is very abundant, and very fine. In 
the churchyard the Hyoscyarnus niger occasionally appears. In 
ditches on the farm of Knowhead, Lythrum Salicaria ; and in the 
fields on that farm, Lepidium campestre and Smithii. Along the 
banks of the Isla I have gathered the Aira ccespitosa in a viviparous 
state. In the Isla the predominant pond-weed is the Potamogeton 
perfoliatum, and on its banks the Scirpus sylvaticus grows. About 
Coupar- Grange, the Barbarea vulgaris ; at Ryehill, the Chelido- 
nium majus. On the banks of the Ericht, the Trollius Euro- 
peans, Silene maritima, and Chrysosplenium alter nifolium. Like- 
wise the Galium boreale. I have found this plant, however, in 
the neighbourhood not near any river, and in other similar loca- 
lities, and am convinced that it does not possess that exclusively 
alpine character which the books give it. In the island below 
the Boat pool, the Veronica montana, Adoxa moschaiellina, Stellaria 
nemorum, and Campanula latifolia grow. On the road sides, above 
Cotyards, there is a patch of the Galium erectum ; at Greymount, 
Smyrnium Olusatrum ; and at Hill of St Phink, Pyrola minor, and 
Trientalis Europcza, very large and fine. In the Highland part of 
the parish the vegetation is of a subalpine type, the Alchemilla 
alpina, Viola lutea, Mevm athamanticum y Sesleria ccerulea, Poly-

gonum vioiparum, and several of the upland car ices appearing in 
the pastures. The Hippuris vulgaris is found in a small pool on 
the left hand of the road leading to Kirkmichael. The marsh has 
been drained, and the plant is rapidly disappearing. The Habe- 
naria viridis grows sparingly on the pastures east of the Strone, 
and H. albida plentifully there and elsewhere. In the same loca- 
lity the H. bifolia is abundant, and the variety H. chlorantha see 
Transactions of Botanical Society, Edinburgh. Entering on the 
left bank of the river at Bridge of Cally, the Primula elatior and 
veris will be found in great plenty : and on the bank of the Black- 
water, that very rare and elegant plant the Convallaria verticillata, 
which I discovered seven years ago. It is to be found, I believe, 
in only three other stations in Britain. Some straggling plants of 
it may also be seen above the bridge of Strone, where the collector 
may likewise gather the Vicia sylvatica, the Circcea lutetiana, and 
alpina, the Melampyrum praten.se and sylv aticum, the Melica nu- 
tans and uni/lora, and the Listera ovata. On knolls, at the 
base of Persie Hill, the Listera cordata may be seen along with 
the Pyrola media ; and near the top of the hill I once gathered 
some plants, of what I convinced myself at the time was the Py- 
rola rotundifolia. On dry rocks at Drimmie, Myosotis collina ; 
and on the banks of the Ericht there are the Epilobium angusti- 
folium and Festuca elatior. I have gathered in the parish also 
the Festuca bromoides, Brumus secalinus, and the Lolium temulentum, 
and the Prunella vulgaris, Veronica serpyllifulia, and Pedicularis 
palustrisy with white flowers. It is important to add, that some 
plants having a very general distribution are not to be found in the 
parish or district, such as the Lamium album and Brornus sterilis, 
while others, of which some localities seem all but destitute-, 
abound, such as the Sedum Telephium. On the banks of our 
rivers as is always the case plants occasionally may be picked up 
not indigenous to the soil, — such as on the Ericht, the Oxyria re- 
mformis, evidently a migrant from a more elevated region, and 

It is with some hesitation that we have mentioned the habitat of this interest- 
ing plant ; and we hope that the young gentlemen who is6ue every autumn from our 
seats of learning will use their botanical trowels tenderly, when they visit the banks 
of the Blaekwater. At the original station in the Den of Rechip this plant is all 
but extirpated. The reason of its disappearance is no mystery. The country is an- 
nually overrun with hordes of hcrborizers from the south and west, who, instead of 
contenting themselves with a specimen, root up, without remorse, the rarest treasures, 
leaving, locust like, nothing for those who succeed them. We implore our learned 
friend, the Professor of Botany at Glasgow, to restrain the herbivorous appetites of the 
rising generation. If matters proceed at the rate they have been doing for some time 
past, nothing but docks and nettles will be left in the land.

transported from its alpine home by the torrents of winter. I have 
made some progress in ascertaining the Cryptogamic plants 
of the parish, but will content myself with stating that, of 
sixteen Filices identified, the Botrychium lunaria grows in the 
moorish pastures around the Monk Mire, and that the Crypto- 
gramma crispa occurs in three several stations, viz. among loose 
rocks on Persie Hill, out of the dike on the road side, a mile 
south of Persie church, and in a similar locality at Hill of St 
Phink. Of the Fungi, it may be mentioned that an exceedingly 
minute one appeared on the corns in 1835 when ripe, com- 
pletely blackening them, alarming the farmer, but, as it turned out, 
quite unnecessarily. It seemed to be the Cladosporium herbarum. 
As a contrast to the above, it may be added that, in 1836, I found 
below the manse a specimen of the Bovista gigantea, measuring 
4 feet 8 inches in circumference, and 1 foot 8 inches in diameter. 
This enormous specimen equals those mentioned by the French 
botanist, Bulliard. — See his Herbier de la France. 

II. — Civil History. 

I know of no ancient or modern account of the history of this 
parish, saving that in the Old Statistical Account, which is a va- 
luable and interesting paper. The notices of the parish in ga- 
zetteers, &amp;c. are very inaccurate. 

Eminent Characters. — The Right Honourable Lord Wharncliffe, 
Lord President of the Privy Council, the proprietor of Bendochy, 
deserves to be noticed here, although his seat, Belmont Castle, 
is in the parish of Meigle. He is as much beloved by his te- 
nantry for his liberality and kindness, as he is respected by the 
nation for his patriotic labours in the Senate. 

The late Principal Playfair of St Andrews, author of the Chro- 
nology, &amp;c, was a native of the parish ; and likewise the Rev. 
J. Plavfair, the writer of the former Statistical Account, who was 
an ingenious man. He had a large apiary, and had studied with 
great care the natural history of the bee. He drew up some ac- 
count of his discoveries, and remitted it to London for publication. 
It fell into the hands of a piratical bookseller, who, it is under- 
stood, turned it to some account for his own behoof. Mr Play- 
fair's successor, the Rev. J. Honey, was remarkable for his gi- 
gantic stature and immense strength, and for his daring and he- 
roic feat at St Andrews, when a very young man, in rescuing from 
a watery grave five shipwrecked mariners, at the imminent hazard 
of his own life.

Chief Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, Patrick Mur- 
ray, Esq. of Simprim ; Lord Wharneliffe ; George Kinloch, Esq. of 
Kinloch ; Sir James Ramsay, Bart, of BamrF; and Colonel W. 
Macdonald of Powderhall. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are contained in 
seven volumes. The earliest date of the baptism register is 23d 
January 1642. It has been regularly kept, with the exception of 
a blank from 12th May 1695, to 29th December 1700. The 
proceedings of session commence with. ] 1th September 1692, 
and are continued regularly to this date, with the exception of 
some omissions in the end of last century, and beginning of this. 
The marriage register begins in 1700, and the record of procla- 
mation of banns has been regularly kept. There is no register 
of deaths. The minutes of session in the end of the seventeenth, 
and more especially during the beginning of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, give curious proof of the rigid discipline, and somewhat in- 
quisitorial surveillance exercised by the ecclesiastical guardians of 
the people in those days. The following selections throw light 
on the history of the period. Regarding one offender, " the ses- 
sion thouyat fitt to bring him in sackcloth, and cause him acknow- 
ledge his guilt on his knees." And regarding another, she ap- 
pears for the twentieth time before the congregation on the stool 
of repentance. Again, T. B. " being examined anent what was 
alleged anent his stricking Thomas Craigie a boy on the Sab- 
bath day, answered that the said Thomas threw in a stone among 
the children, and that he went out and only shot him over, he 
being removed, the members after discoursing of it, thought fitt to 

dismiss him with the session rebook." Again, the laird of 

having been cited, appeared, and being asked whether he did 
" scandalously go out on the fast day with his gun," answered, 
" that he went out only to fleg the tod from his sheep." He 
was dismissed with the session rebuke. It would seem that some 
of the elders were appointed occasionally to perambulate the pa- 
rish during the time of divine service, for the purpose of disco- 
vering who were absent from public worship, and how they were 
occupied. Notwithstanding such vigilance, the records contain 
melancholy proof, that, in this parish at least, these were not "the 
purest times" of the church. The limits of civil and ecclesiastical 
jurisdiction seem, at this period, not to have been much better under- 
stood than now. Thus, " received from G. B. 2 lib. 9sh., with 
other 9. lib. paid by him before to the session, is accepted as sa-

tisfaction for his daughter's resiling from purpose of marriage with 
one A. B., after the publication of the banns." An assault, in 172 J, 
of a very extraordinary nature, having been committed on the 
person of a servant by his master, the case was taken up by the 
civil magistrate. The master, however, was cited before the ses- 
sion. He appeared and gave in a paper, which he called " a de- 
clinator," having in company with him Mr Charles Hay, writer in 
Cupar. The declining their jurisdiction seems greatly to .have 
provoked the session, and, " having considered the whole matter, 
the insolent carriage of the said W. R., in presuming to decline 
this judicatory, his bringing in a public notar on the Lord's day,' 
&amp;c, u they did and hereby do refer the samen to the reverend 
presbytery of Miggle to determine therein, in such a way as may 
either make the said W. R. obsequious to discipline, or bring him 
under ecclesiastical censure," &amp;c. It is not recorded whether the 
presbytery rendered the said W. R. " obsequious." " There is no- 
thing new," saith the wise man, " under the sun." 

Antiquities. — Very nearly the whole of this parish was abbey 
lands, and the property of the ecclesiastics belonging to the ab- 
bacy at Coupar- Angus. The fact is well known, and the names 
of many places indicate to this day, the connection betwixt this 
parish and the religious house at Coupar- Angus. Thus we have 
Monk Mire, Monk Callie, the Abbey Mill of Blacklaw, to which 
the adjacent lands were thirled, after a most grinding fashion, and 
to be relieved from which bondage the proprietors have lately paid 
large sums. There was anciently a chapel at St Phink, dedicated 
to that saint, a small part of the foundation of which still remains. 
It had been surrounded with a burying-ground, out of which the 
present proprietor's father dug some human skulls, inclosed be- 
tween four square stones. Below a cairn he found human bones 
partially burned, and below these again two rudely sculptured urns 
inverted, with human bones in a state of perfect preservation. 
Very lately, near the chapel, there were discovered some singular 
looking bottles, nearly globular, likewise inverted. On the neigh- 
bouring property of Blacklaw, at Pictfield, there were also cairns ; 
and not far otf, a bronzed battle-axe and spear-head were found. 
At Monk Callie, it is understood that there was a small religious 
establishment attached to the abbey at Coupar- Angus. There is 
a small burying-ground there, and it is still used as such. Tra- 
dition says that the soil of this burying-ground had been at one 

time sifted, and freed from stones. There is no trace of the sub-

terranean buildings at Mudhall, described in the former Account 
as Pictish buildings, and which, it is remarked, answered to Ta- 
citus' description of the buildings of the Germans. " They dig 
caves in the earth, where they lay up their grain, and live in win- 
ter." De Mer. Germ. c. 16. My predecessor adds with cha- 
racteristic naivetS : " If people were obliged again to creep into 
a hole, they would know the value of good government by the 
want of it." There are two of those eminences, partly artificial, 
which are generally denominated Laws, — one at Blacklaw, and 
another near the Bridge of Couttie. Some suppose, that, in the 
olden time, these were the seats of justice, whence law, rude and 
simple as themselves, was dispensed to the lieges. Others incline 
to the opinion, that they were used as telegraphs ; and derive the 
name not from the Anglo-Saxon hlaive, {agger, but from the Swe- 
dish loa or lue hence our low, a flame. The walls of the 
church are understood to be very old. The pulpit is curious, be- 
ing carved of oak, resembling John Knox's pulpit at St Andrews, 
and evidently of the same era. There is a monumental stone in 
the back wall of the church to the memory of Kicol Campbell of 
Keithock, son of Donald, Abbot of Coupar, and grandson of the 
Earl of Argyle, who died 1587, aged seventy. Another, in the 
west passage, the inscription on which will soon be obliterated, 
to David Campbell of Denhead, the brother of Nicol Campbell. 
There are two other stones on the wall of the church, — one to the 
memory of Leonard Leslie, entitled Dominus de Cupro, com- 
mendator of Coupar, who died 1605, aged eighty-one ; and an- 
other representing a John Cummin of Couttie in this parish, 
dressed in a coat of mail, and standing on a dog; the date 1606.

In 1841, there were of males, 376 ; and of females, 407 ; and 
of distinct families, 142; inhabited houses, 136; the average num- 
ber of births for the last seven years has been 13; and of mar- 
riages rather more than seven. There is one insane person ; one 
blind ; none deaf or dumb. 

 There are 21 proprietors of land of the yearly value of L.50 or 
upwards.

The enlargement of the farms has caused the decrease of the 
population. The lands of Coupar- Grange, for instance, were at 
one time in the hands of twelve proprietors. At a subsequent pe- 
riod, they were farmed by as many or more tenants, and around 
each farm-house were clustered the retainers and servants. At 
this time there were fifty families in Coupar Grange ; and I un- 
derstand it then had its carrier, its brewer, and its seller of small 
wares. The land now, with a small exception, belongs to one 
proprietor. It is farmed by four tenants, and two bothies and eight 
cot-houses contain the population. At Blacklawand hills of Ben- 
dochy, there was, at one time, a considerable population, which 
has disappeared from the same cause. The slight increase that 
took place after 1811 was probably owing to the division of the 
common at Hill of St Phink, and the consequent building of cot- 
tages that took place in that quarter. 

Character, tyc. of the People. — There are no popular customs or 
amusements peculiar to the parish. There is a small curling club in 
the parish instituted not only " for the purpose as its laws bear of 
joining in an innocent and interesting amusement, but also for che- 
rishing feelings of kindness and of friendship towards one another." 

There has undoubtedly been a vast addition made to the com- 
forts and advantages of the people since the former Statistical 
Account was written. Their houses are far more comfortable, 
and their habits more cleanly. Their food is more varied, and 
their clothing cheaper and more tasteful. " The common people 
live on oatmeal pottage twice a~day. It is the most wholesome 
and palatable of all their food, being purely vegetable, notwith- 
standing the reflection in Johnson's Dictionary, that  Oats are 
eaten by horses in England, and in Scotland by men.' Such food 
makes men strong like horses, and purges the brain of pedantry." 
Old Statistical Account. This is better than the remark of 
I think Lord Lyttleton, " Yes, and where will you find such men 
and such horses." There are now more potatoes, more wheaten 
bread, and more animal food used by the peasantry. Each cottar 
feeds one pig, many two, in the year; and the majority of them 
have a cow. 

The illicit distillation of whisky has totally ceased, although, at 
one time, in the district of Galahill, there flourished a daring set 
of contrabandists, who lived in wild freedom, and laughed at the 
restraints of the law. The morality and comfort of the people in 
that quarter have alike improved since the practice of smuggling

was put down. The establishment of a water police has stopped 
the midnight amusement of black-fishing, although some of the 
older inhabitants continue to believe in the medicinal virtues of 
foul fish. They are a sovereign cure for rheumatism and sundry 
other ailments. 

IV. — Industry. 
With a fractional exception, the whole of the people are more 
or less engaged in the occupations of husbandry, the parish being 
purely an agricultural one. Those who are engaged weaving in 
the winter months, relinquish their looms during summer and au- 
tumn. There may be twenty families, however, who, during the 
greater part of the year, are employed in weaving linen yarn sent 
from Dundee, the great mart of our linen manufactures. The two 
following tables contain a great mass of statistical information, not 
only regarding the present agricultural state of the parish, but re- 
garding its agricultural condition fifty years ago.

From these tables, it is very evident that the farmer, fifty years 
ago, ought to have been much more favourably situated than the 
farmer of the present day. The expense of labour was less ; the price 
of the implements of husbandry much less ; the value of agricultural 
produce, with the exception of the important item of cattle, little 
inferior to what it is now; while the rent seems to have been about 
a third of what it is at present. There are, however, probably 
ten times as many cattle fed for the butcher now as formerly. It 
is in his byre that the farmer looks for his rent. He would need 
• now to do so. But unless grain rises in value, or some latent pro- 
ductive power in the soil be discovered, or the farmer's outlay be 
diminished, it is not easy to see how he can continue long to pay 
his present rent, when that rent is a fixed money one. The breed 
of cattle that is preferred is a cross betwixt the Teeswater bull 
and the Angus-shire cow. Attention is paid to both of these varie- 
ties in the lowland part of the parish, while in the higher districts, 
the Highland breeds prevail. The cattle for feeding are tied up 
chiefly two-year-olds in October. The queys are sold out in 
January, and the oxen in April and May. They are fed in the 
early part of the season mostly on yellow turnips, and, after that, 
chiefly on potatoes. There are no stocks of sheep kept in the 
parish ; but one-half of the turnips are consumed on the ground 
by sheep which are bought in October, or the turnips are let for 
this purpose. The farming on the banks of the Isla and Ericht 
is probably as good as in any district of Scotland. While the soil 
is well suited for the culture of wheat, it possesses the property 
an invaluable one in these times of being equally adapted for 
the cultivation of green crops. Bone-dust was early introduced, 
and with it the turnips are almost exclusively grown. More lately, 
some experiments have been made with guano, which seem to 
show that it will prove a valuable addition to our manures. Fur- 
row-draining has been carried on to some considerable extent with 
the best results, the happiest of which is probably the growing 
conviction, that much remains to be done in this department of 
agricultural improvement. Of recent local improvements, however, 
by far the most important has been the embanking of the Ericht and 
Isla, whereby 500 acres of the most fertile and valuable soil, not 
in the parish only, but, in Strathmore, have been rescued from the 
ravages of the watery element. These embankments were erected 
at a great expense under the direction of Mr Blackadder, civil - 
engineer, Glammis, and they have hitherto answered the purpose 



1194 



PERTHSHIRE. 



for which they were intended. We hope never more to witness 
the dreadful devastations which an autumnal flood was wont to 
cause, and the consequent anxiety and consternation with which 
the farmer contemplated the rising of the waters. We have 
more than once seen the most fertile part of the parish com- 
pletely swept of its crops ; the corns irrecoverably lost, or, if 
recovered, rendered so worthless as not to repay, in many cases, 
the labour of carrying them home, being scarcely fit even for ma- 
nure, while the potatoes were left in the soil, not to enrich it 
with their decaying tubers, but to poison and render it sterile. 
Doubtless there was a fine vegetable deposit left on our haughs 
by those inundations, but any fertility thereby communicated to 
the soil was a poor compensation for the destruction caused by the 
floods. There has been as yet scarcely time to discover the ef- 
fects of these embankments on the channels of the rivers, and on 
the floods with which they are visited. It would seem that the 
channel of the Isla is deepening, and that the water hemmed in 
by the embankments is hurried on with an increased impetus to 
the sea, rendering the flood of shorter duration, while, from the 
same cause, it is kept from rising higher than it formerly did, 
which was scarcely anticipated. One thing is plain, that a vast 
mass of silt, formerly left on the valley, is now carried down to 
the estuary of the Tay, to increase the work of the dredging-ma- 
chine, or to add to the delta of that river. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 

The farm-buildings are generally in an excellent, condition, 
and after the most improved fashion. There is a want of enclo- 
sures on the properties forming the Grange of Aberbothrie. 
The hedge-rows on the Bendochy estate are not attended to, and 
those on the Coupar- Grange property are mismanaged. The 
Coupar- Grange oats, once famous, are the common late oat of the 
country, but presenting a finer, whiter, and weightier sample than 
usual, from being grown, I suppose, in deep and cherishing soil. 
The potato oat, the Hopetoun and other new varieties, are now 
chiefly cultivated ; but the Coupar- Grange oat has many valuable 
properties, and in certain soils, and under certain kinds of hus- 
bandry, may be grown with the greatest advantage. 

There is no rotation of cropping generally adhered to. A ro- 
tation of seven years is often adopted ; thus, two years grass, then 
oats, potatoes, wheat ; turnip with bone dust, half of them eat off 
with sheep ; finally, barley sown down with grass, or a rotation of

five years; the fourth crop being potatoes or turnip, and the fifth 
wheat or barley. All this applies to the lowland part of the pa- 
rish ; the mode of farming being very different in the Highland 
district. Its altitude above the level of the sea forbids the culti- 
vation of wheat, and the climate is only sufficient to ripen the 
earlier varieties of oats and barley. 

The rent of grazing a cow in the lowland part of the parish is 
L.4, in the highland, L.2, 10s. 

Three years ago, Mr Archer erected at Coupar-Grange, a mill 
for extracting the farina from the potato. Nothing can be finer 
or more beautiful than the flour here manufactured ; but I under- 
stand that this is by no means so profitable a trade as it was five 
or six years ago. 

Quarries. — The lowland part of the parish is well supplied with 
freestone, there being four quarries opened at convenient points, 
and now that the road from Blairgowrie to the bridge of Cally is 
being converted into turnpike, it seems probable that the bed of 
clay slate which crosses the Highland part of the parish might be 
profitably wrought. 

Fishings. — The salmon-fishing on the Isla and Ericht is not worth 
altogether above L.20 per annum. From the care that has been 
taken for some years to preserve the fish during the spawning sea- 
son, and from the increased numbers that appeared in our rivers dur- 
ing the past season, there is a hope that the fishing may become 
more valuable, although the extreme vigilance of the fishers on 
the Tay forbid the expectation that our rivers ever can be so 
stocked with fish as they were fifty years ago. 

Produce. — I have found it impossible to make any calculation 
of the value of the different items of raw produce raised in the pa- 
rish, so accurate as would warrant any general statistical deduc- 
tions to be drawn from it. As a near approximation to the truth, 
the average annual value of raw produce raised in the parish may 
be stated at L.28,000. But the table on a preceding page will 
enable the reader to form his own opinion on this branch of the in- 
quiry. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is no market-town in the parish. There is not even 
any village in the parish. Assuredly my predecessor had no 
parochial exemplification of the evils of centralization, a sub- 
ject to which political writers have had their attention of late so 
much directed, and yet these evils seem to have made a deep im-

pression on the mind, as the following sentences show. " Be- 
ware of making cities too great. They are capable of making 
sudden tumults. It was not France but Paris that overturned 
the Government, and left every man to do that which was right in 
his own eyes. To prevent the exorbitant growth of cities may be 
done by individuals, but is not to be attempted by statesmen. The 
most despotic and cruel of all governors were the mobs of Athens 
and Rome. From such inhuman masters, good Lord deliver us " 
Old Statistical Account. The remarkable addition that has 
been made of late years to the means of communication, and the 
extraordinary facilities of transit now enjoyed, have increased the 
danger pointed out in the above extract, and should teach us that 
it is to be warded of in some other way than that indicated. There 
is another class of evils resulting from the system of centralism, 
which it may be more relevant to notice here. The allowing the 
cot-houses to fall into ruins, and the consequent emigration of the 
peasantry into towns, has been injurious to the parish. On the 
fine estates forming the Grange of Aberbothrie, there is but one 
cot-house, and generally throughout the parish, from the same 
cause, there is a lack of agricultural labourers. Nor is this all. 
There cannot be a doubt, that in rural districts the industrious 
poor, when in difficulty or sickness, receive much greater aid and 
attention from their wealthier neighbours, than in densely popu- 
lated towns. Supposing them equally inclined and able, a farmer 
can do much more for the two or three poor families connected with 
his farm, than a merchant or manufacturer can do for the two or 
three hundred workmen dependent on him. In the country, 
moreover, the labouring poor enjoy much greater advantages in 
the education of their children, while the guardians of their religi- 
ous interests have it much more in their power to see that these 
advantages are actually made use of. The nation has reached 
that stage in its social condition, which seems to render it neces- 
sary that the benefits attending the cottage system, in a moral, 
political, and commercial point of view, should receive the imme- 
diate and grave consideration of the proprietors of the soil. 

The market and post town for that part of the parish lying west 
of the Ericht, is Coupar Angus, which is wo miles from the church. 
The post-town for the rest of the parish is Blairgowrie, with the 
exception of the estates of Polcalk, Greymount, East and West 
Tullyfergus, which are nearer Alyth. 

In the lower part of the parish most of the grain is sold at 



BENDOCHV. 



1 197 



Coupar Angus. Corn-merchants from Dundee, and the millers 
of the adjoining district, attend the weekly market there. The fat 
cattle if not sold in the byre are disposed of at the fortnightly 
markets held in Blairgowrie, which are frequented by the Glas- 
gow dealers, and at these markets the farmers from the Highland 
district sell their oats,— the distillers in the neighbouring glens 
relieving them generally of their spare bear. 

In 1835, the road from Coupar Angus to Blairgowrie was con- 
verted into turnpike. About a mile of it traverses the parish. An 
omnibus from Blairgowrie passes along the road once a day in 
winter, and twice or thrice a day in summer, to the terminus of 
the railway at Coupar Angus. Passenger trains start three or 
four times a day from Coupar to Dundee, and the parish enjoys 
its own share of the advantages conferred on Strathmore by the 
opening of this line of railway. 

The bridge over the Isla at Couttie was built by Government 
in 1766. It is inconveniently narrow. The riding stone and the 
reading stone, immediately below the bridge, mark the course of 
the ford used before the erection of the bridge ; " and, as works 
of nature outlive those of art, they may show the place where it 
stood after it is gone." Old Statistical Account. There is an- 
other bridge over the Ardle at Cally, and a third over the Black- 
water at Strone, each of those of one arch. There is a great improve- 
ment on the parish roads of late years. About twenty years ago, 
the road struck orF immediately at the bridge of Couttie, straggled 
deviously through the low haughs within flood-mark, and passed 
within six yards of the manse. In these days travelling in wet 
weather was not unattended with danger, and the carting away of 
the grain, saving in the time of frost, next to impossible. Within 
the last four years, our roads have got into a much better state of 
repair, apparently from the circumstance of the outlay of the road 
money being entrusted to two or three of the farmers. The car- 
riages are mostly driven gratuitously, and, if the present system is 
adhered to, the principal lines of road in the lower part of the pa- 
rish ought soon to be in an excellent state. 

Ecclesiastical State. — It may already be inferred that the situa- 
tion of the parish church is about as inconvenient as can well be 
imagined. It is within 300 yards of the southern extremity of the 
parish, while it is distant from the northern extremity about thir- 
teen miles. There is scarcely a third of the people that can con- 
veniently attend the parish church ; and such is the territorial

character of the parish, that it is not easy to see how this evil 
could be remedied. If a bridge were thrown over the Ericht, and 
the church removed to the bank opposite the present boat-house, 
every thing perhaps would be accomplished for the accommoda- 
tion of the people that the circumstances of the parish permitted. 
This, however, would be but a partial cure of the evils to which 
both minister and people are exposed. A new territorial arrange- 
ment would alone remove the evil. Nothing can be more discou- 
raging to the minister than the scattered and distracted nature of 
the locality in which it is his duty to labour; and, from the same 
cause, the usefulness of the parish schoolmaster is much interfered 
with. The boat at Coupar- Grange was long the property of the 
kirk-session, and under its exclusive management, as the session 
records abundantly prove. Many years ago it seems, from some 
unknown cause, to have fallen into the hands of the proprietors 
of Coupar- Grange. The late proprietors of Coupar- Grange, upon 
the petition of the minister, allowed the people to be ferried over 
to church gratuitously j and the present proprietor  Mr Murray of 
Simprim has kindly continued the boon. 

Before the abolition of Popery, the church here was the parish 
church of Coupar Angus, and so lately as fifty years ago, the 
seats of Keithock, in the parish of Coupar Angus, stood &amp; in the 
church of Bendochy. The situation of the parish church was 
then sufficiently centrical, and when it is remembered that in these 
days, there were chapels at St Phink and Callie, it would seem 
that, as far at least as the plantation of religious edifices was con- 
cerned, our Popish predecessors had provided most judiciously for 
the convenience of the people. It is not known when the walls of 
the church were built. It is in a tolerable state of repair at pre- 
sent,— the old grey slates having been removed and replaced with 
blue ones during last summer, while the roof was strengthened 
by additional wood being put into it, and the seating partially 
repaired. It continues damp and cold. It would accommodate 
about 400 people, and there are none of the sittings let.

date, was built in 1815, and since that time, no repairs on it have 
been asked from the heritors. It is sufficiently commodious and 
comfortable. It is sweetly situated on the banks of the Isla, 
snugly embosomed in its own little grove of wood, — and oh  ye, 
my successors, lift not up the axe against the trees. Touch not 
the old ash that has stood for a century the centinel of the manse, 
guarding it from the eastern blasts, and protecting from the storm 
the graceful birches that weep and wave their branches below. 

The glebe, exclusive of garden, &amp;c. consists of 7 Scotch acres 
of excellent soil, and would let at L.2 per acre. 

The stipend consists of 164 bolls, 2 firlots, 3 pecks, 3f lippies 
oatmeal ; of barley, 22 bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, If lippies ; of bear, 
74 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 0 T 9 5 lippies ; and of money, L. 29, 14s. 
llgd. It is understood that the teinds are exhausted. The 
Crown is patron. 

The Chapel of Persie.— This preaching station is at North 
Persie, about thirteen miles from the parish church. The chapel 
was erected about the year 1785, at an expense of L.150 Ster- 
ling, raised by contributions throughout the district, and amongst 
the proprietors and ministers connected with it. It contains about 
400 people, and accommodates not only the people of this parish 
in that quarter, but the inhabitants of a large adjoining district, 
comprising portions of the parishes of Blairgowrie, Alyth, Kirk- 
michael, Rattray, and Caputh. It is most conveniently located, 
and has proved a great blessing to an extensive district of country, 
containing a population of 1000 souls, which otherwise would 
have been very destitute of the means of religious instruction and 
pastoral superintendence. For some years past the average amount 
of the seat rents and collections has been about L.70. These 
form the salary of the preacher. In the old Statistical Account 
they are stated at L.30. The proprietor of North Persie grant- 
ed the site half an acre for the chapel, upon the express condi- 
tion that it should continue inalienably in connection with the 
Established Church ; and the deed provides, that, in the event of 
any successful attempt being made to sever the chapel from the 
Established Church, that in that case the fabric and the site 
should revert to him or his heirs. He nominated certain proprie- 
tors and ministers connected with the district as trustees on the 
chapel ; but for many years past, a committee of the hearers have 
managed the whole affairs of the chapel. In 1835, a manse for 
the accommodation of the preacher was erected, at a cost of L.150,

exclusive of carriages, raised in the same way as the money for 
the erection of the chapel, and more lately a small court of offices, 
—the proprietor of North Persie again granting half an acre of 
ground for a site and garden, and the managers of the chapel rent- 
ing from him a bit of ground for the convenience of the preacher. 

There are no Dissenting or Seceding chapels in the parish. 
The parish church never has and never can be well attended. 
The members of the Established Church who are within conve- 
nient reach of the parish church, are exemplary in their attendance 
on Divine service, and those who are not, statedly worship at the 
parish churches of Rattray and Alyth. The chapel at Persie is 
well attended. The average number of communicants at the pa- 
nsh church is 260, and about 40 others communicate in neigh- 
bouring parishes. The number of the parishioners not members 
of the Established Church, and belonging to other religious de- 
nominations, is as follows : —

It having been found that collections at the church were not the 
best way of giving the people an opportunity of contributing to the 
educational and missionary schemes supported by the church, a 
parish association for religious purposes was established in 1823. 
Its collections are limited to the lower part of the parish, and for 
some years past they have averaged annually about L.18. 

Education.— There is one parochial school. The salary is 
L.34, 4s. 4±d.; the average amount of fees, L.9, 9s. 6£d. The 
schoolmaster is session-clerk, to which a salary of L.2 is attached, 
and the customary dues. He acts likewise as clerk to the heritors,' 
and as collector of the assessment, for which he receives L.3 pep 
annum. The usual branches of education are taught, and the 
school fees, per quarter, are as follows : English reading, 2s. ; 
with writing, 2s. 6d. ; with arithmetic, grammar, and geography,' 
3s.; with practical mathematics, 3s. 6d. ; with Latin and Greek' 
5s. Many years ago, Colonel Macdonald erected, at his own ex- 
pense, a school-house at Strone of Cally for behoof of the Hio-n.. 
land district of the parish. The school-room is given free of relit, 
but the teacher has no other means of subsistence than the school

fees. A school-house was built four years ago at Mayriggs bv 
subscription, and its affairs are very well managed by a small body 
of Dissenters in that neighbourhood. There seems, however, to 
have been no necessity for this erection, as it is within little more 
than a mile of the parish school, and about two miles from Blair- 
gowrie, where there are schools of every denomination. The 
kirk-session have a right to nominate ten scholars to the parish 
school of Blairgowrie on the " Barty mortification." The pupils 
enjoying the benefits of this bequest are entitled not only to their 
education free, but to school books and writing materials gratui- 
tously, and, if wished, to have their education carried on until they 
are fit to go to a university. There is a Sabbath school taught 
by the parish minister and schoolmaster ; and the religious in- 
struction of the young at Persie is faithfully attended to by my 
friend and fellow-labourer, the Rev. Mr Mitchell. The people 
in general are alive to the benefits of education, and seem espe- 
cially to appreciate the advantages of Sabbath school instruction. 

Hospital. — In 1841, the parish remitted L. 21 to the Dundee 
Infirmary, in virtue whereof the minister of this parish is ex-officio 
a governor of that institution, and the parish has acquired a per- 
petual right to send to it patients. Lord Wharneliffe authorizes 
the kirk-session to procure, at his expense, medical attendance 
and medicine for the industrious poor on his estate when sick. 
This is a most judicious charity. 

Savings Banks. — There are no saving banks in the parish, but 
those at Coupar- Angus and Blairgowrie are sufficiently convenient 
for the parishioners. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid for the last five years is seven ; and the 
average annual sum allotted to each has been L.3, 12s. 7d. The 
average amount of church collections for the poor for the last five 
years, L. 12, 9s. 5d.; do. of interest of money viz. L. 58, L. 1, 
14s. 9d. ; do. from mortcloth, &amp;c. L.l, 10s. 9£d. ; do from assess- 
ment, L. 23, 19s. 5d. The assessment was first laid on in 1775. 
For the first half of that year it amounted to L.8, 2s. 6d. The 
origin of the assessment in such a parish must have been the same 
cause that alone renders its continuance necessary, the impossibi- 
lity, viz. of the great body of the people attending the parish 
church. In the old Statistical Account, the assessment is stated 
at L.6, and the monthly collections at 8s. When the difference 
in the value of money, and the larger aliment now allowed to the 

PERTH. 4 G 



1202 



PERTHSHIRE. 



poor, are taken into consideration, it might seem that the assess- 
ment has not increased since the time when it was first levied. The 
late Patrick Playfair, Esq. of Dalmarnock, Glasgow, a native of 
the parish, left L. 30, minus the legacy duty, for the poor of the 
parish. It was committed to the care of the kirk-session. The 
interest of this sum is appropriated in adding to the comforts of 
the more necessitous poor during the winter months. Occasional 
aid is administered from the poor's funds to persons not on the 
pauper list ; and, while the rich are liberal and attentive to the 
wants of their poorer neighbours, it must be added, that the poor 
are very kind to one another. 

In general there is a disposition among the poor to refrain from 
seeking parochial relief; but when once the rubicon is crossed, 
and their names added to the regular list of poor which is never 
done but at the half-yearly meetings of the heritors and kirk-ses- 
sion, I cannot say that they consider their dependent situation 
as degrading. 

Markets. — There are three cattle markets held at Persie, viz. 
on the first Wednesday of June, on the first Wednesday of Sep- 
tember, and on the last Friday of October, O. S. The Septem- 
ber market is the most important. It is preparatory to Falkirk 
tryst, and generally exhibits an extensive show of excellent High- 
land cattle. 

Inns. — There is only one inn in the parish, viz. at Persie. It 
is conveniently situated ; nor am I aware that the morals of the 
people are thereby deteriorated. 

Fuel. — In the lower part of the parish, coals from the railway 
depots are almost exclusively used as fuel. Those of the best 
quality cost L.l per ton. In the Highland districts of the parish, 
peats form the principal part of the fuel, although coals are now 
driven from Coupar- Angus in considerable quantities, and are em- 
ployed chiefly in the burning of lime. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
With the aid of the former Statistical Account, three agricul- 
tural eras in the history of this parish are distinctly discernible. 
The first, about 1756, when the farms lay in runrig, — when 
there was no winter turnip, or wheat, or sown grass, or potatoes, 
and, indeed, could be none, as, immediately after the corns were 
removed off the fields, they were pastured promiscuously by the 
bestial of the village, the farmers in those days living together in 
hamlets, apparently from theancient policy of mutual protection.

The plough, a truly primitive implement, was dragged by a yoke 
of eight oxen, or of four oxen led on by two horses. By means 
of this motley and formidable cavalcade, the surface of the soil 
was only scratched, although apparently it might have preceded 
the great Deanston trench -plough. Sledges, having the wheels 
and axle of one piece, were used instead of carts. The farming- 
was strangely partial in its character. All the manure was laid 
on the infield. The outfield was treated as the common foe. 
At irregular intervals it was cropped, and then consigned again 
to the unassisted powers of nature, the crop being private property, 
but the grass, such as it was, common pasturage. As a specimen 
of the rental of the parish at this time, it may be added that the 
rental of the Coupar-Grange property was only L 115 Sterling. 
The second era is that described in the former Statistical Ac- 
count, 1796. Forty years had effected a great change to the 
better. The farms are now divided, hedge-rows are planted, 
wheat is grown, and, to a considerable extent, turnips and potatoes 
bad varieties, however, of these invaluable esculents, are culti- 
vated. Flax was now grown in large quantities ; the parish had 
t wo lint-mills ; and the women, rich and poor, were much em- 
ployed in spinning the lint into yarn. The Isla flowed amain, 
and, wanting the protection of embankments, the timorous hus- 
bandman removed to higher ground his corns immediately when 
cut. There were then only three thrashing-mills in the parish, 
and the means of transport and communication were miserably 
deficient. The whole rental of the parish was L.2467. The 
third period, that of the present day, may be described as the era 
of green crop husbandry, of cattle-feeding, of bone-dust, of em- 
bankments, of furrow-draining, of improved roads and railway 
communication. The spinning-wheel is mute, and the clatter of 
the loom is heard in its stead. Twenty- five thrashing-mills have 
frightened the rlail, and that venerable weapon is well nigh obso- 
lete. The rental has risen to L.7087. 

At this moment, it would seem that we are on the eve of great 
agricultural changes, and if farmers wish their employments to be 
profitable, the sooner they direct their attention to the advantages 
of furrow-draining, of trench-ploughing, and to the application of 
new manures, the better will it be for themselves. In the matter 
of draining they ought to be directed, encouraged, and aided by 
the proprietors of the soil. There can be no doubt that the pro- 
ductive powers of the parish may be greatly increased. Thus, for 



1-204 



I'ERTHSHIK E 



instance, the proprietors of the Highland part of the parish, or 
their factors report to me, that there are 700 acres in that district 
which might be profitably added to the arable soil, and if it were 
allowed, which may very fairly be done, that there are 1000 acres 
of the arable soil, the fertility of which might at least be doubled 
by being subjected to a proper system of drainage, it must be evi- 
dent that avast increase may be made to the agricultural produce 
of the parish ; and although the existing rental with the present 
prices might not be raised, yet it could be easily maintained, with- 
out impoverishing the cultivators of the soil. 

It is not so easy to say what means ought to be adopted to in- 
crease the moral and religious advantages of the people. Our 
hearts, alas  are more cold, ungrateful, and intractable than our 
soil. A bridge over the Ericht would make the parish church 
more accessible to a considerable portion of the parishioners. 
Above all, would it be advantageous to a large district of the pa- 
rish, were the chapel at Persie endowed, its preacher ordained, 
and some salary attached to the school at Strone of Cally  At- 
tempts have been made to attain each of these objects, but they 
have hitherto failed, and in these uneasy times there is little hope 
of their speedy accomplishment. The people attending the cha- 
pel of Persie have the election of the preacher ; they have the ex- 
clusive management of the affairs of the chapel ; but this is not 
freedom enough for them, and some of them, deserting the minis- 
try of a most faithful and assiduous servant in the Lord's Vine- 
yard, have joined themselves to the " Free Church."

rRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. LACHLAN M'LEAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — It does not appear that this parish has ever been known 
by any other name than that which it at present bears. It is said 
to be of Celtic origin, and is resolved, by persons acquainted with 
that language, into ceann, signifying head, and fauns, signifying 
an opening ; and is thus made by them to mean the head of the 
opening. What the opening here referred to was, however, it is 
not so easy to determine ; and it must be confessed, that much 
room is left for fanciful conjecture. But as the western part of 
this parish consists of a narrow belt of flat land, confined on both 
sides by hills, and gradually expanding, or opening eastward into 
the vale of the Carse of Gowrie ; one of the most probable con- 
jectures is, that this constituted the opening in question. And if 
this was the case, the western extremity, or upper end of this belt, 
might very appropriately be called ceann fauns, or the head of the 
opening ; and the name being thus applied, at first, to a single spot, 
might, naturally enough, afterwards be extended to a wider dis- 
trict, and ultimately become the name of the parish, of which that 
formed a part. As a sort of confirmation of this opinion, it may 
be remarked, that though Kinfauns has been the name given to 
the whole parish from time immemorial; yet, to this very day, it is 
to the west end of the parish, consisting of the property of the 
Right Honourable Lord Gray, that this name is applied in the 
strictest sense. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The length of the parish from Barn- 
hill toll-bar, at the western extremity of the hill of Kinnoull, to 
the east end of the wood of Glendoick, is fully five miles. The 
breadth is very various, but may be estimated, on an average, at 
one mile and a-half. These dimensions give a superficial area of 
seven and a-half square miles, or 4800 imperial acres, for the whole 
parish.

It is bounded on the west, and north-west, by the parish of Kin- 
noull ; on the north, by a detached portion of that parish, called 
Balthayock, and by the parish of Kilspindie ; on the north-east, 
by Kilspindie ; on the east and south -east, by the parish of Errol ; 
and on the south, by the parish of St Madoes, by another detached 
portion of Kinnoull, and by the river Tay. Its figure is very ir- 
regular, and it is difficult to convey an idea of it in words. For 
the first three quarters of a mile from the western extremity, its 
breadth is scarcely more than half a mile ; farther east than this, 
it extends to upwards of a mile and a half ; then about the middle, 
it is reduced again to half a mile ; farther east still than this, it ex- 
tends to about two miles and a quarter, but becomes gradually 
narrower towards the east end. Its general outline may be said, 
in short, to bear some faint resemblance to that of a violin. 

Topographical Appear ances, Sfc. — The surface is considerably 
diversified by level and rising grounds, by wood and water. The 
lands on the banks of the Tay are flat. From this they arise by 
a gradual and easy ascent to the base of the hills which traverse 
the parish lengthwise from east to west. Of these hills, Kinnoull, 
the most westerly, is also the most remarkable. It lies partly in 
the parish of that name, and partly in the parish of Kinfauns ; and 
presents to the south a large abrupt front of rock, of a striking ap- 
pearance, especially from the old post road, which went close to 
its base. On this side, the ascent is exceedingly steep, and cloth- 
ed with a profusion of young and thriving trees, whose matted roots 
prevent the soil, in some degree, from falling down, which it some- 
times, notwithstanding, does, bringing numbers of the trees along 
with it. This ascent extends upwards to fully three-fourths of the 
whole height of the hill, which is 632 feet, above the level of the 
Tay. The remaining one-fourth, or nearly so, next the summit, 
consists of almost perpendicular rock. The summit projects, 
however, here and there, in rugged cliffs of a seamy texture, 
which, being gradually loosened by the frost and rain, have 
sometimes fallen in large masses, with prodigious force, into the 
plain below. On the east of this hill, the ground slopes gradually 
downwards ; and here, in a hollow, stands Kinfauns Castle, yet at 
a considerable height above the Tay. A little to the east of the 
castle, the ground begins to rise again, by a rather steep but 
smooth ascent, forming the west side of another beautiful hill, 
clothed all around with wood. This hill is sometimes called Binn 
hill, from its somewhat conical shape, and sometimes the Tower 
hill, from its having on its top a tower, upwards of 80 feet high, 



KIN FAUNS. 



1207 



built, about thirty years ago, by the late Lord Gray, for an obser- 
vatory, from the top of which may be obtained almost a bird's-eye 
view of Kinfauns Castle and gardens, and the pleasure grounds 
around, with an extensive prospect of the surrounding country. To 
the east of this last-mentioned hill, the land is arable, sloping gra- 
dually downwards, till it ends in a deep ravine, on the opposite side 
of which there is another hill, remarkable only as consisting of the 
largest continuous mass of conglomerate rock to be found in this 
part of the country. Farther east still, is another hill, which bears 
a strong resemblance to that of Kinnoull, only- the rock immedi- 
ately below the brow is not so nearly perpendicular. The top of 
this hill commands a view of the whole of the Carse of Gowrie, of 
the tower of Dundee, and of Broughty Castle, and also of the 
whole of the river Tay, from a mile below Perth to the German 
Ocean, a portion of which likewise is seen. To the south may 
be obtained a view of the whole east end of Strathearn, and to 
the south-west, a considerable portion of the middle of the same 
strath may be seen, the view being bounded in this direction by 
Auchterarder moor. 

These hills already described, with another still farther to the 
east, which are almost all wooded on the top, and also up the 
southern acclivity, as far as the soil will permit, form what may 
be called the screen of the lowlands. But from these run north- 
ward other hilly ranges, forming various ramifications, rising, sink-, 
ing, and rising again, by gentle undulations, till they pass beyond 
the bounds of this parish, and sink down at last into the valley of 
Strathmore, of which, to a certain extent, they form the southern 
boundary. 

As we do not intend to enter on the geological department, it 
may be mentioned here, that all these hills consist of trap, with 
here and there patches of conglomerate ; that in the sloping 
grounds, near their bases, on the south side, are found onyxes, 
jaspers, agates, and cornelians, of various sizes and colours ; and 
that, also, in various places are found large boulders of whinstone, 
which is of a lighter colour than that of which the hills are compos- 
ed, — with others which seem to consist of a sort of coarse gra- 
nite. 

The only cave in the parish, as far as is known to the writer, is 
one in the face of Kinnoull hill, rather difficult of access, called 
the Dragon-hole, and noticeable only on account of its being re- 
ported, by tradition, to have been the occasional hiding place of

Sir William Wallace, and for its being, in former times, the scene 
of certain superstitious observances. 

" The soil is various. The banks of the river are covered with a 
strong clay, capable, with proper culture, of carrying the heaviest 
crops. The grounds rising towards the hills consist of an easy 
black mould, in many places deep and rich, even at a considerable 
height. In the level part of the parish, on the east side, the same 
kind of soil is in some places, mixed with clay ; in others, with 
sand. The lands under cultivation are, in general, good and fer- 
tile : the uncultivated parts are mostly covered with plantations ; 
so that there is scarcely an acre of waste ground within the pa- 
rish." Old Statistical Account. 

Meteorology. — With regard to aqueous and luminous meteors, 
it may be said that a full description and history of these, in as 
far as regards this parish, have already been published in the 
Statistical Account of Perth, from which city this parish is not 
distant quite a mile in a direct line. We shall therefore only sub- 
join the following meteorological tables, extracted from the regis- 
ter kept at Kinfauns Castle. The first is for 1841, which is the 
latest that could be procured.

From the above tables it will be seen, that the prevailing winds 
are from the west. These are sometimes very boisterous, blowing 
violently, as through a funnel, between the hills of Kinnoull and 
Mordun ; at times, stripping the roofs of houses, and overturning 
stacks of corn. Our most uncongenial weather, however, is from 
the east. Cold piercing winds frequently blow from that direc-

tion in spring ; and sometimes, for many continuous days, even in 
the early summer months. The climate is, upon the whole, how- 
ever, mild and salubrious; and the people are remarkable for health 
and longevity. There are no diseases, or distempers, peculiar to 
the district ; and epidemical infections are neither common, nor 
remarkably fatal. 

Hydrography. — The Tay is the only river connected with the 
parish, and forms its southern boundary for upwards of three and 
a half miles. Three small streamlets intersect the parish from 
north to south, and drain off the humidities of the soil to the Tay. 
These take their rise from a variety of springs in the upper or hillv 
parts of the parish. For, both in these parts, and also in the ris- 
ing grounds that slope towards the hills, there are a great number 
of such springs, of the most pure and limpid water, all perennial, 
and very little, if at all, affected by the severest summer droughts. 

Zoology. — All the common kinds of game are found in the pa- 
rish, — some in very great, some in less abundance ; such as roe- 
deer, hares, black-cocks, pheasants, and, in their season, land- 
rails, snipes, and wood-cocks. Partridges have been rather scarce 
since the severe winter of 1837-8; during which, it is supposed, 
most of them perished. But they are now beginning again to be 
more numerous. Rabbits are, at present, by far too abundant. 
The other wild animals are, foxes, badgers, hedgehogs, squirrels, 
polecats, stoats, and weasels, &amp;c. Badgers and polecats are now 
rarely to be met with ; but they are not quite extirpated. We 
have also different species of hawks ; two species, at least of owls ; 
and the shrike is sometimes seen. Rooks are more numerous than 
is desirable, and great numbers of daws nestle in our rocks. 
Hooded-crows and magpies are extremely rare, considering the 
number and extent of our woods. Wood-pigeons have not been 
abundant since the severe winter above-mentioned, when vast 
numbers of them were frozen to death, or perished with hunger. 
Of all the common singing birds, we seem to have more than our 
own share. Goldfinches used to be very numerous in the neigh - 
bourhood of Kinfauns Castle ; but few have been seen or heard, 
for the last five or six years. Flocks of those little migratory 
songsters, the siskins, pay frequent visits, to the alder trees on the 
margin of the Tay, during the winter months ; but seldom remain 
more than two or three days at a time. We are likewise visited, 

• In 1832, this parish was visited by the Asiatic cholera. The number of persons 
attacked by it was 14, of whom 5, all old persons, died.

at the approach of winter, by large flocks of fieldfares, anil cross- 
bills are then, too, sometimes found in the woods. The Tay is 
frequented by different sorts of wild ducks, particularly the teal 
and the widgeon ; and also by gulls, and birds of the awk kind. 

The Tay, besides abounding in excellent salmon, affords also 
fine trout of different kinds, particularly two species of sea- trout, 
the white and red, weighing from 2 to 6 lbs. The large bull- 
trout is sometimes found from 16 to 30 lbs. and upwards. Stur- 
geon of large size are sometimes, though but rarely, caught in the 
salmon fishers' nets. Pike, too, are very numerous ; and seals 
and porpoises are occasionally taken. 

One species of animals deserves here to be noticed, which has 
of late given more annoyance to the inhabitants of this parish, than 
all the other wild animals put together. It is of no consequence, 
indeed, whether we term this wild or domestic, as it seems de- 
termined, at all events, to make itself the latter. We mean that 
detestable and mischievous little animal, the brown or Norway 
rat, which has intruded itself into every dwelling-house and out- 
house in the parish ; and has multiplied to such a degree, not- 
withstanding all the means that have been used to destroy it, as 
to become a perfect pest. 

Plantations. — In this parish, all the common kinds of trees are 
found. Some of the plantations consist chiefly of hardwood trees ; 
such as oak, ash, elm, beech, &amp;c. ; while others consist mostly of 
Scotch fir, with larches and spruces intermixed. But some con- 
sist of a mixture of all these. Birches and mountain-ashes are not. 
very common, and are, for the most part, comparatively you no- 
trees. The young plantations consist, for the most part, of larch 
and oak. The oaks planted in woods, whether old or young, are 
almost all of the variety called Qjiercus robur, or true British oak. 
Bu many of those planted in hedge-rows, and along road-sides, are 
of the variety Quercus sessiliflorus, or Turkey oak, with narrow 
leaves and mossy acorn-cups, — a variety which is said to be infe- 
rior to the former, both in the quality of its wood, and also in that 
of its bark for the purposes of the tanner. 

In the vicinity of the mansion-houses, there grow sycamores, 
limes, poplars, Spanish chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, silver-firs, &amp;c. 

There are no trees in this parish very remarkable for age or 
size. Near Kinfauns Castle, grows a Spanish chestnut, 14 feet in 
circumference; an elm, 11 feet 7 inches; an ash, 12 feet; a sy- 
camore, 12 feet 9 inches. Near the east gate of Seggieden there 



1212 



PERTHSHIRE. 



is an oak, ll| feet. The boll of this tree is also very long; and 
being altogether of a very handsome appearance, and standing 
near the highway, it frequently attracts the attention of travellers. 
On the north side of the road here is a beech 1 1 feet ; a poplar, near- 
ly in front of the house, is 1 1 feet ; and a horse-chestnut, a little to 
the west, is 11 feet 4 inches. Close to the west end of Glencarse 
House there is a sycamore, 12 feet 2 inches, and containing nearly 
250 feet of wood, exclusive of bark. Right in front of Glendoick 
House, there is agean tree, 9 feet 8 inches; and another beside it is 
nearly of the same size ;— being the largest trees of that kind in this 
parish. At a little distance from these is an ash, 11 feet 4 inches. 

These girths were taken at 3| feet from the ground, except 
where there were large protuberances near the root, in which case 
they were taken a little higher. 

A little to the west of Kinfauns Castle, are a few trees of the 
Pinus sylvestris, or true Scotch fir. They are not remarkable for 
size, the largest being but 8 feet 2 inches in circumference ; but 
they may be mentioned, as being the only trees of that kind in the 
parish, at least so far as is known. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities — In the Castle of Kinfauns is kept a large old 
sword, probably made near 500 years ago, and to be used by both 
hands. It is shaped like a broad sword, and is five feet nine in- 
ches long, 2£ inches broad at the hilt, and of a proportionable 
thickness, with a round knob at the upper end, near 8 inches in 
circumference. This terrible weapon bears the name of Char- 
teris's sword ; and probably belonged to Sir Thomas Charteris, 
commonly called Thomas de Longueville, once proprietor of the 
estate of Kinfauns. Sir Thomas Charteris, alias Longueville, 
was a native of France, and of an ancient family in that country. 
If credit can be given to accounts of such remote date, when he 
was at the court of Philip le Bel, in the end of the thirteenth 
century, he had a dispute with, and killed a French nobleman in 
the king's presence. He' escaped, but was refused pardon. 

Having, for several years, infested the seas as a pirate, known 
by the name of the Red Reaver, from the colour of the flags he 
carried on his ships, in May 1301 or 1302, by Adamson's Chro- 
nology, Sir William Wallace in his way to France, encountered 
and took him prisoner. At Wallace's intercession the French 
King conferred on him a pardon and the honour of knight- 
hood. He accompanied Wallace on his return to Scotland, 



KIN FAUNS. 



1213 



and was ever after his faithful friend, and aiding in his ex- 
ploits. Upon that hero's being betrayed, and carried to Eng- 
land, Sir Thomas Charteris retired to Lochmaben, where he re- 
mained till Robert Bruce began to assert his right to the crown 
of Scotland. He joined Bruce ; and was, if we may believe 
Adamson, who refers to Barbour, the first who followed that king 
into the water, at the taking of Perth, January 8, 1313. 

Bruce rewarded his bravery, by giving him lands in the neigh- 
bourhood of Perth, which appear to have been those of Kinfauns, 
and which continued in the family of Charteris for many years. 

About ninety years ago, upon opening the burying vault under 
the aisle of the church of Kinfauns, erected by this family, there 
was found a head piece, or kind of helmet, made of several folds of 
linen, or some strong stuff, painted over with broad strips of blue 
and white ; which seems to have been part of the fictitious armour, 
wherein the body of Thomas Longueville, or Charteris, had been 
deposited. 

The estate of Kinfauns afterwards belonged to a gentleman of 
the name of Carnegie, of the Northesk family ; from whom it 
passed to that of Blair, whose heiress was married to John Lord 
Gray, grandfather of the present Lord. 

There is also in the house of Kinfauns, which stands on an ele- 
vated situation, overlooking the Tay, an iron flag or vane, 2 feet 
long and 1 foot broad, turning upon a staff of the same metal, 8 
feet high. It has the date, 1688, cut in the middle, and was 
wont to be placed on the top of the castle. This was a mark, or 
badge, of an heritable office, or power of admiralty over the river, 
annexed to the estate of Kinfauns, for preserving the fishing, and 
punishing all trespasses committed in destroying the salmon. In 
a charter under the great seal, in the year 1671, the old jurisdic- 
tion is explained and confirmed ; and, according to the tradition 
of the country, it was acknowledged by all vessels passing in the 
Tay, by a salute, or lowering of their colours to the castle. This 
power extends from Drumlie Sands below Dundee to the heart of 
the river, and entitles the family of Kinfauns to a salmon, annu- 
ally, out of every fishing boat on the Tay. 

There is an old house, still standing, on the estate of Glendoick, 
near the east end of the parish, in which the Pretender, Prince 
Charles Edward Stuart, is said to have passed a night after his 
defeat at Culloden. This house was at that time in the occupancy 
of Lord George Murray; but how his Lordship came to reside 



1214 



PERTHSHIRE. 



here is not well known, as he does not appear to have had any 
property in the neighbourhood. 

Eminent Characters.— .Besides Thomas Charteris, the founder 
of the Kinfauns family, another eminent individual connected with 
this parish deserves to be noticed, viz. the Right Honourable 
Robert Craigie, Lord President of the Court of Session, the 
grandfather of the present proprietor of the estate of Glendoick. 
It was he who purchased the lands belonging to said estate, and 
built the mansion-house, in which he afterwards occasionally re- 
sided, when his professional duties permitted. 

Parochial Registers.— The registers of this parish, regularly 
kept, are only two in number; viz. a register of births and bap- 
tisms, and a register of marriages. Both these commence in 
1646, and are continued to the present time, except that in the 
former there is a blank from 1691 to 1700, and in the latter, 
from 1692 to 1700. Since the year 1825, what was before only 
a register of baptisms, has been a register of both births and bap- 
tisms. Previous to that year, only the child's name and the date 
of its baptism, together with the name, designation, and residence 
of the father, were set down; the date of its birth and name of 
the mother being seldom, if ever, mentioned. The average an- 
nual number of births or baptisms registered is 16; but, as many 
parents are very neglectful in getting their children's births and 
baptisms entered, this probably falls somewhat short of the total 
number of births in the parish. The average annual number of 
marriages, for the last ten years, is 6£, and there can be no doubt 
but that this is correct. 

There has never been any thing that could be called a regular 
register of deaths kept in this parish. In the year 1783, a re- 
gister of burials was commenced, which was discontinued again in 
1793. The total number of burials, as shown by that register 
for those ten years, is only 53, averaging about five annually, 
which must have been greatly below the real number. From 
1793, indeed, to 1816, the dates of both the deaths and burials 
of a few distinguished persons, amounting to only nine in all, are 
set down ; but, since the last-mentioned year, no register what- 
ever of this kind has been kept. 

Besides the above, there are also the minutes of the kirk-ses- 
sion, composing a record of church discipline, which is occasion- 
ally examined and attested by the presbytery. A strict account 
is likewise kept of the management of the poor's funds, and this

last is usually audited and docqueted, once a-year, by a joint 
meeting of the heritors and kirk-session. 

Land-oivners. — The whole of the land owners of the parish, at 
present, with their respective valued rents, are as follow, viz. —

III. — Population. 

There is good reason to believe that this parish is not now so po- 
lous as formerly. Within the remembrance of very old persons 
yet living, it had three public- houses, two meal-mills, one brewer, 
and one baker. It has none of this now except one public-house. 
It also contained at a former period one village, if not more. This 
village was called Clien, and must have been of considerable size, 
as there is a saying among old people, that "it had a reeking him 
in it for every house in the parish of Semmiednres," St Madoes. 
The parish of St Madoes is, indeed, a small one, and probably 
contains fewer houses now than it did then ; but if these could be 
all brought together, they would form a pretty large village. So 
the one in question could not have been very small. 

The following is the state of the population at the different pe- 
riods mentioned :

1841, . 720 



What may have been the causes of the increase or decrease of 
population at distant periods, is not now well known ; but the great 
increase in 1821 was owing to the building of Kinfauns Castle, 
which was then going on, and which drew a great number of arti- 
sans affd labourers from other parishes, and, of course, as many of 
these as lodged within this parish were included in the population 
return thereof for that year. 

There is at present neither town nor village in this parish, the 
largest hamlet containing only 14 families. 



PERTHSHIRE. 

• 

The number of families of independent fortune residing in it 
is only three ; but there are usually more. 

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards, is 6 — being the whole number of land-owners of the 
parish.

It was stated in the last Statistical Account, that the people of 
this parish were rather above the middle size. This, however, 
does not appear to be the case now ; for though there are some 
persons to be found considerably above the ordinary stature, vet 
it would be easy to find as many others as far below it. 

There are, at present, two insane persons belonging to the pa- 
rish, both confined in the lunatic asylum. There is no person be- 
longing to it, who can properly be called an idiot ; but there are 
three of rather weak intellect. One old woman has lately become 
blind. There are none deaf and dumb. 

Smuggling is not at present known here, nor has it been so for 
a long time past. Poaching is still practised within the parish to 
a considerable extent — not, however, by its own inhabitants, but 
by fellows who come from Perth, or places in its neighbourhood, 
very often on the Lord's day, in bands of from three to six, or up- 
wards, accompanied by as many dogs, and scour our woods and 
hills in search of game. 

The number of illegitimate births within the last three years 
has been two. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — It has already been stated, that this parish con- 
tains altogether 4800 imperial acres. Of these, 2380 are arable, 
240 consist of pasture, and the remaining 2180 are occupied by 
wood, roads, ditches, &amp;c. 

The various kinds of trees commonly planted have already 
been described. There is little or no natural wood in the parish, 
so far as is known to the writer ; or, if there was any in for- 
mer times, the interstices have been so closely filled up with 
planted wood, as to give the whole the appearance of plantation. 
Within the last twenty or twenty -five years, several old plantations 
of large extent have been cut down, and the ground which they 
occupied has been replanted with various kinds of trees, amono- 



KIN FAUNS. 



1217 



which the oak and larch predominate. A considerable extent of 
ground, too, which was formerly allowed to lie waste, or which 
afforded very poor pasture, has, within the same period, been 
planted with those same sorts of trees. Some of the young plan- 
tations, however, consist chiefly of Scotch fir. The whole of 
these plantations, whether old or young, with very slight excep- 
tions, are all in a thriving condition, and are, generally speaking, 
under the very best management. 

Extent of Farms, Rent,  c. — Eleven farms, which lie wholly 
in the parish, contain respectively as follows, viz. 126, 126, 127, 
334, 145, 164, 170, 214, 216, 252, 287 imperial acres. Be- 
sides these, there are a number of pendicles and small farms, va- 
rying from two to thirty-eight imperial acres. And, lastly, there 
are six farms, some of them rather large, which lie partly in this, 
and partly in other parishes. The best land in the parish lets at 
about L.2, 16s. per imperial acre, while there is some not above 
L.l. The average rent per acre of arable land, for the whole 
parish, is about L.2, 2s. 9d. ; that is to say, this was the rent for 
the last year 1842 ; but, as some of the land is let at a money 
rent, and some partly at a money and partly at a grain rent, the 
rate above-mentioned is liable to some degree of fluctuation. 
There is no pasture land let by itself, except a few grass parks. 
These are commonly let, by public roup, to the highest bidder ; 
not at so much per acre, but at so much for the whole park, and 
for one season only at a time. The rent varies considerably from 
year to year ; bidders being determined in their offers, partly by 
the appearance of the grass, and partly by the prospective state 
of the cattle markets. 

The average wages and allowances of farm-servants, for the pre- 
sent year 1843 are as follows: Unmarried men, who usually 
lodge in a bothy, have about L.12 wages, with 6 Scotch bolls of 
oatmeal per year, and threepence worth of milk per day. Mar- 
ried men have about L.9 wages, with milk and meal as above, to- 
gether with 5 bolls of potatoes, and a house and small garden, 
worth about L.2, 5s. Foremen have generally about L.2, 10s. or 
L.3 more than common ploughmen ; but their wages vary accord- 
ing to the extent of their charge. Female servants have about L.5 

t s\£ h p T f 1 i ental ° f th 0 6 parish ' f ° r the y ear 1842  was a bout L.8940 including 
L.5574 for land, cottages, &amp;c, and L.3366 for fishings. As the prices of grain fof 
that year, however, were all but unprecedented low, the real rental for land must 
on former years, have been considerably more. St

of yearly wages, with bed and board. Agricultural day-labourers, 
and those employed in other out-of-door work, have about Is. 6d 
per day ; but some less during the short days of winter. Women, 
when employed in agricultural labour, such as in planting pota- 
toes, hoeing potatoes and turnips, hay-making, and the like, have 
8d. per day, without victuals. At lifting potatoes, women earn 
Is. per day, without victuals; and children of eleven or twelve 
years of age, when employed in this sort of work, are paid at 
the same rate as women. During harvest, reapers of all sexes 
and ages are paid according to the quantity of work done, viz. 
at the- rate of 3d, per threave for oats and barley, and 4d. for 
wheat. Journeymen masons, wrights, and blacksmiths, have 13s. 
a-week. But most artisans here are masters and apprentices, the 
former being generally paid according to agreement with em- 
ployers. 

There are at present 26 artisans in the parish, including 
apprentices. The number of male agricultural labourers hired 
by the year excluding farmers' sons, and also the small farmers 
who are usually labourers themselves, is 45, of whom 26 are mar- 
ried. There is evidently a preference shown by the farmers here 
to married over unmarried ploughmen ; as there are always more 
of the former than of the latter; and, taking all their allowances 
into account, they are paid at a somewhat higher rate. Perhaps 
they would have more of the married than they have, if they had 
houses to accommodate them ; for though there is abundance of 
houses on certain farms, yet there is a scarcity on others. 

Live-Stock. — The horses at present used for agricultural pur- 
poses are not of so large size as they are in some other parts of 
the country, nor as they were in this parish at a former period : 
but they are, for the most part, well-proportioned, vigorous, and 
spirited, and remarkably free from diseases. The statement in the 
former Statistical Account that, in this parish, "horses are bought, 
few being reared," does not now, in general, hold true ; though it 
may be still so on certain farms. 

Great attention has not been paid to the breeding of neat cattle. 
They are, generally speaking, of cross breeds ; and often rather 
inferior beasts. Cows kept for dairy purposes by some of the pro- 
prietors, and also by a few of the farmers, are of the Ayrshire 
breed — though, in most cases, perhaps, not quite pure. Some of 
the proprietors choose, however, to keep cows of a larger size than 
these, though they may be deficient as milkers. A few oxen of the 



KIN FAUNS. 1219 

pure West Highland breed are likewise usually kept by certain of 
the proprietors for the use of their own tables. But most of the 
cattle of this parish are crosses, as just stated ; and are generally 
deficient either in size or symmetry — not unfrequently in both. 
As there is but little land allowed to lie in pasture, young cattle 
are kept at home, only in the winter months, to consume the straw ; 
and sent to a distance to graze at the commencement of summer. 

There is only one farmer in the parish who keeps sheep. 
These are of the pure Leicester breed, and usually number about 
300. Two of the proprietors also keep a considerable number 
of the same breed ; but those kept by the proprietors, in general, 
are of the Highland or black-faced breed, as affording the most 
delicate mutton for the table. 

Character of the Husbandry. —The general character of the 
husbandry pursued may be termed judicious. In the low flat clay 
land near the Tay, the usual rotation of crops is the following: 
1st, fallow; '2d, wheat: 3d, beans and pease, 4th, wheat; 5th, 
barley ; 6th, grass ; 1th, oats. In the higher grounds, between 
this flat land and the hills, a five years rotation is most common ; 
viz. 1st, oats ; 2d, green crop ; 3c, wheat ; 4th, barley ; 5th, grass. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years, which is re- 
garded, both by the proprietors and tenants, as a favourable pe- 
riod. 

Farm- Buildings.— The state of the farm-buildings is very good. 
The farmers' dwelling-houses are almost all large and commodi- 
ous, as are also the courts of offices. Most of them are quite new, 
and all may be said to be comparatively new. 

The more recent agricultural improvements have been, in par- 
ticular, furrow-draining the strong land with tiles, and the intro- 
duction, to a considerable extent, of chemical manures of light 
carriage, such as crushed bones, rape dust, guano, &amp;c. These 
tiles are manufactured, to a large extent, by a neighbouring pro- 
prietor, Sir John Stewart Richardson, Bart, of Pitfour, on the 
patent principle of the Marquis of Tweeddale. The machinery 
for making these is wrought by a steam-engine, the clay being 
put in at one end of the machine, and the tiles coming out at the 
other, shaped to great nicety, and ready for being put into the 
kiln. The tenants in this parish, and indeed throughout the 
Carse of Gowrie in general, have used these drain-tiles to a great 
extent, and have thereby improved their crops amazingly, both 
in quantity and quality. And it is generally allowed, that, had 



12-20 



PERTHSHIRE. 



it not been for the improvement hereby effected, they could not 
have continued to pay their rents, although these are now lower 
than they were once. 

An embankment has lately been made on the estate of Kin- 
fauns, bv which an island in the Tav is connected with the main- 
land. This embankment is composed of the gravel taken from 
the bottom of the river, in the process of deepening it, is of great 
width, and is considered of sufficient strength to confine the ri- 
ver, in time coming, within narrower bounds ; and by means of it, 
a considerable extent of arable land may be expected to be ulti- 
mately reclaimed from what was formerly part of the bed of the 
river. 

Quarries. — Throughout the whole hilly part of the parish, quar- 
ries of whinstone may be got, of excellent quality, either for build- 
ing, or for road metal. Three are at present wrought. 

Fisheries. — The salmon fishings of the Tay are the only kind 
of fishings carried on in this parish. These belong partly to the 
Right Hon. Lord Gray, — partly to the city of Perth, partly to Sir 
John S. Richardson, Bart, of Pitfour, — and partly to Mr Hay of 
Seggieden. Lord Gray is the principal proprietor of these in this 
parish, and, indeed, in the whole river. His fishings are at pre- 
sent let in cumulo at a rent of L.3027, 16s. a-year, although, some 
time ago, they were as high as L. 4000. His Lordship's fishings 
within this parish are worth about L.2200 a-year, and give em- 
ployment to 60 men ; those belonging to the city of Perth and to Sir 
John S. Richardson, areletatrentsamountingtogetherto L.766, 13s. 
4d., and employ 32 men ; those belonging to Mr Hay of Seggieden 
are let at a rent of L.400, and, at present, employ only 12 men. 
Adding all these together, therefore, it appears that the whole 
salmon fishings of this parish are at present let at a yearly rent of 
L.3366, 13s. 4d., and give employment to 104 men. These are 
all fished by net and coble; and, besides the 104 men already- 
mentioned, a considerable number of women and boys derive em- 
ployment from them in working nets, &amp;c. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
It has been already stated that there is neither town nor vil- 
lage in this parish. The nearest market-town is Perth, which is 
only about one mile and two-thirds distant from its western ex- 
tremity. 

Means of Communication. —The nearest post-office is that of 
Perth, but there is now a receiving house within the parish. The 



KIN FAUNS. 



1221 



turnpike road from Perth to Dundee, which is kept in excellent 
repair, traverses the parish throughout its whole length ; and three 
coaches, including the Royal Mail, pass and repass along it daily, 
between the towns just mentioned. Several carriers also pass and 
repass every week. There are several cross roads, too, which are 
likewise kept in good condition. Two steam-boats, moreover, 
ply daily, in the river, between Perth and Dundee, during the 
summer months; and one constantly plys in winter, when the state 
of the river will permit ; and there is a small boat kept at Inchyra, 
a little below this parish, which conveys passengers to and from 
the steam-boats. There are, besides, two piers, on the side of the 
Tay, within this parish, at which vessels deliver coals, lime, &amp;c. 
and take in potatoes and grain. One of these piers, however, is 
now rendered nearly useless by the late improvements that have 
been made in the river ; but the pier of Inchyra is not far off, 
and is more conveniently situated for the eastern part of the pa- 
rish than either of the former. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which is the only 
place of meeting for public worship within the parish, is nearly as 
conveniently situated, for the majority of the population, as it could 
be. It is about two and one-fourth miles from the western, and 
two and three-fourth miles from the eastern extremity of the pa- 
rish. It has been built at three different times. The oldest part, 
which forms the body of the church, has no date upon it, but it is 
certainly of very great age. This is a long narrow quadrangular 
building, with very low walls, — so low, indeed, that it has evi- 
dently never been intended to have galleries in it. A gallery, 
however, has been erected in each end ; but these are so near the 
ceiling, that in some parts a middle-sized man cannot stand up- 
right. On the south side, there has been built an aisle, apparently 
at a later date, and which has belonged to the Kinfauns family 
from time immemorial. A very few years ago, as the church was 
too small to accommodate the parishioners and others who at- 
tended, another aisle was built, close to the west side of the for- 
mer one. The church is now altogether very comfortable, and 
notwithstanding the great age of part of it, is considered to be 
throughout quite substantial. It contains 416 sittings, all free. 

The manse was built in 1799, and received a large addition in 
1840. It is now one of the largest and most commodious in this 
part of the country, — is throughout in excellent condition, and 
valued at L.23, 12s. 



1222 



AKGYLESHIRE. 



The glebe contains about five imperial acres, and is valued at 
L.20. 

The stipend consists of 16 chalders, partly of grain and partly 
of oatmeal, together with L.10 of money; out of which, how- 
ever, the minister is bound to provide the communion ele- 
ments. These 16 chalders comprehend 4 bolls Scots of wheat, 
126 of barley, and 126 of oatmeal, all converted into money by the 
highest fiars of the county. It will be seen from this, that the 
amount of stipend must vary from year to year along with the 
prices of grain ; but the average annual amount, for the last seven 
years, was L.257, 18s. 10d. 

Before the great secession from the Establishment, in May 
last, the number of families belonging to the Established Church 
was 130 ; the number of Dissenting or Seceding families, was 12 ; 
and the number of Episcopalian families, 2. But, at the present 
time, it is impossible to say, with precision, how many families or 
individuals belong to the Establishment ; as the people are, in this 
respect, in a very unsettled state. Divine service in the Esta- 
blished Church has generally been very well attended. The 
average number of communicants for the last ten years has been 
in summer 345, and in winter 320. 

Education — There are two schools in the parish exclusive of 
Sabbath schools, viz. the parish school, situated close beside the 
church ; and another, situated in a barren moor, on the north bor- 
der of the parish, which derives most of its scholars from Bal- 
thayock, a detached portion of the parish of Kinnoull. 

The branches of education commonly taught in the parish 
school are, English reading and grammar, writing, arithmetic, and 
geography. Practical mathematics and Latin are occasionally 
taught. There have been sometimes also pupils learning Greek 
or French, but these were usually persons not belonging to the 
parish. The branches taught in the other school are the same as 
those commonly taught in the parish school. 

The parochial schoolmaster's salary is L. 34, 4s. 4|d. As the 
school-fees are very low, they do not amount, on an average, to 
more than L. 25 yearly; but of this sum more than L. 17 is sel- 
dom paid ; often considerably less. His other emoluments amount 
to about L. 7, 10s. at present; but the amount varies in different 
years ; and these emoluments are not inseparably connected with 
the office of schoolmaster. 

The rates of fees at the parish school are 2s. per quarter for 

3 



KIN FAUNS. 



1223 



reading; 2s. 6d. for writing; and 3s. for arithmetic; it being under- 
stood that those who pay the higher rate, get the lower branches 
for nothing. Thus, for instance, children paying for writing, get 
reading for nothing ; and those paying for arithmetic, get both 
l eading and writing for nothing. English grammar and geography 
are always taught gratis, as it is not the parents, but the teacher, 
who wishes the children to learn these branches. At the other 
school, the fees are a little higher. At both schools, the prin- 
ciples of the Christian religion are daily taught. 

The people in general are fully alive to the benefits of educa- 
tion ; and there are scarcely any children above six years who are 
not taught to read, and very few above nine who cannot write. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
for the last seven years was 12 ; that is to say, the average num- 
ber of names on the permanent roll, for these years, was 12 ; but 
as some of those persons had others depending on them, the total 
number relieved was considerably more. Those persons had 
each an allowance in money advanced to them every twenty-eight 
days, varying from 3s. to L.l, according to their necessities ; about 
half the number received each 12 cwt. of English coals annually ; 
and a still smaller number had their house-rents paid. So that 
the average sum allotted to each person on the permanent roll for 
those years, including money, coal, and house-rents, was L. 5, Os. 
7jd. annually. 

Besides the paupers on the permanent roll, there are always 
a number, more or fewer, receiving occasional relief; and the 
average annual sum distributed among these for the period above- 
mentioned was L. 4, 16s. 3d. It may be mentioned also that, 
within the same period, the kirk-session expended considerably up- 
wards of L. 100 on the board, medical treatment, &amp;c. of paupers 
in the Lunatic Asylum. 

The average annual amount of funds which have passed through 
the hands of the kirk-session for the purpose of relief to the poor, 
during the last seven years, has been L. 90, 19s. 2£d. This has 
been made up of church collections, averaging annually L.31, 8s. 
ld. ; and of mortcloth and proclamation dues, averaging annually 
L.A, 4s. 6£d. ; together with an additional sum, amounting, on an 
average, to L. 52, 6s. 6d. annually, consisting of the interest of 
capital, and of part of capital itself lifted. It ought to be observed, 
however, that, out of these L.90, &amp;c, there are paid the salaries 
of the synod, presbytery, and session clerks, — synod, presbytery, 



1224 



PERTHSHIRE. 



and church, officers, &amp;c, amounting to a little upwards of L.I 0 
a-year. 1 

No assessment, either legal or voluntary, for the support of the 
poor, has hitherto been necessary in this parish ; but, as the 
church collections and other casualties are now not half sufficient 
for the purpose, it is but too evident that some such mode of sup- 
port must very soon be had recourse to. 

J»7M.—There is only one inn in the parish, in which very good 
order .s kept, and it has had no bad effects on the morals of the 
people. Whatever may be the faults of our people here, intem- 
perance is a vice scarcely heard of among them. 

Fuel— The fuel commonly used consists of English coal, at from 
15s. to 17s. 6d. a-ton; or of Scotch coal, commonly called great 
coal, from the south of Fife, or the other collieries in the vicinity 
of the river Forth, at from 16s. to 18s. 6d. a-ton, according to the 
quality. This is delivered at the piers in the parish or its neigh- 
bourhood, and costs little for carriage. A good deal of wood is 
also used for fuel, consisting of the thinnings or prunings of plan- 
tations.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING. 

THE REV. GORDON MITCHELL, A.M., MINISTER. 



• — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— The name is believed to signify the Chapel of St Ma- 
dock, Madocus, or Modocus, one of the Culdees. 

Extent. — This extensive parish is about 12 miles in length, and 
9 in breadth, containing at least 64 square miles. 

Boundaries, c— It is situated in the ancient stewartry of Mon- 
teith, and is bounded on the north, by Muthill and Comrie ; on 
the south, by Kincardine and Kippen ; on the east, by Dunblane 
and Lecropt; and on the west, by Callander and Port-Monteith. 

Topographical Appearances.— Its figure, though somewhat irre- 
gular, approaches to a parallelogram. Situated betwixt the Gram- 
pians and the Ochill hills, with a variety of hill and valley, it con- 



KILMADOCK. 



1225 



tains one considerable hill, the Uamvar of the " Lady of the 
Lake." The view from this hill is splendid and extensive. 

That " magnificent mountain," as Sir W. Scott calls it, Ben- 
ledi, which signifies the mountain of God, appears to great advan- 
tage from 

" the mountain's southern brow, 
Where broad extended far beneath, 
The varied realms of fair Menteith." 

Climate, Sfc. — " This parish is an extremely healthful situ- 
ation. While the Grampian mountains protect it from the 
nipping frosts of the north, it is finely exposed to the Atlan- 
tic breeze and heat of the sun. The rapidity of the river Teith 
and the smaller rivers have likewise a strong tendency to sweep 
away those noxious vapours that haunt the low countries. Be- 
ing situated in the centre of the kingdom, the climate is mild 
and free of those rains that drench the western coast, and the 
piercing winds that blow incessantly on the inhabitants of the 
eastern borders. Hence in this parish there are very few diseases. 
The inhabitants enjoy a clear healthful atmosphere, and live to a 
good old age." 

" This parish abounds with fine water springs, from its pecu- 
liar situation on the side of the Grampian mountains. From the 
sides of Uaigh-mor a great number of springs issue, and at one 
place, near the burn of Garwall, there is a very large spring rush- 
ing out of the solid rock in the form of a spout, the water of which 
is said to be mineral. The town of Doune is plentifully sup- 
plied with springs of soft water that never dry in the warmest 
summer, and the banks of Teith abound with similar natural 
springs." — Old Account. 

Lakes or Lochs. — There are two lakes or lochs in the parish ; 

 The word Uamvar Uaigh-mor signifies the great cave. The hill is remarkable 
for a cavern in the south or the Kilmadock side, as it is for a chasm on the north. 
" Ua-var,"says Sir W. Scott, appendix to Lady of the Lake, note A, " as the name is 
pronounced, or moreproperly, Uaigh-mor, is a mountain to the north-east of the village 
of Callender in Menteith, deriving its name, which signifies the great den or cavern, 
from a sort of retreat among the rocks on the south side, said by tradition to have 
been the abode of a giant. In latter times it was the refuge of robbers and banditti, 
who have been only extirpated within these forty or fifty years." The last Account, 
written in 1794, says, « they were only extirpated about forty or fifty years ago." In 
one part of the south brow, large towering rocks are piled sublimely together. At 
a little distance is the " great cave,' so called,— a rocky cavern of great extent, in the 
form of a parallellograrn, connected with which are two small caves, one of them form- 
ing a very commodious place of shelter or concealment, and the other producing very 
line echoes when stones are pitched into it. Such are the « heights" and " wild heaths 
of Uamvar," 

With " the cavern where 'tis told 
A giant made his den of old."

the Loch of Watston, on the estate of Gartincaber, and Loch 
Maghaig, in the braes of Doune. The latter is formed chiefly from 
the springs above referred to. It forms nearly a circle, and is about 
a mile in diameter, while its depth is considerable. 

Rivers. — Besides the smaller streams, Keltie, Annat, and Ar- 
doch, the river Teith flows through the parish, and the Forth is 
its south boundary. The Teith rises partly at the head of Glen- 
gyle, flowing through Loch Venachar from Loch Achray and 
Loch Katrine, and partly in the Braes of Balquidder, flowing 
through Loch Voil and Loch Lubnaig, the two streams unitino- 
above Callander and joining the Forth two miles from Stirling. 

Cascades. — Though we cannot claim the neighbouring scenes 
of Bracklin Bridge and Pass of Leney, the " braes of Doune" can 
boast a number of beautiful cascades, formed by the Annat, — one 
or two at least rather considerable; while, not to mention the nu- 
merous torrents of Teith's rocky channel, splendid though artifi- 
cial cascades are formed by the Deanston embankments. There 
is also a beautiful fall of water from the canal connected with the 
works. 

Zigrtogy, c. — The fishes in the rivers are salmon, trout, &amp;c. : and 
pike and perch in the lakes. The salmon are said to come up the 
rivers for spawning in December, and to return in the end of Ja- 
nuary. Pearls have long been found in the Teith, in a certain 
shell-fish. The sea gull frequents the lochs, and the new dam of 
Deanston. A pure white magpie has sometimes been seen. Ex- 
cellent horses'are bred in the parish. The stag from Glenartney 
is a frequent visitor. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is in the possession of James Macfarlane, Esq. Wood- 
side cottage, a " bond of manrent granted by the Edmonstones of 
Duntreath for the manslaughter of James Stewart of Beith, um- 
quhile father to Sir James Stewart of that Ilk and Doune." 

Eminent Characters. — Connected with this parish by residence 
w ere, Napier of Merchiston, the immortal Inventor of Logarithms, 
— " the person," as Hume says, " to whom the title of great man 
is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever pro- 
duced ;" and Robert Spittel, the benevolent and philanthropic 
founder of the bridge of Teith, and also of the Stirling Hospital 
which bears his name. 

 Ballinton, in tin's parish, was the seat of the Lords Napier till the middle of last 
century. A copy of the Confession is subscribed in the session records by Lord Na- 
pier, with other ruling elders and the minister.

Connected with the parish by birth are, the Rev. John Row of 
Row, and the Rev. Alexander Fletcher of London. 

Land-owners. — The chief land- owners are, the Earl of Moray, 
who has one-third of the valued rent and upwards ; Henry Home 
Drummond, Esq., M. P. of Blair-Drummond; John Burn Mur- 
doch, Esq. of Gartincaber; Andrew Jardine, Esq. of Lanrick, 
nephew to the late W. Jardine, Esq., M. P. ; Major Buchanan 
of Cambusmore ; Captain Graham of Coldoch ; Archibald Stir- 
ling, Esq. of Keir; and George Binning Home, Esq. of Ar- 
gaty, &amp;c. 

The estate of Lanrick, formerly the property of Sir Evan Mur- 
ray Macgregor, passed in 1840 into the hands of William Jardine, 
Esq., M. P., partner at Canton of James Matheson, Esq. of 
Achany, M. P. The suggestions of Mr Jardine on the subject 
of the late war in China are said to have met with due conside- 
ration from the British Government. He died in London in Fe- 
bruary 1843. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers commence in 1623. 
They are not voluminous. One volume was destroyed by fire in 
the school-house. 

Antiquities. — The principal antiquities are, Doune Castle and 
the Bridge of Teith. This castle is thus noticed by Sir Walter 
Scott in Waverley : " On the opposite bank of the river, and 
partly surrounded by a winding of its stream, stood a large and 
massive castle, the half-ruined turrets of which were already glit- 
tering in the first rays of the sun. It was in form an oblong 
square of size sufficient to contain a large court in the centre. The 
towers at each angle of the square rose higher than the walls 
of the building, and were in their turn surmounted by turrets 
differing in height and irregular in shape. This noble ruin," 
adds Sir Walter in the note, " is dear to my recollection, from 
associations which have been long and painfully broken. It 
holds a commanding station on the banks of the river Teith 
and has been one of the largest castles in Scotland. Murdock, 
Duke of Albany, the founder of this stately pile, was be- 
headed on the castle-hill of Stirling, from which he might see 
the towers of Doune, the monument of his fallen greatness. In 
1745-46, as stated in the text, a garrison on the part of the che- 
valier was put into the castle, then less ruinous than at present. 
It was commanded by Mr Stewart of Balloch, as governor for 



1228 



PERTHSHIRE, 



Prince Charles. He was a man of property near Callander. I bis 
castle became at that time the actual scene of a romantic escape 
made by John Home, the author of Douglas, and some other pri- 
soners, who, having been taken at the battle of Falkirk, were con- 
fined there by the insurgents. The poet, who had in his owli 
mind a large stock of that romantic and enthusiastic spirit of ad- 
venture which he has described as animating the youthful hero of 
his drama, devised and undertook the perilous enterprise of escap- 
ing from his prison. He inspired his companions with his senti- 
ments, and when every attempt at open force was deemed hoper 
less, they resolved to twist their bedclothes into ropes, and thus 
to descend. Four persons, with Home himself, reached the ground 
in safety ; but the rope broke with the fifth, who was a tall lusty 
man. The sixth was Thomas Barrow, a brave young English- 
man, a particular friend of Home's. Determined to take the risk, 
even in such unfavourable circumstances, Barrow committed him- 
self to the broken rope, slid down on it as far as it could assist him, 
and then let himself drop. His friends beneath succeeded in 
breaking his fall ; nevertheless, he dislocated his ankle, and had 
several of his ribs broken. His companions, however, were able 
to bear him off in safety. The Highlanders next morning souo-ht 
for their prisoners with great activity. An old gentleman told the 
author he remembered seeing the commander, Stewart, 

M Bloody with spurring, fiery red with haste, 

riding furiously through the country in quest of the fugitives." 

Doune Castle stands on a round hill or mound. It is a mas- 
sive edifice with a spacious square tower 80 feet in height, at 
one end of the front, and another, but smaller, behind the oppo- 
site extremity, nearly 40 feet in height, forming the whole into 
an ample quadrangle. It is uncertain when it was erected, 
though the tradition is, that part of it was built by Murdock, one 
of the Dukes of Albany, two of whom occupied it successively as 
an occasional residence. It was frequently occupied, in the six- 
teenth century, by Margaret, daughter of Henry VII. and widow 
of James IV. Macgregor of Giengyle held it in 1745, when 
John Home was confined in it It has long been the property 
of the Earl of Moray, and gives the title to his eldest son. This 
extensive building overhangs a steep and narrow green bank, being 
romantically situated on a peninsula at the conflux of Teith and 
Ardoch, its lofty towers rising far above the surrounding trees, and

producing a fine effect. The great gate stands in the north, and 
the iron gate with its bars still remains entire. The north-west 
corner is said to have been the family residence. There are se- 
veral cellars and prisons on the ground-floor, on each side of the 
entry, and after being introduced to the great area, the ascent to 
the tower and family mansion is by two inside stairs, standing over 
against each other. The western stair leads up to a spacious lobby 
that divides the kitchen from the great hall, which is 63 feet by 
25. The fire-place in the kitchen occupies an entire side of the 
room, and is supported by a strong arch, which is still entire. The 
eastern stair leads up to the apartments in the tower. One is a 
spacious room with an arched roof and a large fire-place, contain- 
ing a circular pillar. From its south-east corner, a narrow stone 
stair descends by a subterraneous passage into a cell or dungeon. 

The writer of the former account doubts the truth of the com- 
mon tradition as to the founder of this castle ; but there is every 
reason to think that Murdock must have built part of it, as the 
difference between the more and less ancient parts of it may still 
he traced. 

Murdock was son of Robert, who was son of Robert II. King 
of Scotland. He was taken prisoner by the English at the battle 
of Homelden in 1401, and succeeded his father in the Government 
on the 3d of September 1420, but resigned it four years after- 
wards. His resignation was followed by an accusation of high 
treason against him as well as his two sons and his father-in-law, 
who were seized and carried prisoners to Stirling. Murdock was 
taken betwixt Doune and Dunblane, at a small rivulet, which was 
therefore called Murdochs ford, a name which it retains to this 
day. Though the castle is roofless, the walls are still entire, hav- 
ing the appearance of great solidity and strength. Doune castle 
is mentioned in the beautiful traditional ballad which relates the 
death of the " Bonnie Earl of Moray." 

Interesting as it is on account of its other associations, " it 
is rendered still more interesting," says Dr Graham Sketches 
of Perthshire, " by its having been for some time the residence of 
Mary Queen of Scots. And though Sir W. Scott, in the observ- 
ance of the Horatian rule —

Bridge of Teith. The Bridge of Teith is a strong building 
of two arches, situated half-way between the castle and Dean- 
ston. It was erected in 1535 by Robert Spittel, tailor to 
King James IV. or rather to Queen Margaret. Tradition 
assigns to it a somewhat singular origin. Once on coming to 
the ferry, Mr Spittel found he had left his money behind- 
exceptmg as tt .s sometimes added, a small coin, which he cut in 
two with his scissors, offering one-half as his fare. The boatman 
refused to ferry him over, and the generous tailor built the bridge I 
Be this as ,t may, Mr Spittel must have been a man of noble 
mmd and benevolent heart, and the hospital which he founded in 
St.rhng for the relief of decayed tradesmen is another and an ap- 
propriate monument of his patriotic virtue. Inside the western 
parapet of the bridge, are the armorial bearings of England and of 
Scotland, in separate shields surmounted by crowns f 

At some distance from these is the following inscription, in the 
centre o which is a shield with a device resembling a spread eagle 
and in the base a pair of large scissors formed en saltier « f N '

Scottish language was called Spittel. It is a singular coincidence 
that the people at first were, it is said, as jealous and suspicious of 
the bridge of Teith, as they were of the Deanston mill 250 years 
after. " Though this goodly edifice was a work of charity, and 
intended exclusively for their convenience," as indeed the words 
" of alms" express, the common people could not help regarding 
it with all the suspicion and dislike which the lower classes of 
Scotland too often entertain respecting attempts at improvement, 
comfort, or decoration. While they took advantage of the expen- 
sive public work erected for their service, they could not help 
thinking upon the good old Bridge of Callander with feelings of 
tenderness, and this sentiment seems to have extended itself into 
a comparison between the old and the new bridge, much to the 
disadvantage of the latter. The rhyme in which this sentiment 
was embodied has been preserved by tradition, though the object 
of its flattery is supposed not to have been in existence since the 
time of the Reformation — 

The new brig of Doune, and the auld brig of Callander, 
Four-and-twenty bows in the auld brig of Callander." 

This, we suppose, alludes to the circumstance of there being no 
fewer than the extraordinary number of twenty-four arches in the 
ancient bridge   

Of the former church at Kilmadock, there is still standing a 
small part, chiefly the east gable. The ruin is highly picturesque, 
and the effect of the beautiful ivy-mantled window is in fine keep- 
ing with the romantic scenery of this sequestered spot. Out of 
six chapels which are said once to have existed in the parish, four 
have entirely disappeared, — those of Annat, Lanrick, Torry, and 
Walton. There is still to be seen at the bridge of Teith, a wall 
said to have been part of an old chapel there. Of the chapel at 
Newton there remain the west gable and part of the side walls. 

A cave is said to have been discovered at Coldoch, and there 
is the appearance of a camp close to Doune Lodge, with a 
laroe stone at some distance called the " camp stone," said to have 
given the property its former name Cambuswallace quasi Wallace 
camp, — while one or two standing stones are to be seen, which 
are supposed to be Druidical monuments. Before the date of 
last Account, several graves were discovered below Rosehall, en- 
closed with four stones each, in the form of the ancient tombs of 
Caledonia, but no bones remained ; from which it is evident that

they are of great antiquity. It is very remarkable that before they 
were discovered, there was a local tradition that a battle was once 
fought near this spot, and that several were killed in the fray. 
The tombs discovered may have been the graves of these ancient 
chieftains. 

Modern Buildings. — The principal modern buildings are the 
parish church at Doune, Lanrick Castle and Suspension bridge, 
Deanston House manufactory and village, the new Secession 
chapel at Bridge of Teith. 

III. — Population. 

The population of this parish in 1 755 was only 2730 
By the last census 1841 it had increased to . 4050 
In 1831 it was . 3752 

J821, . 3J50 

1792, at the date of last Statistical Account, it was 3209 

One cause of.the great increase during the decade between 1321 
and 1831 is said to have been the extension of the Deanston 
Works. 

Language. — The language generally spoken is provincial Eng- 
lish, with Gaelic by a few families. The common language, in last 
Account, is said to have been " a mixture of Scotch and English." 
" In the quarter towards Callander," says Mr M'Gibbon, " the 
generality of the inhabitants speak Gaelic," as some of them do to 
this day. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— The parish contains about 51,200 acres, a part 
of which remains constantly waste or in pasture. A great deal 
might, with a profitable application of capital, be added to the 
cultivated land of the parish. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land is said to be 
about L.l per acre. 

Great improvements have been recently made in the parish. 
Besides those on Lanrick and at Argaty, we cannot omit to no- 
tice the system carried on by Mr Smith at Deanston, who has not 
only completely changed the face of the country, but turned the 
wilderness into a garden. It is only necessary to refer to Mr 
Smith's published « Remarks on Thorough Draining and Deep 
Ploughing." These are the two great principles of the well 
known " Deanston system." Mr Smith holds furrow draining to 
be the foundation of subsoil plouo-hincr. 

 This system is thus spoken of in the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture June 



KILMADOCK. 



1233 



Manufactures. — In this parish are the celebrated Deanston 
Cotton-works. The following correct description of them is taken 
from the Inverness Courier. 

" Deanston Cotton- Works employ above 1100 persons, young 
and old, and contain the most perfect machinery in the kingdom. 
The first erection took place in the year 1785, by the Messrs 
Buchanan of Carston, four brothers, the eldest of whom was an 
intimate acquaintance of Sir Richard Arkwright, and was his first 
agent in Glasgow for the sale of cotton twist. The English had 
annoyed Sir Richard so much by invading his invention, that he 
resolved to instruct young Scotsmen in the art, in preference to 
his own countrymen ; and among others, Mr Archibald Buchanan 
now manager of the Catrine works, Ayrshire, went apprentice to 
Sir Richard, and was the only one who had the privilege of living 

1889. " The thorough or Deanston mode of draining, of so great benefit, not for 
Scotland only, but for the whole kingdom, is as yet in its infancy. Already, the 
fume and the utility of it are spreading all over the island, and we have not a doubt, 
in a short time, there will not be found a spot, where improvements are carried on, 
that has not been 1 made anew' by means of this simple, yet powerful and efficient 
system of draining." " The principle of the system," as explained by Mr Smith him- 
self, " is the providing of frequent opportunities for the water rising from below, or 
falling on the surface, to pass freely and completely off." Mr Smith adds, that the 
most appropriate appellation for it, therefore, seems to be • the frequent drain sys- 
tem," or " thorough drainage system." In deference to Mr Smith, but in justice to 
his claims as the inventor, it seems not inappropriately called the Deanston system. 
" In proceeding to apply this system of drainage to a farm, the first object," says Mi- 
Smith, " is to allow a sufficient fall or level, as it is commonly termed, for a main 
drain to receive the water flowing from the ordinary or parallel drains." We do not 
here describe the system, referring to Mr Smith's own description. Suffice it to re- 
mark the necessity of" closely covering the upper surface of the stones with a thin 
thatch or flauteher, divot or turf, as many drains are ruined at once by the running in 
of the loose earth." 

With regard to deep ploughing, Mr Smith remarks, " All who have ever studied 
or experienced the most common gardening must be aware of the important advan- 
tages of deep working, and, when it can be attained in the broad field of farming, at 
so small a cost as 9s. per acre, they may easily believe that the whole will be more than 
doubly repaid in every succeeding grain crop, and abundantly even in pasture. When 
this subject was treated of in the Second Report of Drummond's Agricultural Mu- 
seum, published in March 1833, the system was beginning to be adopted in a few 
places, in a very few districts of Scotland, England, and Ireland, and, in most in- 
stances, on a very limited scale. Since then, the intrinsic merits and evident results 
of the system have raised its character even with many of its former opponents, and 
one cannot now travel almost anywhere in the country without, seeing, either on a 
large or a small scale, the operation of thorough draining going on. The deep plough- 
ing is not yet so general, but it will undoubtedly follow ; and, it is to be regretted, 
that, in the meantime, some zealous and good farmers, not aware of its advantages, 
are filling their drains so near the surface, as to mar the future thorough application 
of the system of deep working." " I have been often asked," says Mr Smith in a 
note, " if I would recommend subsoil ploughing of land which had not been drained. 
To this I answer, certainly not.  «  So soon as wet lands are thoroughly 
drained, deep ploughing may follow with the greatest advantage, but not sooner." 

" Thorough draining," adds Mr Smith, " is the foundation of all good husbandry, 
and when combined with deep ploughing, ensures a general and uniform fertility, as- 
sisted, no doubt, by the essentials, thorough working and cleaning, ample manuring, 
and a proper rotation of cropping."

m the house with him. Sir Richard was an old bachelor, and was 
so intent on his schemes and calculations, that young Buchanan 
and he often sat for weeks together, on opposite sides of the fire, 
without exchanging a syllable. The old man, however, was in his 
other moods extremely kind and familiar, and recollected his pupil 
in after life. 

" The powerful fall and supply of water in the Teith having sug- 
gested to the elder of the Buchanans the idea of placing a cotton- 
spinning establishment at this spot, where it now stands, the scheme 
was soon ripened into action. There was a lint mill with a dam 
upon the property, and the owner disposed of the mill to him, and 
gave him a feu of six acres along the margin of the stream. 
Carding and roving for jenny-spinning were then the only proces- 
ses which were driven by power as it is termed, and for this pur- 
pose the old lint mill was appropriated, a building being erected 
close by for the reception of the jennies. At first, the Highland- 
ers were shy of entering this tower of Babel, with its unknown 
sounds and sights : they considered it a sort of prison. From the 
respectable manner in which the works were conducted, they were 
gradually reconciled to the employment, and were quite willing 
that both themselves and children should be engaged. Archi- 
bald Buchanan was then a fine athletic young man of eighteen 
or nineteen, of a social generous disposition ; he mingled with the 
people ; and thus a number of active young men of the district, of 
the better classes, were led to work at Deanston ; and so expert 
did they become, that as tine yarn was then spun at Deanston as 
has subsequently been made by the best spinners in Manchester. 
Some of these young men afterwards made fortunes in business,' 
and the firm of the Macphails in Glasgow extensive spinners and 
power weavers had its origin in one of the family repairing from 
Ross-shire to work at Deanston. 

" In the year 1793, the works at Deanston passed into the hands 
of a Yorkshire Quaker, a benevolent old gentleman named Floun- 
ders; and in 1808 they became the property of James Finlay and 
Co. from Glasgow, with whom Mr Archibald Buchanan had be- 
come connected. The establishment was at this time remodelled 
under the charge of the present manager, Mr Smith a nephew 
of Mr Buchanan, who is well known for his mechanical as well 
as his agricultural inventions and improvements. In 1822, the 
company made arrangements with the neighbouring proprietor's for

additional water-power, by which they acquired a fall of 20 feet, 
making the whole fall 33 feet. 

" An extensive plan of enlargement and improvement was now 
adopted ; the works were thriving, and machinery was daily be- 
coming more and more perfect. In this plan, it was proposed to 
erect eight water wheels in one square building, each to be 36 feet 
in diameter, and 11 feet wide inside, being overshot, and having 
the shrouding and buckets 24 inches deep. At present four of 
those wheels are in operation, and pedestals have been erected for 
two more. They are the most gigantic-looking things we ever 
saw, and distribute, by innumerable shafts, the whole of the vast 
concentrated power over the different apartments. Each wheel 
has a power equal to eighty horses  

" The whole of the works are lighted with gas, and they posses- 
sed this advantage so early as 1813, before any of our towns could 
boast the same brilliant light. Tunnels are made all underground, 
by which communication can be had with the different depart- 
ments without going out of doors, and every other facility has been 
adopted for carrying on the operations. Carts proceed daily to 
Glasgow with the produce. The construction of the various works 
must have cost an enormous outlay of money, and a considerable 
charge annually will be brought against it in the shape of interest; 
but we were informed that the power being once acquired, the 

annual expenditure for management and repairs is small indeed 

not exceeding, on the average, L.400 per annum. The steadiness 
of the stream of the Teith, which flows from Loch Katrine and 
five of her lakes, renders the command of water extremely uni- 
form, and the loss of a few hours' work per day for a week or 
fortnight in the driest period of summer is all the stoppage the 
works ever experience. 

" The process of manufacture may be described as follows: 

The bags of cotton, containing each about 300 pounds weight, are 
laid upon the floor in rows, taken out and thrown into a machine 
called a Willow. This willow is a revolving cylinder with iron 
teeth, which divides and breaks down the masses. The materiel 
is then conveyed to another machine — the Angel. The cotton is 
then weighed in small portions, spread out, and put into a machine 
which determines and regulates the grist of the thread. Passing 
through pairs of rollers, the cotton is struck by iron beaters as in 
a thrashing-mill at the rate of six thousand feet per minute  
The lighter dust is drawn through a revolving wire sieve by the

action of a fanner, and is thus blown to the open air, ridding all 
the processes of that annoyance which used to be so hurtful to 
health. The cotton is now in the form of a web — is next wound 
on rollers — and put to the carding-machines, wherebv the fibres 
ol the cotton are completely separated, and any remaining lumps 
or refuse are taken out. 

" The machines used here are of a peculiar construction, in which 
a process formerly done by hand is now performed by mechanism, 
and for which Mr Smith holds a patent. By the variously im- 
proved construction of this machine, the saving of labour in this 
process will amount to about thirty per cent. Some peculiar and 
beautiful movements are introduced, but it is impossible to de- 
scribe them. The next process to which the material passes, is 
the drawing machine, wherein the fibres are drawn into a parallel 
and longitudinal position, by means of successive pairs of rollers, 
the first pair holding the material, and allowing it to pass with a 
slow progress, whilst the second pair lay hold of it and pull it in 
the same way as a man draws straw for thatching. When the 
fibres have been sufficiently brought to parallel which is done by 
repeating this process three or four times in the same machine, 
the material is carried to what is called a roving frame, where it 
is drawn to a much smaller grist, and then twisted into a thready 
form, and is wound upon bobbins. These bobbins are carried to 
spinning machines, when the grist is still more reduced, until the 
thread reaches its desired size, when it is twisted sufficiently firm 
to become thread fit for weaving. The thread intended for warp 
is spun upon a machine called a throstle, which is a modification 
of Sir Richard Arkwright's original machine, and at this work a 
recent American invention has been adopted ; it admits of great 
velocity in the twisting process, and, consequently, produces a 
much greater quantity of work in the same time. The bobbins, 
by the movements of which the twist is thrown into thread, go at 
the amazing velocity of 8000 revolutions per minute  The effect 
is magical. These machines are attended by children, chieflv 
little girls, who are singularly, dexterous, and they are superin- 
tended in divisions by grown-up women — one male superintendant 
having the general charge of a department. The work is light 
and easy, but requires constant attention and great cleanliness and 
order, and thus it may be said to form an excellent school for train- 
ing the young to habits of attention and industry. These little 
girls follow the employment with spirit, and cheerfulness, from

eight to twelve hours a-day. The yarn intended for woof or weft 
is upon the mule jenny, a machine invented by a Mr Crompton, 
near Bolton, Lancashire. It is an adaptation of the twisting pro- 
cess of the old jenny, or meickle wheel of this country, to the draw- 
ing process of Sir Richard Arkwright. Hitherto such machines 
have generally been worked by men of great strength and skill, 
who acquired high wages, and were the chief movers in all the 
combinations of the cotton trade. To obviate the inconvenience 
of these strikes, the attention of mechanical men has been for 
many years directed. The machines employed here were invent- 
ed by Mr Smith some years ago, for which he holds patents for 
the United Kingdom, most of the countries on the continent of 
Europe, and for America. The machine is now being extensive- 
ly introduced in the trade generally. Mr Smith has just com- 
pleted an adaptation of this principle to mules for spinning wool, and 
which is likely to be of vast importance in the present rising state 
of the woollen manufactures of our country. 

" The invention of this machine removes the only laborious and 
slavish employment that remained in the cotton manufacture, and 
effects a saving of about 50 per cent, besides producing an article 
of superior quality, and insuring regularity. It has created a de- 
mand for young females' labour, who are better paid than when 
they worked under the spinners — the money being thus more 
equally distributed. It gives, besides, to this country an import- 
ant advantage over the cheap labour of other countries. 

" In preparing the warp for the weaving process, from 500 to 
1000 bobbins are arranged in regular rows in a wooden frame, and 
from these the threads proceed towards a beam, or roller, on 
which they are wound, having a peculiarly beautiful appearance, the 
threads converging towards the mass, like the rays of the sun from 
behind a cloud. Being collected, the threads are passed through 
a machine whereby the threads are stiffened, by being immersed 
in a paste formed of flour and glue boiled together with water. 
Brushesattached to mechanism sweep along the surfaces of threads, 
laying all the fibres, and rendering them smooth and uniform. 
Fanners are put in rapid motion, and blow heated air upon the 
mass of threads, so as to render it perfectly dry before being 
placed on the weavers' beam. From this it is carried to the 
power-loom, where the whole operations are performed by me- 
chanism; the young women, who attend two looms each, having 
merely to supply the woof from time to time, and mend such

threads of the warp as may break in the process. The woof is 
supplied in little pirns or cops, formed on the self-acting mules ; 
each loom will, on cloth of ordinary thickness, such as a common 
calico, produce about thirty yards per day, making 60 the work of 
each girl. These looms, to the number of about 300, are arrang- 
ed in rows, with alleys between, in a most spacious apartment, 
which, when lighted with gas, has a most magnificent effect. 

" In going over the vast establishment, it seemed to us like en- 
tering an illuminated village, and we shall not soon forget the effect 
of 300 gas lights in one apartment. This building is quite novel 
m its structure, the roof being composed of groined arches, sup- 
ported on cast-iron columns, 12 feet high, and the rise of the 
arches being 6 feet ; the greatest height of the ceiling is 18 feet. 
The groins are in squares of 33 feet 6 inches, and in the centre 
of each groin there is a circular opening 8 feet in diameter, sur- 
mounted by a handsome glass cupola light, affording a most uni- 
form and perfect light for the operations carried on below. The 
arches are rendered water-tight in the most simple manner by a 
coating of pitched coal tar, about a quarter of an inch in thick- 
ness, and the whole is covered with three or four feet of soil, 
intended to form a garden for flowers and other plants. It is re- 
markable, that during the intense frost of the winter 1837-8, the 
hardening did not penetrate more than one and a-half inches' into 
this soil— owing, doubtless, to the heat from below. This building 
covers altogether upwards of half an acre, and every individual in 
the apartment can be seen from any point. The whole is fire-proof. 
The general order of management at the Deanston Works is very 
much on the principle of Arkwright— a proof of the talents of that 
eminent person. There is a head or superintendent to each de- 
partment—every one has his own allotted part— and in most cases 
they are paid by the piece, not in weekly wages. They receive 
the amount of their earnings every Thursday morning that being 
the market day ; and the youngest individual about the works is 
paid his or her wages into their own hand, which seems to give them 
an idea of personal consequence. They have all the privilege of 
leaving any moment they choose, without previous warnino- ; and 
we were informed that this is found to insure a more steady,°aaree- 
able, and lengthened service than could be obtained by the firmest 
indenture. There is no fine or punishment, excepting for dam- 
age to the works through evident carelessness. The order of the 
establishment is preserved by the dismissal of offending individuals, 



K1LMAD0CK. 1239 

or their banishment for a limited period. By  stopping the sup- 
plies, 1 everv member of the family is interested in the good con- 
duct of the" whole, and a banished child, man, or friend, finds no 
rest at home. The morals of the people are in general very cor- 
rect ; no drunkard is permitted about the establishment. We in- 
quired of an intelligent medical gentleman at Doune Dr M'Ansh 
whether the spinners were as healthy as the other villagers. His 
answer was, « They are not so robust owing to their confine- 
ment, but their health is as steady and uniform.' 

" Immediately adjoining the works is a handsome little village, 
built and founded by the company, which contains about 1200 
inhabitants. The houses are neat, built in one long street paral- 
lel to the water course, and are two stories high, with attics. 
They are most exemplary patterns of cleanliness, and to each 
house is attached a small piece of garden ground, and a range of 
grass plot for bleaching. A school-room is united to the esta- 
blishment, capable of containing 200 children,, and a teacher is 
paid by the company. The young children generally go to school 
when about five years of age ; and as none are admitted into the 
works until they are nine, they are mostly good readers, and able 
to write and cypher before they enter the works. The children 
employed in the works from nine to thirteen years of age, must, 
according to the Factory Act, work only eight hours per day, and 
about three hours are devoted to the school-room. The number 
at this age amounts to 100, and they are divided into relays of 33 
each; so that while two relays are at work, one is attending school. 
The youth above thirteen years of age and under sixteen are ex- 
pected to attend an evening school four nights in the week ; and 
a Sabbath school in the village contains about 150 pupils. Thus 
the works at Deanston seem to possess every facility and recom- 
mendation ; they have changed the aspect of the country — beauti- 
ful and romantic as it is — by introducing into it habits of industry, 
order, and the highest mechanical genius and dexterity ; they 
cause a circulation of money to the extent of about L.20,000 per 
annum ; they furnish employment for the people of all ages; they 
have called forth the spirit and activity of the agriculturists to 
meet the ever-recurring demands of the place ; and in all respects 
they are a splendid monument of British enterprise, skill, and per-

Market-Town.— Stirling is the principal market for grain. It 
is eight miles distant from Doune. 

Villages — The only two considerable villages in the parish are 
Doune and Deanston. Doune is a pleasant village, with three 
principal streets. It contains a market cross, a handsome church, 
and several good houses. It was formerly celebrated for three 
manufactures,— viz. skinning, Highland purses, and Highland 
pistols. The houses are well built, mostly slated, and of ra- 
ther recent erection. Deanston, the other considerable villas, 
is mentioned in the Lady of the Lake, where it it spelt Deanstone. 

Tony and Laniick now we past, 
And Deaustoue lies behind them cast. 

It is a very neat and clean-looking village, consisting of two 
rows of houses, which form one wide street, with a lane behind. 
The one row, which is small, is several feet below the level of 
the street; the other consists of four detached divisions of equal 
extent. The houses are uniform two stories high with attics and 
white-washed, giving the village a very neat appearance. 

There are four hamlets or small villages besides, viz. Buchany, 
or Burn of Cambus, Drumvaich, Delvorich, and Bridge of Teith, 
sometimes called the Cotton Row, and formerly the new town of 
Doune,— a name which is now more applicable to Deanston. Bu- 
chany and Burn of Cambus were formerly distinct villages, but 
three houses of the latter onlv remain. 

Means of Communication.— Doune is a post-town. We have a 
mail-gig daily between Stirling and Callander, and two carriers 
twice a-week betwixt Doune and Stirling. Though there is no 
great length of turnpike roads in the parish, a stage-coach runs 
between Callander and Stirling daily in summer, and twice a- 
week  Mondays and Fridays in winter. Last two summers, there 
were two coaches daily connecting with the Edinburgh and Glas- 
gow Railway. 

The former Account said, « There is no bridge over Teith below 
Callander, except one near Doune, called Bridge of Teith." 
This complaint continued to be well founded up till 1842, when 
a suspension bridge was erected at Lanrick on plans by Mr Smith 
of Deanston.

tunst and engineer-ranking with not only the Wattses and Arkwrights for his me- 
chanical skill but also with the Howards and Clarksons for his benevolence

Ecclesiastical State. — Formerly the parish church stood at Kil- 
madoek, the site of the " ancient monastery of St Madocus ;" but 
it was taken down in 1744. The last church was built at Doune, 
in 1746. The former Account says that it was built about the 
year 1756, the first incumbent of the new church being Mr James 
Smith. The fact is, Mr Smith's predecessor preached ten years 
in Doune. Mr Smith succeeded Mr Archibald Napier in 1755, 
his other predecessors being, Messrs George Campbell 1705- 
1711, John Logan, David Drummond, John Edmonstone, Wil- 
liam Edmonstone, who is mentioned in the kirk-session records 
from 1628, and Alexander Fergy 1576, with Robert Fogo and 
Thomas Redoch reidars readers in 1576 and 1569 respectively. 

The church is situated towards the east end of the parish, and 
is convenient for the greater part of the population. It is a very 
handsome if not elegant church : and on the whole, very commo- 
dious. The style is chiefly Gothic. 

The only interesting benefactions on record are a set of eight 
Bibles and Psalm Books, besides pulpit ones, presented to the 
kirk-session by the Earl of Moray on the opening of the new 
church ; and the only important ones four silver communion cups, 
with the other necessary utensils, presented by William Mitchell, 
Esq. of Bushy Park, Jamaica, a native of Doune. 

The church is seated for 1121, but is capable of accommodating 
1400 persons. The age of the manse is unknown. It was repair- 
ed thirty years ago. 

The glebe is stated in last Account at six acres in extent. It 
contains upwards of seven acres, including the garden. The sti- 
pend is 18 chalders, half meal and half barley, with L. 10 for 
communion elements. According to the Report of the Commis- 
sion for Religious Instruction, the glebe is L.7 in value, with a 
right to cut peats; and the stipend, L.288, 7s. Id., the unappro- 
priated teind being L.625, 2s. 9d. 

There is a chapel at Bridge of Teith in communion with the 
United Associate Synod. The minister is supported by seat- 
rents and collections, his stipend being stated at L.100. 

A congregation has lately been formed in connection wMi the 
Congregational Union of Scotland. 

A small Wesleyan Methodist chapel is in progress. 

There is a general Bible and Missionary Association in Doune, 

 To this it falls now to be added, that there arc in Doune which contains five 
churches or congregations in all two churches in connection with the " Free Pro- 
testing Church of Scotland."

which, up till this year, has collected L.30 annually and upwards j 
besides one connected with the congregation at Bridge of Teith, 
the income of which varies from L.20 to L.30. 

The probable average annual amount, of collections yearly in 
the parish church for religious and charitable objects may be 
stated at from L.80 to L.100. 

Education.— There are seven schools in the parish. Of these, 
one is the parochial school, three are endowed, at least partially,' 
the rest supported by individual subscription. The parochial teacher 
has the maximum salary, and the legal accommodation. 

Literature.— There is a circulating library in connection with 
Deanston Works, besides religious ones attached to each of the 
three oldest churches in the place. 

Savings 1 Bank.— There is a savings' bank in Doune, viz. the 
" Kilmadock Parish Savings' Bank," besides one at Deanston for 
the cotton workers exclusively. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 55 though it has suddenly risen, 
by the pressure of the times, to 62, and the average sum allotted 
to each is about Is. 6d. per week, or L.3, 18s. per annum. 

The annual amount of contributions for their relief is upwards 
of L.200, about L.60 having hitherto been collected at the church 
door, and the rest contributed by the heritors, who voluntarily as- 
sess themselves. 

Fairs.— The Doune fairs are well known. Of these there are 
six annually. The great fair, called the Latter Fair, is held on 
the first Tuesday and Wednesday of November; the sheep fair 
on Tuesday, and the black-cattle on Wednesday. The next 
largest is held on the fourth Wednesday of the same month. 
The others, which are smaller, or mostly nominal, are, Candle- 
mas Fair, 11th February, for grain and general business; May 
Fair, second Wednesday of May, for milch cows and cattle for 
grazing; July Fair, 26th July, for hiring shearers and general 
business ; and Yuill Fair, last Wednesday of December, for fat 
cattle, grain, and general business. 

Inns, Src— There are 14 public-houses in the parish ; besides 
two at Deanston, in which no spirits are sold. 

Fuel.— The fuel used, besides wood, is peat and coal. The for- 
mer is procured at the hill Uamvar and at Moss Flanders ; the 
latter either at Bannockburn or near Alloa. The one costs about 
5s. and the other, exclusive of 5s. for carting, from 7s. to 8s. per 
cart load.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OP PERTH AND STIRLIN 

THE REV. ALEXANDER GRAY, D.D, MINISTER. 



L Topography and Natural History. 

Name and .Boundaries.— In the county of Perth there are the 
castle of Kincardine in Stratheam, the town of Kincardine in the 
parish of Tulliallan, and the parish of Kincardine in Monteith. 
This name is of Gaelic origin, and is said by the author of the 
former Statistical Account of this parish, to mean the head of the 
shore. This countenances the opinion generally entertained, that 
the carse in the vicinity of the church and manse, and which 
forms a very important part of the parish, was, at a remote period, 
a continuation of the Frith of Forth. But some who are skilled 
in Celtic lore say, that Kincardine being a Scoto- Celtic word, and 
occurring in the north, where the Britanno- Celtic or Welsh does 
not appear to have ever been spoken, must be derived from Cinn- 
chairdin ; and that, as the first part of this word means literally 
heads, it may be rendered heads of friends : or applied metaphori- 
cally, it may mean the rallying place of friends, referring either to 
the chief who ruled, or to his stronghold where his retainers found 
friendship and protection in times of danger. 

This locality favours this interpretation, because, adjoining the 
old church and manse, and where the minister lately had his gar- 
den, there was a foss or moat, and what were vulgarly called the 
Auld Wa's, being the remains of an old castle. There is besides, 
at a short distance westward, a commanding point called the 
Ward, and a tumulus about an equal distance eastward, of consi- 
derable elevation, both of which are supposed to have been watch- 
towers. The author of the Account of the parish of Kincardine in 
Ross-shire adopts this latter etymology, and says that the chief of 



1244 



PEllTHSHIllE. 



the clan Ross, and his most powerful and confidential friends, 
dwelt there, and gave the name Kincardine to the place where 
they resided. 

This parish is of a triangular form, and is divided on the south 
and east from the parishes of St Ninians, Gargunnock, and Kip- 
pen, by the Forth ; and by the Teith, on the north, from Le- 
cropt and Kilmadock. From the confluence of these streams to 
the south-west extremity of the parish along the Forth, the extent 
is about ten miles; and from the same point to the north-west ex- 
tremity on the Teith, twelve miles. The western boundary mea- 
sures about seven miles from north to south. A part of the pa- 
rish of Kilmadock, about 3 miles in breadth, and extending from 
the Teith to the Forth, intersects this parish ; but there is a 
quoad sacra church at Norriestoun, in the western part of Kin- 
cardine, which accommodates such of the people of Kincardine, 
Port, and Kilmadock, as live at an inconvenient distance from their 
parish churches. 

Extent.— The eastern part of Kincardine is about 2£ miles 
from Stirling. The parish contains about 6000 Scotch, or about 
7i00 imperial acres; about 5000 acres of which, extending alonrr 
the Forth, are carse, and 2500 along the Teith, are dryfiefd land. 

Topographical Appearances.— The only elevated part of this 
parish is a gradually sloping ridge, which commences at the man- 
sion-house of Blair- Drummond, and ascends westward by rrentle 
undulations, from about 40 to 300 feet above the level of the 
sea, at the highest part of the road, from Thornhill to Callan- 
der. The soil along this ridge is, with few exceptions, of good 
quality, and slopes laterally to the Teith on the north, and to the 
carse on the south. There is nothing very remarkable along this 
line, except the varied and interesting scenery which the higher 
points command. The view to the west and north comprehends 
a portion of the Grampian mountains, such as the cloud-capped 
Benlomond, Benvenue, and Benledi; and also Benvoirlich, Stuc- 
kachrone, and Uamvar. On the east, the range of the Ochils 
including Dumyat, the SherifFmuir, the Abbey Craig, the Castle 
of Stirling, the Gillies Hill, the field of Bannockburn, and the 
rock of Craigforth, all crowd in rich variety upon the sio-ht and 
recal many historical recollections. But, even bevond all the«e 
the hue of the Frith of Forth is seen extending eastward as fa.' 
as the eye can reach. On the south, the view is bounded by the

Lennox hills, which run with little interruption from the Castle 
of Stirling, on the Forth, to the Castle of Dumbarton, on the 
Clyde, the principal portion of these hills being seen from this 

The intermediate district of Monteith, to which the descrip- 
tion refers, is from this point very interesting. Here are the 
extremes of cultivation and sterility. To the west lies Moss 
Flanders, with its thousands of uncultivated acres ; m the cen- 
tre and eastern portions of the Strath are seen the fruits of agri- 
cultural intelligence, enterprise, and success ; and the more ele- 
vated situations in the west, north, south, and east, are adorned 
with the mansion-houses and ornamented parks of the different 
proprietors, and the comfortable houses of their tenantry. This 
grand and beautiful variety of objects is seen from this parish, be- 
cause it forms, as it were, a centre, of which they are the circum- 
ference. 

Soil and Climate.— The carse portion of this parish is com- 
pletely flat, and includes the moss of Kincardine, and a part of Moss 
Flanders. The soil of the small carse, where it has been clear- 
ed of moss, is generally of a rich blue clay, of great depth, and 
very productive, capable of bearing all kinds of grain and green 
crops. 

The dry field rises from the carse into a gently swelling ridge, 
which generally slopes to the south, except at the north-western 
extremity of the parish, where the slope is to the north and south. 
This ridge joins the picturesque hills in the parishes of Port and 
Callander. The soil is a light loam, and produces excellent oats, 
barley, potatoes, turnips, and grass. The subsoil is generally tilly 
or rocky. 

Meteorology. — There is a considerable difference in the tem- 
perature of the atmosphere in the higher and lower divisions of 
this parish. The south-eastern division is about 20, and the north- 
western about 300 feet above the level of the sea. In the lat- 
ter, the air is comparatively cold, and the vegetation later and 
more uncertain ; while in the former, the atmosphere is mild, 
the heat greater, and the land also being better, the crops are 
earlier, more abundant, and of better quality. But in conse- 
quence of the length and breadth of the carse, in which the cur- 
rents of air meet with no interruption for many miles, the high 
winds, especially when the mountains are covered with snow, are

peculiarly cold and penetrating. The following abridged table,

At stated seasons this parish is visited by easterly haars, which 
towards the evenings in the months of spring and autumn, come' 
up the Forth. These haars consist of a cold, dense, moist va- 
pour, which fills the valley of the Forth, extending to the elevat 
ed lands on each side of it. Their chilling effects are injurious 
to the field labourer, whose constitution may have been much 
excited by the heat and hard labour of the earlier parts of the 
day, and in delicate constitutions produce colds, and affect the 
lungs. 



KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH. 



1247 



The summits of our mountains, by the vapours, and the clouds 
resting upon them, give indicatious at all seasons of a change in 
the atmosphere ; and in the evenings of spring and autumn the 
vapour rising for miles along the line of the Forth gives sure proofs 
of frost. The reflexion from the clouds also, of the great furnaces 
at the. Devon, the Carron, and other great works, indicate the moist 
state of the atmosphere for a considerable time before the rain vi- 
sits us. The prevailing winds are from the west and south-west, 
but the coldest are from the north and east. The two ranges of 
hills which enclose this level country meet in the Grampians, to 
the west, where their elevation is so great as powerfully to attract 
the clouds which come sweeping along, sometimes on the north 
side, and sometimes on the south side of the valley. 

The climate here is of a mild and medium character, and pro- 
motes the health of the inhabitants, and renders the soil produc- 
tive. The reason is, that the carse division is wide, open, well 
cultivated, and fertile, and but slightly raised above the level of 
the sea, and the dryfield is also in a good state of cultivation, and 
slopes generally to the south. 

Hydrography. — There are no lakes or friths in this parish, but 
there is, especially in the dryfield, plenty of water produced by 
numerous springs, which are pure and copious. Some of them 
contain a portion of iron, and some of lime which appears in 
very hard incrustations in the process of boiling. For this rea- 
son the water is hard, and less profitable for washing and bleach- 
ing. Throughout the parish, but especially near the line which 
divides the carse from the dryfield, these springs appear in great 
numbers. They gave an abundant supply, with a few exceptions, 
even during the long continued droughts of 1826 and 1842. But 
where there are no surface springs, abundance of water is to be 
found by sinking wells to a moderate depth, especially on reach- 
ing or cutting through the sandstone. 

The proprietor of Blair Drummond estate has, for the benefit 
of his tenants, sunk some wells in the carse, from which the moss 
has been removed, and has found abundance of water. There is, 
in the western division of the carse, a copious supply from two na- 
tural streams, which flow through it from the higher grounds into 
the Forth. But as there are no springs along the banks of the 
Forth, some of the farmers there have, by force-pumps, raised 
water from that river, and filtered it for the use of their families 



1248 



PEUTI1SHIRR, 



and cattle. Mr Home Drummond has lately, and at his own ex- 
pense, brought a supply of excellent spring water by pipes into 
Thornhill, which has been a valuable boon to the inhabitants of 
that village. 

The principal small streams or burns which flow through this 
parish are the Mill of Muck, and the Burnbank burns, which have 
been employed in driving mills and floating moss into the Forth. 
There are also the bums of Cessintully and Little Mill, in the 
western division of the parish, which have been employed for the 
same purposes. 

The principal rivers which water this parish are the Forth, the 
Teith, and the Goodie. 

The Forth, the Boderia of Ptolemy, and Bodotria of Tacitus, 
is the southern boundary of this parish. Near its source it has 
two branches, the one in Stirlingshire, which comes from a spring 
on the north side, and near the summit of Benlomond, and is con- 
sidered to be the proper source of the river ; the other, which is- 
sues from Lochard and Lochcon in Perthshire, has its source 
westward of Lochcon. These two branches meet at Aberfoyle 
in Perthshire, where they are called the Avendhu, or Black 
River ; and at Gartmore House, five miles below this junction, 
they receive and retain the name of the Forth. 

The course of this river from Benlomond to Stirling may be 
about 35 miles. The upper part of the Forth is narrow and shal- 
low; but in its progress it deepens from three to seven feet, and 
when it passes from the dryfield into the carse, its breadth and 
depth are greatly increased, by receiving the contents of many tri- 
butary streams. In its progress, for fifteen miles, the channel is 
sometimes rocky, and sometimes gravelly, and its water is clear 
and pleasant to the taste; but, on entering the flat, mossv, and 
clayey district, it is discoloured, not merely by the nature of the 
soil, but also, during a great part of the year, by the moss which 
is floated into it, and by other agricultural improvements. 

This appearance of the river is increased by the influx of the 
Goodie, which joins the Forth about nine miles above Stirling, 
after running through part of this parish. It issues from the lake 
of Monteith, in the parish of Port; and at a short distance from 
the lake it enters Moss Flanders, and, like the Forth, flows slowly 
in a channel so deep as to be seen only by those who approach its 
banks. 



KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH. 1219 

At a remote period, and before the vale of Mon teith was so 
much improved as it is now, by draining 1 , and the receding of the 
waters, this river, with its beautiful source, was called the Lake of 
the Guidi, or Guddie, because, by its level course, and many 
windings and interruptions, it formed, especially in the rainy sea- 
sons, a complete morass. 

The Teith is of a different character from the Forth and Goodie. 
The name Teith is supposed to be derived from Teth or Te, sig- 
nifying hot, and is said to have received its name from its ra- 
pid progress, in the higher parts of the river, over a channel con- 
sisting of innumerable round stones and pebbles, which, from the 
beautiful clearness of its waters reflecting the sun's rays, give it a 
sparkling prismatic appearance. Flowing eastward from Lochs 
Katrine, Achray, and Vennachar, on the south side, and. from 
Loch Lubnaig, on the north side of Benledi, its two branches 
meeting above Callander, it may well be called " Daughter" not 
"of three," but of " four mighty lakes." It bounds Kincardine parish 
on the north, a portion of Kilmadock intervening, from about 
four miles below Callander, to its junction with the Forth at 
the extremity of this parish, about two and a-half miles west of 
Stirling. Its gravelly channel, and the lakes at its sources, ope- 
rating as so many filters, give a beautiful clearness and freshness 
to its waters. Although it loses its name by its junction with the 
impure and sluggish Forth, yet it sends one-half more water into 
the Frith of Forth than that river does. Its length from Callan- 
der to this junction is about thirteen miles; and, except where 
pools occur, some of which are very deep, it is shallow ; and its 
breadth is generally contracted by its firm and rocky banks. Af- 
ter much rain, or the melting of deep snow, when the mountain 
streams pour their contents into it, its rise is sudden, and, over- 
flowing its banks in various places, it sweeps irresistibly before it 
every moveable object within its reach. Its velocity is increased 
by a uniform fall from Callander to its junction with the Forth of 
about 200 feet. Were it not out of place here, we might dwell 
on the natural grandeur and beauties of this river, with its adja- 
cent scenery, such as the elegant mansion-houses, tastefully orna- 
mented parks, thriving plantations, and agricultural improvements 
which adorn the course of the Teith; but this would be superflu- 
ous, because the immortal Sir Walter Scott, in his Lady of the 
Lake, has celebrated in song this part of Perthshire.

Geology and Mineralogy. —The north division of this parish is 
composed of various soils, resting on sandstone of the transition 
series. The south side consists of clay, resting on the same rock 
and stretching along the north bank of the Forth. The greater 
part of this division was, till lately, covered by moss. The clay is 
rich and deep, and good for agricultural purposes. 

In the banks of the Forth and Goodie numerous beds of 
oyster, muscle, cockle, and other marine shells appear at va- 
rious depths between the surface of the clay and the channels of 
the rivers. 

The discovery of these marine remains and others which have 
been found in the neighbouring parishes, furnishes an increasing 
proof, that the sea extended over the level part of this parish at 
the period of the deposition of the clay. 

The transition from the Carse to the drytield is abrupt, and 
frequently as well defined as are the banks of a river. The dry- 
field has an increasing elevation northward. In the vicinity of 
Blair-Drummond, the soil in the first part of the rising ground is 
a light loam, having in general a gentle slope, but in some places 
an abrupt face to the south, and extending about a mile in breadth. 
It is well adapted to the growth of trees and shrubs, and is beau- 
tifully wooded and tastefully adorned by walks and shrubberies,— 
forming part of the pleasure-grounds of Blair-Drummond. 

The sandstone which has been formerly mentioned, and vul- 
garly called gray freestone, has been considered as the old red 
sandstone of the transition series. It has been used for various 
purposes, the best kind being a good stone for building. In the 
moor of Ballochneck, and for several miles to the west of it, the 
colour is of a light gray or smoke colour, and of a hard con- 
sistency, and valuable for flags and buildings. There is a re- 
markable instance of the first kind at Ochtertyre, where it rises 
above the clay in a detached circular eminence, which is covered 
with trees and brushwood. The prevailing dip of the strata, as 
appears from the various quarries which have been wrought, is to- 
wards the north-west, and in general at a slight inclination. Veins 
of calcareous spar are often met with in quarrying, and occasion- 
ally barytes. 

No organic remains of any kind occur in the sandstone, except 
a few vegetable impressions. 

In the soil of many of the higher parts of the parish, boulders 

3 



KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH

of various species of rocks have been found in great abundance, 
and removed for draining the fields, making roads, and building 
fences. In the latter, many specimens have been preserved of 
granite, gneiss, mica and common slate, conglomerate, sandstone, 
and grit, and of various kinds of trap rock. The mica slate is 
frequently studded with garnets of a coarse quality. 

Zoology. — Roe deer are frequently found, and, occasionally, red 
deer in the young plantations in the higher parts of the parish ; 
and the former frequently visit the woods of the level country. 
Foxes, polecats, stoats, weasels, and hedgehogs, are numerous, 
but less so of late years, in consequence of the constant and suc- 
cessful exertions of the gamekeepers in the district. Otters fre- 
quent the banks of the Teith, Forth, and Goodie. They have 
been traced by their foot-prints in the snow to their hiding-places ; 
and on one occasion, four were killed at one place by terriers of 
sufficient strength and courage. They are very destructive to the 
salmon and other kinds of fish. 

The badger used to be seen, but has now disappeared. The 
blaek rat of Scotland, which till lately abounded in this parish, 
has also disappeared, but has been succeeded by great numbers 
of the brown rat, which are very destructive to the farm-houses, 
barn-yards, and hen-roosts of the farmers. Although the common 
squirrel was unknown in this parish till about twenty years ago, 
yet it now abounds in almost all our plantations. Hares, rabbits, 
common and ring-necked pheasants, and partridges, are very nu- 
merous. Pheasants were not seen here till about twenty-five years 
ago, but since that time the common kinds have multiplied greatly, 
and the white kind occasionally appear in the plantations. The 
curlew was formerly plentiful, and is still to be seen ; and the 
woodeock is an annual visitor. Snipes are now scarce, in conse- 
quence of draining and other improvements. Black and red grouse 
used to be numerous, but are now seldom seen, and in small num- 
bers, since the moss of Blair-Drummond has been improved. For 
the same reason, adders are more seldom seen. 

Various birds of prey belong to this district, or frequently 
resort to it, such as the kestril Falco tinunculus, the spar- 
row-hawk Accipiter fringillarius, and the merlin {Falco ssa- 
Ion. These are the most common, but there are also frequently 
seen here the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, the common 
buzzard Buteo vulgaris, and the hen-harrier Circus cyaneus, 



1252 



PERTHSHIRE. 



The kite {Milvus Ictinus is rarely seen so far from the lakes 
and mountains to the north and west; but the long-eared owl 
Otis auritus, the common ivy or brown owl Strix Jluco, and 
the barn owl Strix JIammea, are common. Rooks are very nu- 
merous, in consequence of there being large rookeries on the es- 
tates in the neighbourhood, especially at Ochtertyre and Blair- 
Drummond. The hooded-crow Corvus comix, the jay C.glaji- 
darius, and also the jackdaw and magpie, are natives. A white 
crow was lately shot in this neighbourhood ; and a magpie, almost 
white, was entrapped by the gamekeeper at Blair- Drummond. 
Both have been preserved. 

This parish is periodically visited by the landrail Crex stre~ 
pera, by the bat, the goatsucker Caprimulgus Europcsus, by 
starlings, and a few golden plovers. We have also the fieldfare, 
redwing, and missel-thrush, the two former of these remaining till 
the middle of March or beginning of April the missel-thrush re- 
maining permanently, when they migrate to Norway or Sweden, 
and are succeeded by the common thrush, after it has been some 
months absent. 

As the following list of smaller birds contains generally the dif- 
ferent species of those which visit this parish periodically or are 
permanent, it may perhaps with propriety be admitted into this 
Account, especially as many of the more common kinds are pur- 
posely omitted : 

Certhia familiaris Silvia salicaria Parus ater 

Muscicapa grisola Regulus cristatus caudatus 

Silvia phcenicurus Saxicola cenantlie Pyrrhula vulgaris 

cinerea rubicola Fringilla montium 

trochilus rubetra linaria 

hypolais Anthus pratensis spinus 

sibilatrix arboreus _ carduetfs 

atracapilla Parus palustris 

The crossbill Loxia curvirostra is rarely seen here, but a 
great number appeared during the winter of 1838, especially at 
Lanrick Castle, and after continuing some months in the planta- 
tions of spruce firs, on the seeds of which they feed, they disap- 
peared in the spring. During their stay, however, specimens of 
the male and female were shot and are carefully preserved. 

The common sandpiper Tringa hypoleucus, and the water 
ouzel and dipper, Cinclus aquaticus frequent our rivers; and the 
king-fisher Alcedo ispida also is occasionally seen, displaying his 
brilliant plumage as he skims swiftly along the streams, or perches 
watchfully on the twigs which overhang his favourite fishing pools. 
The varieties of water-fowl are very limited. Seagulls of differ-

ent kinds and in considerable numbers come up the Forth into the 
interior, fifteen or twenty miles above the flow of the tide, at dif- 
ferent seasons of the year, but chiefly in spring, when they cover 
in great numbers the newly ploughed fields, and devour worms, 
&amp;c. They come also to escape from the storms which sweep the 
Frith ; and to nestle in the islands, and on the shores of the lakes 
to the westward. 

The wild swan does not remain here ; but is often seen in win- 
ter, passing from one favourite haunt to another among the sur- 
rounding hills and lakes. 

Wild ducks are very numerous along the streams of the Teith 
and Forth, but especially on an ornamental piece of water in Blair- 
Drummond park. Here they are allowed to hatch and rear their 
young in safety ; and so securely do they occupy this peaceful re- 
treat, that one may pass within a short distance of a great number 
of them, especially in the months of October and November, 
without disturbing them. There is an island in the middle of 
this sheet of water, bearing trees of various kinds about fifty years 
old. Among the reeds and rushes which skirt this island, and on 
the island itself, coots and water-rails build their nests, and rear 
their young ; and here the majestic swan, in imperial dignity, is 
lord of the isle and the waters. 

The trees are the abode in spring, summer, and harvest of the 
sombre heron, whose ponderous nests, containing a noisy and vo- 
racious brood, weigh down the more elevated branches of the trees. 
The cry of the heron and her brood is very peculiar, and has 
been alleged to have led to a superstitious belief in Scotland, in 
the existence of a being called the Water Kelpie. The jack- 
daw and the heron nestle in the same trees, and the wily little daw 
not unfrequently usurps the heron's nest, and seems even to watch 
for some of the young heron's food. The breeding season appears 
to reconcile , some kinds of the feathered tribe to each other ; 
and in this retired and peaceful spot, where the rays of the mid- 
day sun are powerful, but where no storm can enter, there live 
together in apparent harmony, the heron and the daw, the 
coot, the rail, the wild duck and the swan ; with hares, phea- 
sants, partridges, and pea-fowl, rejoicing in undisturbed peace on 
the margin of the water ; while the venerable grove of mighty 
oaks which overlooks the scene, sends forth the varied music of a 
thousand happy inhabitants. 

Salmon have always been found in the river Teith; and although 



1254 

PERTHSHIRE, 



formerly they were more abundant, yet the floods in spring, 
summer, and autumn, still encourage considerable numbers of ex- 
ceiient salmon, weighing from 6 to 25 lbs., and grilses from 5 to 
°r » lbs., to frequent the river. A considerable improve- 
ment has recently taken place by the protection given to the 
smoults during the months of May and June, when they descend 
m shoals to the sea. 

Common and sea-trout are plentiful, and a few perch and pike 
are occasionally to be found. There are two species of eels, the 
iamprey and common eel, and parr, minnow, loach, and stickle- 
back are numerous. 

Very few salmon resort to the Forth on account of the impure 
and mossy nature of its waters ; but pike, perch, and large eels 
are abundant. Common trout are rarely seen in the lower parts

The muscle that produces pearls Mya Margaritifera is com- 
mon in the Teith, and the size and value of the pearls have oc-

numbers as to remunerate the search. 

The families of insects in this parish are numerous, varied, and 
beautiful, but do not in general differ from those that are to be 
ound m all' the district. It would, however, be an omission, not 
to mention a beautiful specimen of the deaths-head moth, which 
was found on one of the south windows of the church of Kincar- 
dine in 1834, and is preserved, the body measuring 2± inches 
Jong, 2 inches in circumference at the insertion of the wings, and 
1 T inch at the middle; the wings being fths of an inch broad, 
and 4 inches from tip to tip when moderately extended. The 
figure of the death's-head, which gives the name to the insect, is 
halt an inch long, and very distinctly marked. The down of the 
insect is perfectly beautiful. It emitted, when caught, a shrill 
sound resembling that of a mouse or bat. It did not verify the 
common superstition, by preceding the cholera in this district 

It may also be proper to mention the glow-worm here, which 
the writer has found in a warm sheltered locality near the manse.

posed chiefly of oak, ash, beech, elm, birch, and fir The soil fa 
well adapted to the growth of all of these ; but oak, beech, and 

fir predominate. . a , , 

In the park at Blair-Drummond there are many fine trees 
chiefly beech and oak, which are probably not surpassed by any 
others of the same age. Great attention has been paid to thin- 
ning and preserving them from injury, and on this account nc .am- 
maJ but sheep is admitted to the pasture, so that each kind of tree 
is allowed to display the peculiar beauty of its form and mode of 
o-rowth, and to extend its branches near the ground. 

One beech, in January 1835, measured in circumference at he 
smallest part of the bole, between the swell of the roots and he 
swell of the branches, 15 feet 1 inch. Another measured in he 
same way was 14 feet. Another, at 4 feet 8 inches from he 
ground, is 13 feet, and many others at 3 feet or « feet from the 
ground from 13 feet 6 inches to 1 1 feet. An oak at 8 feet from 
the ground is] 12 feet 8 inches, and many others at the same 
height from 9 to 11 feet. 

It will be observed, that these measurements refer to the per- 
pendicular height above the ground, and are taken somewhat 
higher than is usual, at what is considered the fairest point of com- 
parison for the dimensions of trees. 

The trees above-mentioned were not, in 1835, more than 120 
years old, and probably some years younger. 

In December 1839, a larch, which grows in sand in the south 
bank of what is called the Sand Hill, measured at 2 feet perpen- 
dicular from the ground, quite free of the swell of the roots, 9 feet 
10 inches. Another larch, cut at the same date, measured at 
above a foot from the ground, free of the swell of the roots, 9 feet 
2 inches, having 49 rings of wood, of which 36 were red wood. 
There are also five larches above 100 years old, which have risen 
to a great height by being planted among the other trees, one of 
which measures, at 3£ feet from the ground, 8 feet 1 1 inches. 
From former measurements, these last-mentioned larches do not 
seem to have gained above four or five inches in the last ten years, 
while some of the beeches and oaks have added above a foot to 
their circumference. 

There are several birches of a much later date from 9£ to 
\0k feet, and also some old Scotch firs measuring from 8 feet 5 
inches to 10 feet. The seed from which a plantation of Scotch 
firs, along the side of the turnpike road near Blair-Drummond, 



PERTHSHIRE. 



Was raised was procured by Lord Kames from old trees at 
Auchenbowie in Stirlingshire. A great number of them have 
sprung up m the moss on the opposite side of the road, and form- 
ed a new plantation, being self-sown from the cones, which crows 
have been observed carrying to the open moss for the purpose of 
feeding on the seed. « The timber of this species is much superior 
to that of the other two kinds which are frequently cultivated, one 
of which has a short and thin foliage, and produces but little tim- 
ber, and the other, although it is of rapid growth, produces timber 
of an inferior quality." Journal of Agriculture, October 1843. 

1 he ash and plane sycamore trees at Burnbank are much 
older than the trees at Blair. Drummond. Some of them exceed 
11 feet in circumference, and there is a walnut tree there 11 feet 
7 inches at 3 feet from the ground. 

Walnuts usually ripen, chestnuts not so often, though not lono- 
ago they ripened three years consecutively, and as manv plants as 
were wanted were raised from seed. 

On the estate of Ochtertyre, belonging to David Dundas, Esq. 
M.F., there are some trees remarkable for their age and size, and 
oi which the following deserve particular notice. 

An ash near the house, called the jug-tree, from the jugs hav- 
ing been fixed in it, was measured in 1800 by the late Mr Ram- 
say, and, at about two feet from the ground, was 11 feet in cir- 
cumference, the branches extending 38 feet from side to side 

I he circumference of the same tree in 1838, at two feet from the 
ground, was 13 feet 8 inches. 

In 1838, the following measurements of other trees of various 
kinds were taken at the height of two feet from the ground • Se- 
veral oaks, seventy years old, were from 8 feet 8 inches to 8 feet 

II inches in circumference. One large lime, ninety-eight years 
old, 10 feet 5 inches; a beech, 10 feet 7 inches; a poplar,' 12 
feet; another, 10 feet 7 inches ; a larch, seventy years old in 
183b, growing near the river, measured 7 feet 7 inches, and others 
growing near it from 7 feet 7 inches to 0 feet 5 inches. ' Two 
others, on the bank of the river, 10 feet; one elm, 10 feet - and 
several Scotch firs from 6 feet 8 inches to 6 feet 10 inches 
These trees grow chiefly in a gravelly or sandy soil 

In the neighbourhood of the manse and other situations in this 
parish, some of the commoner plants, as they appear in succession, 
are remarkable for their profusion and elegance. The woods are 
literally clothed in April with the white flowers of the anemone

{Anemone nemorosa, and in May with the graceful clusters of the 
blue hyacinth Hyacinthus non-scriptus, to which the white earth- 
nut Bunium flexuosum, and a profusion of other plants succeed. 
The red campion Lychnis dioica, and the blue geranium Ge- 
ranium pratense, grow in similar abundance on a part of the bank 
of the Teith, which has been nearly insulated by a lead cut from 
the river. And in this situation, and in the mosses, some of the 
rarer plants are found, which are mentioned in the subjoined ca-

II. — Civil History. 

There are no accounts, ancient or modern, of this parish, except 
the last Statistical Account by Mr Tait ; but the following short 
notices may be worthy of a place here, on account of their ancient 
dates and connection with this parish. 

From the chartulary of Cambuskenneth, at the time that Hugo 
was chancellor betwixt 1190 and 1200, and by whom the follow- 



1258 



PERTHSHIRE. 



ing deed was signed, it appears that William the Lion granted to 
the Abbey of Cambuskenneth the church of Kincardine, as un- 
der, " Ecclesiam de Kincardin cum capellis decimis et oblationi- 
bus omnimodis et tredecem acris terrae arabilis, et unum toftum 
brasiatoris cum uno orto, et unum toftum ad campanam sancti Lo- 
lani cum uno orto, et unum toftum ad baculum sancti Lolani cum 
uno orto." 

It also appears that " the lands of Guddie were, by James II., 
on the 1st of June 1452, given to Robert Norrie for bringing the 
tidings of the birth of Prince James, afterwards James III." Scots- 
tarvet's Calendars in the Harleian Library. 

Eminent Characters, £c— The Muschets long held high rank 
in this parish and district. They were descended from the Earls 
of Montfort, who were the Dukes of Bretagne. 

The Duchess of John de JMontfort was daughter to the Earl 
of Flanders, and her daughter Ann, was married first to Charles 
VIII. and thereafter to Lewis XII., kings of France. 

The Muschets, originally called Montefitchett or Montficher, 
and De Montefixo, are said to have come from France into Eng- 
.and with King William the Conqueror, and in King Edgar's reign, 
to have come from England into Scotland with that king's sister, 
who was married to Malcolm III. 

The above particulars are taken from a manuscript in the pos- 
session of Dr Muschet of Birkhill, near Stirling, who is the lineal 
descendant of the Muschets, and, it is said, their only representa- 
tive in this district. 

For the following statements in reference to this ancient family, 
the writer is indebted to H. Home Drummond, Esq. 

" In the churchyard, over the door of a burial-place at the east 
end of the ground where the old church stood, there is a shield 
of arms, consisting of two cheverons, Gules, on a field ermine, 
with a pigeon for crest, and the motto, " I thank my God." 
Above the shield is the date lb86, and below it this inscription : 
" Sepultura antiquissimae Mushetorum familiae a Gulielmo de 
Montefixo, qui hie floruit circa annum M.cc.c. progenitae." 
Sir David Lindsay in his " Register of Armes," gives the same 
shield as the bearings of " Muschet of Kincarne," with the differ- 
ence of an additional cheveron charged with a star. There were 
various branches of this ancient family, who were proprietors of 
many estates in this part of the country, and in this parish in par- 
ticular, there were Muschets of Burnbank, Culgarth, Miln of 



KINCARDINE IN MONTE ITU. 



1259 



Torr, Miln of Goodie, Cuthil, &amp;c A few years ago, in repairing 
the mill of Torr, a stone, on which there had been a coat of arms, 
was found, which had probably been placed in the wall of the pro- 
prietor's house, when the Muschets had a residence there. The 
shield is unfortunately defaced, but the motto " 1 thank my God, 
and the date " 1598," are distinct. 

There is a tombstone of this family in the orchard of Burn- 
bank, and near where the house of the Muschets once stood. It 
bears the following inscription : 

» Here lyes the corpes of Margaret Drummond, third daughter 
to the Laird [of Invermay,] and [Spouse to] Sir George Mus- 
chet of Burnbanke : Her age 26 : Departed this life m the 
wisitation, with her three children at Burnbanke, the 10 of Au- 
gust 1647." 

In confirmation of the English origin of the family, the coinci- 
dence of the arms of the ancient name of Montfichet in English 
heraldry may be noticed. " Montfichet, Lord of Stansted, Mont- 
fietch Essex, Gules three chevrons or, with a label of three points 
azure," v. Arms of the Barons of England added to the supple- 
ment to Heylin's History. 

The author of remarks on Ragman Roll, p. 42, v. Appendix 
to Nisbet's Heraldry, after mentioning " Richard Muschet" as 
one of those who swore fealty to Edward L, adds, " This is a very 
ancient family, designed in Latin De Montefixo, and were Barons 
of Cargil in Perthshire. Sir William de Montefixo was Justici- 
arius Scotiae in 1332. By his daughter and heiress the estates 
of Cargil and Stobhall came to Sir John Drummond, one of the 
ancestors of the noble family of Perth. Mushet of Burnbank was 
the heir-male, but lately decayed, though severals in Monteith are 
of them, as the Mushets of Craighead, Cailziehat, Mill of Torr, 
and Mill of Goody." 

An exemplified copy is preserved in the Perth charter-chest of 
a very old charter, by which William the Lion grants " Richardo 
Mountfecht" the lands of " Kergill et praeterea Kincardin, juxta 
Strivelyn, cum socca et sacca, cum furca et fossa, cum thai et 
them, et infanganthef," to be held in free barony for the service 
of one knight. 

An eminence about a quarter of a mile from the house of Blair 
Drummond, known by the name of the Gallow Hill, was pro- 
bably the place of execution under this jurisdiction.

tradition, was a castle in the immediate vicinity of the church- 
yard, the old walls of which were mentioned above, and were visi- 
ble in some places not many years ago. 

George Drummond of Blair, in 1684, acquired by purchase 
from the Earl of Perth the lands of Drip, Cambusdrennie, and 
others in this parish, being part of the ancient " Barronnie of 
Kincardin in Monteith, which came to the house of Drummond 
by the Lady Mary Montefix." These lands were, at the same 
time, erected, in favour of the said George Drummond, into a 
free barony, to be called the barony of Blair- Drurnmond, from 
his own name, and that of his paternal estate of Blair, in the 
Stormont.f But it was not till 1714 that he obtained from the 
Earl of Perth the conveyance of the other parts of the barony of 
Kincardine on which the house of Blair-Drummond is built. The 
building was commenced soon afterwards ; and before that time 
there was no family residence in the vicinity, nor a tree planted, 
except the few that were usually raised, according to the custom 
of the times, in the turf dikes that surrounded the small corn- 
vards of the tenants." 

There is an inscription in elegant Latin on a shield in the 
church of Kincardine, in memory of this George Drummond ; and 
there are also other separate inscriptions to the memory of seve- 
ral of his descendants. His grand-daughter, Agatha Drummond, 
the Lady of Lord Kames, succeeded to the estate of Blair-Drum- 
mond. Lord Kames died in December 1782, and his lady in 
June 1795. There is a monument over their tomb in this church- 
yard, bearing an inscription, which is also in the church, and which 
was composed by Dr Hugh Blair, and is particularly noticed by Lord 
Woodhouselee in the second edition of the Life of Lord Kames. 

In the church there is also a very appropriate inscription to the 
memory of George Home Drummond, Esq., the only son of 
Lord Kames, whose lady was the sister of Sir Henry Jardine. 
The estate has descended to Henry Home Drummond, Esq., 
their eldest son, who lately represented the county of Stirling in 
the British Parliament, and who is at present the Member and 
the Vice- Lieutenant of the county of Perth.

In referring to eminent characters who belonged to this parish, 
the late Lord Kames deserves to be particularly mentioned. As 
a philosopher, an author on various subjects, a lawyer, and a judge, 
and a zealous supporter of every patriotic undertaking and useful 
improvement, his name is above all praise. There is a painting 
of his Lordship in his robes of office as a judge in the drawing- 
room at Blair- Drummond. There are also several original por- 
traits there by Sir Godfrey Kneller, particularly one of the Lord 
Chancellor Perth, and one of his brother, the Earl of Melfort. 

In the church there is an inscription in Latin to the memory of 
the late John Ramsay, Esq. of Ochtertyre, which was composed 
by himself some time before his death. He was related to the 
family of Dundas of Manor, near Stirling, and studied as a lawyer 
at the University of Edinburgh, but did not follow the law as a 
profession. He was very indulgent to his tenants, was a kind 
friend, an intelligent country gentleman, and was highly esteemed 
by all classes of the community. He composed several epitaphs 
in Latin, of which the one in the church is a good specimen. He 
died in March 1814. His name appears in Dr Currie's edition 
of our poet Burns's works, as one of the correspondents of the 
poet, who was a visitor at Ochtertyre.

agriculture and the rearing of stock. They have made this pa- 
rish, compared with what it was formerly, very productive. 

Parochial Registers. — The books of discipline in this parish, 
which are not voluminous, dated from 1695 to 1734, in the hand- 
writing of Mr Matthew Wallace, who was the minister of the 
parish, contain a minute account of the parochial collections 
and disbursements. These old manuscripts are at present in the 
possession of Mr Home Drummond. The book of discipline has 
been regularly kept to the present time. 

There is also a register of births regularly kept by the session- 
clerk. The registry of baptisms commenced in 1691, and that of 
marriages in 1692, and have been distinctly kept. 

Antiquities. — Some interesting vestiges of antiquity belong to 
this parish. 

When the Doune approach to Blair-Drummond was made, 
several stone coffins, containing urns and bones of the human 
body, were found, which are noticed in the " Transactions of 
the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh," Vol. iii. p. 42. Each 
coffin consisted of a box of stone rudely formed, and half the 
length of the human body. 

A portion of the skeleton of a whale was found some years ago 
about a quarter of a mile from the manse, imbedded in the clay, 
which had formerly been covered with moss, and lying on another 
stratum of moss below the clay. An account of it is to be found 
in the Transactions of the Wernerian Society. It is very re- 
markable that a small piece of deer's horn, with a hole bored in 
it, was found along with this skeleton, of exactly the same descrip- 
tion as a piece of horn which Mr Bald mentions as found with the 
skeleton of the Airthrey whale, now in the Edinburgh College 
Museum. The skeleton of the whale found here is also deposited 
in the same museum. 

There is a very well-defined tumulus within the garden of Blair- 
Drummond, of a conical shape, and of considerable dimensions, 
which has never been opened, measuring 92 yards in circumference, 
and about 15 feet in height ; and there is one of larger dimensions 
within the pleasure-grounds, on a bank overlooking the carse, 
which was probably a watch-tower or signal-point, as there is no 
intervening object between it and Borrowstownness. It is 150 yards 
in circumference, 15 yards in height, and 40 yards from the bot- 
tom of the bank. There is a tumulus near Blair-Drummond 
east Lodge, in which, on being opened, some fragments of urns 



KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH. 



1263 



and human bones were found. It is surrounded by a circular 
foss, from which it has been formed, and is vulgarly called Wal- 
lace's Trench. It is 63 yards in circumference, and 5 feet in 
height from the bottom of the fosse. The history of Sir William 
Wallace brings him, after having burned the Peel a stronghold 
of Gargunnock, across the Forth to this very point, by a road 
which led across the moss of Kincardine to a ford in the Teith, 
where, in the ordinary state of the river, it is fordable. 

In addition to these antiquities, we may take notice of a large 
stone which stands on the summit of the Borland Hill, at a short 
distance and in a north direction from the first-mentioned tumuli. 
It is 5 feet in height above the ground, and 12 in circumference, 
but more flat than round, and of a conical form near the top. It 
is apparently in a natural state, bearing no marks of the ham- 
mer or the chisel, and is a very large boulder of slate. A 
very vague tradition represents it as having' been a place of 
religious worship in superstitious times. There are no other re- 
mains near it to confirm this opinion ; but whether it be correct 
or not, it is evident that its site is a very important one, and may 
have been useful as a signal station, as it commands a view, not 
only of the road across the moss of Kincardine already referred 
to, but also of the line of the Roman stations along the Forth and 
Teith in the direction of the camp at Ardoch. 

In the operation of removing the moss, several specimens of 
antiquities were found between 1770 and 1840. One of the most 
remarkable of these is a large brass camp kettle, of a circular 
form, of the shape of a common boiler, which was found upon the 
estate of John Ramsay, Esq. of Ochtertyre in 1768, and presented 
by him to the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh. For an ac- 
count of it, see the Farmers' Magazine, 4th August 1817. 

A similar vessel was found at a much later date in a similar si- 
tuation, which is preserved at Blair- Drummond. Antiquarians 
are of opinion that they are Roman camp kettles. Several spear- 
heads of brass have also been found from time to time in the 
mosses of Blair- Drummond and Meiklewood, which are in the 
possession of the proprietors. 

A considerable number of a remarkable kind of stone has been 
found upon the clay, under a thick bed of moss, some of them 
composed of slate, and others of a compact stone of a greenish 
colour. They are from four to six inches long, of a flat shape, 
well polished, some being wedge-shaped at one end, and some at 



12G4 



PERTHSHIRE. 



both, and others having a hole through the thick end. They are 
by some supposed to have been used for skinning animals, and 
are apparently too short for the purpose of removing bark from 
the ti ees, for the purpose of tanning leather. 

Some of the moss tenants found small heaps of embers or 
charred timber ou the surface of the clay below the moss. 

The late John Ramsay, Esq. of Ochtertyre, who was a zealous 
antiquarian, had a pair of jugs which were fixed in a large and 
very old ash tree near his house, at about five feet from the 
ground. The jugs consisted of a piece of iron to be fastened in 
a wall or tree with an iron collar which enclosed the neck, and 
which was secured by a padlock, for the punishment of culprits. 
There was a ring or hook on the outside of the old church, to 
which, it is understood, jugs had been formerly fastened. 

When the walls of the old manse here were taken down, the 
die of the communion tokens was found in a recess above the 
front door, bearing the impression " k. p. 1699," within a square 
on the die, bounded by double waving lines. 

There are no ancient roads in this parish, except the one found 
by the moss improvers, which is universally ascribed to the Ro- 
mans. Seventy yards of it in length were discovered on the sur- 
face of the clay, at the bottom of the moss, after the peat, to the 
depth of eight feet, had been removed. It was formed of trees 
about twelve inches in diameter, having other trees of half this 
size crossing them, and brushwood covering the whole. This 
road crossed the moss of Kincardine northward from a narrow part 
of the Forth, towards the Roman road, passing between the moss 
and the river Teith. This last-mentioned road has been traced 
from a ford in the Teith, about four miles north-west of the Drip, 
in a south-east direction, by Torwood and Larbert, to Camelon, 
on the Roman wall. It is supposed to have been made by the 
Romans for checking the incursions of the Caledonians by the 
Pass of Leny, and also for opening a communication by Dunblane 
with the well known station at Ardoch. A part of this road, near 
the mansion-house of Ochtertyre, is still called Staniegatesj from 
the stones of which it was formed, there having been no moss 
there to require a foundation of trees. 

The stone coffins already mentioned were found on this line 
in Blair-Drummond Park. By pursuing this line along the Forth 
and Teith, the Romans had not only the advantage of the more 
open country, but also of having their right protected by these rivers. 

Modern Buildings. — The mansion-house of Blair-Drummond 



KINCARDINE IN M ONTEITH. 

was built by George Drummond, Esq., as above-mentioned, be- 
tween 1715 and 1717, and is a good specimen of the style of that 
time. Although it is in extent, elegance, and convenience, wor- 
thy of its founder, and of the estate on which it is built, yet the 
present proprietor lately added to it an elegant and extensive 
wing, which has greatly enlarged the family accommodation. 

The church of Kincardine is of recent date, a new one having 
become necessary in consequence of the decayed state of the 
former, the age of which cannot be ascertained. That old build- 
ing had been a place of worship in Catholic times. When the 
heritors agreed to build a plain church, more than two-thirds of 
the expense of it fell upon the estate of the late George Home 
Drummond, according to his valuation. But, having laid before 
the heritors an elegant plan of a Gothic building, from a design 
of the late Mr Crichton of Edinburgh, he generously offered to 
pay his proportion of the plain building, and to defray all the ad- 
ditional expense of the new one, according to Mr Crichton's plan, 
expressing his wish to put an end to the poverty-struck churches 
of the district. The heritors gratefully acceded to his offer, and 
hence the much admired structure in which the people of Kin- 
cardine worship. The taste and example of our heritors have 
since that time been followed by some of the neighbouring pa- 
rishes, as their elegant and commodious churches evince. 

There was also a new manse lately built, which in elegance, si- 
tuation, and convenience, harmonizes with the church. 

III. — Population. 

By the former .Statistical Account it appears that the amount of the population of 
this parish in 1 746 was, . . 2000 



and in 179L . . 2068 
Since that time it has been as under : —

In 1831 the number of males was 124G 

females, 1209 

In 1841 the population was . . 2232 

The increase in 1831 is accounted for by the number of men 
employed by Colonel Graham of Meiklewood, in floating the 
moss from his estate in this parish. The excess of the males 
above the females for the same year is to be ascribed to the same 
cause. 

Of the above population the amount in the village of Thornhill not including 
the rural population there. . . in 1821 was 595

Language, SfC. of the People. — A mixture of the Scotch and 
English language is spoken by the original inhabitants of this pa- 
rish, and Gaelic and English by the moss population who settled 
here from the commencement of the moss improvement. The 
Gaelic language has fallen so much into disuse during that time 

DO ° 

that few or none can profit by a sermon from the pulpit in that 
language. 

The habits, dress, and food of the parishioners are similar to 
those of the agricultural population of Scotland in general. It 
may be observed, however, that there has been a marked improve- 
ment generally since the last Statistical Account, in their habits of 
cleanliness, style of dress, and mode of living, arising from their 
being more independent in their circumstances. They are a so- 
ber, industrious, contented, enterprising, and successful people, 
and generally unexceptionable in their moral and religious cha- 
racter. 

IV. — Industry. 
The number of farmers, cottars, and farm-servants, exclusive of 
the moss, is 110, and the number of such labourers in the moss, 
110. 

There are 20 artisans, by whom about 30 subordinates are em- 
ployed. There are six superannuated male labourers in this pa- 
rish, two of them diseased both in mind and body. There are 
also two females of the latter description. 

Although the able-bodied portion of the population are em- 
ployed in field labour, yet such as are confined to their houses, 
during the winter season, are employed in thrashing grain, feed-

ing cattle, and keeping in order every thing connected with their 
farming establishments. The females in particular are occupied 
in needle work, knitting stockings, spinning flax and wool, making 
coarse kinds of dresses for themselves and their families ; in car- 
rvino- effffs, fowls, butter, and cheese to the market ; and in bring- 

J O OCT ' - 

ing in return things necessary for domestic use. I he system ot 
small wheel spinning and hand-loom weaving, which used to pre- 
vail in this parish, as well as in the other parts of Scotland, 
has been superseded by machinery in the cotton and woollen ma- 
nufactories. 

Much time is spent during a great portion of the year in cart- 
ing peats and produce to various places. The sale of peats was 
formerly carried on by all the moss people, and engaged much of 
their time and attention, and was found to be so profitable that 
in some years individuals have been known to realize from it as 
much as L.40 Sterling. 

Agriculture.— There are about 6560 acres in this parish which 
are cultivated. There are 142 acres of moor which are unfit 
for agricultural purposes, but would be profitable if they were 
planted; and there are 470 acres of moss, a great part of which 
will soon be removed by floating, or by making it into peats, and 
the subsoil, consisting of a superior quality of clay, brought into 
cultivation. There is no common remaining but about 10 or 12 
acres in the vicinity of Thornhill, open and unenclosed, as liable to 
certain servitudes. There are on the estate of Blair Drummond, 
about 500 acres in permanent pasture, and ornamented with 
trees, and about 300 acres of woods. 

In the pleasure grounds at Ochtertyre there are about 24 acres 
of fine old trees. And on a part of the moss there are about 24 
acres of a young plantation. 

The trees which appear to be indigenous to this parish are, the 
oak, common and mountain ash, Scotch fir, elm, alder, birch, 
plane, beech, and various kinds of willow. The spruce, larch, and 
silver fir, and others of the fir kind, as also the walnut, and Spa- 
nish and horse chestnut have been at different periods successfully 
introduced. The Spanish chestnut grows rapidly and to a great 
size, and its timber when matured is considered as next to the 
oak in value. 

The management of the woods in this parish with regard to re- 
gular thinning, periodical felling, pruning, and the like, has been 
very judicious.

Rent of Land. — The average rent of earse land. per acre has 
been about L. 2, 7s. 5 and of the dryfield, about L. 1, 7s. The 
average rent for grazing an ox or a cow is from L. 3 to L. 4 per 
annum. This is not a sheep grazing parish. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of labour during summer and winter, 
for the different kinds of farm-labourers and country artisans, is 
from 2s. to 3s. per day ; of masons, carpenters, and other country 
mechanics, from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. per day. The yearly wages of 
ploughmen are from L. 14 to L. 18, and of women employed as 
farm servants from L.5 to L.8. 

Live-Stock. — The horses in this parish are of a medium size, 
altogether fitted for agricultural purposes ; but as the labour of 
the carse farms requires a more powerful horse than that of the 
dryfield, a larger size is reared for this purpose by across between 
the hardy race of the western district of Perthshire, and the 
Clydesdale horse. Of late years, much taste and skill have been 
shown by the farmers in selecting at the neighbouring markets 
horses of strength and symmetry, by which means the breed has 
been much improved. 

The cow common to the Highlands of Perthshire till of late 
years prevailed ; hut for dairy purposes the Ayrshire breed has been 
generally reared, and has been found profitable to the farmer for 
milk, butter, and the market. A cross of one remove between 
the Ayrshire cow and the short-horned bull, has by some farmers 
been lately introduced for the purpose of increasing the size of the 
stock, as well as for dairy purposes, but the practice has been too 
limited to warrant any general conclusion. 

A five years' system of rotation is generally followed by the 
farmers in the dryfield, and a six years' rotation by those in the 
carse, and during this rotation marked attention is paid to the 
draining, cleaning, liming, and manuring of the land, which has 
greatly increased the return of every kind of produce, both in 
quantity and quality. 

Kincardine Moss. — It may be proper to take some notice here 
of the history of the moss of Kincardine. In showing the recent 
improvements of the parish, this becomes in some degree unavoid- 
able, and the utility is obvious, because these interesting topics are 
more satisfactory and useful when condensed in a Statistical Ac- 
count, than when in detached statements in various publications. 
The reader may see a good account of this moss and its improve- 
ments in the Farmer's Magazine for August 1817, containing a plan 

4 



KINCARDINE IN MONT KIT II. 



1269 



pf the moss and a drawing of the large wheel, and also in the En- 
cyclopaedia Britannica, Vol xii. and in the appendix to the former 
Statistical Account. 

The man who renders waste land productive increases the re- 
sources and prosperity of his country. This remark applies to 
some of the enterprising proprietors of this parish, and in particu- 
lar to the proprietor of the Blair Drummond estate. 

In the moss of Kincardine there were above 1800 acres of moss, 
including nearly 1 500 on the estate of Blair Drummond. This moss 
was very deep, resting on a subsoil of rich clay, which consists of 
strata of a gray, reddish, and blue colour, of the same quality as 
those of the level country along the Forth from Stirling to Falkirk, 
and which are called carses. The sea at one time must have co- 
vered the country where the moss of Kincardine was, and must 
have been the cause of this accumulation of clay. On the reced- 
ing of the sea and the subsiding of the waters of the Forth, the 
Teith and the Goodie, by the formation of deeper channels, 
this rich flat district was soon covered with oak, birch, alder, and 
hazel, and even with a few firs, some of the oaks being of a very 
great size, indicating a great age. These trees have been found as 
numerous under the moss as they can be supposed to have grown in 
their natural state, and the roots and heath have been found fixed in 
the clay. The trees and roots thus found correspond in dimensions. 

In " an Account of the Peat Mosses of Kincardine and Flanders 
in Perthshire," by the Rev. Christopher Tait, formerly minister of 
this parish, read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1793, 
and printed in the 3d volume of the Transactions, it is stated, that 
" Forty large oak trees were lately found lying by their roots, and 
as close to one another as they can be supposed to have grown, — 
one of these oaks measures 50 feet in length, and more than 3 
feet in diameter, and 314 circles or years' growths were counted 
in one ol the roots. In another part of the moss, an oak was 
found that measured 4 feet in diameter, and I am assured that 
some years ago, a root was discovered at Ross, on the south side 
of the moss, that was 15 feet in diameter at the surface of the 
clay ; and the tree, which was 22 feet in length, was 4 feet 8 
inches in diameter at the lower end, where it had been cut over, 
at the height of a yard from the ground." 

In 1823, an oak of the following dimensions was found in Blair 
Drummond moss: Length of bole 41 feet, circumference at the 
surface of the ground IG feet, and at the top 9 feet. One branch 



1-270 



PERTHSHIRE. 



18 feet in length, measured 5 feet 4 inches in circumference, 
The solid contents of this tree were 361 feet I inch. As there 
was only a part of the trunk found, the height of the original stem 
must have been about 60 feet. In Blair Drummond House, there 
are some beautiful pieces of furniture, which were made of an oak 
of great size, which was dug out of the bank and bed of the Forth 
in 1826. 

These trees cannot have died naturally, otherwise the roots 
could not have retained their strength and consistency so long. 
Nor can they have fallen before a hurricane, otherwise they 
would have broken at various heights from the ground, or been 
torn up by the roots, which has not been the case, as they are 
cut about two and a-half feet from the ground, being the part 
where the tree is easiest cut, and where the greatest strength of 
the person cutting can be applied. The general opinion is, that 
they were cut down by the Romans, as the marks of the size of 
a Roman axe have been seen on some of them. As the roots 
and trunks are found together they must have been cut, not for 
the value of the timber, but for clearing the plains and dislodging 
the natives. This is confirmed by history, because from the time 
of Agricola, the Roman soldiers and the provinciated Btitonswere 
employed to cut down the woods or make openings in them, and 
to make roads through the marshes for the passage of their ar- 
mies. In proof of this, various Roman antiquities have been 
found upon the clay under the moss, to which reference has been 
formerly made. Thus we find that they attempted to secure the 
northern frontier of the province, by cutting down part of the exten- 
sive forests which covered the level country along the banks of the 
Forth and Teith, and by establishing a regular chain of posts in 
the direction of Kincardine moss, the pass of Leny, and the sta- 
tion at Ardoch, where the forests formerly stood. 

Tacitus mentions the chain of posts between the Forth and 
Clyde as the work of Agricola in his fourth campaign, which co- 
incides with the year 81 of our era. About fifty years thereafter 
the wall of Antoninus was built nearly in the same line. From 
these references, therefore, the age of the moss of Kincardine 
must be about 1760 years. 

In 1766, Lord Kames having become connected with the es- 
tate of Blair-Drummond, by the succession of his lady, applied his 
intelligent and comprehensive mind to the improvement of this 
moss, and, during his lifetime, was pretty successful, but still the 



KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH. 



1271 



want of sufficient water-power made the process very slow. He 
was successful, however, in showing the practicability of the plan 
of floating which he had adopted. 

In the year 1783, his son, George Home Drummond, Esq., 
succeeded him. At this time, by the genius and perseverance of 
Mr Georo-e Meikle of Alloa, the son of the inventor of the thrash- 
ing machine, a water-wheel was invented for raising a large supply 
ofwater for floating the moss. It was lined with buckets round 
the whole inner circumference, made about four revolutions in a 
minute, and in that time raised from forty to sixty hogsheads of 
water. This it discharged into a cistern connected with it, seven- 
teen feet above the surface of the stream which supplied the wheel 
with water and turned the whole. From the cistern, the water 
flowed partly in pipes and partly in an open canal about 1754 
yards in length into the reservoirs in the moss. 

The water-power being thus procured, the floating by means 
of spade labour became comparatively easy, and the Forth served 
as a recipient for carrying the moss into the Frith. By the 
end of October 1787, the wheel, pipes, and aqueduct were all fi- 
nished, and the result realized the most sanguine expectations of 
all parties. The total expense exceeded L. 1000. The tenants 
voluntarily enaged to pay the interest of the money so expended, 
but the proprietor generously relieved them from this engagement. 

During the time of the great wheel, occasional and expensive 
repairs were necessary. Its labours commenced in 1787, and 
ended in 1839. At the time of the erection of the wheel from 
1-200 to 1300 acres were still to be cleared of Mr Drummond's 
moss, and a great number of settlers were required for this pur- 
pose. These were procured chiefly from the parishes of Callan- 
der, Balquhidder, and Killin. The population in this moss soon 
increased to from 800 to 1000, and the colony increased in pro- 
sperity, until they became in many instances so independent in 
their circumstances, as to become farmers on a larger scale. 
When a new line of turnpike road was made along the north side 
of the moss, giving them easier access to and from the mills and 
markets, so grateful were they to the proprietor, who had at 
great expense encouraged this road, that they made him a volun- 
tary offer of one hundred guineas for its advantages to themselves, 
which offer he generously declined. 

By the system of improvement which was then adopted, and 
which has been in operation since that time, nearly the whole of 



1272 



PERTHSHIRE. 



the Kincardine moss on the estate of Blair- Drummond has been 
reclaimed. 

The subsoil on which the moss rested, consists of very produc- 
tive clay, and carries good crops of wheat, oats, barley, hay, tur- 
nips, potatoes, and pasture. It is well known, however, that, for 
some years after the moss is removed, the new land does not pro- 
duce profitable crops of wheat, beans, and barley,'nor even of green 
crops. To prepare it for these crops, the roots and stocks of the 
trees must be removed, the ridges made straight and level, the 
water from the clouds skilfully disposed of by draining, the soil 
exposed by the plough to the action of light, air, and moisture, 
and enriched by lime and manure. 

By following this system these crops in the carse are even more 
abundant now than in the dryfield, and in all respects equally good 
in quality. 

The moss improvement on this estate has in all respects been 
completely successful, in reference to the return to the landlord 
and tenant, and in its advantages to the community. 

In thus adding to his estate, the proprietor has certainly been 
at great expense, in cutting canals, erecting the great wheel, mak- 
ing roads and sinking wells, dividing the water among his diffe- 
rent tenants, and in keeping the whole in repair; but the suc- 
cess which has attended his operations in this and his other agri- 
cultural improvements on his estate, for the mutual benefit of him- 
self, his tenants, and the public, must have afforded him very 
great pleasure. He has now the satisfaction of seeing, instead of 
the stagnant waters and the deceitful quagmires of the moss, the 
presence, prosperity, and happiness of hundreds of his fellow-crea- 
tures. Mr Drummond's predecessors were considered as roman- 
tic when this plan of improvement by floating was devised, and 
measures adopted for its execution; and the very people whom they 
employed were regarded with more than indifference by many, as 
a dangerous class, and as likely to become a burden to the parish 
and the district. But who does not now admire the foresight of 
Lord Kames, and the bold enterprise and liberal expenditure of 
his son and his grandson in this great improvement  The result of 
this wisdom is seen in the many happy families on the estate, in 
the many thousand additional bolls of produce which these te- 
nants carry annually to the market, and in the great amount of 
wholesome food which they thus provide for the public. 

In addition to the moss of Kincardine, Mr Drummond acquired 



KINCARDINE IN MONTE ITH. 



1273 



by purchase, some years ago, 280 acres of moss below Thornhill. 
There is no stream here, the level of the Goodie being too low, nor a 
water-wheel to carry away the moss from the spades of the work- 
men ; but reservoirs are made m the higher moss, called Moss 
Flanders, for receiving rain water, and from these, by sluices, the 
operation of floating is carried on. Although the moss here is 
very deep, and the labour and expense great, yet, of the 280 acres, 
170 have been cleared; and the remainder diminishes daily. 

On a part of this moss, and higher up the Goodie, about 75 
acres have been cleared by the same system, by Messrs Sim, 
Doig, Paterson, and their predecessors, who are still very in- 
dustrious and successful in thus adding to the extent of their farms. 

The trees found below this moss are of the same character as 
those found in Kincardine, consisting chiefly of large oak, and ly- 
ing on the clay with their tops towards the east. It is the gene- 
ral opinion, that no moss nor forest existed between this moss and 
that of Kincardine ; and, on the supposition that the trees were 
cut down by human labour, this is the position in which they 
would naturally be laid, because the space to the east of the ori- 
ginal forest being open, the first cut trees would be made to fall 
in that direction. 

In addition to these improvements in this parish, it is gratifying 
to refer to a most important one by Colonel Graham of Meikle- 
wood, for an account of which see the Quarterly Journal of Agri- 
culture, and the Prize Essays of the Highland Society of Scotland 
for March 1832, from which the substance of the two following 
paragraphs is taken. 

Colonel, then Major, Graham had 130 acres of good clay land 
in this parish covered by moss to the depth of ten feet. He had 
no water power of sufficient elevation near this moss ; but, as it 
was near the Forth, and running parallel to it, he adopted the plan 
not hitherto employed of raising water from the Forth by a steam- 
engine, for carrying the moss into that river by means of spade 
labour. He erected an engine of ten horse power, which, by 
means of pipes, forced as much water into a cistern at the engine- 
house, and from that into a large reservoir in the moss, as kept 
25 men constantly employed. This was allowed to flow as usual 
by a sluice from one side of the reservoir, in the direction of the 
portion of land which was to be cleared, and the 25 men, with 
their spades, were skilfully and actively employed in loading the 



1274 



PERTHSHIRE. 



stream with moss as it returned to the Forth, near the point, 
whence it had been raised. 

The engine raised t lie water at the rate of five tons per minute 
to the height of 38 feet from the surface of the river to the re- 
servoir at the top of the moss, conveying it in long wooden pipes 
to the distance of 400 yards. The operation began in May 1828, 
and the ground was all bearing a crop in 1832. There was paid 
to the contractor for clearing 100 acres, averaging ten feet deep, 
L. 2095 ; for coals, L. 816; wages of engine and furnace man, 
L.223, 4s. ; tallow, oil, leather, &amp;c, L.156. In all for clearing 
100 acres, L.3290, 4s. 

The ardour, liberality, and perseverance of Colonel Graham in 
tli is operation excited the attention and the unqualified praise of 
the whole proprietors and farmers of this district. But, as will 
appear hereafter, he is also entitled to the highest praise for 
other improvements. 

Another system of moss improvement has been resorted to on 
the estate of David Dundas, Esq. of Ochtertyre, M. P. for Su- 
therlandsbire. 

When, at the death of Mr Ramsay, the family of the late James 
Dundas, Esq., succeeded to this estate, there were about 243 
acres of it under moss, exactly similar to the moss of Blair- Drum- 
mond, to which it is united. Of these, 38 acres have been re- 
claimed and bear crops, and 20, being low moss, are under a 
thriving plantation. These 38 acres were improved by the 
late William Dundas, Esq., who had recently returned from In- 
dia, and, during a short residence here, was most deservedly and 
universally esteemed. He died in the prime of life while visiting 
the Falls of Niagara. 

As he had not a sufficient command of water at Ochtertyre, for 
conveniently reclaiming his deep moss, he improved that which is 
commonly called spreadfield, by trenching. This operation was 
performed by burying the moss under about sixteen inches of clay, 
which, by spade -labour, was thrown upon the surface, drains being 
at the same time made in it at proper distances. 

The land thus treated bears abundance of some kinds of crops 
to repay the expense of improving. The spreadfield moss is that 
from which the peat from generation to generation has been dug, 
and is generally about two or two-and-a-half feet deep above the 
clay. The twenty acres of fine thriving young plantation are up- 



KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH. 



1275 



on this kind of moss, which is kept dry by open ditches at regular 
distances. 

Draining.— The proprietors and farmers of this parish have 
been peculiarly successful in adopting the most improved system 
of draining ; but, as so much has been published of late respect- 
ing the construction of drains, in reference to their depth, distance, 
and the mode of filling them, it is deemed unnecessary to enter 
particularly into the subject here. It may be stated, however, 
that the utility of the frequent draining system was shown by Mr 
Ord, factor at Blair-Drummond, so early as 1826, in the north 
side of the cow park there, in which parallel drains were cut from 
top to bottom, at distances of fifteen feet, and filled with stones 
broken to a small size. 

Partial draining was practised at a much earlier period, in the 
dryfield part of this parish than in the carse ; but the system of 
deep ploughing and thorough draining, which Mr Smith of Dean- 
ston has done so much to introduce into general use, now prevails 
in both, and has been productive of the most beneficial results. 
That gentleman is so universally celebrated for his inventions in 
machinery, and improvements in agriculture, as to require no en- 
comium here. 

Mr M'Ewan of Black-dub, in this parish, who is a very intel- 
ligent and enterprising farmer, invented his well known drain- 
plough, the utility of which is particularly described in the Third 
Report of Drummond's Agricultural Museum. As a proof of its 
efficiency, it may be added, that he has opened drains by this 
plough in this parish to the extent of 448 acres, and about 100 
acres in the neighbourhood. 

It is highly creditable to the tenants of this parish in general, 
that they have been most skilful, persevering, and successful, not 
only in draining, but also in adopting all other modern agricultu- 
ral improvements. 

In 1831, a tile work was erected on the estate of Blair-Drum- 
mond, from which tiles are supplied gratis to the tenants of the 
carse lands, to the yearly value of about L.400, and the tenants 
are allowed to divide them among themselves, according to the 
size of their farms, the landlord reserving to himself the power of 
refusing them where the drains do not appear to be properly exe- 
cuted. 

So sensible are the tenants of this advantage, that they vie with 
one another to meet the wishes of the landlord, by making their 



1276 



PERTHSHIRE. 



drains properly, and by skilfully improving their farms. The 
dry field farmers are accustomed to use broken stones for filling 
their drains, of which they have abundance on their farms, and 
which, by competent judges, are in light soils preferred to tiles. 

Many of the most improved implements of husbandry are in 
general use here, not only in the cultivation of the soil, but also 
m the reaping of the crops, and in preparing the grain for the mill 
and the market. 

Some years ago, Mr Drummond secured a beautiful part of his 
park, on which were some fine old trees, against the encroachments 
of the Teith. This was accomplished at an expense of about 
L.100 per month, during two summers, by a strong wall of large 
stones projected into the bed of the river, and well sloped back- 
ward to the edge of the bank. In some places large piles were 
driven by a machine to secure the foundation, and at one place in 
water of considerable depth. This work has stood firm and un- 
injured by flood or ice ever since its construction. 

The progress of agricultural improvement in this parish gives 
the best proof of the comfortable relations that subsist between pro- 
prietors and tenants. The terms on which the land is let to the 
tenants, are by leases at so much per acre for nineteen years, in 
which they become bound to follow an improving system of rota- 
tion of crops by draining, liming, manuring, and judiciously 
ploughing their farms, the proprietors binding themselves at the 
same time to assist, according to the state of the farms, in bearing 
a part of these expenses. Hence a strong mutual interest in im- 
proving the soil. 

The lease includes the obligations of the contracting parties in 
reference to fences and farm-buildings, &amp;c. and the general prac- 
tice in regard to houses is, that the proprietors pay for the build- 
ing and furnish all the materials, and the tenants bear the expense 
of driving them. These houses in this parish, but especially in 
the eastern division of it, are very creditable to the proprietors 
and comfortable to the farmers, and have improved with the ad- 
vancement of our country in civilization. On the farms of Colo- 
nel Graham and Mr. Dundas, excellent new farm houses have 
lately been built, and also on the estate of Blair Drummond. 

There were formerly five corn-mills in this parish, but now 
there are only two. One of these, called Little-mill, is at the 
western boundary, for the benefit of the farmers there, and the 



KINCARDINE IN MONTEITH. 



1277 



other, called the Mill of Torr, is in the eastern division. This 
mill is convenient for the farmers, and is under good management. 
The buildings are good and suitable, the whole process of grind- 
ing and sifting is done by machinery, and the wheel is driven by 
water power. The miller dries and grinds the oats at 9d. per 
boll. The roads to this mill are so good and level that a horse 
can with ease carry an extra load. The mill is the property of 
Mr Drummond, who keeps it in repair. 

Three mills, which were called the Mill of Burnbank, Mill of 
Muck, and Mill of Cambusdrennie, no longer exist. The last 
was either built or rebuilt about 1690, as a stone bearing that date 
was lately found where it stood. Either then or some years af- 
terwards, George Drummond, or his son James, accomplished 
what was at that time a great undertaking, by forming a water lead 
along the whole length of the north side of the moss, to the extent 
of three miles, for conveying the water of the mill of Muck to the 
mill of Cambusdrennie. 

A modern mill certainly executes more work than two did for- 
merly, and the diminished consumption of oatmeal, and the im- 
provement in machinery, may, in a great measure, explain why 
there are fewer mills now. 

Some years ago, Mr Drummond erected a saw-mill near the 
church of Kincardine, which cuts timber by circular saws ; and 
is of great convenience and utility to the proprietor and to the 
people in the neighbourhood, who get their timber cut for farm 
and other purposes at a trifling expense. 

In addition to these improvements it may be proper here to re- 
fer to an elegant range of cottages which some years ago were 
built on the estate and near the house of Blair Drummond, for 
the accommodation of the people who are, from father to son, 
employed on this estate. These cottagers have houses and 
large gardens free of rent ; receive assistance in planting their po- 
tato crops, and have from 10s. to 12s. of weekly wages, during 
the year. When the plantations are thinned, they have the use 
of the crops, &amp;c. for firewood. Their condition is one of compa- 
rative ease and comfort, enhanced by the old having the happi- 
ness of seeing a portion of their offspring rising up to fill their 
places, and also by the hope of spending their own last hour in 
the place and house of their birth. The system is generous on 
the part of the proprietor as well as comfortable to his people, 



1278 



PERTHSHIRE. 



and it is so carried on as not to relax diligence nor encourage 
vice on their part, but the contrary. The same kind system, de- 
scriptive of the good old country gentleman, has long existed at 
Ochtertyre, not only in the time of the late Mr Ramsay, but also 
under his enlightened and accomplished successors. 

The facts which have already been stated in reference to the 
estate of Blair Dnimmond which is strictly entailed, refute the 
objections, in as far as it is concerned, which are occasionally 
made against entails, and this remark may be more completely 
confirmed by referring to the general system of management. 
Through several generations, part of it has been emerging from 
the condition of a wilderness into a state of high cultivation and 
abundance. On its improvement, above L.2000 are annually ex- 
pended, and it may be noticed that on another entailed estate, at no 
great distance, where the improvements are very great, a larger 
ura was expended for several years. But in both these instances, 
the proprietors are zealous land improvers, and the intelligence, in- 
tegrity, and success of their factors are so well established, that any 
sum for improvements may with advantage be put into their hands. 

The landed proprietors, in general, have it in their power to en- 
courage agricultural enterprise, aud to increase the comfort and 
independence of the farmers, by placing objects of ambition with- 
in their reach. This can be done not only by setting the ex- 
ample of skilful improvements in general, but also in so regulat- 
ing the size of their farms, as to give employment to men of 
small as well as of large capital. It is very encouraging to the 
skilful and industrious farm-servant, for example, to labour and 
economize, when he knows that he may in due time invest his 
hard-earned savings in a farm, where he becomes the master, and 
where he may rear his family in industry and comfort. It is a na- 
tional benefit to give all the population as great a stake in the 
great interests of our country as possible; and as our peasantry, 
in peace and in war, are the main-springs of our wealth and 
strength, let them by all means be encouraged, so as to secure 
their patriotism and independence. 

This principle is in operation in this parish : in proof of which 
it may be remarked, that the great number of small proprietors 
who farm their own estates have risen to this distinction by the 
very principle here recommended. Nor has it been overlooked by 
the more wealthy heritors. It became the more necessary, how- 



KINCARDINE IN M0NTE1TH. 



127D 



ever, on the estate of Blair-Drummond, because, in consequence 
of the moss population being suddenly superadded to the usual 
numbers of the parish, arrangements became necessary for giving 
them employment. Their rural labours did not occupy them dur- 
ing the whole year ; but they have always had sufficient employ- 
ment beside the moss operations, in draining, making and repairing 
roads and fences, and other improvements. It is part of the sys- 
tem of management on the estate of Blair-Drummond, to give, as 
much as possible, constant employment to the same number of 
persons, that industry and good conduct may have their due re- 
ward. It is considered of importance for the best interests of this 
class of the community to encourage them to maintain a good 
character, by securing to them a steady demand for their labour, 
and to avoid the evils of vicissitude in their condition, inseparable 
from any sudden increase or diminution of expenditure. And per- 
haps in no other place will persons of this class be found more in- 
dustrious, more skilful, and more respectable in their station than 
here, or in more comfortable circumstances. On the same prin- 
ciple the farms here are so varied in their extent, as to meet the 
capabilities of men both of large and small capital. 

But to apply these remarks to the moss population and their 
possessions, it may be stated, that the moss-field was originally 
let to the tenants in farms of about eight acres to each, for fifty- 
seven years, and at a nominal rent per acre during a great portion 
of that time. From the length of the lease the tenants were usu- 
ally called moss lairds, and, with their families, at one time 
amounted to about 1000 souls. On the expiry of the lease, 
however, the land must, to reimburse the proprietor, bring a 
much higher rent than formerly; but, as the tenement of 
each was too small to enable him, after the moss was re- 
moved, to pay even an ordinary rent, and at the same time 
maintain a profitable farming establishment, such as were not 
prepared to occupy larger farms contracted with their neighbours, 
for the disposal of their leases, which, with the consent of the pro- 
prietor, they were at liberty to sell. So early as 1792, there 
were sales of this description to the amount of L.849 Ster- 
ling, and since that time, the reversion of their leases has tri- 
pled in value, and many sales have taken place. In the pro- 
gress of the moss improvement, the practice has prevailed of one 
tenant purchasing the possessions of two or more of his neigh- 



1280 



PERTHSHIRE. 



bours, and thus, when the moss was removed, the same 
people, with the exception of those who had sold, remained 
in possession of the lands, and the extraordinary influx of 
that class of population diminished so gradually, as to prevent 
the evil of a number being suddenly thrown upon other re- 
sources. The forms where the moss used to be, are, by the 
wise system of the proprietor, made as small as the benefit of 
all parties would admit, and thus provision is made for continuing 
on these lands as many as possible of the original cultivators. 

Quarries. — The sandstone of this parish is used for the pur- 
pose of building houses and dikes, and making roads. In some 
places it is too soft for such purposes, but in others it is hard and 
durable. 

Fisheries. — There is a cruive dike extending across the Teith 
at Doune Castle, containing boxes for catching salmon. The 
right of fishing, which is of little value, belongs to the Earl of 
Moray, who pays yearly to the proprietor of Blair Drummond, in 
terms of an old decree-arbitral, 24| merks Scots, being L.I, 7s. 
9d. Sterling, for resting the dike on the south bank of the river. 
From this dike to the commencement of the town of Stirling's 
fishing near the junction of the Teith and Forth, the exclusive 
right of salmon-fishing is attached to the estate of Blair Drum- 
mond, but it is now much reduced in value, the only portion let 
producing a rent of no more than L.6 Sterling a year. 

Produce. — The valued rent of this parish is L.4784 Scotch. It 
is difficult to give accurately the amount in money of the aggre- 
gate value of its raw produce ; but the real rental has for many 
years greatly increased. In the last Statistical Account this rent- 
al was stated to be L.3500 Sterling, but it is now more than dou- 
ble this sum, not only in consequence of the great agricultural im- 
provements here, but especially by the addition of about 1700 
acres of good clay land, which have by the proprietors been re- 
claimed from moss since the last Statistical Account was written. 

Associations. — A horticultural society has existed for some years 
in this parish, which has excited much competition in the cultiva- 
tion of shrubs, flowers, and plants, and of all kinds of vegetables 
which are necessary for domestic use. It has been productive of 
much improvement in the appearance of the cottages and of their 
flower plots and gardens. Many of the cottages here are models 
of neatness and cleanliness.

Villages.— There are no market-towns in this parish ; the mar- 
ket-towns being Stirling, six miles, and Doune two miles distant 
from the manse. The only village in the parish is Thornhill, 
which includes Norriestoun, and in which there is a post-office 
subordinate to Stirling. 

Police.— One of the recent improvements, which have proved 
beneficial to this parish, is the establishment of a county police. 
Previous to their appointment, vagrants, tinkers, and gipsies from 
various quarters were numerous; but, by the vigilance of the police, 
they have been suppressed. 

Means of Communication.— -From the Bridge of Drip, six miles 
of the turnpike road from Stirling to the Port of Monteith pass 
through this parish, and about two miles from the manse towards 
Doune parish. There is a cross road turnpike as far as Thorn- 
hill, entirely new made, and about five miles long, which runs 
from near the Bridge of Frew, past the west end of Thornhill to 
the top of the ridge in this parish, which overlooks Callander. 
The Nethertoun Bridge, across the Goodie, on this road, was 
built, and the new part of the road in the carse, and in the moss, 
was made at the expense of Mr Drummond ; and if the proprie- 
tors in the neighbourhood of Callander were to extend the road 
on their side, there would be a very short line to Kippen, Fintry, 
and Glasgow. One public coach runs from Stirling to Callander 
twice a-week during winter and spring, and there are coaches 
daily on the same road during summer. 

There is now a direct communication between the north and 
south sides of this strath by a suspension bridge, which was de- 
signed by James Smith, Esq. of Deanston, and erected at the 
expense of Colonel Graham of Meiklewood in 1831. An ac- 
count of this bridge may be seen in the Third Report of Drum- 
mond's Agricultural Museum, and in the leading journals of that 
date. 

From the nature of the soil, and the state of the banks of the 
Forth, much difficulty occurred in finding good foundations for 
the pedestals at each end, but these were surmounted by the ge- 
nius of Mr Smith. The north end of the bridge rests on Colonel 
Graham's land in this parish, and the south end on a portion of 
land which he procured for the purpose from the proprietor of 
the estate of Gargunnock. This bridge cost at least L.800, and

entitles the Colonel to the gratitude of the whole district, because, 
previously, the only means of crossing the Forth, from the Bridge 
ol Drip to the Bridge of Frew a distance of about ten miles, 
was by insecure boats, and what was called a temporary peat 
bridge. A pontage is here levied from foot passengers, and all 
kinds of conveyances, and the Colonel, with the assistance of the 
Statute Labour Fund, keeps in good order the road from this 
point to the public road between Stirling and Doune. About a mile 
and a-half farther down the Forth, and shortly after the date of 
this bridge, he built another of smaller dimensions for L.350. 
The genius of Mr Smith appears in the simplicity, economy, and 
utility of this structure. It leads directly from Colonel Graham's 
new and elegant mansion-house, across the Forth to a part of his 
estate in this parish, part of which was, till lately, covered with 
moss, but is now, by moss-floating, levelling, draining, fencing, 
and planting, in a very profitable state of cultivation. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which is near the 
site of the old one, is too far north-west for a small proportion of 
the population ; but the situation was central before a chapel was 
built at Norriestoun. With a few exceptions, however, the most 
remote population are only from two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half 
miles distant. The church, which accommodates 770 sitters, was 
built in 1814, and was opened for public worship in 1816. 

The manse and offices were built in 1821, and are highly cre- 
ditable to the taste and liberality of the heritors of the parish. 

The glebe extends to seven acres, exclusive of the garden, 
road, and site of the manse and offices. The amount of stipend 
is 17 chalders, the one-half meal and the other barley, and pay- 
able according to the fiars of the county of Perth. There is also 
1 boll and 1 firlot of oatmeal payable to the minister, by the pro- 
prietor of the Blair- Drummond estate, in lieu of a servitude of 
peat, according to a decision of the Court of Session, in the time 
of the late Rev. Christopher Tait. L. 10 Sterling are also paid 
annually to the incumbent for defraying the expenses at the com- 
munion, by the award of the Court of Teinds, the sacrament 
being dispensed twice a-year. 

The number of families belonging to the chapel at Norriestoun 
and the church of Kincardine in 1831, was about 530, and the 
number of persons 2383. The number of Dissenters was from 
60 to 70, who belonged to the old and new ligdit congregations 



KINCARDINE IN MONTE ITH. 



1263 



in Dounc and Stirling. The attendance of the people in general 
on divine service in the Established Church is regular and devout, 
and thev are attentive to the duties of family devotion. The 
number "of communicants in the church of Kincardine is about 
300 in winter, and about 400 in summer. 

The Chapel of Ease at Norriestoun stands in this parish, and 
is four miles distant from the parish church. Gabriel Norrie of 
Norriestoun, a descendant of the ancient family of the Nornes in 
this parish, gave the church-yard and the site of the church there, 
upwards of 170 years ago, for a burying ground and a place of 
worship, in connection with the Established Church of Scotland. 
The minister of this chapel receives his stipend from the rent ol 
lands which were purchased by public and private collections, 
which were made by the authority of the General Assembly. The 
Presbytery of Dunblane are appointed by the Assembly to ma- 
nage this fund called the Norriestoun fund, with authority to let the 
lands, keep in repair the farm buildings, pay the public burdens, 
and the stipend of the minister at Norriestoun. The stipend va- 
ries from L.80 to L.95 per annum according to the state of the 
buildings and the amount of rent the land produces. He has, in 
addition to this sum, six acres of glebe, a garden, and also a 
good house, but the house, like the farm buildings, is built and kept 
in repair out of the rent of the land. 

There is a Bible. Society in this parish for Bible and mission- 
ary purposes, whose annual contributions to the General Assem- 
bly's Schemes have been about L.15. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish; one parochi- 
al school, one General Assembly's school in Thornhill, one in 
Kincardine moss, one unendowed in Thornhill, and another 
near the bridge of Drip. In these schools the branches taught 
are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, practical mathema- 
tics, book-keeping, geography, and English grammar ; and in 
the Assembly's school, in addition to these, the Greek, Latin, and 
French languages, and mathematics are taught. There is also a 
well attended Sabbath evening school. 

The parochial schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, and in 
all respects he enjoys the legal accommodations. His school fees 
amount to about L.14 per annum, and in addition, he receives as 
session and heritors' clerk, and from a mortification, about L. 12 



1284 



PERTHSHIRE. 



annually. This mortification is recorded in the minute of the 
kirk-session as follows : 

" At Kincardine, Tuesday 30th April 1695, the Earl of Perth, 
after the Revolution, and with consent of the United Presbyteries 
of Stirling and Dunblane, mortified, out of the vacant stipend of 
Kincardine, for the encouragement of a schoolmaster in this place, 
2000 merks Scots money," being L.lll, 2s. 2£d. Sterling. 

The school-fees, including all the classes, are from Is. 6d. to 
3s. 6d. per quarter for each pupil. The teacher of the Assem- 
bly's school receives from the Assembly's Committee, and some of 
the heritors of the Norriestoun district, an annual salary of L.22. 
The other emoluments of the teacher arise from the school-fees, 
which are from 2s. to 3s. per quarter, the number of scholars be- 
ing 50. He has besides an excellent school-house, dwelling- 
house, and garden, free of rent, from the proprietor of the Blair- 
Drummond estate, who lately repaired the buildings at a great 
expense. 

The teacher of the school in Kincardine moss has a free school- 
house and dwelling-house, and an acre of good land from Mr Drum- 
mond, and also a small gratuity for teaching a Sabbath even- 
ing school. His school-fees are from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per 
quarter, the number of scholars being about 100 during the greater 
part of the year. The other two schools, which are unendowed, 
are supported entirely by the school-fees, with the exception of 
school-houses and dwelling-houses free of rent. In the one there are 
100 scholars, who pay individually, per quarter, from Is. 6d. to 3. 
6d. In the other, which is near the Bridge of Drip, the number of 
scholars is 38, and the school-fees are from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. per 
quarter for each pupil. The teacher receives in addition a small 
sum annually from the parents of his scholars, and an allowance 
for a garden from the proprietor. 

The education in this parish is good, and the people are gene- 
rally attentive in sending their children to the schools, which are 
at a convenient distance, so that no additional school is required. 
The ample provision which is made for education has had a salu- 
tary influence upon the moral character of the people. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— As the greater part of this parish 
is landward, the poor are generally few in number, and the system 

 The presbyteries of Dunblane and Stirling are now disjoined.

of management such as has always prevailed in the rural parishes 
of Scotland. The paupers have, either by long residence or re- 
lationship, a claim upon the sympathy and benevolence of then- 
friends or neighbours, who are always willing to assist in support- 
ing them. On this principle, the kindly and unostentatious flow 
of private charity circulates from hand to hand and from heart to 
heart, and the aid from the poor's fund of the parish is adminis- 
tered as the circumstances of each individual may require. The 
minister and kirk-session select the most deserving objects of pub- 
lic charity, and adapt the monthly allowance to such as equitably 
as they can. There is no regular parochial assessment; but 
when extraordinary cases occur, the heritors frankly come for- 
ward with a voluntary contribution according to their valued rent to 
meet such cases. They have of late contributed in this way to a 
considerable amount for the support of two lunatics, a foundling 
child, and other extraordinary cases of pauperism. A legal assess- 
ment should, if possible, be avoided, especially in landward parishes, 
as tending to the increase of pauperism, and to the destruction of 
a feeling of independence among the poor ; but still the legal as- 
sessment is the most equitable system of parochial support, espe- 
cially in towns and boroughs, and where there are many Dissenters 
from the Establishment. The average number of paupers on the 
permanent roll during three consecutive years previous to 1838 
was about 16, each of whom received on an average yearly L.2, 
lis. 3d. The average annual contributions for their relief dur- 
ing these years was, from collections at the church door, L.24, 
18s.; and from mortcloth, proclamation, and other dues, L.16, 
2s. The latter sum includes L.5, 17s., being the interest of mo- 
ney mortified for the benefit of the poor. Although the poor 
in some instances show a delicacy in seeking parochial relief, yet 
in general they do not think it degrading to receive it, and are 
content with what they receive. 

Fairs. — There are no fairs held in this parish, except one for 
cattle at Thornhill on a small scale, being in the month of Ja- 
nuary annually. 

Inns, SfC. — In all this landward part of the parish, containing a 
population of about 1400, there is only one house licensed to sell 
ale or spirits, and only two in the village of Thornhill and its vi- 

 This sum is less than the usual amount given to the poor, because the list of 
paupers for these years includes a greater number than usual from Thornhill dis- 
trict, from which the fund receives 1.0 aid.

oinity, containing a population of about 820. Public-houses were 
at one time more numerous than at present ; and the diminution 
of their number has had a beneficial effect upon the morals and 
the pecuniary circumstances of the people. There being now less 
temptation to drink, instances of extravagance, idleness, and dis- 
sipation are fewer, the class of publicans is more select, and their 
houses are more orderly and their example better than formerly. 
The community are deeply indebted to the justices of the peace 
for their judicious attention to this and other subjects of police. 

Fuel. — Coal and peat are both used in this parish for fuel. The 
coals at Greenyards and Bannockburn are generally preferred, 
and the price is about 14s. per ton, including tolls, carriage, and 
custom at Stirling. There are three tolls between Kincardine 
and Bannockburn. The road is in two counties, and the distance 
is nine miles. 

The population of the Moss have generally used peat for fuel, 
of which, from their situation, they have had great abundance, 
and of excellent quality. At the commencement of reclaiming 
the moss, the peat was very cheap to themselves and to the sur- 
rounding district; but latterly, the steady demand for it at Stir- 
ling and the neighbouring villages, and especially at the distil- 
leries, has raised the price to from 4s. to 7s. per cart-load, accord- 
ing to the quality of the peat, and the distance to which it is car- 
ried. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

By attending to the preceding Account, it will appear that the 
variations betwixt the state of the parish at present and at the date 
of the last Statistical Account are of importance. 

Thus from 1600 to 1700 acres of excellent land have been re- 
claimed from moss, capable of producing from seven to eight bolls 
per acre of all kinds of grain. A new system of draining and im- 
proving land has been extensively adopted. Several miles of new 
turnpike roads have been made, and are well kept for the benefit 
of the whole district. Three new bridges have been built, which 
add greatly to the advantage of the public. There have been 
erected a new church and manse, and new offices ; and also a oreat 
number of new farm-buildings and elegant cottages. Above a 
hundred acres have been planted on the estate of Blair Drum- 
mond. Several acres have also been planted on the estate of 
Ochtertyre. The population, which, for some time, had frreU

increased by the settlement of the moss, has, for some years, de- 
creased by emigration to Canada ; by the removal of some to other 
places when they sold their moss possessions, or no longer found 
occupation there ; and also by the villagers of Thornhill and Nor- 
riestoun removing to places of greater trade, for the more profit- 
able employment of their families. The people being more in- 
dependent in their circumstances give their children a better edu- 
cation than formerly, and hence a marked improvement in their 
general character.
