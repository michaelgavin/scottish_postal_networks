PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. THOMAS DIMM A, A. M., MINISTER.  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Boundaries. — This parish, which comprehends the royal burgh, 
is bounded on the north by the Frith of Forth, and everywhere 
else by the parish cj" Dalmeny. In the town, but beyond the 
royalty, there are 422 inhabitants, and at New- Halls 90, by the 
census 1841. 

Climate §-c. — In winter the thermometer ranges from 46° to 
15°. In November 1830 it was 32° at the lowest, and in the fol- 
lowing January at 23°. The barometer is not subject to more 
than the usual variations. 

The Frith opposite the town is about a mile and a half in 
breadth. The tide rises 18 feet at the harbour mouth. The water 
is shallow on the southern shore; but the depth is greatest on the 
Fife side, where in the fair-way between the island Inch Garvie, 
and the Battery Point, the bottom has been found with a line of 60 
fathoms. At certain seasons, after floods occasioned by melting 
snow or falls of rain, the saltness of the water is much diminished 
by the volume of fresh water carried down by the Forth and its 
tributary streams. 

The town is supplied with water collected in an artificial reser- 
voir, very liberally formed, at the expense of the Earl of Rosebery, 
in the year 1819. This has proved an unspeakable advantage to 
the town. During the great drought of last summer, when the 
reservoir was nearly emptied, the burgh laid out upwards of L. 100 
m heightening the embankment, and thereby greatly increasing 
the supply of water. At the original formation of the reservoir, 
the town expended L. 200. 

The houses in the centre of the town are founded on sea sand, 
which extends to the foot of the risijg ground or brae, at the bot- 
tom of which the town is built. In the west and east, a bed of 
sandstone appears, which dips to the north with a considerable

angle of depression. In digging the foundation of houses or graves 
in the churchyard, sea-shells are found, affording evidence that the 
whole site of the town has been reclaimed from the sea. 

II. — Civil History. 
There is no complete account of the parish deserving of particu- 
lar notice, though there is an anonymous publication, bearing date 
1726, arising out of some disputes between the magistrates and 
the clergyman of the time, which contains various particulars 
of interest connected with the erection of the church, provision for 
the minister, &amp;c. Some documents also, in the hands of the 
representative of the ancient family of Stewart of Craigieball, 
show, in 1689, the state of the water passage, as divided into thir- 
ty-two shares, among twelve shareholders. There is likewise a 
petition, printed in 1718, and presented to the Convention of Royal 
Burghs, setting forth the great distress of the town, on account of 
the failure of trade, pressure of taxation, removal of sailors to New- 
Halls, and the quartering of soldiers passing to the north, and in 
returning from it. 

At a very early period, the spot where the town is built was 
much frequented, as the most convenient place for crossing the 
narrow strait which separates the county of West Lothian from 
Fife. At a remote era, it was denominated Freti Transitus, as the 
Romans, about the year a. d. 83, penetrated as far as the marshes, 
lakes, and forests in the neighbourhood of Lochleven. Various 
discoveries made of bones, funeral urns, &amp;c. in the town and im- 
mediate neighbourhood, point it out as the scene of fierce strife 
between the original inhabitants and its invaders ; and as it lay 
near the course of the Roman wall, built by Antoninus, a. d. 140, 
this may well account for the importance this place early acquired. 

On the conquest of England by the Normans, a. d. 1066, va- 
rious fugitives escaped to Scotland, and among these Edgar 
Atheling, heir of the Confessor's race, with his sister, Margaret, 
a most beautiful and accomplished maiden. Malcolm III., sur- 
named Cean Mohr, married this princess in 1067. To the west- 
ward of the town a spot favourable for embarkation was called 
Port Edgar, and some rocks, from whence the Queen was accus- 
tomed to pass to the opposite shores of Fife, in the low Latin of 

• George IV. embarked at Port Edgar on the 15th August 1822, on his return to 
England He was accompanied from Hopetoun House by General the Earl of Hope- 
toun At the same pier, on the 1st October 1823, the remains of the gallant and dis- 
tinguished earl were landed from His xMajesty's Sloop of War, Brisk, from France, 
amidst the regrets of the whole nation. 



QUKKNSFERRY, 



the time, Passagium RegincB and in the vulgar tongue, the Ferry, 
or the Queen's- Ferry, by which name it was then known. There 
was formerly a house on the beach, near some shelving rocks, 
called the Binks, which, it is understood, was built for the Queen's 
accommodation while waiting the arrival of her boat from the op- 
posite shore, on her way to Dunfermline, the royal residence. So 
much attached to this princess were the inhabitants, that her foot- 
mark was cut out in the solid rock; and some of the inhabitants 
speak of it as being in existence in the recollection of the ancient 
inhabitants. 

In a charter of Malcolm IV. the town was called Portus Re- 
gincB, who granted a free passage to the monks of Scone, ad Por 
turn Regince. Pope Gregory, in 1234, confirmed to the abbot 
of Dunfermline, dimidium passagice sanctce Margarita ReginoB, 
This was also granted to the abbey of Dunfermline, by Robert I., 
regranted by Robert IIL, and confirmed by James II. in 1450. 
At the Reformation this right was disposed of by the abbot, in 
sixteen shares,- but there is evidence on record that he actually 
sold eighteen-sixteenths. 

Though a port so early as Malcolm IV., it was not a royal 
burgh in 1556, when a tax was levied on royal burghs, but it pro- 
cured a charter of erection into a free royal burgh in 1636. Its 
erection was much opposed by Linlithgow, which was appeased 
by some degrading concessions. It appears to have sent a repre- 
sentative to Parliament in 1639. Under the Union it has the 
privilege of choosing a representative to Parliament, along with 
Stirling, Inverkeithing, Culross, and Dunfermline, The town- 
council consists of twenty-one, of whom two-thirds were formerly 
merchant sailors, and three were deacons of crafts. The number 
of persons residing within the royalty, whose rents in property or 
tenantry amount to L. 10, are 20 ; and in the extended royalty 
there are 10 persons resident rated at the same amount. 

The parish was an erection from Dalmeny, in the year 1636, 
ratified by Act of Parliament 1641, at which time, the place 
seems to have acquired considerable importance, in conse- 
quence of its commercial intercourse with Holland. At this 
time it possessed nearly twenty great ships, with several coast- 
ing vessels of a smaller size. A church was built in 1633, 
on the ruins of a very ancient chapel. Some tombstones 
bear the date of 1685, and one, apparently of a much earlier pe- 
riod. The magistrates and town-council are patrons of the churchy 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



The leno-th of the town does not extend to one quarter of a mile, 
and its breadth to a few hundred yards. It forms xne street, 
bounded by one row of houses on the north, and on the south 
several closes, as they are called, extend backwards. The shore 
is flat and sandv, except on the east and west, where ledges of 
rocks extend a considerable way into the sea. On the western 
ridge the harbour is formed. The rude erection of an early time 
has been replaced by -a very substantial pier and harbour, bmlt 
under the directions of Mr Stevenson, civil engineer. 

Parochial Registers.-The parochial registers extend from 16.5 
to the present time. The first entry in the record of baptisms is 
1635, and in that of marriages, 1635. They are not volummous, 
but have been regularly kept, though the register of baptisms ap- 
pears, with a few exceptions, since the commencement of the seces- 
sion, to contain only the names of those connected with the Esta- 
blished Church.

Eminent Men. — It is not known that any individuals of miiciv 
note have been connected with this parish, Mr Kid, whovwas mi- 
nister from 1710 to 174f3, was much distinguished as an emiiieiii. 
divine, and one of the twelve brethren who, in 1721, united in a 
representation to the Assembly respecting the act passed in con- 
demnation of the Marrow of Modern Divinity. The celebrity of 
this individual at the time of the communion attracted crowds from 
the most distant parts of the country. By the session record it 
appears that 600 communicants were sometimes assembled, and 

monie, sail pay to the reidar threttein shillingis four penneis. It was also ordanit 
that tbes personis sail give to tlie beddell the day of thair marriag 4s. It was also 
ordanit that the personis qusomevar that ar to be merriet sail cosigne the sowme

dar aucht shillings and to the beddell, four shillings. It was also ordanit 
qusumever persone sail depart this lyf above ten yeires sail pay to the 
beddell ten shillings, and under ten yeires six shillings aucht penneis, and that 
for the making of the graves. It was also ordanit that everi fornicator, es- 
pecially the man, sail pay to our box fur his trespas the sowm of six pounds, and 
the woman four pouds, and the relaps ever to be redowblit ioiies quoticn. It was 
also ordanit that qtsomever personis sail break the Sabbath day by taking other great 
or small boot to pass this ferrie, from the rysing of the sune to the twelf hour of the 
day, tbes personis sail be fynit for the first fault in twelf shillings Scotts the man, 
and if they sail fall in the sam fault againe, they sail stand at our kirk-door in sack- 
cloth, and mak ane cofessione of thair fault before the cogregane. It was also or- 
danit that if the master of the bootis sail give thair cosent to the botsman, they sail 
pay fyye pounds totics qiwlies. It was also ordanit that qtsomever browstar sail

Antiquities. — The burgh has no ancient buildings; but in the 
west end of the town the Carmelite church, dedicated to the Vir- 
gin, ts deserving of notice. It was built and endowed by the very 
ancient family of Dundas of Dundas, about the year 1330. Its 
extent and revenues are now unknown. It continues to this time 
the burial-place of the family, whose remains are deposited in a 
Vault under the place where stood the high altar, and now in a new 
tomb, formed by the present proprietor. The town suffered from 
time to time, from the hostile commotions that prevailed in the 
country. It was injured by the cannon of some ships in the time 
of the Commonwealth, as there are balls in the possession of some 
families, which tradition mentions as having been picked up after 
the cannonade had ceased. In the year 1745 the town was threat- 
ened to be plundered by the Highlanders on their march to Ed- 
inburgh, but the Happy Janet, a ship of war lying off the town, 
prevented their designs being carried into effect. 

There are some goo'd houses in the town, on what is called 
the Vaults. The church is a plain building, but in the year 1821 
was fitted up with very great neatness and taste, at the expense of 
upwards of L.500. It has an excellent bell, which the shipmasters 
brought from Holland, at the erection of the church. It has the 
following inscription : " Soli Deo gloria, Michael Burgerhuys me- 
keit, David Jonking, maerchant of Edinbruge, gifted this bell to 
the kirk of the Queensferrie. Cursed be they that takes it frae 
there. Anno domino 1635." It has a spire and two bells, and a 
council-room, in which the magistrates and council meet for the 
despatch of business.

IV. — Industry. 
No attempt hitherto made to supply the town and neighbour- 
hood with white fish has proved successful. In the summer months 
they'are brought here in boats from the east coast of Fife, by se- 
veral persons, who carry on a profitable trade in this article. In 



QUEENSKERllV. 



winter, it is very mortifying to see the London fishing smacks fit- 
ted with wells, carrying off numerous cargoes of cod to the south- 
ern markets, while our own fishermen only occasionally, while en- 
gaged in the herring-fishery, employ a line or two for that pur- 
pose with very indifferent success. To the westward of the town 
a salmon- fishery has been established, which has been carried on 
very successfully by its present tenant, Mr M' Queen. Stake-nets 
are employed, in which, particularly in the months of July and 
August, great numbers of salmon, grilses, and sea trout are caught. 
They are regularly sent to the Edinburgh market after supplying 
the demand in the neighbourhood. 

The herring-fishery is the principal employment of the inhabit- 
ants during the winter months. Masons, quarriers, with the re- 
gular fishermen, are occupied from 'the end of November to the 
beginning of March in this very useful and profitable branch of 
industry. It commenced in the year 1792, opposite to the town, 
in St Margaret's Hope, Inverkeithing Bay, &amp;c. Since that time 
it has been carried on with various degrees of success. The early 
period of the fishery was more successful than in recent years. 
During the war, the prices were high, and several curers embarked 
in the trade, and so many as 600 barrels were cured at this 
port. In 1831, which was a very abundant fishery, perhaps 
1500 barrels were cured ; but the curers, unable to cope with the 
carters, who came from all quarters of the country to purchase the 
herrings, could take advantage of those days only when the supply 
exceeded the demand. Forty or fifty carts were frequently in at- 
tendance, carrying away from 6000 to 12000 each. The price va- 
ried from 6d. to Is. 6d. per 100. The curers seldom purchased 
at a higher price than 7s. the cran or barrel. There are twelve 
boats belonging to the town, carrying each four or five men, and fur- 
nished generally with twelve nets, fifty yards long and thirteen yards 
deep. But the boats employed in the fishery from other places, 
Fisherrow, Prestonpans, Cellardykes, Buckhaven, &amp;c. may amount 
to about 50 or 100; the greater part of these discharge their cargoes 
at this port. This occasions a considerable bustle in the town, 
and is a principal source of revenue, each boat paying d. and every 
cart 6d. When the curing goes forward briskly, about twelve women 
are employed in preparing the herring for the barrels, which pay a 
duty, when cured on the pier, of 4d., and in the port, 2d. Those 
who are expert in the business can easily earn 2s. or 3s. per day. 
Though this trade is most beneficial to the country at large, it is 



8 



LINLlTHGOWSHIIll';. 



not favourable to the morality of the town. The use of ardent 
spirits is greatly increased, and the influx of carters, not generally 
of the most exemplary character, casts an influence round the her- 
ring season which is most injurious to sound morals. Since the 
year 1831, the fishery of herrings has been very irregular. Occa- 
sionally, some good seasons have occurred ; but, in general, they 
have been very unproductive. For three or four years, in the 
herring season, immense shoals of garvies, mixed with young her- 
rings, have appeared off the town and adjoining bays. They are 
an excellent article of food, and have amply rewarded the exer- 
tions of the fishermen when in demand ; but the Board of Fishery 
has often interfered, under the idea that the use of the trawl net, 
with small meshes, is injurious to the herring fishery- It is much 
to be wished that this matter were settled, so as to allow the fish- 
ermen to pursue their avocations. They must destroy many young 
herrings, but they are a mere fraction to the myriads of garvies 
that fill the water. 

A number of females are very profitably occupied in the summer 
months in spinning hemp for nets, which the younger members of 
the family boys and girls work up with great neatness, and ex- 
pedition. A net when finished is worth about L. 3, though an in- 
genious individual, Mr Faterson, once resident here, but now re- 
moved to his manufactory in Musselburgh, is able to furnish them 
at L. 2, 10s., by the aid of machinery, which he has brought to 
an astonishing degree of perfection. In the summer months a few 
boats of larger size, from the end of July to the beginning of Sep- 
tember, are employed in the northern or western fishery, each 
boat engaging with the curers, to furnish about 200 or 250 bar- 
rels, for which they receive 7s. or 8s., and sometimes a higher sum. 
But ihey are not always able to complete their quantity. A few of 
the young men also, from time to time, went to the Greenland whale- 
fishery, though misfortune and want of success in recent years have 
rather deterred them from engaging in this hazardous voyage, and 
they generally engage in the coasting trade, or proceed in vessels 
engaged in the North American wood trade. 

The manufacture of soap was formerly carried on with great 
skill, and on a great scale, in this town. There were four works 
employing about thirty or forty men, and paying an excise duty of 
L.SOOOor L.l 0,000 per annum. But the fluctuations of trade have 
been experienced here, as well as in other quarters, and for the last 
seven years there has been only one small manufactory employing 



QUEENSFEUIIY.

three or four men, and this also has for several years been discon- 
tinued. The trade is precarious, and far from lucrative. The 
workmen make good wages, and, as the business is at present con- 
ducted, the morals of those engaged do not suffer. 

There are no vessels belonging to the port, though a person hav- 
ing ship property resides here. The foreign trade is not carried 
on, though various coasting- vessels from time to time arrive here 
with barley for the distillery here and at Kirkliston. The 
coals used by the inhabitants are nearly all sea-borne, and in the 
winter months, some farmers in the country have been in the prac- 
tice of shipping potatoes for the London markets, and receiving in 
the course of the season cargoes of rape-cake, drain-tiles, dung, 
&amp;c. A few cargoes of stones are also sent to different ports, from 
an excellent freestone quarry at Humbie, about three miles distant. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

The situation of Queensferry is favourable for communication 
with the metropolis and the northern parts of the kingdom. The 
■water passage is admirably managed. The great northern road is 
in the very best state of repair,, while that to Edinburgh cannot be 
exceeded in excellence. This was the first turnpike road in West 
Lothian, formed in the year 1751. There is a post-office, at which 
the mail arrives from Edinburgh at half-past 6 a.m., and 5 p.m. and 
from the north at 5 a. m. and 8 p. m. There are two coaches which 
leave the town each morning for Edinburgh, and return in the 
evening. At various times in the day there are four other coaches 
which pass to and from the north. On the opening of the Edin- 
burgh and Glasgow Railway, in February 1842, a minibus start- 
ed to join it at the Winchburgh station. It was discontinued dur- 
ing the winter, and has not yet been resumed. 

There is much obscurity about the establishment of the water 
passage. It was once private- property, and appears to have been 
attached to the lands of Muiryhall, consisting of seventeen acres, 
in the immediate vicinity of the town. These were, it is suppos- 
ed, a donation from Queen Margaret, for supporting the passage. 
There were formerly two classes of proprietors ; the holders of 
shares, and the holders of boats and yawls. A change took place 
in 1784, when the whole boats were purchased by the shareholders 
and let by annual roup. They were kept in a state of good re- 
pair, and the arrangements devised by the proprietors were so ju- 
diciously carried into effect, that the interests of the public were 
as ss'eW consulted as circumstances would permit. The state of

the piers and ship{ings was, however, a great barrier in the 
way of comfort. Those on the sooth side, especially, were in a 
very ruinous condition, and at certain states of the tide much risk 
and inconvenience were experienced in landing and embarking 
passengers. 

This state of things continued till 1809, when a general desire 
was felt to improve the water passage, both by altering the system 
of management, and making such changes as its increasing impor- 
tance demanded. An application was made to Parliament in 
1809, rendered necessary by the following circumstances, — that 
there were no suitable piers, — no superintendents, — boats only at 
the North Ferry, where all the boatmen lived, — other traffic at the 
wharfs, unconnected with the passage, — and the arrangements at the 
piers so incomplete, as to admit of passage only four and a half 
hours in each tide. The rates and dues belonged to individuals, 
and the jurisdiction was such, that the proprietors could not be 
compelled to keep the piers in a state of repair. 

By the act, trustees were nominated, consisting of the following 
persons, viz. the Keeper of the Great Seal, Privy Seal, Lord Justice- 
General, Lord Advocate, Lord Justice- Clerk, Lord Clerk- Re- 
gister, Lord Chief- Baron, and Vice- Admiral of Scotland, Keeper 
of the Signet, Postmaster- General for Scotland, Lord Lieutenants 
of Perth, Linlithgow, Fife, Kinross, Clackmannan, Commander 
of the Forces, Admiral of Leith ; Chief Magistrates of Perth, 
Linlithgow, Queensferry, Inverkeithing, Dunfermline ; the Sheriffs 
of the counties ; the proprietor of the estate of New-Halls; and 
all having L.200 Scots valuation in the above counties. Nine 
trustees to be a quorum ; a committee of management consisting 
of fifteen, who have the power of making bye-laws. To these 
trustees, by the act, was committed the power of constructing land- 
ing-places, purchasing ground for boatmen's houses, opening quar- 
ries in any common in Fife, on the shore, within high water- mark, 
between Port Edgar and the Long Craig. 

At this time there was only one pier on the north side, two oii 
the south, one at New- Halls, the other at Queensferry, Advan- 
tageous, however, as an alteration and improvement of the passage 
obviously were, there was great and continued opposition, which 
at length was happily overcome. The localities for the proposed 
piers were surveyed by the celebrated Rennie. The Chancellor of

the Exchequer agreed to propose to Parliament to advance one- 
half of the money required for the purchase of shares and the 
erection of piers, on condition that the other half should be advan- 
ced by individuals. The sum expended in purchasing the property 
of the shareholders, and improvements at the Ferry, amounted to 
L. 33,824, 14s. 9d. ; of this, the public paid L.13,586, J Js. 8d., 
and there were lent by individuals, in sums of L.500, L.20,238,

The original funds subscribed being exhausted, there was a se- 
cond application, in 1812, made to Government, and a new sub- 
scription. By these means the Long Craig Pier was built ; the 
small East Battery Pier ; the West Battery Pier on the north side 
was raised and enlarged ; the North Ferry Pier lengthened, &amp;c. 

Steam navigation was introduced, and the Queen Margaret put 
on the passage on October 1st 1821. This caused additional ex- 
pense in the raising of the piers. To meet this, the sinking fund 
was pledged, two large sailing boats were put down, and two pin- 
naces with their crews. The Queen Margaret cost L.2369. 
Since September 1820, there have been three large sailing boats 
of the original construction, the Earl of Moray half-tide boat, and 
three pinnaces. The crews of these, thirty-six men and boys. 
The hire of a boat, when light, 2s. 6d. ; dark, bs. Large ditto,

ing vagrants with the legal passes. By the act, not more than two- 
thirds of the boats and yawls to remain at each side. The boat- 
men are not liable to be impressed. Two superintendents to be 
appointed. 

Steam navigation by the Frith and across it, by coaches passing 
to Burntisland, greatly diminished the number of passengers at 
this ferry, but in 1811, we have the following account : 228 per- 
sons crossed each day, and sometimes 447; 1515 carriages annu-

The steam-boat has contributed much to the accommodation of 
passengers in calm weather and cross winds ; the boats, instead of 
being long on their passage as they formerly were, being taken in 
tow by the Queen Margaret, are scarcely twenty minutes in pas- 
sing. There are two porters at each side paid by the trustees. The 
boats are manned by experienced seamen, well acquainted with the 
navigation, generally regular in their habits, and polite in their at- 
tention to passengers. No loss of a boat has occurred for more 
than sixty years ; and this may be considered one of : the best re- 
gulated ferries in the kingdom. In October J 838, a most melan- 
choly accident occurred at the Newhalls Pier, owing to the very 
reprehensible practice of driving the coaches to the water's edge 
along the piers, to receive passengers from the boats. A young 
lady and a female servant were precipitated with the coach, into 
which they had just entered, into the water, and drowned before 
they could be extricated. The mother of the lady and a gentle- 
man had nearly shared the same fate. Since that fatal day, which 
will not be speedily forgotten, the practice of driving on the pier 
has been abandoned. Two or threq times in the year the boats 
may be prevented from crossing by stormy weather or contra- 
ry winds, but this very rarely extends to a few hours. At the 
present time, 1831, the rental of the passage is L.I 840 per an- 
num; the tacksmen engaging to keep up the boats and pay the 
wages of the men. 

The harbour of Queensferry was once in a very ruinous condi- 
tion, but is now in a very excellent state of repair. The funds for 
making the recent improvements were raised by a contribution of 
L.OOO from the convention of royal burghs ; L.200 from the two 
noble families in the neighbourhood ; and the remaining L.800 
from the funds of the burgh, arising from the sale of the Ferry 
muir to Dundas of Dundas for L. 1610. In winter, when the her- 
ring-fishery is prosperous, the harbour is often crowded with ves-

5els engaged in curing. The dues exigible by the town, which aro 
almost the only source of revenue now possessed by the burgh, 
are let annually by public roup. Since the removal of the soap 
trade, the rental has been gradually falling off, and now amounts 
only to L.80 per annum ; since the erection of the distillery, it 

has risen to L. 1 00. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is placed in the centre of the 
town, and is most convenient for the inhabitants. It is in an excel- 
lent state of repair, and may accommodate about 400 persons. 
There are numerous free sittings, more than are equal to the de- 
mand. The seats, with the exception of three free seats, are an- 
nually let by public roup, under the authority, and at the sight of 
the magistrates. The. rental forms a part of the stipend. There 
is neither manse nor glebe belonging to the .minister. The living 
is increased by a Government allowance of L. 49, 13s. 4d. ; and 
in lieu of a manse and glebe, L.50 have been recently granted by 
a late act of Parliament. 

Ministers. — 1. Mr Robert Gibbeson, ordained 13th August 
16.35, and died in 1641; 2. Mr Ephraim Melville, grandson of 
Andrew Melville, ordained 1st September 1641, transported to 
Livingston, 1650; 3. Mr John Primrose, ordained 28th October 
1652, removed in 1662, by the Indulgence came back to Queens- 
ferry, and died 28th December 1673. There were six ministers 
between 1673 and 1690. Of the number, Archibald Buchan 
continued only one year, in 1683. None of them died here. 
Mo-t of the number appear to have preached without being regu- 
larly inducted. 4. Mr Donald Campbell, transported from Muir- 
avonside in December 1693, died in 1697 ; 5. Mr John Grieson, 
ordained in 1700, and died tn the year 1709 ; 6. Mr James Kid, 
ordained 28th September 1710, and died 9th February 1743; 
7. Mr Archibald M'Aulay, ordained 1746, and died 1781; 8. 
Mr John Henderson, ordained 1782, died June 1820; 9. Mr 
Thomas Dimma, ordained 16th November 1820. 

There is one Dissenting meeting-house here belonging to the 
Associate Synod. The stipend, it is believed, amounts to L.90 
per annum, raised from the seat-rents. Families attending the 
Established Church, December 1830, 110 ; number of persons iii 
the above, 464 ; number attending Dissenters, in forty-one fami- 
lies, 194; Roman Catholics, in three families, 14. At the pre- 
sent time, April 1843, the families attending the parish church 
are 111, and the number of persons in these, 448. The number 



14 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



of fam.hes, in connection witii the Dissenters, is 40, containing 
214 persons, of whom 9 are Roman Cathoh'cs, and 11 belong to 
other religious denominations. There are 169 communicants be- 
longing to the Established Church. 

Divine service is well attended both in the Established Church 
and Dissenting congregation ; although it is to be regretted, that 
many connected with each, are either very partial, or altogether 
negligent in their attendance on ordinances. The average num- 
ber of regular communicants in the Established Church is 130. 
There is a penny a-week Bible society, and collections are annually 
made in the church, for various religious and charitable purposes, 
which may amount on an average to L.12 or L.15 annually. The 
average of the collections made at the church-door in aid of the 
poor funds, amounts, for the- last ten years, to the annual sum of 
L.35, but now to about L. 28. 

Education — There are three schools in the town, viz. the 
burgh or parochial, one private and unendowed, and one female 
school. The usual branches are taught in the burgh school, in- 
cluding English, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, geography, 
mathematics, Latin, Greek, and French. In the private school, 
English, writing, and arithmetic ; in the ladies' school, the various 
branches of female education, including music and drawing. The 
salary of the burgh teacher is L.29, 4s. 6d. per annum, which, 
with the addition of the school-fees, can scarcely make an income 
of L. 60. The average annual expense- of a single pupil varies 
from 10s. to L.l, 10s. The burgh school is numerously attend- 
ed, and well taught. A new school-room is just nearly finished 
for the reception of the pupils, in room of the old one, which was 
the worst in the bounds, while the new erection will be one of the 
best in the country. 

Libraries. — There is one subscription library, containing nearly 
600 volumes, one under the management of the Associate Burgher 
congregation of 400 volumes, and one belonging to the Sabbath 
school, containing 1335 small publications suited to the young. 
This school has been taught by the minister, for twenty-two years, 
every Sabbath evening, for two hours and upwards, and has proved 
of great advantage to the rising generation. It has always been 
well attended. The library has been most beneficial in exciting 
a taste for reading, and storing the minds of the young with useful 
knowledge. 

Friendly Societies.- — There are two Friendly societies in the

town, from which allowances are made during sickness, and at 
death, the funeral expenses are paid. It is another feature m one 
of these, a weeklv payment is made of one shilbng and a penny, 
which is paid out'in one sum, half-yearly, at the time when house- 
rents are due. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— TQ average number of the regu- 
lar poor, 16; allowance monthly, from 3s. 6d. to 8s.; church- 
door collections, L.35 ; rent of money and land, L.23 ; average of 
legacies, mortcloth, and marriage dues, L.5; interest of L.5000 
just bequeathed by Captain Henry Meek, deceased, a native of 
the parish, and now payable, making the allowance of 37 persons 
on the roll from 3s. 6d. to 8s. per month. From this fund, 
also, about twenty children are educated. No means have ever 
been adopted to procure relief for the poor, but the usual mode 
of church-door collection. This has hitherto met every demand 
without having recourse to assessments. The poor of this parish 
have in former times been unusually well provided for by the kind 
attentions of various individuals in the respectable classes, but by 
death and a change of circumstances this supply has been very 
much diminished. By a decision of the Court of Session, the poor 
residing in Queensferry, but in that part of it belonging to the pa- 
rish of Dalmeny, have been found entitled to share in the bequest. 
This adds about -25 persons, who receive an allowance from the 
Meek funds. It has not been found that there is any great reluc- 
tance to apply for parochial relief, though, in many cases, it has 
been offered before it was sought. It has often, however, been 
observed, that many persons permit their aged relatives to remain 
on the poor-roll, which, with a better spirit, they might easily pre- 
vent. The collections at the church-door have been greatly di- 
minished since the Meek bequest has been dispensed. One 
mode of relieving the poor is well deserving of imitation by 
those whom Providence has blessed with the means. The Coun- 
tess of Rosebery gives employment in spinning to the widows and 
industrious females of the town, who are able to earn at least 2s. 
or 3s. each month. This produces excellent effects on the inha- 
bitants, and induces them to practice a useful art, in many quar- 
ters of the country fallen into disuse. 

There is a jail in the burgh, or rather a lock-up house. Prison- 
ers are seldom detained beyond a single night, being removed after 
examination to Linlithgow. The town-officer is the keeper of the 
jail.

Fair. — The annual fair in August is injurious to the morals of 
those who only require excitement to indulge in intemperance, but 
agreeable to others whose families are happily assembled at that 
time. A custom has been observed, from time immemorial, the 
evening before the fair : the boys dress one of their number with 
a covering of burs, from head to foot, adorning him with ribbons 
and flowers, and conducting him, led by his companions, through 
the town and neighbourhood. They receive small donations from 
the inhabitants. The origin of this practice cannot be ascertained. 

Inns, Akhouses, Sfc— There are 1 inn in the town, 8 alehouses, 
and 4 shops where accommodation is provided for drinking. 
The facilities enjoyed here for the use of ardent spirits have 
been most prejudicial to the morals of the people. Accidents of 
a most frightful character have occurred almost every year from 
the immoderate use of spirits, and though there have been deaths 
both by fire and water, the votaries of dissipation are neither im- 
proved nor diminished in number. There are m--h poverty and 
wretchedness originating from this cause ; children are neglected 
by their parents, and families are reduced to misery by the disso- 
lute habits of those who ought to provide for them. 

Coals are brought by sea from Fife, and from Bo-ness, &amp;c. by 
carts. They are seldom furnished at a lower rate than 10s. per 
ton, and sometimes a nuich higher price. When sold in small 
quantities to the poor, the cost is much greater. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In the summer months this place is much resorted to by many 
for sea-bathing and change of air. The accommodation is gra- 
dually improving, and the delightful walks in the vicinity render it 
particularly attractive. Since the date of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, the appearance of the town is considerably improved ; seve- 
ral new houses have been erected, and alterations made contribut- 
ing both to beauty and convenience. Shops of a more respectable 
description have been established, and the demand from the 
country increasing, enables the merchants to retail at prices very 
similar to those in the metropolis. The brewery long esta- 
blished here has been discontinued. For two years, a distillery 
has been in operation here, under the firm of the Glenforth Dis- 
tillery Company. It is on a small scale, making from 1700 to 
2600 gallons weekly ; but, being fitted up in the most approved 
manner, and skilfully managed, it produces spirits of the first qua- 



. QUKENSFKURY. 



17 



lity. It gives employment to about twenty persons, and adds 
considerably to the trade of the port in its imports and exports. 

Since June 1838, a new steamer, the William Adam, has been 
put on the passage, the Queen Margaret having proved inadequate 
to the work required. The new vessel was built by the Messrs 
Menzies, and her engine, of forty horses' power, by Mr Maxton, 
Leith. Length, 98 feet, and breadth, 32 feet. She has proved 
a very superior sea-boat, and renders this ferry one of the best 
and easiest in the kingdom. She leaves the south side every 
hour, and the north side at the half hour, from sunrise to sunset. 
The William Adam was honoured by conveying Queen Vifioria 
and Prince Albert across the Frith, on her royal progress to the 
north, on the 5th September 1842. The day was most beautiful ; 
the water unruffled ; the crowds on both shores very great ; the 
sea covered by numerous steamers and boats, gayly adorned ; in- 
deed, the whole scene was calculated to make an impression not 
speedily to be f "gotten. It is understood that the Sovereign ex- 
pressed the greatest satisfaction with all the arrangements made 
on board the steamer. Mr Mason, the superintendent, took the 
helm, while the attentive skipper, Charles Roxburgh, attended 
to the other duties. 

Since the William Adam was put on the passage, which cost 
L.2800, raised by subscriptions among the trustees, the establish- 
ment has been greatly reduced, as the steamer, except at the 
great cattle fairs, performs nearly the whole duty of the passage. 
There are, however, two large boats and two pinnaces, which can 
be used when required. The number of working hands amounts 
now only to sixteen, with a shore-master, clerk, and two porters, 
at each side. The rental paid by the tacksmen- at this date 
amounts to L. 1880. It may be useful to notice the expense at- 
tending the steamer on the passage, viz. three tons of coal con- 
sumed per day, at 8s. 6d. ; oil for the engine per do., a quarter 
of a gallon ; cotton per month, half a hundred weight. The 
boilers require to be cleaned every fortnight, at 14s. of charge ; 
the furnace bars are renewed every six months ; a quarter of a 
hundred weight of tallow is used per month ; and the expense of 
ropes, &amp;c. per week, may amount to L.l. The crew consists of 
five men and a boy, whose wages amount to L.5, 5s. per week. 
It is pleasant to be able to speak of the correct and steady ma- 
nagement of this ferry, when travellers know the very minute when 
they can procure a passage, and, by well regulated signals, when

on the water, secure the presence of a carriage awaiting them on 
their arrival at the pier, where civil porters and hostlers, connected 
with the establishments on each shore, consult the comfort and 
convenience of passengers, who may calculate on crossing in ten 
or twelve minutes.

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp;TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. LEWIS H. IRVING, MINISTER. 

L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 5fc. — This parish derives its name, written 
formerly Abercorne, from the ancient monastery of Aebercurnig. 
The confluence of a rivulet, called the Cornie burn, with another 
stream at the bottom of the high bank on which the church stands, 
points out the probable origin of the name as descriptive of the 
site of the monastery. 

The parish extends 4| miles in extreme length, and 2 miles 
in extreme breadth, containing 7.03 square miles. It is of a rect- 
angular figure, stretching east and west, and bounded on the east 
by Dalmeny ; on the south, by Kirkhston, Auldcathie, an an- 
nexed porcion of Dalmeny, and Ecclesmachan ; on the west, by 
Linlithgow and Carriden ; and on the north, by the Firth of Forth. 

The surface is exceedingly diversified, but although broken in- 
to many picturesque undulations and irregularities, no part of it 
attains an elevation above 350 feet. Two points alone have re- 
ceived the name of hills, Binns hill and Priestinch hill. The for- 
mer, at the western extremity of the parish, is arable to the sum- 
mit : insulated and rising with uninterrupted slope from the sea, 
although of no great height, it commands an extensive and mag- 
nificent view of the shores of the Frith, and the circumjacent 
country, with a bounding amphitheatre of hills, formed by the 
Grampian, Ochil, Pentland, and Campsie ranges. Priestinch 
hill, on the south border of the parish, is a precipitous mass of 
trap- rock, surrounded on three sides by a green bog called the 

3. 



ABERCORN.

Prlestinch. Its altitude is inconsiderable. The suminit is nearly 
flat, of an oval form, and has been rudely fortified at some remote 
period. The shore is clayey, intersected at several points by low 
rano-es of rock : near high water-mark, the beach is covered with 
rolled stones and boulders of greenstone. The bottom is flat to 
seaward, the tide receding a great way, but inland the ground rises 
abruptly, presenting a steep, though not precipitous bank, from 80 
to 100 feet high. The line of coast, extending about four miles, 
is of singular Ijeauty. Seen from the terraces and rides judici- 
ously conducted along the heights, — a series of irregular promon- 
tories with receding bays and steep undulating banks, clothed with 
trees to the water's edge, except where a few green slopes and 
winding glades occur, just sufficient to break the uniformity of the 
wood, — form a rich foreground to the varied views of mountain, 
shore, and flood beyond. 

Meteorology. — The average temperature for seventeen years, ob- 
tained from a register kept by Mr Smith at Hopetoun House, is 

Hydrography, — The Frith of Forth is here about 2 miles 
broad, the water is much discoloured from the particles of impal- 
pable mud suspended, and prevented from subsiding by the action 
of the tides and winds. The degree of saltness is not materially 
lower than that found nearer the mouth of the Frith. The springs 
are perennial, but neither frequent nor very abundant, flowing 
chiefly from the coal measures ; they are more or less tinctured 
with iron and sulphuretted hydrogen. One spring has been used 
medicinally, but its qualities are by no means powerful ; its waters 
have not been analyzed. There are several artificial sheets of wa- 
ter of small extent, two of them employed as mill-ponds ; the others 
are ornamental. The only streams are mere rivulets ; the largest, 
the Midhope, or Nethermill burn, rises in the parish of Linlith- 
gow, about seven miles from its mouth, entering this parish at the 
south-west angle; it flows easterly through a deep wooded glen, 
and reaches the coast a few hundred feet below the church, being 
joined near the sea by the Cornie burn, a still smaller rivulet. 
Blackness burn, which separates Abercorn from Carriden, and the 
Linnmill burn, which divides it from Dalmeny, both flowing north, 
and neither of them above one mile and a-half in length, exhaust 
the slender hydrography of the district. 

Geology. — The strata are much deranged and interrupted ; the 
prevailing direction is from north-east to south-west, and the dip

WGSlGrlVj til 6 angle varying from 5 to 60 degrees. The 
most remarkable disturbance is seen in the ravine, near the mouth 
of the Nethermill burn. The rocks are the sandstone, shales, 
limestone, &amp;:c. of the coal-formation, with protruded masses of 
trap, such as Binns hill, Priestinch hill, and two or three of smal- 
ler extent. The limestone occurs denuded in the central and 
eastern portions of the parish ; the stratum is about 10 feet thick, 
covered with an alluvial deposit of gravel, clay, and rolled stones;- 
fossil shells, and beautiful impressions of ferns, have been found 
in the accompanying shales. Coal appears, and clay-ironstone in 
the south and south-west districts, but the seams, so far as vet ex- 
plored, are of minor importance. Calcspar is abundant in the 
fissures of the limestone, but the crystals are small and insignifi- 
cant. The general alluvial deposits consist of clay, mixed with 
gravel and rolled stones. The bank on which the church stands, and 
some others near the coast, seem to be composed of gravel and 
beds of sand. The soil is varied, — loam on a clay bottom is its 
most prevalent aspect ; the loam is shallow, except in hollow and 
peculiar localities. Boulders of greenstone, weighing several tons, 
are occasionally met with. A small coal mine has existed for a 
few years past at Priestinch, close to the Union Canal, in the 
neighbourhood of which the coal crops out, dipping to the north- 
west at an angle of 20°. The seams are small, the upper one 
being eighteen inches, and the under one twelve inches in thick- 
ness, separated by three feet of shale, a band of clay ironstone, four 
inches thick. Both seams of coal are soft and friable ; the lower 
one is used as smithy coal, and yields the better price. 

Zoology. — An otter {Lutra vulgaris was killed some years ago 
in the Nethermill burn. The Hopetoun deer-park, extending to 
118 acres, is stocked with between 200 and 300 head of fallow- 
deer, [Cervus dama. Squirrels {Schirus vulgaris abound in the 
woods. The weasel {Mustela vulgaris is common. The stoat 
{M. erminea and the polecat M. putorius are more rarely found. 
The seal {Phoca vitulina, and the porpoise {Delphina PlioccEna 
occasionally visit the shores. Sir Robert Sibbald mentions the 
capture of a whale, in 1692, at Abercorn,of the razor-back species, 
{Rorqualis borealis, measuring 78 feet long, which had infested 
the Forth for twenty years, and from a perforation in its dorsal fin 
by a ball, was known by the name of the " hollie pike." The 
fox {Fulpes vulgaris is tolerated in the coverts for the chase; 
hares are numerous, and of late years, the multitude of rabbits has

become a nuisance. Buildings are much infested with the brown 
rat Mus decumanus and the common mouse M. musculus ; 
whilst the black rat  M. rattus and the short-tailed field-mouse 
Arvicola agrestis are not plentiful. The pheasant {Phasianus 
Colcliicus has been introduced, and has multiplied extensively in 
the preserves; the partridge {Ferdix cinerea is not abundant 
\voodcocks{Scolopax Eusticola, sn\\e {S. Gallinago, and wild-duck 
{Anas Boschas are still rarer. The cuckoo is a yearly visitant, and 
the woods are alive in summer with the notes of the blackbird and 
thrush, and the cooing of the wood-pigeon. The smaller birds 
common to the climate are plentiful ; the numbers of the missel- 
thrush or storm-cock {Turdus viscivorus have latterly much in- 
creased. During the protracted severity of the winter, in the com- 
mencement of 1838, a male blackbird was repeatedly observed, 
whose plumage had become snow- white, with the exception of a 
few speckled feathers. The crested lapwing  Vanellus cristatus, 
the dottrel {Charadrius Morinellus, a'nd the grey plover {Squata- 
rola cinerea, are frequent. The shores are peopled with flocks 
of waders, consisting of plovers, gulls, {Larus fuscits, L. argentatus, 
and L. eanus, and the lesser auk [Alca Torda. Apart from 
which the heron Ardea cinerea seeks his food in lonely spots. 
An exterminating warfare is waged against the crows, magpies, 
hawks, and owls, but the various races contrive still to exist. Se- 
veral years ago a pair of black swans {Cygnus atratus, from New 
Holland were placed in a pond near Hopetoun House, and bred 
repeatedly : but the female having been unfortunately destroyed 
one winter by a fox, the male bird remains the sole tenant of his 
pool. Salmon {Salmo salnr, and its congeners Salmo trutta, 
and S. albus, approach the coast when the season is somewhat 
advanced. Skate {Raia Batis, and flounders [Platessa Flesus, 
are frequently caught, soles {Solea vulgaris occasionally, and 
sometimes, but very rarely, sturgeon Accipenser Sturio. 

The common muscle Musculus edulis is found in consider- 
able quantities. Formerly some attention was paid to the forma- 
tion and preservation of the scalps, so as to furnish abundant bait 
for white-fishing, but they have been now long neglected. The 
cuttle fish {Sepia vulgaris is at times cast ashore. 

Botany. — From the small portion of the land that is waste or 
in a state of nature, the botanist has but a narrow range in pro- 
portion to ihe extent of surface. The sea-shore and the neigh- 
bouring water-courses furnish the following list of rarer plants :

Trees of many kinds have been extensively planted, and 
thrive well, particularly beech, elm, oak, sycamore, lime, and 
chestnut, Scots, silver, and spruce fir, and larch. The masses of 
wood are penetrated and rendered accessible in every direction by 
rides and green glades, whose windings and recesses afford many 
exquisite glimpses of forest scenery. The plantations have been 
chiefly formed during the early part of last century, and there are 
but few traces of great age. The cedar trees {Cedrus Lihani in 
the Hopetoun pleasure-grounds are well worthy of notice, from 
their size and beauty. Planted only in 1748, the largest already 
measures 15 feet 7 inches in girth, and 87 feet between the ex- 
tremities of its branches. The increase of girth has been 5 feet 
within the last thirty years. In the same grounds, a sweet chest- 
nut tree {Fagus castanea measures 13 feet 9 inches, and an aged 
beech 14 feet 4 inches in circumference. The growth of the 
silver firs {Abies picea, planted early in the last century, is re- 
markable, several being nearly 100 feet high. The tulip trees 
{Liriodendron tulipifera are of considerable size, and frequently 
flower. The hemlock spruce {Abies Canadiensis has been intro- 
duced, and grows vigorously. To the east of the house, near a 
quarry, a plane tree {Acer pseudo-platinus, of 14|- feet in girth, 
is more notable for the number of its spreading branches and the 
ground it covers than for the thickness of its trunk, the distance 
betwixt the extremities of its boughs being 116 feet. A range of 
gigantic ash trees {Fraxinus excelsior, of unknown age, marks the 
ancient boundary of the parish churchyard. The largest measures 
16 feet in girth. Their hoary trunks and shattered limbs are 
monumental of generations long since passed away, whose dust 
slumbers at their feet. In an arboretum attached to the gardens 
at Hopetoun House are several Scots firs {Pinus si/lvcstris of 
great size and picturesque form, and groups of various exotic 
trees; amongst others, the Cedrus deodara and the Abies vnrinda

from the Himalaya. One of the latter, a very gracefu tree, but 
a few years old, has attained the height of 20 feet ; whilst several 
vigorous specimens in various parts of the grounds are curious from 
belno- grafted on the common spruce fir. A Siberian pine [Pinus 
cimbra Siberica in one of the flower-borders, is remarkable for the 
peculiarity of its form and the tardiness of its growth. With a 
vigorous thickly-thatched head, it is only ,5i feet high, and its 
trunk but a few inches in diameter, though nearly a hundred 
years old. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices.— The Monastery of Aebercurnig is more 
than once mentioned by Bede, and appears to have been a Culdee 
establishment of early'date. In the latter part of the seventh 
century, it formed the residence of a bishop, at a period when 
Whitherne in Galloway was the only other Episcopal seat south 
of the Forth. In 696, when Aegfrid, King of the Northumbrians, 
whose kingdom included the Lothiatis, was slain in battle by the 
northern Picts, Trumuini, who then held the see, deeming Aber- 
corn too near the Pictish kingdom of Fife, forsook the monastery 
with his followers. Trumuini, of whom Bede speaks with respect, 
was in all likelihood a Culdee bishop, as the papal authority had 
then but little influence in Scotland. The Castle and estate of 
Abercorn were possessed by Walter Avenale in the middle of the 
twelfth century; and in 1176, a dispute took place betwixt his 
son, John Avenale, and Richard, second Bishop of Dunkeld, re- 
garding the patronage of the parish, the monastery being then 
extinct. As might be expected in those days, the claim of the 
prelate was triumphant. In 1460, the whole church lands be- 
longing to the Bishop of Dunkeld on this side of the Forth, 
including Abercorn, Cramond, Preston, and Aberlady, were 
erected into one barony, called the barony of Aberlady. In the 
thirteenth century, the estate of Abercorn passed by marriage into 
the possession of the Graemes, and was held by the patriot, Sir 
John the Graeme, the friend of Wallace, killed in battle against 
the English at Falkirk July 2-2d 1298. The estate was subse- 
quently the property of the Black Douglases. Abercorn Castle, 
a strong natural position, partook of the fortunes of that proud 
house. Repeatedly attacked during a period peculiarly turbulent, 
it was besieged by James II. in 14,55, and taken by storm on the 
8th of April.f The Earl's retainers were put to the swoid, and

the castle destroyed. Buchanan speaks of it as " semidiruta arx" 
in his time. It was never rebuilt. The estate was conferred by 
the Crown on Claud Hamilton, the tirst Viscount Paisley, third 
son to the Earl of Arran. Forfeited for his adherence to the for- 
tunes of Mary, it was restored to his son by James VI., created 
m 1606 Earl of Abercorn. From this family it passed successively 
to the Mures, Lindsays of the Byres, and Setons, and was sold 
by Sir Walter Seton in 1678 to John Hope, fkther to the first 
Earl of Hopetoun. The estate had dwindled at that time to a 
few acres, but had the sheriffship of the county attached to it, 
until the abolition of heritable jurisdictions. 

Eminent Men.— Thomns Dalyell of Binns, a General in the 
army, and for some years at the head of the forces in Scotland, 
was born in this parish in 1615. His private eccentricities fur- 
nished scope for the sarcastic pen of Swift in the Memoirs of Cap- 
tain Creighton, while the puWic history of General Dalyell forms 
an important element in the narrative of the troubles of the Kirk 
of Scotland. Undaunted courage, and blind devoted fidelity to 
his sovereign, form almost the sole redeeming points in a life re- 
dolent of cruelty. He died at Edinburgh in 1685. The family vault, 
erected in 1623, is attached to the church, but of his place of sepul- 
ture there is no record. His portrait, well executed, is preserved at 
Binns House. John Dundas of Philpstbun, advocate, procurator 
for the Church, and the author of the Abridgement of the Acts of 
Assembly, published in 1721, was a native of Abercorn, and a pro- 
prietor and elder within its bounds. John, fourth Earl of Hope- 
toun, whose character conferred a lustre of its own on the rank he 
held, was born at Hopetoun House in 1765. His reputation as a 
.soldier belongs to the history of the last war, with whose details 
his military career as General Sir John Hope is amply interwoven. 
The Corunna dispatch, written when he assumed the command 
on the death of Sir John Moore, at the close of that day of 
mingled grief and glory, is well-known, and needs no comment. 
He was, however, not less remarkable for business talents of a hio-h 
order, and all the milder graces of private life, than for courage 
and capability in the field. Created for his services Baron Nid- 
dry in 1814, he succeeded his brother James, third Earl of Hope- 
toun, in 1816. On his retirement from military life, he devoted 
himself, among other avocations, to the public business of the 
county over which he presided as Lord-Lieutenant, and by his 
assiduous and punctual attention to all the minutiae of county mat-

ters, produced a very marked amelioration. In the discharge of the 
functions devolving upon him as a magistrate, a landlord, and a 
parent, his intellectual endowments and high personal qualities of 
integrity, love of order, and benevolence, together with the dignity 
andunaPfected kindliness of his deportment, invested him with a 
beneficial moral influence, of great power and wide extent. His 
sudden and comparatively premature death was felt as a pubhc ca- 
lamity, and his memory is still deeply venerated. He died at 
Paris, August 27th 1823. His remains have been latterly inter- 
red in a cemetery of Saxon architecture near the church. Besides 
the statue in bronze erected in St Andrew's Square, Edinburgh, 
two portraits of this Earl, painted by Raeburn, have been several- 
ly placed ill the county halls at Linlithgow and Cupar. In 1822, 
his Majesty George IV. visited Hopetoun House on the day of 
his embarkation for England. This tribute of his sovereign's 
esteem was as singular as it was justly earned; the Earl of Hope- 
toun being the only private individual so honoured during the 
King's sojourn in Scotland. 

Land-owners. — The old valuation of the parish amounts to 
L.6945, 7s. Scots, now divided between two proprietors, the Earl 
of Hopetoun, who possesses L.6212, 3s. Scots of valued rent, and 
the trustees of the late Sir James Dalyell, Bart, of Binns, whose 
property within the parish is valued at L.733, 4s. Scots. The 
Hopetoun estate is an aggregation of smaller properties acquired 
at various periods, such as Philpstoun, Stoneyhill, and Morton, 
formerly possessed by branches of the house of Dundas ; Duntar- 
vie, the property of a family of Durhams; Midhope, a former seat 
of the Earls of Linlithgow ; Craigton, possessed by the Ewings ; 
and Duddingstoun, lately the property of Gabriel Hamilton Dun- 
das, Esq. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial records are voluminous. 
The minutes of kirk-session reach from 1691 to the present time, 
with the exception of the years from 1737 to 1750 inclusive, dur- 
ing which a protracted vacancy occurred. The register of baptisms 
commences with the year 1585 ; some of the earlier portions are, 
however, imperfect. The record of marriage proclamations and 
that of deaths are complete from 1700. The ministers since the 
Revolution have been, Alexander Dalgleish, inducted in 1690 ; 
John Brown in 1700 ; Henry Lundie in 1740, transported to 
Edinburgh in 1758; John Richie in 17.39; Hugh Meiklejohn, 
D. D., Professor of Church History in the University of Edin- 
burgh, inducted in 1791 ; and the present incumbent in 1831.

LINLITHGOWSHIUR. 



Jntiquities.—The Roman wall, or « Vallum Antonini," con- 
necting the Friths of Forth and Clyde, has been styled by some 
writers the wall of Abercorn ; it is, however, matter of dispute 
whether that line of defence extended so far east. Sir Robert Sib- 
bald, indeed, writing from his own observation, and Font's former 
survey, says, that the wall passed Abercorn, and terminated at the 
" laird of Manor's windmill," which occupied an abrupt eminence 
at the commencement of the eastern approach to Hopetoun 
House, where traces of escarpment are still visible. Bede, how- 
ever, states that the wall terminated at Peanfahel or Penneltum, 
distant about two Roman miles from the monastery of Aebercur- 
nig.f This language would apparently determine Blackness as 
the Peanfahel or " head of the wall." A prolongation or outwork 
may have been at some period continued along the coast as far as 
the " windmill knowe." No light has been thrown on the subject by 
the discovery of monuments or inscriptions. The remains of the 
monastery have wholly disappeared ; some foundations of buildings 
and a mass of deep black loam, of limited exent, in the vicinity of 
the church, are the only traces hitherto found. The site of the 
castle of Abercorn is marked by a green mound, the ruins having 
been carefully removed at the dictate of the taste prevailing when 
the Hopetoun pleasure-grounds were first laid out. The situation 
was singularly strong, accessible from the east by a narrow neck of 
high ground, but surrounded on all other sides with steep banks. 
The socket of an ancient cross, occupying its original position, was 
exhumed last year, in altering the west end of the church ; and by 
the removal of an out-building, the shaft was exposed, mutilated, 
and converted into an obscure window lintel. The two sides visi- 
ble are elaborately carved with arabesque tracery in relief, resem- 
bling the crosses at lona. Midhope House, a building of consi- 
derable age, is in tolerable preservation. It consists of a square 
turretted tower, with a cumbrous addition attached to the east 
side. The old doorway bears above it a coronet, and the letters 
J. L. in cipher, the initials of the then Livingstone Earl of Lin- 
lithgow. An oak stair, of massive workmanship, still gives access 
to the upper stories of the house, inhabited by labourers. 

Mansion- Houses. — Binns House, an irregular mass of build- 
ing, garnished with turrets and embrasures, is beautifully placed on 
the western slope of Binns hill. It was built in 1623, and enlarged 
by the late proprietor. The park around is highly picturesque ;

the grassy acclivities of the hill being interspersed with scattered 
trees and groups of evergreens. The summit is crowned with a 
high round tower, forming a conspicuous land-mark. Duddmg- 
stoun House, a modern erection, of a heavy castellated character, 
stands on high ground in the south-east of the parish, and com- 
mands an extensive view. Hopetoun House, the principal residence 
of the family of that name, holds a pre-eminent place among the 
mansions of the land. Originally planned by Sir William Bruce 
of Kinross, it was commenced in 1696, but not completed until 
many years after, under the superintendence of Mr Adam. The 
front is very extended, consisting of a corps de logis, with advanced 
wings terminating in octagonal dome-roofed towers, and connected 
with the body of the house by sweeping colonnades. The archi- 
tects have sedulously avoided all prominence in the minor details, 
enhancing materially the general effect. The decorations, though 
not obtrusive, are yet sufficiently rich and numerous to prevent 
heaviness or insipidity. The stables, contained in the north wing, 
are on a scale of princely magnificence. The internal accommo-. 
dations are extensive, although convenience has been somewhat 
sacrificed to the production of an imposing fa9ade. The library 
is rich ia early specimens of printing, and illuminated conventual 
manuscripts. An ample collection of paintings has been formed, 
including works of many ancient masters, both of the Flemish 
and Italian schools. Occupying an elevated plateau, the front 
view, from the house eastward, embraces the opening of the Frith, 
with its picturesque shores and rocky islets. North Berwick Law 
closing the vista. The grounds within the plaisance are kept in 
high order, formerly laid out after the French symmetrical taste. 
The more formal arrangement has been broken down, but the 
quaint dipt yew-trees and grassy terraces have been sufficiently 
spared, to soften the transition from the style of the house and its 
architectural accompaniments, to the irregularities of form and 
outline, characteristic of the more modern alterations. The gar- 
dens are extensive, well sheltered, and of varied exposure. Much 
and successful pains are bestowed on their culture. The walks 
within the grounds, more especially along the verge of the steep 
sea bank, abound in interesting views, whilst the abundance of 
tall evergreens renders the bleak aspect of a Scottish winter less 
perceptible. The eastern and principal approach proceeds up 
the centre of an open levelled esplanade, but the western leads 
through an overarching avenue of noble elms, forcibly illustrating

In the census of 1841, the population isstated to be 2147. This 
extraordinary increase arose from the residence of about IJOO la- 
bourers during the formation of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Rail- 
way. 

From the record of baptisms, it would appear that the permanent 
population was more numerous in the close of the seventeenth cen- 
tury than at any subsequent period ; the annual average of births 
for ten years being then about 39, whereas, for the ten years pre- 
ceding 1792, it hardly reached 20, and is now but about 28. 
Probably the obliteration of several farms, in order to form the 
parks and ornamental grounds in the vicinity of Hopetoun House, 
may explain the decrease.

There is no natural wood, but the extensive plantations, covering 
nearly one-sixth of the whole surface, abound in all varieties of 
well-thriven trees. Much attention has in general been paid to 
thinning and pruning, and the surrounding fences are kept in ex- 
cellent repair. The rent of land in cultivation varies from L.l, 
15s. to L.2, 10s. The annual rent of grazing per ox is about L.3.

are in great measure determined by the corresponding prices in 
Edinburgh and its neighbourhood. Some attention has been be- 
stowed in the improvement of the cattle, by the introduction of 
the Teeswater breed. The husbandry, in most respects, has 



ABEUCOUN. 



29 



kept pace with the general improvement in method and farming 
implements common to the country. Furrow-draining, both with 
stones and tiles, is of late becoming frequent, and from the gene- 
rally retentive nature of the subsoil, the results are most beneficial. 
Stones fit for drains abound in all directions, and drain tiles are 
easily procured from the manufactory at Blackness, distant but a 
short way from the boundary of the parish. The general dura- 
tion of leases is nineteen years. The grass parks are let from 
year to year. The farm-buildings are by no means showy, al- 
though commodious and in good condition. 

Quarries and Mines. — Several quarries of excellent freestone, 
in various parts of the parish, have been occasionally wrought 
from a very remote date. The stone is durable, and well adapted 
for building. The quarries in the northern and central districts 
yield a stone varying in hue from a cream colour to a palish-gray ; 
in the south and south-west, a hard durable freestone is procured 
of an intensely dark-gray, approaching to black. Both admit of 
being wrought for ornamental purposes. Hopetoun House fur- 
nishes a very favourable specimen of the lighter variety, whilst the 
dark has been employed in the erection of the house and otKces 
at Duddingston. A quarry of trap, on the north face of Priest- 
inch Hill, opened by the Road Trustees, affords the best material 
for roads in this vicinity. Limestone has been extensively exca- 
vated in the central and south-eastern parts of the parish. The 
workings are of great age ; and it is traditionally reported, that 
the lime used in the once famous fortifications of Dunkirk was 
obtained from Abercorn. The stone is still quarried in consider- 
able quantities on the farm of Newton, giving work to about ten 
men. It is of a dark gray colour, but becomes pure white when 
calcined, being very free from foreign ingredients, with the 
exception of carbon. It becomes so extremely friable in the pro- 
cess of burning as to unfit it for the draw-kiln. The method re- 
sorted to is that styled the sow-Jdln. Its purity renders the lime 
fitter for agricultural purposes than for building. The bed of 
limestone measures 10 feet in thickness, and the depth of the 
alluvial covering varies from 15 to 35 feet, whose removal adds 
very considerably to the expense of working. The lime sells at 
2s. 6d. per boll of six imperial bushels. The coal mine, near 
Priestinch, is of small extent, and without peculiarity. The num» 
ber of people employed is about seventeen. The water is drawn 
off by a small steam-engine.

FisherT/.-The only fishery is at the mouth of the Linn-mill 
Burn, where very extensive stake-nets are erected for the capture 
of salmon. This station was once tolerably productive, at least 
in the latter months of the fishing season ; but of late years, the 
quantity taken has diminished materially. The lessee holds the 
right of fishing from the proprietors of a great extent of coast. 
The rent paid to proprietors within the parish is about L.60 
yearly. During several months, nearly thirty men are employed. 

Amount of Rav Produce. — The following is an approximation 
to the gross amount of raw produce yearly raised : — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, . L. 10,500 0 0 

potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. . 2,000 0 0 

hay, . . 2,000 0 0 

land in pasture, . . 7,000 0 0 

annual thinning of wood, 100 0 0 

fishery, say . . 200 0 0 

quarries and mines, . 9U0 0 0 

Total annual value of raw produce, L.22,700 0 0 

The annual rent of real property, as assessed in 1815, wasL.7722. 

The burning of lime is the only branch of manufacture, with 
the exception of the ordinary country artisanship. There are 
two corn-mills driven by water, and a saw-mill lately erected, by 
the Earl of Hopetoun, on the Nethermill Burn, the prospective 
utility of which is very apparent, from the great extent of the 
plantations, and the quantity of full-grown timber. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The nearest market-towns are, 
South Queensferry, distant three and a-half miles, and Linlithgow, 
about six miles from the church of Abercorn. The former is the 
most accessible post-town to the great bulk of the inhabitants'; com- 
munication by a private runner takes place twice a-day. There is 
neither medical practitioner, general merchant, baker, nor butcher 
within the parish ; the villages of Newton, Society, and Philpstoun, 
being mere hamlets, and furnishing merely a few retail shops for 
groceries. The cluster of houses near the church cannot be cal- 
led a village. The turnpike road from Queensferry to Linlithgow 
traverses the parish for nearly four and a-half miles, all the others 
are statute-labour roads. These, together with the bridges across 
the rivulets and canal, are kept in good repair. Stone and lime 
walls are frequent, but the most prevalent fences are hedges and 
dry stone dikes, which are efficiently maintained. The Union 
Canal passes through the south part of the parish, near its 
boundary, affording the most accessible means of public con- 



ABERCORN.

veyance; and the line of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, 
runs alongside, and in some parts but a few yards distant from the 
canal. No harbour or quay exist, but small vessels with coal un- 
load their cargoes on the beach, in the bay at Society ; and lime- 
stone is some times exported in the same manner. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church stands near the centre of 
the north boundary of the parish, and close to the sea shore. This 
situation is tolerably convenient, being about three miles from the 
extreme points, while the greater part of the population reside 
within two miles. Part of the church is very ancient ; the date of 
its original erection is, however, unknown ; it was enlarged and 
fitted up soon after the Reformation, some of the old wood-work 
bearing a. d. 1579. Built at various periods without much re- 
gard to convenience or beauty, the form is most irregular, and the 
accommodation was wretched until 1838, when a thorough repair 
took place. Being now drained, floored, the walls lathed, and a 
heated air apparatus constructed, it forms a comfortable place of 
worship, nearly adequate to the wants of the community. There 
are no sittings let, the whole, with the exception of the private 
seats of the heritors, being allotted to the parishioners. The 
church bell, of considerable size, and handsome workmanship, 
presented by a naval gentleman, was formerly the bell of a Danish 
ship of war, and formed part of the spoil at the battle of Copen- 
hagen. Part of the manse is of an unknown date ; additions have 
been made to it at various times ; it was last altered and repaired 
in 1832. The garden is large, walled, and productive. The 
glebe contains between five and six acres, and might let for L.15 
a-year. The stipend consists of the following items : bolls of 
wheat old measure, ; barley, 92; meal, 16 £; total, 
192f| ; money, L.50 ; for communion elements, L.8, 6s. 8d. ; and 
the whole may average L.240. There is no dissenting place of 
worship in the parish ; the nearest is at Queensferry. The num- 
bers belonging to different denominations were in 1832 as follows, 
nor have the proportions much altered since : Established Church, 
192 families; 948 persons of all ages; Seceders, 12 do. ; 41 do; 
Episcopalians, 1 do ; 2 do. The church attendance is very good. 
A communion- roll, embracing all the members, has been kept, 
since 1832, and regularly revised by the kirk-session previous to 
the dispensation of the Lord's Supper, which takes place twice a- 
year. The number on that roll is at present 390 ; the average 
number of communicants at each time, is 350. The kirk-session. 



32 



I-INLITHGOWSHIRR, 



consisting of the minister and seven elders, has, for seven years 
past, revived the custom, once maintained in the parish, of hold- 
ing stated diets for prayer once a-month. This practice proves 
a benefit in many respects. A parochial association has exist- 
ed since 1835, vk'hose funds are equally distributed among the 
schemes of the Church of Scotland. A prayer meeting, connected 
with the subject is held monthly, and a growing interest in the ob- 
ject and success of missionary enterprize is discernible since its 
institution. The disposable funds amounted last year in contri- 
butions, L.6 ; four collections at church doors, to L.18 ; in all dis- 
tributed as above, L.'24. 

The ordinary collections and donations for he poor amount 
yearly to L. 62, which, with L.18 of extraordinary collections, 
gives L. 80 as the average sum collected at the church doorsfor 
all purposes. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, the parochial 
school, and one exclusively for girls, supported by the Countess 
of Hopetoun. In the parish school, the greater part of the pupils 
are receiving instruction in reading, writing, English grammar, 
arithmetic, and geography. A few- are taught mathematics, Latin, 
Greek, and French. The school is opened and closed with prayer. 
The Bible is employed as a class-book, and the Shorter Catechism 
universally taught. The number in attendance is about 80, chiefly 
boys. The explanatory system is vigorously pursued. At the 
female school, the children are instructed in reading, writing, 
English grammar, and geography. The Bible and Shorter 
Catechism are employed daily, and the teaching is efficient. The 
number of pupils is about 70, all of whom are taught to sew. A 
Sabbath school, under the personal superintendence of the minister 
and elders, has existed for some years, attended by 130 children. 
Classes of male and female catechumens are taught on alternate 
Sabbaths by the minister, averaging 14 males and 20 females, 
from the age of thirteen to twenty. The parish schoolmaster was 
permitted to retire a few years ago, retaining the salary, which is 
the maximum, L,34, 4s. 4d. for life. An assistant and successor 
is now supported, in part, by private subscription, and receives the 
school-fees, the house, garden, the interest of a small mortification, 
and the emoluments of the session-clerk's office. These may 
amount to, subscriptions, L.17; interest, L.2, 12s.; session-clerk's 
salary, &amp;c. L.6; school-fees, about L.30; total, L.55, 12s. The 
averao-e emoluments derivable from the female school are, sub- 



ABEUCORN. 



33 



scription, L.14; school-fees, about L.20; total, L.34. The pro- 
per legal accommodation is furnished to the parochial teacher ; 
and the teacher of the female school has a school-room, dwelling- 
house, and garden, secured to her. The expense of education 
varies from 8s. to L.l annually, according to the branches required. 
About 12 children of the poor are educated gratuitously by the 
kindness of the heritors. 

Literature. — A parochial library was established in 1833, and 
contains now 260 volumes of useful miscellaneous reading. The 
charge is 3s. annually, and about fifty families avail themselves of 
the advantage. A juvenile religious library of 180 volumes is at- 
tached to the Sabbath school : the books, furnished by a public 
collection some years since, are given out gratis. A friendly so- 
ciety existed for a number of years, but unfortunately, the capital 
began to diminish rapidly, from a deficiency of new contributors, 
and the funds were lately divided amongst the subscribers. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The opulent families have all 
along shown much attention to the wants of their superannuated 
dependents, thereby limiting the demands on the poor's fund. 
The number of paupers on the roll is, at an average, 1 1 persons 
on whom depend 7. Occasional relief is afforded to 6 familieSi 
The highest annual rate of relief to regular paupers is L.3, 12s. ; 
the lowest, L.2, 18s. No assessment has ever existed. The re- 
venue is derived from the following sources : average of collections, 
L.62, 10s. 6d.; interest on a mortification and mortcloth dues, 
L.17, 18s. 6d. ; total, L.80, 9s. Deducting session-clerk's, precen- 
tor's, Synod and Presbytery clerks fees, and sexton's salary, L. 13, 
33. Gd., there remains for relief of the poor, L.67, 6s. 6d. A further 
sum of L.l 9 is paid by the heritors, in voluntary subscription, for 
the board of a lunatFc. A strong feeling of honest independence 
prevails, leading the people to strain every effort rather than re- 
ceive habitual relief. Some striking instances of this spirit have 
come to the writer's knowledge. 

Inns. — Besides a small inn at Society, there are three alehouses, 
some of which might be beneficially dispensed with. 
Puel. — Coal is almost exclusively the fuel employed.

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALE, 

THE REV. WILLIAM M. HETHERINGTON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish is evidently Celtic in its ori- 
gin ; but etymologists are by no means agreed with regard to its 
true composition and meaning. The word Tor is unquestionably 
hill; but the latter part of the name is more doubtful. Some as- 
sert it to mean ten, and say that it refers to a range of hills in the 
vicinity having ten summits. The range, however, has not more 
than seven distinct summits ; and the Gaelic word Jichead means 
twenty, not ten, as they assume. The most probable derivation 
seems to be Torfeochan, or the hill of the Ravens. It may be re- 
garded as some corroboration of this meaning that there is an 
estate in the neighbourhood of the village named Craw hill ; and 
that the crest of the most extensive land proprietor in the parish 
is a raven chained to a rock, as if in allusion to the parochial name. 

Boundaries, Extent, Sc. — Torphichen is bounded on the east 
by Linlithgow ; on the south by Bathgate, and part of Shotts ; 
on the west by part of Shotts and New Monkland ; and on the 
north by part of Slamannan and Muiravonside. Its greatest length 
is about 10 miles from eavst to west, and its greatest breadth about 
2 miles- In one part the breadth is less than a mile. It contains 
about 10,429.77 English acres; and about 16.30 square miles. 

Topographical Aspect. — The eastern part of the parish is very 
agreeably diversified by a succession of woody elevations, sloping 
terraces, and cliffy ridges, as it ascends towards the higher range 
of hills by which it is divided from Bathgate and Linlithgow on 
the east. The ridge immediately above the village has a peculi- 
arly picturesque appearance when viewed from the east, consisting 
of a succession of rounded summits swelling along wave after wave, 
as if some enormous ocean-tide had been suddenly changed to 

solid earth throughout the continuous sweep of all its billowy heav- 

4 



TORPHICHEN.

incrs. The western side of this beautiful ridge slopes gradually 
down into softer undulations, in the midst of which are situated the 
village, the church, and the Preceptory of Torphichen. The dis- 
trict\round the village is both fertile, and presents a pleasing and 
remarkable diversity of picturesque aspects, as viewed from vari- 
ous points, through clusters of woody ridges, and green trees, and 
craggy cliffs of trap, till it sinks away into the hollow through 
which flows the small stream, the Loggie. From thence it again 
ascends into a sort of bleak upland, composed chiefly of stoney 
elevations with a clayey subsoil, interspersed by long stripes and 
flats of heathery bogs, and wet marshes, covered deep with peat 
moss. 

The highest hill in the parish is that central one of the Bath- 
gate and Torphichen range, called Cairn-naple, or Cairn- paple, 
which is just included within the angle of its eastern boundary, — 
its height is stated to be 1498 feet. Towards the north the bound- 
ary-line skirts the base of Cockleroi perhaps Cnchil-righ, the 
King's chair, which is considerably lower ; and includes Bowden 
hill, which terminates the range in that direction. From the sum- 
mit of any of these hills, especially Cachil-righ, may be obtained 
a prospect scarcely surpassed by any in Scotland for extent, beauty, 
and magnificence, — reaching from North Berwick Law to the dis- 
tant cloud-crowned Ben Lomond, and including the view of Edin- 
burgh with its castle, Salisbury Craigs, and Arthur's'Seat, the bays 
and windings of the Forth, " studded with islets and alive with 
sails," — the rich and varied scenery of the Fifeshire coast, with all 
its numerous villages and spires and towns, — the wavy outline and 
the deep indentations of the massy Ochils, the fertile carse-land of 
Falkirk, the gray towers of ancient Stirling, and the sky-piercing 
peaks of the majestic Grampians. 

Behind the mansion-house of Craw-hill, on the banks of the 
river Avon, which are deep, rocky, and wooded, there is a chasm 
commonly called Wallace's cave ; and close adjoining it there is 
a natural arch in the living rock of very considerable size, within 
the deep clefts of which there are some beautiful and rather rare 
varieties of lichens and mosses. 

The climate is unquestionably good, though raiher cold. The 
air is pure and bracing, particularly in the eastern division of the 
parish ; and even in the more upland and moorish districts west- 
ward, there are no such exhalations as to be noxious to the health 
of the inhabitants. 



36 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



Hydrography. — There are only two mineral springs deserving 
of notice as such. At the westward base of the Kipps-hill there 
IS one said to be impregnated with vitriol. On the estate of Wall- 
house, and about a mile west from the village, there is a chalybeate 
spring, which formerly enjoyed some reputation as a tonic, but has 
fallen into neglect, so that even its position is scarcely known. 
Several other springs exhibit traces of mineral impregnation, but 
of no very decided character. 

On the very boundary of the Cathlaw estate, nearly due east 
from the Preceptory, there is a very strong spring of deliciously 
tasted pure water, called St John's well ; to which it is said the 
Knights of St John used to go in days of yore for a morning 
draught. Whether its virtues were medicinal, or of a more hal- 
lowed character, tradition cannot exactly inform us ; but still its 
waters are thought to possess peculiar healing powers, if not still 
rarer qualities, which operate in various cases as a charm. Near 
it stood a stone, in some way connected with the well, and on the 
very limits of the parish. 

There is a beautiful little lake at Lochcote, about a mile to the 
north-east of the village, in the hollow formed by the surround- 
ing hills of Bowden, Cachil-righ, and Kipps. It covers about 22 
English acres. Formerly it discharged its surplus waters by a 
stream from its north- west end, which formed a singular pool, cal- 
led the eel-ark. From this pool it ran under ground for more than 
200 yards, when it again burst upwards like a strong spring, and 
continued its course into the Avon. This romantic little lake was 
drained by a late proprietor, who thereby lost a great natural 
beauty, and gained a few acres of deep, ill-reclaimed, and not half 
arable marsh. The present proprietor Joseph Hume, Esq. has, 
with great taste, determined to restore the lake, considering a beau- 
tiful sheet of water more truly valuable as an ornament to his ele- 
gant mansion on its margin, than could be the acquisition of as 
much muddy soil and rank vegetation. 

The little river Avon flows along the north boundary of Tor- 
phichen, dividing it from the parish of Muiravonside. The Log- 
gie is a much smaller stream than the Avon, into which it falls. It 
forms the boundary between Torphichen and Bathgate for seve- 
ral miles ; but though its channel is considerably deep, its course 
is not adorned with scenery of particular interest. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The most peculiar geological fea- 
tures of the parish are to be found in the east end of it, skirting 



TORPHICHEN. 



37 



the Bathgate range of hills. That range is chiefly composed of 
trap-rock as its central mass, with successive strata of limestone, 
carboniferous shale, coal, sandstone, and thick beds of clay, gra- 
vel, and other alluvial deposits. The ridge seems to have been 
produced by igneous agency, upheaving the superincumbent stra- 
ta, bursting through them in the centre, in some places overly- 
ing them, in others rending them asunder and thrusting them aside 
till it displayed the disturbing material in various aspects, occa- 
sionally in that of columnar trap. The dip of the superincum- 
bent strata is accordingly very steep, in some places almost per- 
pendicular, in others a foot in five or six, and gradually diminish- 
ing till it reach the level of the adjoining country. The pic- 
turesquely undulating range of the Torphichen hills, already de- 
scribed, is also composed of trap ; and where it has been decom- 
posed around their sides and bases, or in hollows, it has formed a 
peculiarly rich and fertile soil, though of no great depth. On the 
Hilderston hills, on the west side of the Bathgate ridge, there is 
a coal mine, the mouth of which must be at least 800 feet above 
the level of the sea. This height has been manifestly caused by 
the upheaving of the ridge where the trap forced its way from be- 
neath, raising in its passage the superincumbent strata, as the mine 
is worked in from the top where the coal crops out. Nearly oppo- 
site, on the eastern shoulder of the same hill, there is a limestone 
quarry, in which many shells are found, chiefly ammonites, some 
of which are unusually large. Some fossil fishes are also said 
to have been found. A coal mine has been recently opened in 
the hollow between the Kipp hills, the Torphichen wavy range, and 
the continuation of the Bathgate range, running through Cath- 
law estate. The coal bed seems to lie in a kind of basin formed 
by these ridges, and can scarcely be expected to be very produc- 
tive or permanent from the nature of the situation. 

In Bowden hill is another limestone quarry, or rather mine, en- 
tered by a horizontal shaft in the side of the hill, and chambered 
out regularly, leaving columns to support the roof of what is be- 
cominop an immense cave. 

Along the course of the Loggie burn there runs a chain of co- 
nical sand-hills, of such a regular figure, as to have led to the er- 
roneous popular belief that they are artificial, and have been rais- 
ed at some distant period as monumental mounds. They are, 
however, obviously natural, being composed entirely of fine sea- 
sand, washed together into regular heaps and banks by the action

o'l water, at some period indefinitely remote, when the whole cir- 
cumjacent country had not yet emerged from the depths of the 
ocean. 

In the limestone quarry first mentioned, there was formerly 
found a considerable quantity of silver ore, whence the place is 
still called the silver mine ; but the ore was not found to be either 
sufficient in quantity or rich enough in quality, to repay the ex- 
pense of working it ; consequently that has been abandoned. 

There was also a coal mine on the property of Bridgecastle, 
about two miles and a-half west from Torphichen village, which 
was wrought several years. Its quality is said not to have been 
very good, and it also has been neglected for some time, though 
it is reported that the present proprietor, Captain Hope, R. N., in- 
tends to open it again. 

Zoology and Botany. — There is nothing known of the zoology 
of this parish meriting peculiar notice. In botany it is worthy of 
more attention ; less, however, on account of its possession of very 
rare plants, than because nearly all the varieties of plants indige- 
nous to the lowlands of Scotland, especially to trap districts, 
may be found in it in a state of great perfection, and even some 
almost peculiar to the Highlands. On Cathlaw estate the ly- 
copodium is found in great profusion ; as also the wild gentian, 
and some beautiful varieties of the polygala, or milkwort. There 
are also some fine species of the orchis ; and the trap hills of the 
Torphichen ridge abound with the common wild heart's ease in 
greater profusion than can be seen almost any where else. There 
are also some rather rare kinds of mosses and lichens found on the 
moorish districts, and among the rocky banks of the Avon. Some 
exotic plants have been occasionally found on the Kipps hills, as 
if naturalized, which are thought to have been brought thither by 
Sir Robert Sibbald in former days. 

The soil seems to be adapted to the growth of timber of al- 
most any kind, as appears from the well-wooded aspect of the dis 
trict in the eastern division of the parish. There are some fine 
old trees of considerable magnitude around the mansions of Cath- 
law, Lochcote, Wallhouse, and Bridgecastle ; and on Cathlaw 
hill and Hilderston hill there are some young plantations in a 
very thriving condition, — indicating the possibilities of the district, 
were a system of planting adopted generally by the proprietors. 

II. — Cjvil History. 

Almost the only account of the parish of Torphichen that has 



TORPHICHEN. 



39 



ever been written or printed is to be found in Sir Robert Sibbald's 
History of the Shire of Linhthgow. There is also a somewhat 
confused account of it in a brief history of Linhthgowshire by the 
late John Penney, Esq. Information respecting its history and 
antiquities may also be gleaned from papers connected with the 
family records of the different proprietors, particularly the Noble 
family of Torphichen. As these contain materials of some in- 
terest, it has been thought proper to bring them together so as to 
form a somewhat detailed and connected account. 

The civil history of Torphichen is so intimately connected with 
that of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem,' who had their Precep- 
torate, or chief site and regality there, that a short account of that mi- 
litary and monastic order of knighthood will be that of Torphichen 
itself. This celebrated order had its origin in the interval between 
the first and second crusades, when, for the accommodation of the 
pilgrims who visited the Holy Sepulchre, especially of the sick 
among them, an hospital was built near the church, and dedicated 
to St John the Almoner. As they increased in numbers and in- 
fluence the brothers of the hospital first withdrew from the juris- 
diction of the Abbot of the Latin Church, and finally became in- 
dependent of the Patriarch of Jerusalem. This happened in the 
year 1104, which may be taken as the date of the commencement 
of the Order of St John of Jerusalem or Knights Hospitallers, as 
they are sometimes termed, in contradistinction to the Order of 
Templars. When Jerusalem fell into the hands of the Saracens 
the survivors of the Order were compelled to retire into Italy, 
where they obtained from Pope Innocent IV. a dispensation, ab- 
solving them from their original obligation, and permitting them 
to elect a Grand Master and other subordinate officers for their 
own government. The same distinguished Order afterwards held 
possession of the Island of Rhodes, maintaining it against the 
Turks in the most brave and determined manner, during which 
they were generally called the Knights of Rhodes. When 
Rhodes finally was reduced by the Turks in 1522, the knights ob- 
tained possession of Malta in 1530, which they defended against 
their old antagonists the Turks, and in the defence displayed pro- 
digies of valour and military skill. 

The renown obtained by the Knights of St John gave rise to 
several other orders of knighthood, of which the Templars were 
the chief. The templars, however, excited the indignation of 
Philip IV. of France by their licentiousness, or his cupidity by

their wealth ; and were suppressed in the year 1312. Previous 
to their downfall they had acquired extensive possessions in every 
kingdom in Europe, which were either seized upon by the sove- 
reign, or transferred to the kindred order of St John. In this 
manner, the lands of both orders came to belong to the Johannites; 
though in many instances they retained the name of Temple lands, 
from the Templars, as being the best known, though not the most 
ancient and honourable order. 

As the Knights of St John had adherents, so they soon acquired 
possessions in every country in Europe. They were first esta- 
blished in Scotland by David I. or Malcolm IV. in the year 115.3. 
In the charter granted by that monarch there occur the following 
words : " Qui in liberam et puram Eleemosynam donavit Fratribus 
Hospitalis Hierosolymitani unum plenarium toftum in qualibet 
Burgo totius terrse suae." This small foundation was greatly am- 
plified by additional grants from the succeeding kings, especially 
by Alexander II. and III., Robert IL, and the Jameses II., III., 
and IV. These sovereigns not only confirmed the donations of 
their predecessors, but by new grants of lands, and by grants of 
privileges, powers, rights of patronage, and civil immunities, they 
bestowed at length a competent revenue and territory, and erected 
the dignities of the order into what was termed the Lordship of 
St John and Preceptorie of Torphichen. The suppression of the 
Templars tended greatly to augment the power of the Knights of 
St John. By a canon of the Council of Vienna, and a bull of 
Pope Clement VII., the whole lands and possessions of the 
Knights Templars in Scotland were conferred upon the Knights 
of St John of Jerusalem. The former had had their chief seat at 
Temple in Mid- Lothian, the latter at Torphichen, which con- 
tinued to remain their chief seat or Preceptory. Not only did 
their new acquisitions, however, retain the designation of Temple 
lands, but even their own original property came to be called by 
the same name, which has caused considerable confusion in the 
attempts that have been made to discriminate between the lands 
formerly held by the Templars and those held by the Knights of 
St John. 

Several of the preceptors, priors, or grand-masters of Tor- 
phichen were men of great talent, and distinguished themselves 
in the public affairs of the kingdom. Mention is made of one

In the year 1298, while the heroic Sir William Wallace was 
Recrent of Scotland, he held his head-quarters at the preceptory 
of Torphichen for some time previous to the battle of Falkirk, as 
appears from a charter granted by him as regent, conferrmg some 
lands at Dundee upon Alexander Scrimgeour, the royal standard- 
bearer, as a reward for his services, which charter is dated at lor- 
phichen, the 29th day of March 1298  It would seem that the 
then preceptor had previously sworn fealty to Edward I. ot ll.ng- 
land, as did so many Scottish nobles, but redeemed his character 
for patriotism, and afterwards fell at the fatal battle of Falkirk, 
foucrht on the 22d of July 1298. His name is given by Rymer 
as Alexander de Wells. 

The next Preceptor of whom particular mention is made was 
Sir William KnoUes, who held the preceptorate about half a cen- 
tury, and was commonly designated Lord St John. He held the 
offices of Councillor and Treasurer in the reign of James IV., 
and was killed fighting by the side of that brave but rash monarch 
at Flodden Field in 1513. He was succeeded by Sir George 
Dundas, who had been the fellow-student of Hector Boetius at 
Paris, and was distinguished for his learning. Sir Walter Lind- 
say was the next preceptor, who also rose to distinction in the 
kingdom, and was appointed to the office of Justice- General of 
Scotland in the reign of James. V. In Sir David Lindsay's 
" Testament of Squyer Meldrum," he is mentioned in the follow- 
ing laudatory terms : 

 «' Chakta Domini Gulielmi Wallace,

" The wise Sir Walter Lindsay they him call, 
Lord of St John and Knight of Torphichen, 
By SL'i and land a valiant capitane." 

Sir Walter Lindsay died in 1538, and was succeeded by Sir 
James Sandilands, brother to Sandilands of Calder. During his 
preceptorate, the Reformation began to stir men's minds, and to 
break up every thing estabUshed on no better foundation than su- 
perstition. Sir James Sandilands joined the Reformers, and this, 
together with the spirit of the times, caused the dissolution of the 
order of Knights of St John in Scotland. He resigned into the 
hands of Queen Mary the whole lands and baronies possessed by 
the preceptors of St John, receiving them again in feu farm, to 
him, his heirs, and assignees, for ever, upon condition of paying 
to her Majesty 10,000 crowns of the sun, and 500 merks of an- 
nual feu-duty. The charter conveying to him the lands, &amp;c. is 
dated at Edinburgh the 24th day of March 1563. The most 
important part of it is as follows :— « Dedisse, concessisse, et hac 
presenti carta nostra confirmasse, hereditarie dicto Jacobo Domino 
de Sancta Johanne heredibus suis et assignatis totas et integras 
terras et Baronias de Torphichen, Listoun, Balinlrodo, Tanker- 
toun, Denny, Maryculter, Stennop, Galtua, cum teneutibus et 
tenendiis et libere tenend : servitiis, advocationibus et donationibus 
Ecclesiarum beneficiarum, et Capellanarum omnium et singularium 
dictarum terrarum et Baronarum cum molendinis, multuris, silvis, 
piscariis, castris, terribus, fortaliciis," &amp;c. It thus appears, that, 
at the period of the Reformation, the Knights of John were in 
possession of not less than eight baronies ; and the records of the 
order contain a document in the hand-writing of Sir Walter Lind- 
say, which gives the same number and names. The last Precep- 
tor, and first Lord Torphichen, resigned all these into the hands 
of James VI., with the exception of Torphichen and Listen. The 
church patronage held by the first Lord Torphichen in right of 
the order were Torphichen, Inchinnan, Maryculter, Tullaich, and 
Aboyne. 

In the earlier periods of their history, the preceptors of Tor- 
phichen sat in councils and Parliament alternately among the 
higher clergy and the temporal barons. Sir William KnoUes 
was raised permanently to the dignity of a Lord of Parliament by 
James IV., with the style and title of " Lord of St John," or 
" Lord St John of Torphichen," which title descended regularly 



 10,000 crowns of the sun, equal to about L. 1 100 Sterling, — a large sum in those 
days. 



TORPHlCttEN. 43 

,0 his successors, Sir George Dundas, Sir Walter Lindsay, and 
Sir James Sandilnnds. When the charter of the new peerage 
was granted to the last preceptor, it rendered that rank and title 
hereditary which had previously been purely official, that is, vested 
in the office of Prior, Grand Master, or Preceptor of the Order 
of Knio-hts of St John of Jerusalem, whose chief residence or 
Preceptory was Torphichen. The office and the seat, therefore, 
gave the title, which was not vested in or inheritable by, any pe- 
culiar family ; and by the charter of 1563, the title was changed 
into that of Lord Torphichen, but still remained attached to the 
ancient Preceptory, as a local dignity, though the official dignity 
had been abolished. The abolition of the official dignity ren- 
dered the title hereditary in the preceptory itself, whosoever should 
be its possessor, and in the family of Sandilands so long as they 
should retain the possession. 

In 1599, James, second Lord Torphichen nephew of the first, 
conveyed the whole Temple and some of the Hospital-lands, with 
the exception of the baronies mentioned above, to Mr Robert 
Williamson, writer, and James Tenant of Linhouse. Williamson 
became sole proprietor in 1604, and afterwards sold them to Sir 
Thomas Hamilton, subsequently Earl of Melrose and Haddington. 
This nobleman acquired a charter from the Crown, erecting the  
lands so obtained into a barony, called the barony of Drem. The 
act of Parliament ratifying this charter is dated 1614. This ba- 
rony was disentailed by act of Parliament about the middle of last 
century, and having passed through the hands of two or three 
proprietors, appears to have at length become dormant, if not ex- 
tinct. 

In 1633, John, Lord Torphichen, upon the resumption by 
Charles I., of the superiorities of church lands, felt apprehensive 
that his rights 'as successor to a religious order might thereby be 
prejudiced ; and after petitioning Parliament, obtained an award 
of his Majesty, following a resolution of the Privy- Council, which 
was to have the force of an Act of Parliament ; that the resump- 
tion, while it included the temple-lands, &amp;c. should be held in no 
degree to encroach upon the superiorities of the barony of Tor- 
phichen, in Linlithgowshire, within " that mean portione thereof 
qu/iarin does subsist the title and dignity of Lords of Parliament 
and toquhilk the title of Lord of Parliament is annexit, perteining 
to him Lord Torphichen presentlie in propertie ;" but that the 
same " sail remain with him and his successors, accordimj to the 
tenor of Im auld richts and infeftments, to be holden of his majesty 



44 



LINI-ITHGOWSHIRE. 



in feu ferme for payment of the soume of ane hundrethe merks 
yeirlie." No other title being mentioned in the Act, except the 
previous charter in 1563, it hence continued the regulating one, 
to be in force as far as respected the remainder of the property 
which had been still retained by the family. This mean portioned 
wherein the title " subsists," is probably the central part of the ba- 
rony, including especially the preceptoryand its immediate demesne 
lands, which was, perhaps, the most ancient part of the patrimony 
of the knights. 

The earldom of Arundel in England is held, it appears, by 
a similar tenure, the title being vested in the castle itself; and 
this too was ratified in the reign of Charles I. 

The lands constituting the barony of Torphichen have been gra- 
dually sold, till little more remains in the possession of the Noble fa- 
mily than probably what constituted the original patrimony at first 
bestowed upon the founders of the Order in Scotland, nearlv 700 
years ago ; but the portion which remains is that in which the 
title is vested, lying around and adjacent to the preceptory. It 
would appear from a claim given in by John Gillon of Wallhouse, 
November 10th 1747, that the lands of Wallhouse, South and 
North Hilderstons, Torphichen mill, and other lands, were ori- 
ginally held under the lordship of St John, as he mentions that 
they formed part of the regality of Torphichen, and that he had 
acquired the superiority thereof, and right of regality by purchase 
from James, Lord Torphichen. Mr Gillon states he had procur- 
ed a crown charter of resignation under the great seal, on the 22d 
of June 1733, upon which infeftment followed on the 29th of the 
same month. He claimed L.300 as the value, but his claim was 
dismissed. 

The lands of Lochcote, which are said to have belonged to the 
same lordship of St John, enjoy the peculiar privilege of paying 
no teind, apparently on the assumption of having been church- 
lands. 

Eminent Characters Sfc. — Some of the most eminent characters 
connected with the parish by birth or residence have been already 
mentioned in the enumeration of the most distinguished precep- 
tors of Torphichen. Of these, the last preceptor, Sir James San- 
dilands, occupies the most prominent position, in consequence of 
the part which he took in the Reformation. This distinguished 
man, having left no family, was succeeded in his honours by the 
son of his elder brother, Sandilands of Calder; and as Calder 



TOllPHICHEN.

House had been long the patrinfionial residence of the family, it 
continued to be that of the Lords Torphichen, in consequence 
of which, the preceptory and its appurtenances were comparatively 
neglected, and allowed to fall into decay. Some portions of the 
original barony, however, came into the possession of cadets of the 
family, of which perhaps the most noted was Sandilands of Hd- 

derston. p e 

During the stormy period of the Covenanters, the famdy ot ' 
Sandilands adhered to the principles of their ancestors ; and both 
struggled in defence of, and suffered with, the persecuted Church 
of Scotland. William Sandilands, brother of the fourth Lord 
Torphichen, and tutor to his nephew, the fifth Lord, was laird of 
Hilderston. He married the second daughter of Cunningham of 
Cunninghamhead, in Ayrshire, a gentleman distinguished, even in 
that period, for his sincere piety. Hilderston and his lady were 
both remarkable for their attachment to the Presbyterian princi- 
ples of the Scottish Church ; and their mansion-house at Hilder- 
ston was often the hospitable resort of the persecuted Covenan- 
ters. There Mr Blackadder and others often held what were 
termed conventicles, and heavy fines were on that account imposed 
upon the family, Walter Sandilands, his son, married the heiress 
of Westport, near Linlithgow, and assumed the name and arms of 
Hamilton of Westport. He retained the same attachment to 
Protestant and Presbyterian principles which had characterized 
the family, from the days of their illustrious ancestor, Sir James 
Sandilands, the last preceptor, and the personal friend of John 
Knox. See Wodrow, Vol. iii. p. 441. This branch of the San- 
dilands family is now represented by Colonel John Ferrier Ha- 
milton of Westport and Cathlaw. 

It may be mentioned, that in the same troublous times, the rega- 
lity of Torphichen is among those stated to have fallen into the 
hands of his Majesty, in consequence of their possessors refusing 
to take the test ; and Lord Livingstone is recommended as the 
person to whom it should be given, probably on account of his 
want of principle and subserviency to that corrupt and tyrannous 
court, which had honoured Lord Torphichen by its dislike and 
its feeble enmity. The then minister of Torphichen was also 
ejected from his charge for refusing to take the same test ; as ap- 
pears by a report of the Committee for public affairs, offering it 
as their opinion that missives should be sent to the patrons of pa- 
rishes vacant by the ministers' refusal of the test, of which mis-

sives one is directed to Lord Torphiclien for the parish. See 
Wodrovv, Vol. iii. pp. 360—1. 

Sir Robert Sibbald, an eminent Scottish naturalist and antiqua- 
rian, was connected with this parish by becoming proprietor of 
the estate of Kipps, in right of his mother, heiress of the family 
of Boyd, its former proprietors. He resided for some time at Kipps ; 
and there are still to be found some proofs of his taste in some 
kinds of exotic plants introduced by him, and now growing wild 
on the lands. 

The Rev. John Bonnar is well known as one of the marrow- 
men ; and subsequently as one of the ministers who assisted at the 
remarkable revival of religion which took place at Cambuslang 
in 1742, at which time he was still minister of Torphichen. It 
is stated, that he was then very old, and so infirm that his journey 
to Cambuslang occupied him three days, though the distance 
is not more than eighteen miles. Although none are now living 
who enjoyed his ministrations, his memory is still held in the 
highest respect and veneration. It appears, also, that Mr Gillon, 
of Wallhouse, ancestor of the present W. D. Gillon. Esq. was at 
that time an elder in Torphichen, and officiated as such at Cam- 
buslang. 

Mr Henry Bell, celebrated as being the person who first suc- 
cessfully applied the steam-engine as a propelling power, for the 
purpose of river and canal navigation in Britain, was a native of 
Torphichen. In a little spot of level alluvial ground, formed by the 
Avon, in a bend of that river, near Torphichen bridge, and shel- 
tered by steep banks, may still be seen the ruined side walls, and 
the solitary gable of the cottage in which he was born. A few 
years before his death he paid a visit to the secluded scene of his 
infancy, with a view, it is said, of purchasing the spot, and erect- 
ing another cottage, and in that calm retreat terminating a career, 
the honours and rewards of which had been, as too often happens, 
but ill proportioned to its usefulness. He did not, however, pro- 
secute his intention, and the solitary ruin remains his melancholy 
memorial. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Right Honour- 
able Lord Torphichen ; W. D, Gillon, Esq. of Wallhouse ; 
Colonel Ferrier Hamilton of Cathlaw ; David Pringle, Esq. of 
Kipps ; Joseph Hume, Esq. of Lochcote ; Captain David Hope 
of Bridgecastle ; William Wardrop, Esq. of Bridgehouse ; Peter 
Sawers, Esq. ; R. C. Buchanan, Esq. ; and Sir Thomas Living- 



TORPPIICHEN. 47 



Stone, Bart, of Bedlormie. There are in all 37 proprietors, of 
whom 25 possess lands of the yearly value of L.50 and upwards. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest entry in the parochial regis- 
ters bears the date of 1650. Since that time they have been pret- 
ty regularly kept, though they are somewhat meagre in their de- 
tails." They amount, at present, to five volumes of no great size. 
There are two volumes of acts of Assembly from 1690 to 1733; 
but from that time till recently these acts have not been regular- 
ly obtained. 

Jntiquities.— The chief object of interest, in an antiquarian point 
of view, is the Preceptory, or chief seat of the Knights of St John 
of Jerusalem. It would appear, from the date of the original char- 
ter, 1153, that the preceptory was founded in that year, as it was 
the first property held by the Knights in Scotland, and continued 
to be their chief seat. Its site was well chosen for both strength 
and beauty ; at the base of the picturesque range of the Torphi- 
chen hills, on the edge of a piece of marshy ground which fur- 
nished water to fill a moat twenty feet wide, by which the build- 
ing itself, and about a Scotch acre of land, were surrounded, of 
which moat the course may still be distinctly traced. The upper 
part of the building commanded an extensive prospect towards the 
Frith of Forth in the direction of Falkirk and Stirling ; as also, 
the upper range of the Ochils, and the summits of the Gram- 
pians. It appears to have been built, as most religious structures 
were, in the form of a cross, of which nothing but the transept, or 
cross-beam, necessarily the smaller division of that figure, with a 
tower at one angle containing a spiral staircase, are now remain- 
ing. The walls of the nave, or main part of the fabric have long 
disappeared entirely, but its foundation may still be traced so as to 
give some idea of its original dimensions. The transept, or, as it 
is commonly called, the choir, still remains almost entire. It is 
about 72 feet long by 26 broad ; inside 66 by 20, the walls being 
above 3 feet thick ; the nave was about 112 feet long. The interior 
is composed of three lofty arched domes, supported by massive yet 
handsome Gothic columns, 20 feet high before the spring of the 
arch ; of these the central dome and its columnar shafts are dis- 
tinguished by their symmetry and simple grandeur, and the key of 
the vault itself, in the central dome, being formed of an open ho- 
rizontal arch, or rather complete circle, at right angles with the 
arches of the vault, and sustained merely by their mutual and equal 
pressure 30 feet above the level of the floor, the effect is peculiar- 



43 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



ly striking and elegant. In each end of the transept is a beautiful 
Gothic window, formed by arched divisions and tracery of stone- 
work, part of which has yielded to the dilapidations of time. Owing 
to the marshy nature of the ground, the whole structure seems to 
have been built on strong piles of oak, driven deeply into the yield- 
ing soil, and thus forming a perfectly secure foundation. Portions 
of these piles have been occasionally dug up in excavating graves, 
and found to be not only firm and entire, but even of a hardness 
and compact consistency little short of black marble, such has been 
the effect of the antiseptic qualities of the morass, together with 
the pressure which they have so long sustained. A portion of the 
ground, formerly inclosed within the moat, still bears the name of 
' the Knights' Garden," although it has long been cultivated by 
the plough alone, and yielded no other produce than that common 
to the adjacent fields. 

Notwithstanding the entire disappearance of the 7iave, the larger 
portion of the original building, there are no records, nor even 
traditions of its having been demolished by any sudden burst of 
popular violence. From any such fate it may have been preserved 
by its falling entire into the hands of Sir James Sandilands, who 
could have no interest in its destruction, and whose influence with 
the Reformers would be sufficient for its preservation. But as Cal- 
der House very soon became the chief residence of the Lords 
Torphichen, it was neglected, and, falling into decay, was used as 
a quarry, whence stones might be procuredfor any necessary pur- 
pose. That such was the case is evident from the fact, that many 
houses in the village are built entirely of hewn stones, such in 
size, form, and apparent age as those of the portion which still re- 
mains standing, while the greater part of the stone walls by which 
the adioining fields are subdivided are composed of exactly similar 
materials. In this manner have the walls of the nave been carried 
piece-meal at length entirely away. There was also, according to 
tradition, another house of some size and unknown antiquity, built 
•close to one angle of the transept, a portion of which was standmg 
about eighty years ago, as the writer of this was informed by an 
old woman who died in 1837 at the age of eighty-nine. It was 
said to have been a separate tenement, built for the accommoda- 
tion of the knights when their numbers had increased beyond what 
the preceptory could conveniently contain. It communicated with 
the transept by a private door, which is still visible, though strong- 
ly built up. While the lovers of antiquity must deplore the dila- 

3 



TORPHICHEN. 



49 



pidations by which this ancient and very remarkable building has 
suffered so severely, it must be gratifying to know, as it is to re- 
cord, that it will be preserved henceforth from any such violence 
and desecration. Its present Noble proprietor, Lord Torphichen, 
has with great good taste and judgment recently protected it from 
the wasting ravages of time and the weather by roofing it com- 
pletely anew, and closing the rents and chinks which here and 
there had deeply scarred its hoary and venerable walls ,• so that re- 
mote ages may continue to contemplate the sole remaining monu- 
ment of what was once a mistaken, yet a very gallant Order of 
vowed and consecrated warriors, many of whose exploits shed lustre 
on the darkness of the middle-ages, like the path of a meteor 
through the gloom of a lowering sky. 

In the interior of the transept or choir, at its south end, beneath 
one of the windows, is a curious arch, in the form of a canopy, 
about six feet in span, within which it is said the bodies of the 
knights were laid before interment, and during the performance 
of the funeral rites ; and close beside it is a font for holy waten 
There is an antiquely carved stone, built into a comparatively mo- 
dern part of the inner wall on the west side, on which the follow- 
ing inscription may with difficulty, and perhaps also with some un- 
certainty, be read : " Gualterus Lindesay, Justiciarius Generalis 
de Scotland, et Principalis Preceptor Torphicensis, 1538." The 
inscription is in what is termed the black letter characters, and is 
embarrassed by several abbreviations ; but the above seems to be 
its true reading, as far as can be made out. 

In the churchyard stands a short square stone pillar, with the 
outline of a St John's or Maltese cross rudely carved on it. From 
this as from a centre was measured in ancient times the sanctuary 
of Torphichen, which gave, at least, temporary protection to any 
person accused of crimes less than capital. Its Hmits were mark- 
ed by four stones, each bearing the St John's Cross, erected as 
near as might be on the cardinal points, east, west, north and 
south, each a Scotch mile from the central stone in the church- 
yard adjoining the preceptory. They all still occupy their origi- 
nal positions. 

In a field adjoining the old peel-Yxke mansion of Kipps, there 
are the remains of a Druid circle. The central stone, of a large 
size, probably the stone of sacrifice, still occupies its original po- 
sition, but has been split asunder, which tradition says was done 
by lightning. Some of the stones that formed the circle have 

LINLITHGOW, D 



56 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



been broken and removed, in order to give place to the plough ; 
yet the outline of the circle may still be traced, which has been 
of considerable extent. There is an upright stone at no great 
distance, connected, probably, with this ancient place of supersti- 
tious worship, but of which the express use is not now known. 

On the top of Bowden Hill are the traces of a camp, with a 
deep trench surrounding it. Some antiquarians term it a Roman 
camp ; but its circular, or rather oval shape, scarcely permits it 
to be regarded as Roman. Some term it Danish, which is at 
least equally improbable, as this district was never peculiarly sub- 
ject to the incursions of those invaders. Tradition gives no in- 
formation respecting it, and history is equally silent. On the 
Lochcote Hills, in the immediate vicinity, there is a large cairn, 
and not far from it have been found several stone-coffins, which, 
being opened, were found to contain human bones. A very dim 
and uncertain tradition speaks of some bloody battles having been 
fought in this neighbourhood, but states nothing as to the date, 
or the parties between whom the contest was waged. 

On the rising grounds above the Loggie Burn, there were se- 
veral stone coffins found a few years ago, of a very simple con- 
struction, being merely thin stones set on edge, to mark the 
length and breadth of the grave, with one long flat stone-cover 
laid upon them ; the bottom being merely the natural sand of 
which that ridge is composed. Nothing is known respecting the 
time or cause of these sepultures, beyond the usual vague tradition 
of battles in times immemorial. 

Bridge Castle still remains in nearly its original condition, 
though shorn of its original splendour. It was formerly the seat 
of the Earls of Linlithgow, and still shows remains of its former 
importance in a few trees of great age and considerable magnitude, 
especially in height, by which it is partially surrounded. 

About two miles to the south-west, may, by diligent search, be 
discovered the ruins of the foundation of Ogilface Castle, the seat 
of the ancient family of De Bosco, Barons of Ogilface. It fell at 
length into the hands of the Earls of Linlithgow, and upon the 
fall of that family, ceased to exist as a barony, and was sold in 
portions to different proprietors, the chief of whom is now R. C. 
Buchanan, Esq. It must have been a place of some strength, 
though of no great size, as appears from the outline of the ruins of 
the foundation, as far as that can be still traced. 

Bedlormie has also been a place of considerable antiquity and 



TORPHICHEN. 



51 



some strength. Its general structure resembles that of the Border 
peels, consisting of a single square tower, the under storey of 
which is constructed with a vault or stone arch, nearly fire-proof, 
-for greater security against sudden and desperate assaults. Such 
is afso the structure of Kipps, on a smaller scale. 

Moder7i Buildings.— these there are none of any peculiar 
importance, except perhaps Wallhouse, the seat of W. D. Gil- 
ion, Esq., and that at present being built by Mr Hume at 
Lochcote, which, when finished, will be an ornament to the dis- 
trict. There are of mills one for oats alone, one for oats and 
barley, two lint-mills, and two woollen-mills, all generally well 
employed. 

III. — Population. 
The census of 1841 may be taken, as giving an accurate view of 
the parish at present : 

Population residing in villages,— Torphichen, 430 ; Blackridge, 94, . 324 
the country, about . • • 893 

1417 

The average of births, deaths, and marriages cannot be exactly 
ascertained, owing to the migrations to, and connections with

IV. — Industry, 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land, about L. 1 
per acre ; average rent of grazing, L. 3 per ox or cow per annum. 

Wages. — Rates of labour average Is. 8d. per day summer; Is, 
3d. winter for men, and for women about lOd. summer and winter. 

Live-Stock. — The breeds of sheep and cattle are of the common 
kind. A few of the Ayrshire cattle have been introduced, and 
some improvement in that respect is taking place. The chief im- 
provement in agriculture of which the district is susceptible, and 
which indeed it requires, is draining, much of the land being very 
wet. Some progress is making in this branch also ; but the want of 
resident landholders, and of disposable capital, must tend greatly to 
impede agricultural improvement. The general duration of leases 



52 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



is fourteen or nineteen years. The farms are not large ; and the 
style of farm-building corresponds ; some of them, however, are of 
a rather superior order. 

Quarries. — There are two limestone, one sandstone, and two 
granite quarries ; and there was once a quarry or mine of iron- 
stone on the bank of the Avon, near Torphichen bridge, but it 
has not been wrought for some years. The two limestone quarries 
of Cathlaw and Bowden have already been noticed, as also the 
coal mine on Hilderston, on Kipps, and on Bridge- Castle estate. 
It is said also that coal may be obtained on the Bridgehouse pro- 
perty. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish has not been ascertained, and cannot be stated. 

Manufactures. — The only branches of manufacture in the parish, 
if such they can be termed, are two flax mills, and one mill for 
the manufacture of wool, part of which is wrought into shawls. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish; the 
nearest is that of Bathgate, distant from Torphichen village about 
two miles and a-half. Linhthgow is little more than four miles 
and three-quarters distant. There are two villages in the parish, 
Torphichen and Blackridge. 

Means of Communication.— The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parish are, the turnpike-road from Linlithgow to 
Bathgate, about two miles and a-half of which is within Torphi- 
chen ; that from Linlithgow to Glasgow by Armadale, about one- 
and a-half of which is within Torphichen ; and about three miles 
of the middle road from Edinburgh to Glasgow, passing through 
the west end of the parish. The parish roads are kept in general 
in a very good condition ; and are upheld by an assessment upon 
the land at the rate of L. 2 each ploughgate, which is estimated 
at seventy acres. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated close beside 
the village of Torphichen, its eastern gable resting on the ancient 
preceptory. It is within about a mile of the east end of the pa- 
rish, consequently is by no means convenient for a very large ex- 
tent towards the west. As, however, the eastern district is the 
most populous, the church is tolerably convenient for nearly two- 
thirds of the population. It was built in 1756. It affords accom- 
modation for about 450. Being allocated to the different proprie- 
tors of land and their tenants, its sittings are free to such persons, 



TORPHICHEN. 



53 



but cannot be let to any others, except by private bargain between 
the parties themselves. There are about fifty-eight sittings not 
allocated, in what are called the table-seats, where, consequently, 
the poor may sit free. The manse was built above 100 years ago, 
and enlarged about thirty years ago, since which time it has 
obtained no repairs. The glebe is above eleven acres, only six of 
which are arable. It lets in grass for about L. 13. The stipend 
is L. 150, of which L. 25, 7s. is granted by the Exchequer. 

There has been a new church built by subscription at Black- 
ridge. It was opened for public worship on the first Sabbath of 
June 1838. A minister has been recently chosen for it, who is to 
be supported by the seat-rents and collections, by which it is hoped 
that about L. 60 will be obtained. It cannot yet be stated what 
number of people may attend the church at Blackridge, as it is not 
yet in full operation, consequently the respective numbers of 
Churchmen and Dissenters in that district cannot be stated. The 
attendance at the parish church is almost equal to the amount of 
accommodation afforded by the church, and is very regular. The 
average amount of communicants is 350. Average church collec- 
tions for charitable purposes, L. 25 ; for religious purposes, L. 12. 

Education. — There are three schools in the parish, of which two 
are parochial, and one unendowed. The branches of instruction 
generally taught in each are, reading, writing, arithmetic, mensu- 
ration, book-keeping, and rarely Latin. The salary of the paro- 
chial schoolmaster at Torphichen is the maximum ; at Blackridge 
L. 29 of a mortification and 100 merks. 

Libraries. — There are two parochial libraries in the parish, one 
at Torphichen, the other at Blackridge, both of which are pretty 
well supplied with books, well selected, and carefully perused. 

Friendly Societies. — There is one Friendly Society. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 18 ; the sum allotted to each varies 
considerably, but the average, including house-rents, is about 
L. 4, 14s. 6d. per annum, or about Is. 9d. weekly. The annual 
amount of church-door collections is about L. 25 ; from sums mor- 
tified, or otherwise disposed at interest, there is obtained about 
L. 25 ; and the heritors have assessed themselves voluntarily to 
the amount of about L. 35 per annum, making the sum annually 
expended for the maintenance of the poor about L. 85. It is to 
be regretted, that the lofty and generous reluctance to receive pa 
rochial aid, formerly characteristic of the poor, is declining, and

also, that, instead of being received as a boon, it is beginning to 
be demanded as a right, — than which nothing can be more de- 
structive to genuine charity. This is to be ascribed chiefly to the 
non-residence of the proprietors, which diminishes the church- 
door collections, dries up the springs of private charity, drains 
away the local wealth, and, abating the demand for labour, keeps 
wages low, and prevents the labouring classes from rising above 
the pressure of necessity, and the near approach of poverty.

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALB. 

THE REV. DAVID FLEMING, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The modern name of the parish is Carriden. In Gil- 
das " De excidio Britanniae," a. d. 560, it is written Kair Eden. 
Foredun, the Scottish historian, who lived about the year 1308, 
calls the village that was in existence in his days Karedin ; and 
in Richard of Cirencester's History of Roman Britain, written 
about 1338, the orthography is Ccerridden. The word is under- 
stood to be of Celtic or ancient British derivation, and to denote 
the relative position of the then existing village as a military sta- 
tion, or the specific character of its locality. Chalmers, in his 
Caledonia, represents it as being the same with Caer Adin or 
Eden which, in the British language of Roman times, signifiesr 
on the wing, or projection like a wing. 

Extent, — According to Forrest's survey of the county, fur- 
nished in 1817, the length of the parish from east to west is 3 sta- 
tute miles, and nearly 2 furlongs ; and the breadth from north to 
south wants half a furlong of 2 miles ; the number of square miles 
which it contains being 424. It is bounded on the east, by the 
parish of Abercorn ; on the west, by the parish of Borrowstounness ; 
on the north, by the Forth ; and on the south, by the parish of 
Linlithgow ; presenting the appearance of an irregular four-sided 
figure, the longest side stretching along the shores of the Forth. 



CARRIDEN. 



55 



Topographical Appearances.— The surface is very unequal, ris- 
ino- from the shore by a quick ascent, with a varied undulating 
form for about a mile, and then in general declining to the south. 
The most elevated ground lies towards the south-western part 
of the parish, near its junction with Linlithgow and Bo'ness, form- 
ing part of the Irongath  hills, or what is vulgarly named Glowr 
owre-em, and subsiding in an eastern direction by a gradual de- 
clivity. The highest point is 519 feet above the level of the sea, 
or high water of spring tides. There are no natural cavities ; but 
the ground has been excavated to a considerable extent in the 
north-west of the parish for coals and ironstone, in consequence 
of which, by the settling of the superincumbent strata in the old 
wastes, the surface was at one place broken into a number of small 
concave cisterns, which in the course of agricultural improvement 
have been filled upi and levelled ; and within the last twenty or 
thirty years, several instances have occurred in different places of 
the ground suddenly giving way and leaving large holes in the open 
field. The coast along the Forth, including its windings, extends 
to about three miles and a-half, having, through a considerable 
portion of the line, at high water mark, a margin of sand and cal- 
careous mixture several feet broad, thence stretching out to low 
water-mark, for several hundred yards, in a sleechy flat, composed 
of alluvial soil, with more or less of sand, and showing here and 
there a small bank formed of drifted oyster shells. Of late, ow- 
ing to the encroachments of the sea, the sandy margin has been 
undergoing a change, and becoming more of a rough stony descrip- 
tion. Occasionally there is an appearance of rock. At two 
places the land points into the Frith,— the one, called Bridgeness, 
near the western extremity, — the other forming the eastern extre- 
mity of the parish, named Blackness, a rather remarkable rocky 
promontory on which Blackness Castle is situated. Within a few 
yards of the shore the ground rises into a steep bank, ranging 
from the junction with Bo'ness parish, till it falls into a gentle 
acclivity near the church, to the east of which it again becomes 
more abrupt, and so continues along the whole coast eastward, 
till it loses itself in the point of Blackness. 

There is no good bathing-ground along the coast except at 
Blackness, though not a few families from different quarters inland 



• Otherwise called Airncoth. Sibbald says there is a tradition, that a battle was 
fought there between the Romans and the natives under Argadus, and thence the hill 
took the name of Argad.

annually resort to the shore of the Frith, for the benefit of bathing, 
and of the sea air. It is difficult, except at high tides, to reach 
a sufficient depth of water without wading to a considerable dis- 
tance, and the footing in the soft yielding sleech is by no means 
agreeable ; besides, the water is not a little muddy, especially when 
it is in any degree agitated : and, sometimes, considerable quan- 
tities of peat moss in large coherent masses or in a pulpy state 
are deposited on the shore, which has been floated down the river 
in the process of clearing the extensive moss fields at Blair- Drum- 
mond and other places in its vicinity. 

Meteorology. — The prevailing winds are from the south-west 
and west. Next to these in frequency is the east wind. The se- 
verest storms of snow are commonly from the east and north-east. 
The following table gives the number of days in each month dur- 
ing which the wind blew from any particular point of the compass 
in 1834 ;

Average for the year, thermometer, 48.50 ; barometer, 29.35. 
The hottest days were, July 4th and 7th, when the thermometer 
stood at 66°. On August 17th, the notation was 65°, and on 
July Sd, 3d, 22d, August 2d, 14th, 15th, 16th, September 19th, 
and 20th, it was 64°. The greatest degree of cold was in De- 
cember 19th, when the mercury indicated 29°; the next coldest 
days were December 1 8th and 20th, the degree being 30°, and

next to these were January 29th, November 23d, December 23d 
and 27th, the mercury standing at 32°. The lowest range of the 
barometer was on December 1st, when it showed 28.08, the wind 
beincr south-west, and the thermometer 44° ; the highest range 
was on December 23d, being 31.01, when the wind blew from 
the west, and the thermometer stood at 32°. The observations to 
which the foregoing tables and statements refer, it may be proper 
to add, were taken about a mile from the coast, at a slight elevation 
above the sea. 

The climate is in general dry, pleasant, and healthful, though 
variable. 

Hydrography.— T\\e Frith of Forth bounds the parish on the 
north, to the extent of about three miles in a straight line, the 
breadth at high water averaging about four miles, with an average 
depth of 9i fathoms in the channel. The water is never very 
transparent, and when in a state of commotion, it is turbid and mud- 
dy, of a lightish brown tinge, from the quantity of alluvial matter 
which it holds in solution. Its saltness is considerably diluted by 
the fresh current descending from above, but is nevertheless of 
quality sufficient to furnish a productive material for the manufac- 
ture of excellent salt. 

There are two small streams that traverse the parish, both of 
very insignificant dimensions, viz. Blackness burg, which rises in 
the Irongath hills, and after running eastward, joins the Forth 
on the east side of the castle of Blackness, where it separates the 
parish from Abercorn ; and Carriden burn, which passes into th&amp; 
Frith on the west side of Carriden House, to the situation of which 
it adds considerable attractions by the natural beauty of its banks, 
having formerly served as an outlet to a small loch on the estate 
of Grange, that has been drained and is now under cultivation. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The general characteristic of the mi- 
neral structure is of the coal formation. Passing along the coast 
from the westward, we tall in with trap or hard whinstone at Cow- 
denhill, Bridgeness, and CufFabouts. A little farther to the easty 
between the old manse and Burnfoot, there is a bed of light grey 
sandstone, which dips to the south-west with a declination of 1 1°. 
About a quarter of a mile onward, shale and indurated clay, with 
some bands of calcareous sandstone, appear at the surface within 
the sea mark, the dip continuing to the south-west. A dislocation 
in the strata appears to have taken place about a mile farther east- 
ward, the rock consisting of clay sandstone in thin layers, and lying 



58 



MNLITHGOWSHIRE. 



in an opposite direction to the north-east. About 400 yards west 
of the village of Blackness, a bed of calcareous ironstone crops out 
on the beach, dipping into the sea in the same direction, which, 
when carefully prepared, forms a hydraulic cement of a very supe- 
rior quality; for which purpose it was wrought some years ago, 
and is again in contemplation of being wrought. This stratum is 
covered with a strong shale, otherwise called Ilea, varying in thick- 
ness from 1 to 20 feet, interspersed with balls of clay ironstone, 
the under layer being of the kind called alum shale, and separated 
from the upper by a thin band of ironstone. The alum shale was 
formerly employed in the manufacture of soda, but the work has 
been lately discontinued and dismantled. About twenty yards 
farther into the sea, a freestone rock of a rough granular texture 
rises to the surface, and runs in the same direction as the cement 
stone, forming the covering towards the castle hill, which consists 
entirely of trap rock, declining by 12°, also to ihe north-east. 
In the interior, to the south-west of the parish, trap is chiefly to 
be met with. 

There are many seams of coal in the parish, some of which 
have been wrought at their crops or outbursts, centuries ago. The 
coal-field that is in the western division of the parish is supposed 
to extend across the Frith, and to be connected with the coal 
formation in the opposite district in the county of Fife. The 
strata are known to the depth of 135 fathoms, having been 
passed by the miners in sinking pits and other operations in 
the coal mines. The deepest seam that is known is the carsy 
coal, rising to the north-east along the sea shore. This seam 
and the smithy seam come out to the surface a short distance 
to the east of Burnfoot. The foul coal and red coal take on 
to the west of the road leading to Linlithgow ; the western 
main coal is only in the south-west of the parish, as there is not 
sufficient cover for this seam to the east and north. This coal 
field passes through the south-west boundary of the parish in- 
to the parishes of Borrowstownness and Linlithgow. In the southern 
division of it, the strata dip nearly north, with a declination of one 
foot in three. In approaching the north, the dip gradually comes 
round more to the west ; in the middle of the field, the dip is 
north-west, with a declination of 1 in 6 to 1 in 10. 

The following is a journal of the strata passed through in sink- 
ino- the engine or mingle, and the burn pits, which are the same 
inboth, with a slight variation in the proportions :

There are several dikes that throw the strata up, partly to the 
south, but generally to the north. These dikes vary from one to 
twenty fathoms, running chiefly from south-east to north-west, 
and may be termed slips rather than dikes, as they seldom occa- 
sion any rise, and merely disjoin the metals without producmg 
much alteration in their relative position. To the east of Burn- 
foot, after passing the crop of the Carsy coal, it is thought that 
no coal is to be found. No attempt by boring has been made to 
ascertain what minerals exist beneath the surface; but it is sup- 
posed that the strata lie beneath the coal measures. It is a cu- 
rious fact, that in a district where so many seams of coal occur, 
whinstone should be found so abundant. The Irongath hills 
consist of hard whinstone, resting on the coal strata ; nor does it 
present itself only in crops on the tops of eminences, but is found 
in regular seams between, and sometimes even in actual contact 
with the coal. In these hills, there is a bed of coal, varying from 
one to eight or ten feet in thickness, which has whinstone both 
for its roof and pavement ; and between the western main coal 
and the red coal, the seam of whinstone is about 70 feet thick. 
The fossil remains that have been found in the coal formation 
consist of reeds of different kinds. Shells and impressions of 
leaves are also of more or less frequent occurrence ; and a few 
years ago, the workmen fell in with a beautiful specimen of that 
curious extinct genus of fossil plants, the lepidodendron, but, un-

fortunately, only a small fragment of the inleresting relic was 
recovered. Ironstone appears to have been wrought in former 
times to some extent to the west of the church. 

The alluvial deposits in the west part of the parish, near the 
shore, consist of sea sand and shells resting on blue clay and mud, 
the clay resting on the coal formation j and' in the south-west, 
there is found yellow brick clay, and yellow clay with sand and 
gravel. The soil is of all varieties, from that of a light sandy 
texture to the richest loam and heavy clay. The subsoil is also 
very various, in some places being free and open, in others of a 
rocky description, and in others tilly and retentive. The boul- 
ders that have been met with, are trap, but different from that of 
the neighbourhood, and must have come from a distance, their 
weight varying from three or four cwt. to four or five tons. 

Botany. — There is but a small portion of the parish covered 
with wood, and that chiefly ornamental, planted for the most part 
on declivities and other parts of the surface, inapplicable to the 
usual purposes of husbandry. The prevalent sorts of trees are 
the plane, the ash, the elm, the beech, the larch, the oak, and 
the lime, which are all promiscuously intermixed, and seem all 
equally adapted to the soil. The full-grown trees, which are but 
few in number, are chiefly in the neighbourhood of the old man- 
sion-houses ; and as a proof of the geniality of the climate and 
vigour of the soil, it may be stated, that, within a few feet apart 
from high water mark, immediately below Carriden House, several 
trees of respectable size and appearance stand strong and healthy 
in growth, stretching their branches and foliage over the flood at 
full tide. 

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish. — Several incidental notices of it are to 
be met with in the works of antiquarian writers, from its being the 
eastern termination of Antoninus's wall, and the site of other an- 
cient Roman works ; but the only detailed accounts, besides the 
former Statistical Account, with which the writer is acquainted, 
are to be found in Sir Robert Sibbald's History of Linlithgowshire, 
Chalmers's Caledonia, and Penney's Topographical and Histo- 
rical Account of Linlithgowshire. 

Historical Events. — The only events of any note on record 
have a reference to the history of Blackness Castle, an ancient 
royal fortress, which never appears to have been considered of 
much importance as a military station, though, by the Act of Union,

it is one of the few ancient fortified places in Scotland that are 
stipulated to be preserved in a state of repair. In 1548, under 
the reo-ency of the Earl of Arran, the castle was garrisoned by 
the French, whom Henry II. sent over under the command of 
Monsieur D'Ess6, to support the pretensions which he derived 
from the matrimonial alliance that was contemplated between the 
Princess Mary and his eldest son the Dauphin. When Mary of 
Guise was promoted to be Regent, the castle again came into the 
possession of the French; but on the 14th April 1560, it was 
taken from them by the Sheriff of Linlithgow. In February 1571, 
it was manned with a garrison by Lord Claud Hamilton, a zealous 
partizan of the Queen; and it appears to have been held in her 
interest till February 1573, when it was delivered up to the Re- 
gent, the Earl of Morton, along with 50,000 double ducats, being 
the Queen's dowry, which had been brought from France by 
James Kirkaldy the preceding month, and with the written docu- 
ments relative thereto. During the occupancy of the castle by 
the Queen's troops in April 1572, an inroad was made by them 
upon the opposite coast, when they " spoulzeit" the towns, and 
returned to Blackness with considerable booty. On two occasions 
during the same period, an attempt was made upon the castle by 
the opposite party. In the same month and year as last men- 
tioned, a ship of war, well furnished with artillery, was sent from 
Leith to " asseige" the castle, but was driven from the station 
where she had cast anchor, with great danger, by the violence of 
the weather ; and in the year following, an attack was made to 
carry the place by surprise, which failed of success by " the gar- 
rison being on the alert."  

During the troublous times of the struggle between Presbytery 
and Episcopacy, the castle appears to have been employed chiefly 
for the purposes of a state prison, and was the place of confine- 
ment where many, who were obnoxious to Government for their 
known adherence to the principles of religious and civil liberty, 
were immured. By a decreet of the secret council of James VI. 
in February 1584, the celebrated Andrew Melville was adjudged 
to be committed to ward in the Castle of Blackness for declining 
their authority to decide upon the doctrine taught in a public dis- 
course which he had delivered at St Andrews. After the warrant 
of committal had been served upon him, however, he made his 
escape to Berwick. During the same year, the clergy in and near

Edinburgh, having been apprized that measures prejudicial to " the 
Kirk and its disciph'ne" were to be resolved on at a meeting of 
Parliament appointed to be held in May, prevailed upon David 
Lindsay, minister at Leith, who was most acceptable to the 
court, to intercede with the king for the interposition of his autho- 
rity till the Assembly should be heard in the matter ; but, when 
he was entering the gate of the palace in discharge of his com- 
mission, he was apprehended and carried to Blackness. There, 
also, the ministers of Edinburgh were condemned to a temporary 
confinement in 1587, for refusing to pray for the Queen's delive- 
rance ; their refusal being " not simply to pray for her, but for the 
preservation of her life, as if she had been innocent of the crimes 
laid to her charge." In 1594, the Earl of Angus, one of the ex- 
communicated Lords, was required to deliver himself up to cus- 
tody in Blackness, till he should undergo a trial, but refusing, was 
subsequently with the others found guilty of high treason. From 
August 1605 till towards the close of the following year, John 
Welsh, minister of Ayr, who had married John Knox's daughter 
Elizabeth, along with five other clergymen, were confined in the 
castle for refusing to condemn the Assembly that had met a short 
time before at Aberdeen, when they were " banished the king's 
dominions upon the pain of death." About the same time, a state 
prisoner of a different description, Gilbert Brown, abbot of New 
Abbey, " a trafficking and seducing Papist," who had been appre- 
hended by Lord Cranstoun, was lodged for a few days within its 
walls, till he was transported to the castle of Edinburgh. In 
1624, William Rigg, one of the bailies of Edinburgh, was de- 
prived of his office of magistrate, condemned to be imprisoned in 
Blackness Castle, and fined in L.50,000 Scots for challenging the 
doctrine taught by the Episcopal clergy. He was charged as being 
" the chief ringleader of the non-conformitants in Edinburgh, and 
that he contributed liberally to the printing of books which crossed 
the course of conformitie," The second Lord Bargeny, John 
Hamilton, who was served heir to his father, the first lord, on the 
17th October 1662, as the retour in Thomson's Abridgement 
bears, " in terris dominicalibus de Carriden, Law, et Dyland, cum 
maneriei loco de Carriden, infra baroniam de Carriden," was a 
prisoner in the castle in November 1679. In his indictment before 
the Court of Justiciary, dated 24th February 1680, he is inter 
alia charged with " corresponding with John Welsh," grandson 
of the former worthy of the name, " a factious trumpet of sedition

and treason, entertaining notour rebels in his house, pubhcly 
maintaining the principles of Naphtali, Jus Populi, Lex Rex, and 
declaring that Scotland would never be well till it wanted Episco- 
pacy, and the present government of the Church was destroyed, 
as unfit for the nation;" but the trial was never brought on from 
want of evidence. This nobleman entered heartily into the Re- 
volution, raised a regiment of 600 infantry for the public service 
in 1689, and died on the 25th May 1693. From an act of the 
Scots Parliament, we learn, that another sufferer in those times of 
religious persecution was John Hay of Lochloy, who was in 1683 
committed prisoner for the space of thirteen months, pairtly in 
the tolbuith of Edinburgh, and pairtly in the castle of Blackness." 
His offence was his hearing the nonconforming ministers. 

There are still attached to the castle a governor and lieutenant- 
governor, but both non-resident. When the former Statistical Ac- 
count was written, the garrison consisted of 2 gunners, 1 Serjeant, 
2 corporals, and 12 or 15 privates. Lately, the barrack furniture 
has been removed, and now the only inmates are an inferior officer, 
and his wife and daughter. 

Eminent Characters.— Co\ox\e\ James Gardiner, who fell in the 
battle of Prestonpans in J 745, and whose life, as recorded by Dod - 
dridge, affords so impressive and affecting an example of the power 
of divine grace and the influence of Christian example, was born 
in this parish at Burnfoot, where are yet pointed out the window 
of the apartment in which it is alleged that he first drew the breath 
of life, and two trees, an apple and a pear, said to have been plant- 
ed by his hands, but which are now in a state of great decay. 

In the new churchyard lie interred the remains of Dr John Roe- 
buck, a native of Sheffield in England, and projector of the exten- 
sive iron-works at Carron. Besides originating other important 
establishments connected with the arts in different parts of the 
island, this ingenious and enterprising individual was united in 
partnership with the celebrated James Watt in perfecting his im- 
provements upon the steam-engine ; and the story is told, that the 
first time the great engineer succeeded in setting his working mo- 
del agoing was in Dr Roebuck's dining-room, who was then resi- 
dent in Kinneil House, as lessee of the Duke of Hamilton's coal 
and salt-works near Borrowstounness. 

The late Sir John Lees, Private Secretary to the Marquis of 
Townshend when Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and who afterwards 
filled the office of secretary to the post-office in Dublin, was in his

youth brought up in this parish. lie was eminently successful in 
life, and affords a memorable example of the distinguished place 
in society to which the careful cultivation and judicious application 
of superior talents may raise their possessor. He was created a 
baronet on the 21st June 1804. 

As proprietor of the estate of Carriden, the late Rear-Admiral 
Sir George J. Hope, K. C. B., became connected with the parish 
above twenty years ago. He was a very distinguished officer, and 
highly appreciated in the service for his exemplary discipline, his 
decision, promptitude, and bravery, and his veneration for religion. 
He entered the navy at the age of fifteen, in the year 1782, and 
after passing through the usual gradations, attained the rank 
of captain in 1793, and that of rear-admiral in the year 1811. 
During the above period, he commanded the Romulus, Alcmene, 
and Leda frigates, the Majestic, Theseus, and Defence seventy- 
fours, being present at the battle of Trafalgar in the ship last 
named, and served as captain of the Baltic fleet during 1808 and 
the three subsequent years. In the year 1812, he went to the Ad- 
miralty, which he quitted temporarily in the following autumn to 
bring over the Russian fleet to England during the French inva- 
sion of that country. In 1813, he held the chief command in the 
Baltic, and at its termination returned to the Admiralty, where he 
remained as confidential adviser to the First Lord till his death on 
the 2d May 1818; thus closing a life spent in unremitting active 
■service in the discharge of the duties of the highest posts of our 
naval administration. 

Land-owners. — The Duke of Hamilton ; the Earl of Hopetoun ; 
Sir James Dalyell, Bart, of Binns ; James Hope, Esq. of Carri- 
den, Post- Captain in the Royal Navy ; James S. Cadell, Esq. of 
Grange ; and James Johnstone, Esq. of Straiten, are the principal 
proprietors of land. Captain Hope holds the place of first heri- 
tor; but the greatest amount of superiority and the patronage of 
the church belong to the Duke of Hamilton. 

Parochial Registers. — These are very voluminous, and in a state 
of excellent preservation. They have, upon the whole, been kept 
with great regularity. Seven volumes contain the collections and 
disbursements for the poor, from 1688 down to the present time, 
without any interruption but between 1708 and 1714. The ses- 
sion minutes occupy six volumes, commencing with the sederunt 
dated 27th January 1691, and have been regularly recorded, with 
only two exceptions, the one amounting to about two months, the

Other to five years. The registers of baptisms and marriages in- 
chide four volumes, the first entry of baptism being dated 1687, 
that of marriage, 16«8; and both records coming down to the 
present day, with only one interval in the former of about seven 
years, and one of about one year in the latter. The first volume 
of the session-minutes, among some other items besides the ses- 
sional transactions, contains "a just double of the mortification 
given by the Lairds of Grang, of a house or houses in Muirhouse, 
for a schoole to the parish of Caridden, 1636," the family name 
at that time being Hamilton; also, " mortification be Sir William 
Dick of Braid to Mr Andrew Keir and his successors, ministers 
of Caridden, of two roodes of land, 1642." Besides these, there 
are several odd volumes, and a register of deiiths and burials ; but 
since 1 806, it is very partial and defective. 

Antiquities. — The ancient Roman wall, built between the Forth 
and the Clyde in the reign of the Emperor Antoninus Pius by his 
Legate Lollius Urbicus, a. d. 140, is, by the almost universal con- 
sent of antiquarians, understood to have had its eastern termina- 
tion in this parish. Three diflPerent places have been assigned as 
the terminating point, Carriden, Walton, and Blackness. In the 
summary of the ninth chapter of Gildas, " De excidio Britannige, 
A. D. 560," it is expressly asserted that the wall commenced at 
" Kair Eden ;" and this opinion is adopted by Foredun, Richard 
of Cirencester, Gordon in his " Itinerarium Septentrionale," pub- 
lished in 17'26, and by Roy in his "Military Antiquities of the 
Romans in North Britain," published in 1793. Bede, in his 
" Eccles. Hist. Gentis Auglorum," written in 737, affirms that 
the wall began about two miles west of Abercurnig,f i. e. Aber- 
corn, at a place called, in the Pictish language, " Peanuahel," 
and in the English, " Penueltum." If the distance Ie correct, 
the " Peanuahel" of the Picts, and Penueltum" of the English, 
must correspond with Blackness, which is exactly two miles from 
Abercorn. In accordance with this opinion, Sir Robert Sibbald, 
in his "Hist. Inq." printed in 1707, says, "the wall runs from 

• The wdrds in Gildas are, "Videlicet, ut inter duo maria murum per milHa pas- 
suum plurima trans insulam instriierent a mari ScotisB usque ad mare Hibernias i. e. 
a Kair Eden civitate antiquissima, duorum ferine millium spatjo a Monasterio 
Abercurnig quod nunc vocatur Abercorn ad occidentem, tendens contra occiden- 
temjuxta urbem Alcluth." 

t I'he language of Bede bears a striking resemblance to that of Gildas, except in 
the proper nitmes : — " Ciijus oeris liodie certissima vestigia cernere licet. Incipit 
autem duorum ferme milium spatio a Monasterio Abercurnig, ad occidentem, in loco 
qui sermone Pictorum Peanuahel, lingua autem Anglorum, Penueltum appellatur, et 
tendens contra occidentem terrainatur juxta urbem Alcluit." — Lib. i. Cap. xii,

Carriden towards the Castle of Blackness, where it once ended, 
just as it did upon Clyde at Dunglass." The " Peanvahel" or 
" Penveltum" of Bede, however, he thinks corresponds with the 
present Walton, which, he says, "derived its name from the wall, 
as it stood upon its track." In the former Statistical Account of 
the Parish, the wall is said to have terminated at " Waltown 
and Camden, in his " Britannia," Vol. iii. p. 318, states, that 
" Antoninus Pius's wall may be traced to Carriden, and probably 
ended at Waltoun, the Penvahl of Bede." The locality of Wal- 
ton, however, affords a sufficient ground of conviction that, 
though evidently the site of a Roman fort or station, it neither 
formed the termination of the wall nor stood upon its track ; as, 
instead of being situated close upon the shore of the Frith in the 
line of direction obviously taken by the wall from Kinneil to 
Grange, and thereby completing the line of defence, it diverges 
towards the south at a considerable angle to the distance of about 
a mile, over irregular ground, and affords no advantage that could 
recommend it as the last station of so elaborate a work. Besides, 
Walton, instead of being two miles, as it ought to be according to 
Bede's account, is about four miles from Abercorn ; and, instead 
of being derived from the " Penueltum" of Bede, or from any re- 
lation it had to the wall, the name seems to trace its origin to a 
noted well or fountain of water that was constructed there to sup- 
ply the military posted at the station, and which, in the memory 
of the present tenant of the farm, went by the name of the Roman 
well, pronounced Scotice icall, having been filled up above fifty 
years ago ; and where still, at a little distance from the former re- 
servoir, an unfailing supply of excellent water at all seasons is 
delivered from a square stone-built conduit, large enough to re- 
ceive the body of a man. I am satisfied, in short, thathe wall 
terminated either at Carriden or Blackness, and, with highest 
probability, at the former, its remains, till very lately, being pretty 
clearly traceable to a small tumulus to the south-east of Grange 
House, called in modern phrase, the " Deacon's Stone," and a 
farm- steading, little more than a gun-shot to the west of the tu- 
mulus, called "Graham's Dyke," affording unquestionable evi- 
dence that this was the identical hue of its direction, and either 
of them forming a most desirable position for completing the line 
of defence, besides corresponding most nearly with the geographi- 
cal description of the more ancient writers upon the subject. 

. It ought not, perhaps, to be omitted, that another opinion is held upon the sub-

or 



The wall was cespititious, composed of earth or of the materials 
promiscuously taken from the ditch. ' Non tam lapidibus," says 
Gildas, "quarn cespitibus." There were nineteen forts erected 
upon it at certain intervals, the mean distance from station to sta- 
tion being 3554 yards, or something more than two English 
miles, so that an alarm could easily be communicated from one 
to another on the approach of danger. Roy makes the total 
length of the wall from Old Kilpatrick church to Carriden to have 
been 63,980 yards, or 36 miles and 620 yards English, being 
nearly 39| Roman miles ; a measurement which corresponds very 
much with that of Gordon. From Dunglass to Blackness, the dis- 
tance is about 40 English miles. 

The origin of the appellation " Graham's" or " Grime's Dyke," 
which is sometimes given to the wall, seems not to have been ex- 
actly determined by antiquaries. According to Horsley, " Gra- 
ham" in the Gaelic language signifies black, and, from its appli- 
cation to a large ditch and rampart that traverses a great part of 
Northumberland, which is so designated from its dark and sombre 
appearance in passing through the moors, this wall, he conjectures, 
may have taken its name from the same circumstance. The pre- 
vailing use of the appellation in the possessive case, however, would 
seem to restrict it to the name of a person ; and the common le- 
gend is, that " Grime," nephew to Eugenius, King of the Scots, 
with his troops broke through the wall a few miles westward of 
Falkirk, between Camelon and Castlecary, and had the achieve- 
ment immortalized by having his name given to the wall as iis 
vernacular designation. 

On the south side of the wall, and running in a great measure 
parallel with it, a military way was constructed for the more con- 
venient and expeditious communication between the different sta- 
tions. Roads of a similar description seem to have traversed the 
country in various directions ; and, from south to north, it would 
appear that, by means of this kind, a line of connection was main- 

ject. Nenius, who wrote a. D. 620, says, that the wall commenced at a place called 
in the British tongue, " Penguaul, which town, in Scottish, is called Cenail, but in 
English i e. Saxon Peneltum." — " Cenail" is understood to be the same as Kinneil; 
and its signification in Gaelic, denoting the " head" or ''end," is supposed to give far- 
ther indication that the wall terminated theie. It is impossible to identify the " Ce- 
nail" or " Peneltum" of Nenius, if corresponding with the modern Kinneil, with the 
" Penueltum" of 13ede, as the latter was only two, and the former is seven miles from 
Abercorn ; but it is by no means improbable that, in the course of its construction, 
the wall concluded, in the first instance, at Kinneil, and was, at a subsequent period, 
continued onwards to Carriden. Horsley at first coincides with Nenius in the opi- 
nion, that Kinneil was the proper terminatioi of the wall, but afterwards seems to 
agree with Gordon that it ended at Carriden.

tained tlirouffh the whole extent of the Roman territories in Bri- 
tain. Richard of Cirencester makes mention of a Roman way, 
that proceeded from the wall in Northumberland, by which I ap- 
prehend he means the wall built by the Emperor Adrian, by the 
Eildon hills, Borthwick Castle, Muttonhole, Cramond, Queens- 
ferry, and Abercorn, to Carriden, at or near the eastern termina- 
tion of Antoninus's wall ; and, several years ago, some remains of 
a causeway were dug up on the ridge that runs from Blackness to 
the road that leads from Carriden to Walton, to all appearance a 
branch from or an integral part of the above-mentioned way. 

At Carriden various Roman relics have been found at different 
times, such as a Vespasian of gold; a stone, described by Gordon 
as having an eagle with expanded wings, holding a corona trium- 
phalis in her bill, and standing in the middle of two Roman vexiUa 
or standards, on one side, and on the other the letters COH. 
lULiA, and others so obliterated as to be illegible, which was 
built in a wall added to the house by Alexander Miln, Esq. the 
then proprietor ; Roman pottery ; an old Roman altar, havmg no 
inscription, placed at the time in the garden ; and a brass gladius 
or sword, which is now in the Advocates' Library. " About fifty 
vears before" the former Statistical Account of the parish vvas 
written, the author savs, that, « in digging up stones to bmld a 
park dike, axes, pots, and several vases, evidently Roman, were 
found, and sent to the Advocates' Library." In levelling the tu- 
mulus above Grange House, already referred to, in spring 1833, 
several rude stone coffins with bones in them were found, but from 
the appearance of the bones, there was reason to believe that they 
had been deposited there at a much later date than the time ot 

the Romans. . 

At the eastern extremity of the parish, on a promontory jutting 
into the Firth, stands the Castle of Blackness, one of the tour 
national fortresses of ancient times, wbose preservation is guaran- 
teed by the Act of Union. The period of its erection is unknown, 
and its history has been very imperfectly recorded. It is a struc- 
ture more characteristic of the warfare of a ruder age than adapted 
to the modern improvements in the military art. 

Mavsion-Homes.—The mansion-houses of Carriden, Bonhard, 
and Grange, are fabrics of some antiquity ; the first of them, with 
some modern additions, being still occupied as the -.dence of 
the proprietor; the second attached to a farm ; and the third, 
after being lately put under some repairs, occupied by a tenant.

cording to their taste, and especially as they are to be seen at 
church, their appearance is most respectable. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

The number of Scots acres in the parish is 2157 

in cultivation, . 2023 

incapable of do. . 16 

under wood, 90 

roads, &amp;.c. . . 28 

Bent of Land. — The rent of the best land is from L. 4 to L. 5, 
that of the worst is about L. 1. The average grazing of a milk 
cow is L. 3, 10s.; of others L. 2, 10s. ; and of a sheep 10s. per year. 

Kinds of Stock. — The sheep mostly fancied for fattening are the 
black-faced; the breed of cattle is chiefly the short-horned ; but 
various sorts from the north are also in much request by the far- 
mer. The horses are for the most part the Clydesdale. 

Husbandry. — The style of husbandry in practice is the most 
approved of the present day. The farmers are most intelligent, 
enterprising, and active ; and the state of cultivation in which the 
farms are upheld is of the highest order. Much has been done of 
late to improve and ameliorate the soil by draining, manuring and

LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



regulating- the fences. Tile-draining has been introduced with 
great advantage. Sown grass is often grazed instead of being cut 
as being more conducive to keep the land in heart. Growing of 
turnips has been adopted to a considerable extent, with the most 
decided benefits to the cultivator. The duration of leases is ge- 
nerally for nineteen years. The usual rotation pursued is that of 
six years. Some of the farm- buildings are of a superior class. 
In two instances, the thrashing-mills are driven by steam-engines, 
and the fields, with few exceptions, are well inclosed. 

Quarries and Mines. — There are several quarries of free and 
whinstone in the parish, but they are only wrought occasionally for 
domestic use. The substrata abound in coal, and coal has been 
wrought in the parish from time immemorial. In former times 
the supply was furnished from the estates of Carriden, Bonhard, 
and Grange. Within the present century, no less than ten diffe- 
rent pits have been at work, though at different times, and all of 
them within little more than a mile distant from each other. At 
present there are only two in operation, belonging to the Duke of 
Hamilton. 

The seam of coal wrought in the mingle or engine-pit, which 
was the only one at work in 1832, for which year the following ac- 
count is given, is called the Eastern Main coal, and is in general 
about 4 feet thick. There are now 1843 four in operation. The 
workings are situated on the western boundary of the parish, 
close to that of Borrowstounness, the coal going under the 
name of the Bridgeness coal in the towns to which it is taken, 
from the name of the pier where it is shipped. The pit is 
77 fathoms deep, and the coals are drawn from the dip by an 
engine to the pit bottom, whence another engine raises them 
to the surface, the water being pumped up by a third engine of 
greater power, erected at the mouth of the pit to within 21 fathoms 
of the surface, where it escapes by a day- level to the Forth. The 
quantity of coals produced in 1832 was 9780 tons great coal, 
18,062 tons chows, and 4363 tons small coal. There are about 
ninety-five men, many of them residing in the parish of Borrows- 
townness, employed in hewing the coal, which is brought from the 
workings in corves or baskets set upon hurleys, which run upon a 
plate railway, driven by their children or putters to the place, 
from which the engine below takes it to the pit bottom. The col- 
liers are paid 2s. lOd. per ton for working the great coal, Is. lOd. 
per ton for chows, and 8d. per ton for small coal. A collier with 
his putter may put out ] ton great coal, and 2 tons chows in a 



CAURIDEN.

dav. The small coal is quite unsaleable ; the greater part of it is, 
of course, left in the waste, and, were it not for the use of the salt- 
pans, none of it would be brought up at all. The pit is about a 
mile from the shore, the coals being conveyed to the place of ship- 
ment bv a railway. The coal dips generally to the west at the 
rate of'l in 7 or 8 feet. Before the present dip workings com- 
menced, which was in 1830, the workings were above the level 
of the pit-bottom, reaching to the south of the pit about 900 yards, 
where the coal gets below the Irongath hills, in a direction nearly 
straight south, dipping to the north in some places at the rate of 
1 in 3. But it became so mixed with stone and troubled with 
dikes, which were generally up to the south, that the working of 
it was discontinued. The quality of this seam of coal is highly 
esteemed. 

In 1833, the Burn pit was sunk from the main to the smithy 
coal, a seam lying 12 fathoms deeper, and about 2 feet 7 inches 
thick. 

Fishery. — A stake-net for taking salmon was erected several 
years ago in the Frith, on the property of Captain Hope of Car- 
riden, having three pockets or chambers; and the fishing has occa- 
sionally been pretty successful. 

Produce. — The following is given as an approximation to the 
gross amount of produce : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, . L. 73.53 

potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. . 1200 

hay and pasture, . 2376 

gardens, . . 250 

coal mines, . . 7000 

salt-pans, . . . 1000 

L. 19,379 

Manufactures. — There were six salt-pans working in the village 
of Grange-pans in 1834, which made about 23,000 bushels of salt 
annually ; now there are only four at work. In the same village, 
in 1832 and 1833, and the two following years respectively, 7J3|, 
312, and 552 quarters of barley were malted. At Brickfield, near 
Blackness, a valuable field of clay, averaging 12 feet deep, has 
been wrought for some years past, which, in 1834, gave employ- 
ment to twelve men, and then yielded at an average yearly 150,000 
bricks, 200,000 roofing tiles, and 200,000 draining tiles. Since 
then, the demand for the latter has been greatly on the increase. 
Some years ago, there was at Blackness a chemical work in opera- 
tion, for the manufacture of soda, Barilla ash, and Roman cement ; 



72 



LINI.lTHGOWSniRE. 



a similar establishment at Bridgeness for the manufacture of vitriol 
or sulphuric acid ; and another in Grangepans for the manufac- 
ture of sal-ammoniac ; but all three are now extinct. 

Navigation. — There are no vessels belonging to the parish ; but 
about .'300 coasters, from 20 to 1-00 tons, fronj different ports in 
Scotland, and ten foreign vessels, from 50 to 100 tons, ship coals 
yearly at Bridgeness. In 1834, about 400 tons of Leith manure 
were imported at Blackness by two neighbouring farmers at 5s. 
per ton, employing eight vessels at 50 tons each ; and twelve ves- 
sels from 20 to 60 tons were employed by the proprietor of the 
brick-work in exporting the produce of his manufacture. There 
are also occasionally other importations of lime and manure for 
agricultural purposes. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Marltet-Toion, c. — The nearest market-town is Borrowstoun- 
ness, which is about one mile and a-half distant from the church ; it 
is also the post-town. Linlithgow lies about three miles distant 
to the south-west. There are five villages in the parish — Grange- 
pans, Bridgeness, Cuffabouts, supposed to be a corruption of 
Causewayfoot, the original name, Muirhouses, and Blackness. — the 
four last being of very little extent. 

Roads. — The turnpike-road from Linlithgow to South Queens- 
ferry passes through the south-eastern section of the parish for 
nearly a mile and a-half, but no public vehicle travels upon it. 
Another line of public road is at present in the act of formation 
from Grangemouth by Borrowstownness, diverging from the coast 
at the church of Carriden, and designed to meet the road above- 
mentioned at Champany. A railway, about a mile in length, 
having an inclined plane on which the empty waggons are drawn 
up by the descent of those that are loaded, was constructed some 
vears ago for the purpose of conveying the coals from the pits to 
the pier of Bridgeness. The other roads in the parish are suffi- 
ciently convenient for the purposes of communication, and, for the 
most part, kept in a good state of repair. 

Harbours. — The pier of Bridgeness was some years ago ex- 
tended by the proprietor about fifty yards further into the sea, to 
secure a greater depth of water for the vessels that repair to it, 
anji affords excellent accommodation for the purposes for which it 
was erected, the trade to which it is serviceable being the exporta- 
tion of coals and salt, and the occasional importation of manure and 
limestone. In former times Blackness was a harbour of conside- 



CARini3EN. 



73 



rable importance, being the sea-port of Linlithgow, the county 
town. Sir Robert Sibbald, in his " History of Linhthgowshire" 
in 1707, describes it as " a harbour for all sorts of ships, where 
they have a large custom-house, and warehouses with other accom- 
modations for merchants." " In the range along Bo'ness and the 
South Ferry they had," as he knew in his time, " some 36 ships 
belonging to them, though in all that tract south of the Frith there 
is no part for ships to lie at but Blackness. They traded with 
Holland, Bremen, Flamburgh, Queensburgh, and Dantzic. Many 
rich merchants lived there, and the cities of Glasgow, Stir- 
ling, and Linlithgow had great trade thence." Now the har- 
bour is in ruins, the custom-house converted into lodgings ap- 
propriated chiefly for the use of sea-bathers in summer, and the 
only merchandize known to the place is the shipment of a few tons 
of bricks and tiles, and the importation of a few tons of lime and 
manure. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\\q church stands upon the coast, dis- 
tant about two miles from the eastern and southern, and one mile 
from the western extremity of the parish ; and only one or two 
families can be said to be at a distance of more than two miles 
from it. It was built in 1766, the old church having stood about 
half-a mile distant, in close proximity to the mansion-house of 
Carriden, where the old church-yard still remains. The church 
was never properly seated by the heritors, but left to be occupied 
very much at the pleasure of the parishioners, so that, though ful- 
ly seated, the workmanship is but indifferent ; and the sittings 
were possessed in a great measure promiscuously, as they had been 
erected or purchased by the parties till 1826, when a formal di- 
vision of it was made by the sheriff among the heritors, according 
to their respective valuations. The pulpit, which was transferred 
from the old church to the new, and is formed of oak, is said to 
have been brought from Holland, having inscribed upon it the 
date 1655. One of the communion cups is dated 1660, the shape 
being the antique form of an inverted candlestick ; the other was 
procured during the present incumbency. The church, accord- 
ing to its present arrangement, will accommodate 458, but might 
be seated for 500. There are 28 free sittings allotted to the 
poor. The manse was built in 1818, and, though of rather small 
dimensions, is commodious, well-finished, and in good repair. 
The old manse, now in ruins, is situated a few hundred yards to 
the east of the present. The glebe is 14.556 imperial acres, hav- 



74 



LINLITIIGOWSHIUE. 



ing been received in excambion for the old glebe in 1817. The 
stipend, inclusive of communion elements, is 128 boils meal, and 
as many of barley. 

In 1834, there were 259 families, amounting to 1104 indivi- 
duals who might be reckoned as attached to the Established 
Church, 22 families containing 96 individuals belonging to the 
United Associate Synod ; one family and part of another who 
were Reformed Presbyterians, and there were 5 Episcopalians. 
The average number of communicants is nearly 200. 

Religious Society. — A Parochial Bible Association was instituted 
in 1826, in connection with the West Lothian Bible Society, with 
a special provision, that the wants of the parish should, in the first 
instance, be supplied. The rate of contribution was a penny a- 
week, and in this way, from 1826 to 1833 inclusive, L.51, 17s. lid. 
were collected for the purpose of promoting the distribution of the 
Scriptures. This society has now merged in a general association 
lately established in support of the schemes of the General As- 
sembly, and for circulating Btbles through the parish. 

Church Collections, — The amount of church collections for re- 
ligious and charitable purposes for the seven years ending in 1834, 
averaged L. 38, 4s. lid. 

Education. — Besides the parochial school, there are three other 
schools in the parish, two of them under the patronage and su- 
perintendence of the Carriden family, one an infant school, the 
other for the education of female children, the third dependent 
upon the personal efforts and success of the teacher. 

The parochial teacher's salary is the maximum. He possesses 
the legal accommodations as to school and dwelling-house, and 
in lieu of a garden, two bolls of oatmeal are allowed him. 

Library. — In 1821, a library was instituted in the parish, to 
consist of books of a religious and instructive character, and to 
remain in perpetuity for the use of the inhabitants. A number 
of donations set it at once on a respectable footing, and the ac- 
cession of subscribers was at first promising, but latterly they have 
not been so numerous. 

Friendly Societies and Savinys' Banks. — Some years ago, a Sa- 
vings' bank was established, in the hope that it would speedily and 
largely improve the character and domestic comfort of the labouring 
classes ; but the experiment did not succeed. Few embraced the 
opportunity of entering deposits, and those few not altogether the 
class of persons for whose benefit it was designed. 



CARRIDEN4

Friendly Societies.— There vieve two Friendly Societies in exis- 
tence in 1834, and had been for soaie years before— one for the 
support of its members when disabled by sickness or infirmity, the 
other for defraying the funeral expenses incurred at the death of 
a member, or of a member's wife or child. At present the latter 
only is in existence. 

Poorand.ParocUal Funds.— i:\\e average number of paupers up- 
on the roll for the seven years ending in 1834, was 30||, to each of 
whom the average sum allotted yearly was L.2, 2s. 6|d. Be- 
sides those upon the roll, there are others who are allowed occa- 
sional relief. The funds for this expenditure proceed partly from 
the church collections, and the proclamation and mortcloth dues, 
and partly from an assessment laid on the landlord and tenant, and 
which, for the seven years above specified, averaged L.3b', 6s. Sd. 
per annum. It is much to be regretted, that the disposition, once 
so honourable a trait in the Scottish character, to live indepen- 
dently of parochial aid, is greatly on the decline. 

Ale-houses. — Of these there are too many amongst us for the 
moral well-being of the people. There are six houses in all where 
spirituous liquors are sold. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In more remote times, the aspectof the parish must have been con- 
siderably different from what it is at present. The surface was for- 
merly much more thickly studded with human habitations and 
scenes of human industry, grouped together in little patches, than 
it is now ; many of which have disappeared altogether, while of 
some a few faint vestiges still remain. At one time a considera- 
ble establishment of salt-works, now wholly obliterated, existed 
near where the present church is situated, and was named in the 
former Statistical Account, " Benhard-pans." Nearly a mile dis- 
tant from the church to the east, another series of erections of the 
same kind was stationed, called Carris-pans, probably a corruption 
of Carriden-pans, of which the only relic to be seen is the stakes, 
that mark out the boundary of the " bucket -pat that is, the re- 
servoir that held the sea water that was to be subjected to the 
process of evaporation. Bonhard appears to have been once the 
seat of a village inhabited by the labourers that were employed at 
the coal-works formerly in operation there. Little Carriden, si- 
tuated a short distance eastward from the Muirhouses, but now 
extinct, was within these twenty years in existence. From time 
to time, the smaller farm steadings have been gradually disappear- 
ing. And the villages that continue to exist discover symptoms

of decay rather than of increase and improvement. Blackness, 
especially, seems to have shrunk greatly from its former import- 
ance, as, besides being a respectable sea-port and mart of trade, 
it was once the centre of a considerable population, having in its 
neighbourhood mills, fisheries, coal-works, and salt-pans.

THE REV. GRAHAM MITCHELL, A. M., MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Extent, Sfc. — Whitburn, formerly written Whiteburn, 
seems to have received its name in contradistinction to Blackburn, 
which lies to the east of the parish. In extent it is about six miles 
long, and two and a-half broad. It is bounded on the east, by Living- 
ston ; on the west, by Shotts and part of Cambusnethan ; on the 
south, by West Calder; and on the north, by Bathgate and part 
of Shotts. t The Almond runs through the north of the parish, 
and the Breich along the south of it. 

There are several spuings, and a good deal of mineral water 
strongly impregnated with iron. 

Mineralogy. — A most valuable seam of coal has been wrought 
here for more than a century. A drop falls from the top of 

 Besides what was formerly stated in the text, the importance of Blackness may 
be inferred from the following words found in a charter granted in 1642, to Thomas 
Dalzell de Binnes, — " Duobus marinis molendinis granariis lie sea-cornmylnis cum 
multuris omnium terrarum de Blacknes et Bonytoun, infra dominium de Linlithgow, 
cum viridario — piscationibus et piscariis lie cruves de Blacknes infra mare, cum 
carbonibus, et salina2 patellis, de dominio et balliatu praedicto." In another charter 
to George Earl of Linlithgow in 1690, the tenor is — " officio constabularise et custo- 
diaj castri de Blackness — terris, et carbonibus et carbonariis dictariim terrarum de 
Blackness tarn infra quam extra fluxum maris ; — piscibus, piscariis et lie cruives de 
Blackness infra mare, &amp;c." 

I The first branch of the Briech water commences at a place called Darmid Lin, 
or Moss, on the lands of Climpy, — it is sometimes called Darmed Kirk, as sermons 
were often preached in that retired place in times of persecution. The second branch 
commences at a ilace called Linqure, between Knowton and Headless cross Mains, 
and Causeway hill. The Almond water commences at the foot ol'the Ilirst hill, in 
the parish of Shotts, and from Blairmackhole moss, about a mile farther north, in 
the same parish.

the pit, and sometimes forms itself into strong pillars, wh.ch can 
xv-ith difficulty be broken. It is calcareous stalactite. The fol- 
lowino- report of Greenridge Colliery is from Mr Bald, engineer, 
who \s well acquainted with a considerable part of the parish :- 
« 1st The dip of the strata is to the north ; their declination 
from tlie horizon is in general about one in twelve, but they are 
in some instances much flatter, and also steeper. The strata are 
occasionally cut by veins or slips, producing dislocations ot the 
strata, and these are generally in the line of bearing from east to 
west. The eff'ect of these is to throw the strata either up or down 

to the rise or crop. 

« 2d, The whole of the parish of Whitburn, as to its minerals, 
is of the independent coal formation, and consists of the following 

kinds of rocks : — ... 

" Sandstone, of various shades of yellow and brown, some ot it in 
thick beds ; flagstones, and thin slaty sandstone. Mica is found 
in all these, and generally very abundant in the latter. Hardness, 
from very soft to very hard. 

. « Argillaceous shistus, of various shades, from dark blue to black, 
is found in beds of a few inches to several yards thick. This shistus, 
when mixed with sand, forms a clay slaty sandstone. Bands and 
balls of argillaceous ironstone are frequently found in this shistus. 
Some of this rock is of very fine particles, decomposes rapidly 
when exposed to the air and weather ; when calcined, it is of a 
bright-red. 

« ArgiHaceous rocks, of various shades of brown and approaching 
to black. This is commonly found to be the bed upon which each 
coal rests ; in it are found occasionally small balls of argillaceous 
ironstone, very much the shape of potatoes. This kind of rock 
is termed fire-clay, and from it, in diff"erent places, the best fire- 
bricks of Scotland are made, for resisting the action of intense 
furnace heat. 

" Greenstone rock, commonly termed blue whinstone, abounds 
very much in this parish. It is similar to the same kind of rock 
so abundant in Scotland, composed of red or white felspar and 
hornblende, and in whatever situation the bed of greenstone is, 
that is, whether in a vertical or horizontal position, the numerous 
fissures, which give it a columnar form, are always at right angles 
to the bed on which it rests. This rock is found in detached 
beds, generally several yards in thickness, forming small knolls, 
and at times the summit of hills, of from 150 to 200 feet high, 



78 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



above the adjacent country. Many mineralogists, and mining 
engineers in particular, think these rocks of igneous origin, be- 
cause when they come in contact with bituminous coal, the com- 
mon coal of Scotland, they deprive it of its bitumen, converting 
it in some cases into glance coal the blind coal of Scotland, 
having neither smoke nor flame, on which account it is used for 
drying malt, at other times it converts the coal into a black stone 
of no use whatever. 

" Limestone,, — None of this rock is found in the parish, but mi- 
neralogists are of opinion it is to be found in the lower series of 
the coal strata, and of that kind which is termed the mountain- 
limestone. 

Ironstone. — The ironstone found in this parish is of the common 
argillaceous kind, and is found in beds from one inch to several 
inches thick, or in balls or flat circular pieces. This ironstone 
is similar to that found in all the coal-fields of Scotland, and used 
for the making of pig-iron. It yields generally from twenty-seven 
to thirty-three per cent, of pig-iron. 

" The same kind of organic remains are found in the strata here 
as are common in all the coal-fields of Scotland. 

" The alluvial covers are, 1. the old alluvial cover, composed of 
clay, sand, and small stones, intimately blended together, and 
very impervious to water. In this, large greenstone boulders 
abound. 2. Quick sands. 3. Clay mixed with small rounded 
stones. 4. Peat-bog. This is of very considerable extent, and 
very full of water. 

"The most valuable mineral which this parish contains, is what 
is called the Crofthead, or slaty black band ironstone, of which a 
very fine field has lately been discovered lying between Fauldhouse 
beyond the village of Longridge. The change which this discovery 
has made upon this district is very remarkable ; what was, till 
within the last three years a solitary moorland scene, has now be- 
come one of enterprise and industry. Tall chimneys are seen 
in all directions, and clouds of smoke rolling along from huge 
burning masses, show the extensive nature of the operations which 
are now carried on. 

" In regard to the position of this mineral, in relation to the 
strata of the neighbouring districts, it is undoubtedly connected 
with the Great Western Coal-field, or Glasgow Field, as it is 
usually termed, and lies at the bottom of the series to which it 
belono-s. At the south-western extremity of the parish, the Shotts

minerals are found cropping out in the Fauld Burn, a little above 
the village of Fauldhouse. These minerals lie somewhat in the 
form of a basin, the next in order below which is the slaty band 
series, to which also belong several seams of coal, generally of 
trifling amount. One of these seams is at present worked at 
Crofthead. The slaty band ironstone lies eleven fathoms below 
this seam. It occurs in three layers or plies, averaging in all 
about fourteen inches thick, the lower layer having from half an 
inch to one inch of coal adhering to the bottom of.it. The strata 
above the slaty band is composed of shale, which contains balls 
of ironstone, which are worked along with the slaty band in the 
« following," or part of the overlaying strata, which is taken down 
in order to make the workings the proper height. From twenty- 
three to twenty-five fathoms below the slaty band, there is a bed 
of ironstone balls, which contain a very high per centage of iron. 
These balls lie in a bed of clay, from four to four and a half feet 
thick. From forty-five to forty-eight fathoms below this bed, 
there is another bed of ironstone balls, from two to two and a-half 
feet thick, lying below a mixture of sandstone and clay, the floor 
being composed of bastard limestone, from one foot to sixteen 
inches thick. Sixteen fathoms below this, there is a bed of lime- 
stone, which probably belongs to the hmestone series which occurs 
at Levenseat, in the county of Edinburgh, and which lies beneath 
it. Below this, the coals which are found at Wilsontown, Wood- 
muir, and Longford, in the counties of Lanark and Edinburgh, 
occur. The series to which the slaty band belongs lies between 
the Levenseat limestone and the west country coal, called the 
Drumgray coal. There"appears to be a great mass of sandstone 
between the slaty band series and the Levenseat limestone. It 
is considered a doubtful point whether the slaty band field extends 
much beyond the district in which it is at present worked. It 
has been found at Langside, in the parish of Shotts, and was sup- 
posed to have been found about a mile and a-half south from 
Crofthead. 

" Although now so highly prized, the real nature and valuable 
properties of this kind of ironstone was, until within these few 
years, almost unknown. It was worked about forty years ago by 
the Wilsontown Iron Company, on the lands of Wester Handax- 
wood, in the county of Edinburgh ; but its valuable properties 
were then unknown, and it was supposed that it did not extend 
to the north side of Breich Water, whereas the greater part of 



80 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



this ironstone has now been found to lie on the north side of this 
water. The whole of the slaty band as yet worked in this parish 
is in tack by the Shotts Iron Company, and Messrs Holdsworth 
of Coltness. A number of pits have been sunk, and a number 
of steam-engines are used for pumping and winding. There 
are upwards of 200 workmen employed, who receive from 
2s. 6d. to 3s. per ton for working the ironstone. The minerals 
in this field dip to the north-west one foot in seven. The iron- 
stone is worke.d in the Longwall or Shropshire manner, and a 
subsiding of about eighteen inches takes place. Great care is 
required in regulating the air-courses, and numerous air-pits are 
sometimes required in consequence of the great quantity of sul- 
phurous vapour exhaled from the ironstone. When brought to 
the surface, the ironstone is removed on railways a short distance 
from the pits, where it is piled in large heaps for the purpose of 
being calcined. These heaps vary in size, according as it is 
found most convenient, from a few hundred up to 2000 tons. 
Previous to being set on fire, the mass is covered with ashes, in 
order to exclude the air, otherwise the ironstone becomes oxidated 
and of a reddish colour. 1000 tons of ironstone is, when calcined, 
reduced to 64 tons, and the quantity of iron got from the raw 
stone is estimated as high as forty-two per cent. When properly 
calcined, it has a very open texture, in consequence of the carbo- 
naceous matter having been consumed, for which reason it is used 
for mixing with other kinds of iron when put in the furnace, in 
order to make them flow more easily. _ Whilst the process of cal- 
cining is carried on, the smoke has a very stifling eff'ect, in con- 
sequence of the sulphurous vapour which is given out along with 
it, and sulphur is found deposited on t\fe top of the heap. This 
vapour has a most devastating eff'ect on the vegetation around, 
the ground in some places near the pits being totally devoid of 
vegetation ; and on the lands of Crofthead, a young plantation has 
been totally destroyed. When the water was pumped out of the 
old workings of Wester Handaxwood in spring 1840, it was so 
much impregnated with sulphate of iron, that it killed the fish in 
the Breich and Almond waters, into which it flowed. There are 
a number of faults or dislocations in this field, which generally 
run in the direction of the dip and rise, and vary in depth from a 
few inches to about nineteen feet, but they ore not of such extent 
or frequency of occurrence as materially to impede the working of 
the ironstone."

Land-owners. — These are, Sir William Baillie of Polkemmet, 
patron; Alexander Weir, Esq. of Boghead ; George Napier, Esq. 
of Little.Blackburn ; James Waddle, Esq. of Crofthead, &amp;c. 

Anliquities. In Cowhill, two gold pieces of Roman coin were 

dug up in a bog. 

The late Samuel Muir, Rector of Perth Academy, who was 
said to have been master of the grammar of eighteen different 
languages, received the first elements of his education in this parish.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The parish contains 10,019 English acres. 

The improvements of which husbandry is susceptible in this pa- 
rish are considerable. The ground being clay, or till bottom, it 
much requires draining, which is not yet carried to that extent it 
mioht. In some few places, the soil is of such a stiff nature that 
draining proves of little benefit. 

There is a great want of good enclosures and fences in some 
parts of this parish. Plantations are getting up. 

Quarries. — Several stone quarries are open in the parish, one 
at Blackburnhaugh, and another at Longridge. Whinstone is to be 
found. There are some good sand quarries ; one of a white sili- 
ceous nature, which makes excellent garden-walks. There is ano- 
ther of red sandstone. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is most 
convenient. When this parish was disjoined from Livingston, it 
was opened for public worship on the 21st October 1718; but 
there was preaching before from the year 1628. -f- The church 
was erected and partly endowed by public subscriptions. 

• The progenitors of Sir William Baillie came originally from Lanarkshire. They 
purchased the propeity of Polkemmet in the sixteenth century from Mr Andrew 
Shaw, a brief account of whom will be fpund in Spottiswood's History.

at Torwood.

The extent of the glebe is between six and seven acres. The 
final decreet of locality for the stipend, though many years before 
the court, is not yet determined, but over and above the stipend, 
L. 100 arises to the minister from a mortification in the county 
of Lanark, and which entitles him to a vote for member of Parlia- 
ment, besides the vote in Linlithgow county. 

There are three Dissenting meeting-houses in the parish. Di- 
vine service in the Established Church is well attended, and the 
majority of the parishioners are attached to it. Secession origi- 
nated here from the parishioners being frustrated in obtaining a 
vote for the minister, notwithstanding they had contributed to the 
erection of the church with that special end in view. 

The amount of collections in the parish church used to be be- 
tween L.46 and L.50 in the year ; but it has been less of late. 

Ministers. — The Rev. Alexander Wardrope, first minister of 
the church of Whitburn, was the descendant of a respectable fa- 
mily in this place. He was licensed to preach about 1722, and, 
some time after, was ordained at Muckhart. Vide Sketch of 
him by the late Rev. John Brown. We find Mr Wardrope men- 
tioned in Erskine's Memoirs as one of his correspondents. Mr 
Wardrope took an active share in the discussion usually called " the 
Marrow Controversy." Mr Wardrope, however, excelled more 
as a preacher than a controversialist. People came in crowds 
from very great distances to hear him. 

The individual who succeeded Mr Wardrope was Dr William 
Porteous. He was the son of the Rev. James Porteous of Mony- 
vaird. He was born on the 10th of March O. S. 1735. From 
the Memoir of his life, it appears that he became one of the most 
able ministers of the Church of Scotland in his day. By him was 
planned the Glasgow Society of the Sons of the Clergy, which 
has endeared his memory to the Church. In the same spirit of 
humanity and zeal for the best interests of men, he promoted with 
all his public and private influence the noble and extensive views 
of the British and Foreign Bible Society. And it was upon his 
motion before the Church courts, there was appointed the first pub- 
lic collection which was ever rnade in Scotland for the objects of 
that institution. He was ordained minister of Whitburn on the 
10th of June 1760, where he laboured for ten years. On the 
28lh June 1770, he was appointed minister of St George's, Glas- 
gow, where he set agoing Sabbath schools, and devised plans for 
the benefit of the poor.

WHITBURN.

The next minister who succeeded Dr Porteous as minister of 
Whitburn was the Rev. Mr Baron, who afterwards became Pro- 
fessor of Moral Philosophy in the University of St Andrews. 
Professor Baron was born at Kershall, in the parish of Corstor- 
phine, in 1735 ; he died in 1803. He received the greater part of 
his education at the University of Edinburgh. His first settlement 
took place at Wamfray. His reception in the parish was not very en- 
couraging; but similar occurrences were not very unusual at that 
time. In 1774, he published an essay on the mechanical principles 
of the plough, and in 1777, a " History of the Colonization of the 
Free States of Antiquity, applied to the present Contest between 
Great Britain and her American Colonies." This work attracted 
much notice, in this country, and on the continent. It called forth 
several keen replies in England, and in the following year a French 
translation was published at Utrecht. When at Whitburn, he 
likewise wrote his history of the political connection between Great 
Britain and Ireland, which was published about 1780. Soon after 
he went to St Andrews. 

It is proper to mention, that he wrote an account of the life of 
Thomson, which was prefixed to an edition of the " Seasons," 
published at Edinburgh. He also was a contributor to the Edin- 
burgh Magazine. Among the distinguished men who then adorn- 
ed the literature of Scotland, few were more conspicuous than the' 
late Lord Karnes. With him Mr Baron lived on terms of fa- 
miliar intercourse. His Lordship, about this time, succeeded 
in reviving the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, originally es- 
tablished by the celebrated Maclaurin. Of this Society Mr Baron 
was a member. In a few years, chiefly at the instigation of Prin- 
cipal Robertson, this Society merged in another on a more extended 
plan, and was incorporated by royal charter under the name of 
the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Of this Society Mr Baron was' 
an original member. He was nominated Professor of Rhetoric 
and Logic in the University of St Andrews without his knowledge. 
This appointment compelled him to give up his benefice at Whit- 
burn ; but as a compensation for the loss of his living, the King 
was, many years afterwards, pleased to confer upon him a pension 
of L.lOO a-year. His Lectures on Rhetoric were published in 1806. 

Mr Baron was succeeded in the charge by Dr James Somerville. 
He was born in Carnwath in the ear 1747. He was appointed 
minister of Whitburn in 1779, in which charge he laboured about

LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



ten years. Vide account of Dr Sommervile in Dr Stevens's his- 
tory, also prefixed to the vohjme of his published discourses. 

Dr Somerville was succeeded in the charge by the Rev. James 
Rhind, who was admitted minister of Whitburn in 1790. His 
successor was the Rev. James Watson, who was translated from 
the presbytery of Orkney. 

The Rev. Archibald Bruce, minister of the Associate Congre- 
gation, and teacher of the theological class at Whitburn under the 
inspection of the late General Associate Synod, was a man of 
such eminent attainments in theology and literature, that his name 
deserves to be here recorded. In the year 1780, he published 
" Free Thoughts on the Toleration of Popery ;" a work of most 
elaborate research, which has furnished subsequent writers upon 
the subject with a rich store of materials, and which procured Mr 
Bruce the friendship of Lord George Gordon, upon whom Mr 
Bruce waited when in London in the year 1782, and who, a year 
or two later, visited Mr Bruce at Whitburn. The following works, 
among many others, issued from his pen : " Introductory and Oc- 
casional Lectures," delivered in the Theological Academy at 
Whitburn ; " A Dissertation on the Supremacy of Civil Powers 
in Matters of Religion ;" translation from the French of " Dis- 
courses on the True and False Religion, by Pictet." Vide sketch 
of Mr Bruce in the Life of Dr M'Crie. 

Education There are five schools ; two are endowed from a 

sum of L.4250 left to the schools of this and Cambusnethan pa- 
rishes. The salaries of the teachers of these two schools, inde- 
pendently of the school-fees, at present amount to less than L. 30, 
besides free house and garden. The parish schoolmaster's salary is 
the maximum, L.34, 4s. 44d. He has also a glebe of about ten 
acres, Scotch measure. He has the legal accommodation. The 
amount of school-fees may be about L.20 per annum. 

Libraries. — There are two libraries in the parish, one in the 
village and the other at Longridge.

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE BOAG, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, Sc.— The extreme length of the parish, from east to 
west, is 4 miles, and breadth from north to south about 3 miles. 
It contains 3120 Scots acres. It is bounded on the north, by 
Ecclesmachen and Linlithgow ; on the east, by Kirkliston; on 
the south, bv Mid-Calder; and on the west, by Livingston and 
Ecclesmachen. 

The highest part of the parish is probably not 380 feet above 
the level of the sea. Toward the north-west, however, where the 
church and manse stand, it is so elevated as to have a commandmg 
view of the country to the east and south-east as' far as Edmburgh 
Arthur's Seat, and the Pentland hills, and even North Berwick 
Law, as well as the Lammermoor hills, are seen in the distance. 

The parish anciently was named Strathbrock, which signifies 
" the valley of brocks or badgers." 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers. — These are chiefly records of marriages, 
baptisms, and proceedings of session. Registers of marriages and 
baptisms seem to have been regularly kept, and are for the most part 
extant, for upwards of two hundred and forty years. Records of 
the deeds of session have been regularly kept since the establish- 
ment of Presbyterianism, after the Revolution. During the time 
of Episcopacy, before the Revolution, a register of burials seems 
to have been kept, which is still extant; but since that time, 
this was for the most part neglected, till the beginning of the 
year 1840, when the regular registration of burials was com- 
menced. 

Land-owners. — The Earl of Buchan is the principal land-owner 
and patron of the parish. The valuation of his Lordship's pro- 
perty situate in this parish, being the estate of Strathbrock, and 
part of that of Amondeli, is L.3320. Strathbrock, according to 



86 



LINLTTHGOWSIIIRE. 



the account given by the late Earl of Buchan, was very anciently 
in the possession of the family of Sutherland. From that family 
it passed to the Douglasses about the beginning of the fifteenth 
century ; then to Keiths, Earls Marischal ; next to the Earls of 
Winton and the Oliphants, and sometimes called, on that account, 
Strathbroke Oliphant. From them it came by purchase to Sir 
Lewis Stewart, whose grand-daughter, Katherine Stewart, marrying 
Henry Lord Cardross, it came by descent to the present Earl, 
Henry David Erskine. The present Earl succeeded his uncle, 
David Stewart Erskine, the eleventh Earl of Buchan, in 1829. 
His own father, the late Honourable Henry Erskine, that most 
distinguished member of the Scottish Bar, was twice Lord Ad- 
vocate of Scotland in 1782 and 1806. After a long, laborious, 
and brilliant professional career, extending over a period of forty- 
four years, Mr Erskine retired from public life, and spent the re- 
mainder of his days in domestic retirement at his beautiful villa of 
Amondell, in this parish, where he died on the 8th of October 
1817, in the seventy-first year of his age. The remains of this 
most celebrated barrister, as also of the late Lord Chancellor 
Erskine, his brother, are deposited in the family vault adjoining 
Uphall Church. 

Next to his Lordship, in respect of extent of property, is 
Norman Shairp, Esq. of Houstoun. The valuation of his estate 
is L.720. 

The Shairps of Houstoun have held property varying in extent 
at different periods, in the parish of Uphall, for nearly four hun- 
dred years. It is said that their ancestor, whom Nisbet calls 
William E'scharp, came from Normandy with David H. The 
first of the family of whom history makes particular mention, is 
Sir John Shairp, Knight, Advocate for Queen Mary, who acquired 
most of the property, and in whose time it is said the oldest part 
of Houstoun House was built. Since his time, many of his de- 
scendants have distinguished themselves in battle ; and the graves 
of some- are on famous fields. 

Thomas Shairp, Esq. of Houstoun, held a pre-eminent place 
in the opposition party in the Union Parliament, in which, along 
with his brother-in-law, Murray of Livingston, he represented the 
county of Linlithgow. In the time of his successor, the property 
of Houstoun was the largest in the county of West Lothian.

Since that time, it has shrunk within comparatively narrow limits. 
All these facts and many more are fully authenticated by papers 
in possession of the family, some of which bear as far back a date 
as 1462. 

R. W. Maxwell, Esq. of Middleton, is another land-owner. He 
has lately purchased and taken possession of that small but beau- 
tiful estate, the valuation of which is L.113. 

The whole of the parish, with the exception of a very few acres, 
is the property of the Earl of Buchan and these two gentlemen. 

Mansion- Houses. — These are, Kirkhill House, formerly the re- 
sidence of the Earl of Buchan ; Amondell, at present occupied by 
his Lordship ; Houston House, the residence of Norman Shairp, 
Esq. ; and Middleton, the residence of R. W. Maxwell, Esq. 

HI. — Population. 

It appears from Old Accounts, that the population, sixty years 
ago, was only 600. Since that time, there has been a great in- 
crease. 



Population in 1801, . 786 

1811, . 800 

1821 . 1016 

183 J, . 1254 

1841, . 1467 



The principal village is Broxburn, of which the population is 
500 ; the only other village is Uphall, containing 220 ; the popu- 
lation of the country part of the parish, 504. The remaining part 
of the population at last census consisted of people employed on 
the railway, who have now left the parish. 

Of the regular population, the number of families are, 245 ; 
belonging to the Established Church, 216 ; Dissenters, 24 ; Epis- 
copalian, 1 ; Roman Catholics, 4. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish contains 3922 imperial acres, 3532 of which are 
in a state of cultivation. There are 178 acres of plantations ; 212 
have never been cultivated, but are, for the 'most part, capable of 
cultivation. What is called Drumshorlan moor contains about 200 
acres of uncultivated land, of which the half is natural wood. 

The real rental of the parish is nearly L.6000 ; and the ave- 
rage rent per imperial acre about L.l, 15s. 

Agriculture. — The greater part of the parish is in a high state 
of cultivation, and in the hands of active farmers, who have intro- 
duced many of the recent improvements in agriculture. Among 
these, furrow draining has been introduced within the last ten

LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



years, and is progressing. The general character of the husban- 
dry practised is sicilful and in accordance with the modern im- 
provements of the day. The soil has been greatly improved by 
the application of an extra supply of manure, brought from Edin- 
burgh by the Union Canal. 

The soil consists generally of clay, and, to a certain extent, its 
character is a loamy clay, incumbent on a close subsoil, impervi- 
ous to moisture. The whole cultivated lands are divided into 
fields, enclosed with ditches and thorn hedges. 

The general rotation of crops is, after hay or pasture, one 
crop of oats ; next, fallow or fallow crop ; then wheat succeeded 
by barley or grass seed for a hay crop. In the higher parts of 
the parish, little wheat is sown, but the fallow crop is succeeded 
by barley or oats, and then hay or pasture. 

The dairy produce is excellent. Considerable attention has 
been paid of late years to the breed of cows. The Teeswater 
or short-horned and Ayrshire are preferred, and crosses from 
these. Butter and milk, also poultry and eggs, are sent to the 
Edinburgh market. The breed of horses for agricultural purposes 
has been of late much attended to, and a rapid improvement has 
taken place from the cultivation of the Clydesdale breed. There 
are not many sheep in the parish, but recently a few of the Lei- 
cester breed have been introduced ; and so far as trial has been 
made, they have proved profitable. 

This parish cannot yet boast of any manufactures. Coals have 
been wrought in it for a long period. The colliery at present in 
operation is on the estate of Houstoun. It employs about twenty 
individuals. The parish abounds with other minerals, ironstone 
and freestone. The ironstone has never been wrought. But the 
freestone has been wrought to a great extent. It is of an excellent 
quality, much celebrated ; and of late years, by means of the ca- 
nal, a great quantity of freestone has been conveyed from this 
parish to Edinburgh," and used in erecting some of the principal 
buildings in that city. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church bears all the marks of one 
erected before the Reformation. It is ftir from being commodious, 
and is too small for the population. The bell still in use is that 
brouo-ht from the steeple of the old church, and bears date 1441,, 
The ''inscription on the bell is " Campanum Sancti Nicholai de 
trathbroke." The church was a rectory in early times. The

succession of ministers since the Reformation stands thus: 1. 
The Rev. -James Smith; 2. Patrick Shairp; 3. Andrew Keith; 
4 Alexander Keith ; 5. W. Mowbray ; 6. George Barclay, ad- 
mitted 1691 ; 7. John Wilkie, admitted August 22, 1706; 8. 
William Gibb, admitted October 27, 1763; 9. David Ure, ad- 
mitted July 14, 1796; 10. John Ferguson, admitted September 
28 1798; 11. John Ferguson, Junior, appointed assistant and 
successor,' April 29, 1824; 12. George Boag, admitted August 
22, 1839. 

In a list of ecclesiastical persons who held lands m Scotland, 
anno 1296, and preserved in the Tower of London, we find the 
name of " Ferquardus parsona ecclesiae de Strathbroke vicecomi- 

tatu de Linlidgo." 

The present stipend is sixteen chalders of victual, amounting in 
value, according to the fiars of crop 1840, to L.265. But there 
are unexhausted teinds to the value of nearly L. 400. The 
glebe contains ten Scotch acres, which may be valued at L.25. 
There is, properly speaking, no manse at present. But in place 
thereof, the minister possesses an excellent mansion-house, be- 
longing to the Earl of Buchan, delightfully and conveniently situ- 
ated, for which the other heritors pay their proportion of rent. 

Schools. — There are two schools. The parochial school is at 
the village of Broxburn. About 100 scholars attend it. The 
other school is at the village of Uphall. It is attended by 80 
scholars. No additional school seems necessary. The parochial 
schoolmaster's salary is L. 34, 4s. 4id. ; school fees amount to 
L.36 or thereabouts; and other emoluments to about L.15; the 
sum of L.l, 12s. is allowed him by the heritors for a deficiency of 
garden. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Particular attention is paid to the 
support and comfort of the poor. The average number regularly 
receiving parochial aid is about 20 ; several get occasional relief 
besides. The weekly collections in the church average about L.l 6 
a-year ; property for behoof of the poor, invested in the kirk-ses- 
sion, fields L. 40 a-year ; and to make up the deficiency of what 
is requisite, the heritors voluntarily assess themselves. The as- 
sessment is L. 30 or upwards, varying as circumstances require

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES SCOTT, MINISTER, 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The ancient name of the parish, as appears from char- 
ters of the twelftli century, was Dumanie or Dumanyn. In others 
of a later date, it is written indiscriminately, Dummany, Dumanie, 
Dalmany, or as at present Dalmeny. It is understood to be of 
Celtic origin, and to signify Black heath, or glooviy spots, of which 
there is reason to believe, the greater part of the parish at one 
time consisted. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish proper, exclusive of Auld- 
cathie, which was once a separate parish or" vicarage, and which 
lies at a distance of 1 miles from its western extremity, being dis- 
joined from it by parts of Kirkliston and Abercorn, is about 4 
miles in length, and 2 in breadth. It stretches along the south- 
ern shore of the Frith of Forth from a burn which separates it 
from Cramond parish on the east, to that of Abercorn on the 
west. Its southern boundary is Kirkliston parish and the river 
Almond. The name of the disjoined portion, Auldcathie, pro- 
perly, Altcathaek, signifies in the Celtic, rivulet of the defile " or 
battle burn." Its length, which is one and a-half mile, is termi - 
nated by the parish of Linlithgow on the west, and Kirkliston on 
the east : its breadth three-fourths of a mile, by Ecclesmachan on 
the south, and Abercorn on the north. The two portions toge- 
ther comprise an area, of 9.371 miles. 

Topography, Geology, Sfc. — In the parish of Dalmeny proper, 
which, from its proximity to the Forth, its undulating surface, and 
its high state of cultivation, stands almost unrivalled for its beauty, 
there are three considerable elevations, ranging at about 380 feet 
above the level of the sea, Dundas Hill, on the west, runs for 
three-quarters of a mile from nearly north-west to south-east, pre- 
senting to the south-west a precipitous front to the height of about 



DALMENY. 



91- 



seventy feet of columnar whinstone or trap. At the foot of the 
basaltic range, there was formerly a loch, which was lately drained, 
consisting of moss of unknown depth, and resting at the outlet east- 
ward on a bed of shell-marl, from which have been dug several oak 
trees with the heart in a state of entire preservation. Southward 
from this line of whinstone, towards Kirkliston, is an immense ex- 
tent of freestone of the finest quality, which has been cut out in 
great quantities from Humbie quarry. The same stratum of free- 
stone appears also on the north of this elevation in close contact 
with the whhi, being separated from it only by a thin layer of in- 
durated clay. This range of whin, which forms a prominent fea- 
ture in the outline of the parish, extends eastward, reappearing at 
a place called Craigbree in a similar form, though less elevated, 
till it is again thrown up in an immense mass at Craigie-hill, where 
it attains its greatest height. Aline drawn from this point through 
Mons-hill, Inch- Garvey, and North Queensferry, traces an almost 
uninterrupted chain of this igneous rock, though within the grounds 
of Dalmeny Park, where it forms an extensive and ever- varying 
succession of hill and dale, it is mostly covered with verdure or 
thriving wood. The strata lying within this range consist chiefly 
of freestone, shale, and limestone, of from seven to ten feet in 
thickness, of the finest quality, worked out by mining at an exten- 
sive quarry a little to the west of Queensferry, within the water- 
mark. There is also ironstone, and probably coal, though no se- 
rious attempt has ever been made to discover it. The whole of 
these intervening strata dip towards the north-east into the Frith 
of Forth, where, for a distance of upwards of five miles, including 
a part of Cramond parish to the west of the confluence of the 
Almond with the sea, and within the grounds of Dalmeny Park, 
they form alternately a beautiful succession of small promontories 
and bays, richly wooded to the water's edge. In the shale or blaes 
above the limestone, are found numerous vegetable fossils of the 
species peculiar to that order of the carboniferous group. The 
view from Duhdas-hill, Craigie-hill, and Mons-hill, and indeed 
from the whole elevated range from which the stratified rocks 
take their slope, can scarcely be surpassed for extent, variety, and 
beauty. The panorama from the top of the latter hill, which 
forms the highest point in the spacious park of Dalmeny, and over- 
looks its splendid mansion, comprehending an extraordinary varie- 
ty of objects that constitute the sublime and beautiful, includes no 
less than sixteen different counties.

Meteorology, Sfc. — The average summer temperature is 64 ; 
winter, 47°. Average barometrical pressure 29.4 inches. On 6th 
November 1838 and 7th January 1839, during the prevalence of very 
high winds, the barometer fell to the unprecedented degree of 
27.9 and 27.8 inches. 

The Frith of Forth, which, as has been already stated, bounds 
the parish entirely on the north, and which from Cockle Burn, a 
little to the east of Lord Rosebery's mansion in Dalmeny Park, 
has numerous indentations and inlets along the shore to Linmill- 
burn, its limit on the west, is often discoloured by the moss car- 
ried down by the river. The shore in many places, owing to the 
same cause, is covered with slime, which renders it somewhat un- 
safe, especially on horseback, — varied, however, with beautiful 
patches of white sand and shell. The tides rise somewhat higher 
than at Leith, owing to the contraction of the Frith towards 
Queensferry. There are no mineral springs in the parish except 
such as contain carbonate of lime ; but the water is generally 
excellent, and one well, in particular, near Leuchold, in Dalmeny 
Park, is remarkable for its uncommon transparency and coolness. 
The only waterfall that can be termed a cascade on a very small 
scale, except at Craigiehall, to be afterwards noticed, is formed 
by the Linmill-burn falling over a precipitous rock of whin se- 
venty-five feet high, near Springfield, which overhangs the road 
leading from Queensferry to Hopetoun House at the western ex- 
tremity of the parish. 

Zoology. — Under this head may be noticed a kind of sprat which 
appears occasionally in winter near Queensferry, resembling in its 
outline the young of the herring, and averaging five or five inches 
and a half in length. It is more generally known by the name of 
Garvey, probably from its place of rendezvous being in the im- 
mediate vicinity of the island so called. Dr Parnell states, in 
his Essay on the Fishes of the Forth, p. 163, that the sprat, 
which abounds on the coast of Essex and Kent, is found in the 
Frith throughout the year, frequenting the lower parts during 
summer, and ascending the estuary as the cold advances where, 
from the commingling of the fresh and salt water, the temperature 
is considerably higher. To a common observer, their migrations, 
except as to the time of their arrival, are extremely irregular, and 
their numbers vary so much, as in one season scarcely to repay the 
trouble of taking them, whilst in another they are caught in such 
shoals as to glut the Edinburgh and Glasgow markets and the in-

ter mediate towns and country, and afford a surplus, which has 
been several times used by our farmers as a cheap and rich manure. 
There are two salmon-fisheries of stake net, one at the junction of 
the parish with Abercorn, and the other near the ruin of Barn- 
bougie, in Dalmeny Park. They are taken, at the former especially, 
in considerable quantities, and sent chiefly to the Edinburgh mar- 
ket. They go up the Forth to spawn in September, and return 
in March and April.

II. — Civil HrsTORY.f ' 
Land-owners. — The sole proprietors are the Earl of Rosebery ; 
James Dundas, Esq. of Dundas ; James Joseph Hope Vere, 
Esq. of Craigiehall and Blackwood ; and the Earl of Hopetoun. 
The three former are resident in the parish, and the latter in the 
adjoining parish of Abercorn. Near the south-eastern extremity 
of the parish is Craigiehall, the seat of J. J. Hope Vere, Esq., 
beautifully imbedded in the vale of the Almond by the rising 
grounds, which are richly wooded on the south and north. The 
Almond or Amon, which in Gaelic signifies a meadow, enters the 
policy a little to the west of the house, and winding past its south- 
ern front, forms a cascade of six or seven feet perpendicular, 
whence it descends over a rocky bed, worn out into numberless 
fantastic cavities, beneath a rustic bridge, from which the effect is 
extremely picturesque and pleasing. This bridge, which was built 
by the grandfather of the present proprietor in 1757, consists of 
one arch, with a cord of 48 feet, so concealed by the ivy and wood 
that profusely cover it, as to give it the appearance of a perforated 
rock. Immediately above it, and overhanging the cataract, is a 
grotto, containing a saloon above and a bath below, which may be 
filled and emptied at pleasure by sluices from the river. There 
were formerly several statues on pedestals on a walk along the 
side of the river, from one of which, a Venus di Medici, a small 
island, formed by the division of the stream into two parts a little 
above Cramond bridge, obtained the name of Venus's Island. The 
original name of this place was Creagac/i, a Celtic word signifying 
a craggy ridge, and afterwards softened into Craigie. John de 
Oaigie was one of the witnesses to the original charter of Dundas 
of that Ilk in the time of King David I. One of them defended 
the Castle of Kildrummy for David II. against the followers of 
Edward Baliol. Margaret de Craigie, only daughter of another

'John de Craigie, who made a conspicuous figure about 1360, in- 
herited the baronies of Craigie and Blackwood in Lanarkshire, and 
married, in 1387, John Stewart, a younger son of Sir Robert Stew- 
art of Durrisdeer. Their posterity continued at Craigiehall for 
about 250 years, and ultimately sold it in 1643 to John Fairholm, 
treasurer of the city of Edinburgh. It appears from Calderwood's 
History fo. 515, that Henry Stewart of Craigiehall was chan- 
cellor of the jury summoned at Linlithgow in 1606, to try those 
Presbyterian ministers who had been indited on a charge of high- 
treason for having denied the King's authority in matters ecclesi- 
astical. Tradition says that, having been one of the majority who 
found them guilty, agreeably to some prophetic intimation, his 
family never afterwards prospered ; whilst that of Mr Hope, who 
defended them, and who was created a baronet by James VI., and 
held the office of King's Advocate, both under that monarch and 
Charles I., notwithstanding his known partiality to the Presbyte- 
rian cause, rose progressively to the affluence and importance since 
enjoyed by them. The descendants of the family of Stewart, who 
were also proprietors of Leuchold and Newhalls, have continued 
in the parish ever since, highly respected, but are now reduced to 
a single female representative, resident in Queensferry, with whom it 
is likely to become extinct. The present proprietor is the third in 
lineal descent from Charles, first Earl of Hopetoun, who acquired 
the estate in right of his lady, Henrietta, only surviving child of 
William, Marquis of Annandale, who had previously come into 
possession, also by marriage with the grand-daughter of the above- 
mentioned John Fairholm. The family assumed the name of 
Weir or Vere, on the marriage of the Honourable Charles Hope, 
second son of the foresaid Earl of Hopetoun, with the heiress of 
Blackwood in Lanarkshire, whose ancestors held that property by 
uninterrupted succession from the time of David I., by grant from 
the Abbey of Kelso. 

The extensive barony of Barnbougle and Dalmeny, belonging 
to the Earl of Rosebery, adjoins the lands of Craigiehall to the 
north. The spacious park of Dalmeny, in which stands the ruins 
of Barnbougle Castle, and the mansion, now the residence of the 
family, built by the present noble proprietor, comprehends the 
whole area bounded by the road from Cramond Bridge to New- 
halls on the south, and between the river Almond on the east, and 
the Frith of Forth on the north. The grounds which rise from the 
shore to a considerable elevation, in a constant succession of un- 



56 LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 

dulations, are tastefully ornamented with large masses of thriving 
plantation, so arranged as to afford a rich variety of landscape, 
and command numberless views of the Frith and surrounding 
country, which cannot be surpassed for extent or beauty. Barn- 
bougie', the ancient name of the castle and barony, was probably 
the scene of an hostile engagement, " Bar na-buai gall," in 
the Celtic signifying « the point of the victory of strangers," 
though no tradition now remains of any event of that nature 
to which it can be traced. The ancient family of Moubray 
were its first proprietors. They came originally from Normandy 
with William the Conqueror, and are supposed to be a branch of 
the noble house of Moubray, Dukes of Norfolk. Philip de Mou- 
bray was Lord of Barnbougle, Dalmeny, and Inverkeithing, in the 
reign of Alexander II., and died in 1221. From him descended 
Sir°John Moubray, who, having no male issue, made a settlement 
in 1511 of the lands of Cockairney, part of the lordship of Inver- 
keithing, on his father's brother, William Moubray, whose direct 
posterity still enjoy that patrimony. The remainder of his pro- 
perty he bequeathed to his only daughter, who, by marrying Ro- 
bert Barton of Over-Barnton, transmitted it under the family 
name to their great-grandson. Sir Robert Moubray, the last of 
that long line who inherited these extensive possessions. Several 
persons of the name of Moubray, in the humbler walks of life in 
the parish, are said to be descendants of this ancient family. 
The baronies of Barnbougle and Dalmeny were sold by Sir Ro- 
bert in 1615, to the celebrated Sir Thomas Hamilton, his Majes- 
ty's Advocate, afterwards created Earl of Haddington, whose 
grandson again disposed of them in 1662, to Sir Archiba d Pnm- 
rose, Bart., of Carrington, then Lord-Register, and afterwards 
Justice-General of Scotland. Sir Archibald entailed his estates 
on his second son Archibald Primrose of Dalmeny who, in 1/00 
was created Viscount, and in 1703, Earl of Rosebery and Lord 

. There is in Chambers's Journal, No. 4, February J 832 a cunous and i„

Dalmeny, whose descendant, the fourth Earl, is the present pro- 

''FamilT/ ofRosehery.—Oi the early history of the family whom 
this distincTuished nobleman now represents, there are some interest- 
ing notices in Crawford's and Douglas's Peerage. They were ori- 
ginally seated at Primrose, near Inverkei thing, and acquired lands 
in Perthshire and Culross. One of them was principal surgeon to 
Kingf James, who died in 1615, and was buried in the Greyfriars 
church-yard, " Plenus annorum et plenus honorum," as his monu- 
ment bears. He was father of Gilbert Primrose, D.D., who was cue 
. of the ministers of the Protestant church of Bordeaux, and after- 
wards of the French church in London— chaplain in ordinary to 
James VI. and Charles 1. ; and finally canon of Windsor in 1682. 
He left several publications that testified alike to his learning and 
piety. His son David Primrose had also the reputation of being one 
of the most learned divines and active promoters of the reformed 
rehgion in France. The most distinguished, however, of this ex- 
cellent family, direct ancestor of the Earls of Rosebery and the 
founder of their fortunes, was Archibald, the third in descent by a 
younger son of the first of the lineage above-mentioned. He was 
first appointed in 1641 clerk of the Privy-Council, and until dis- 
charged by the Parliament, was in constant confidential correspon- 
dence with the King and Court. Adhering faithfully to the royal 
cause, he was taken prisoner at the battle of Philiphaugh 1646, 
tried by the Parliament of St Andrews, and found guilty of high 
treason. Though his life was spared at the intercession of the 
Marquis of Argyle and others of his friends, he continued a close 
prisoner till a capitulation was entered into between Montrose and 
the Committee of Estates, when, on repaij-ing to Charles at New- 
ark, he had the honour of knighthood conferred on him in consi- 
deration of his great services and sufferings. King Charles H., 
on coming to Scotland in 1651, created him a baronet, " as a spe- 
cial mark of our Royal favour, to gratify the deservings of so faith- 
ful a servant." During the Usurpation, Sir Archibald lived in re- 
tirement, but on the king's restoration, he was in August 1660, 
appointed Lord-Register of Scotland, and in June 1661, consti- 
tuted one of the Senators of the College of Justice by the title of 
Lord Carringtou, and afterwards Lord Justice- General. Accord- 
ing to Bishop Burnett, " he possessed a great measure of sagacity 
and prudence, with expedients always ready for every_difficulty." 
Throughout the changes of that troublous period, he maintained

SO high a chanicter for integrity andwisdom, as to have exercised 
immense influence over the destinies of his country, whose welfare 
he had deeply at heart ; and having acquired an ample fortune, 
with which he purchased the extensive properties of Barnbougle, 
Dalmeny, Ochiltree, Carrington, &amp;c., he died on the 27th Sep- 
tember 1679, and was interred in a leaden coffin in the cemetery 
built by him, to the north front of the church of Dalmeny. The 
plate on the mouth of the catacomb in which his remains are de- 
posited, bears this inscription : " Hac in capsula in spe resurrec- 
tionis consignatur corpus Domini Archihaldi Primrose de Carring- 
ton militis baronetti sub augustissimo monarcha Carlo l""" Se-, 
Crete Concilii clerici," a resturato Carlo 20 Resrni ab Archivis,

The present Earl, to whose hereditary possessions have been 
added the estates of Livingstone and Rosebery, in West and Mi 
Lothian, was born at Barnbougle, 14th October 1783, and has two 
sons and three daughters, the eldest of whom, Lord Dalmeny, is 
M. P. for the Stirling burghs. His Lordship is Lord Lieutenant 
of the county of Linlithgow. 

Family of Dundas of Dundas. — The family of Dundas, who 
hold the portion of the remainder of the parish proper, a large 
and valuable demesne surrounding the elegant mansion, built by 
the present proprietor in conjunction with the old baronial castle, 
is by far the most ancient now extant of any in the parish. 
Huttred, the first of this remote ancestry, is said, on the authority 
of a charter from King David L to the Abbey of Melrose, to have 
been a son of Gospatrick, grandfather of Gospatrick, first Earl 
of Dunbar and March. This supposition is confirmed by the cir- 
cumstance of Helias, the son of Huttred, obtaining a charter of the 
lands of Dundas from his uncle, Waldevus, son of the first Gos- 
patrick. This charter, which is still in possession of the family, 
is one of the oldest original private writs in Scotland, and is in the 
following words: " Waldivus filius Gospatricii omnibus probis ho- 
minibus tarn futuris quam presentibus, salutem. Sciatis me de- 
dissie et concessisse et hac carta mea confirmasse Helio filio Hut- 
tred Dundas pro servitio dimidii militis, ilium et haeredes sues 
tenendum, de me ethseredibus meis, in feudo et haereditate in mo- 
ris, in aquis, in stagnis, in molendinis, in pratis, in pasturis, cum 
omnibus rectis et divisis et pertinentiis, concede itaque quia volo et

quiete tarn libere et tarn honorifice ut nullus miles de barone tenet

His testibus, Joanne filio Orm. Waldevofilio BaldwinRoberto de 
Sancto Michaele, Heiio de Hadestanden aWillielnio de Copland, 
Willielmo de Hellebes. Alano Dapifero, Gerardo Milite Joanne de 
Gragin." This charter, which has no date, must have been granted 
previous to 1 122, in which year, Robertus de Sancto Michaele, one 
of the witnesses, was made Bishop of St Andrews. The lands of 
Dundas continued in the direct male line for twelve generations, 
when James de Dundas died, without mal« issue, in 1450, and was 
succeeded by his brother, Sir Archibald, whose son and successor 
was several times sent on an embassy to England, and enjoyed the 
confidence of King James III. to such a degree, that he created 
him Earl of Forth in 1488 ; but the patent, though signed, not hav- 
ingpassed the King's seal, previous to the death of that unfortunate 
monarch, was held to be invalid. From this period, the property 
has again descended in the male hne direct through other twelve ge- 
nerations, some of them figuring conspicuously both in the civil and 
ecclesiastical history of the country, andgiving rise to the collateral 
branches of the families of that name, of Melville, Arniston, Dud- 
dingstone, and Carron-hall. The estate had nearly again diverged 
from this line of succession, on the death of the father of the present 
proprietor, who perished in command of the Winterton East India- 
man, on the coast of Madagascar, in August 1 792. His son, James 
Dundas, Esq. the present proprietor, who was born in January fol- 
lowing, having, by his wife Lady Mary Duncan, daughter of the 
Hero of Camperdown, a family of six sons and five daughters, 
bids fair to transmit this venerable name and inheritance to a late 
posterity. 

Eminent Men, — The only person eminent as an author known 
to have belonged to this parish, was William Wilkie, born at 
Echline in 1721. He was first minister of Ratho, and then Pro- 
fessor of Natural Philosophy in the University, where he died in 
1772. His principal work, the Epigoniad, has been much and 
justly admired, especially the Episode of Hercules. 

Auldcathy, the portion of the parish lying to the west, as for- 
merly described, appears to have been formerly part of the crown 
lands, but was along with the lands of Kinneil and Larbert, be- 
stowed by King Robert Bruce in 1324, upon Sir Walter Hamil- 
ton of Cadzow, ancestor of the Duke of Hamilton, and continued 
a long time in that noble family. After passing through the hands 



100 LINLITHGOWSHIKK. 



of various proprietors, it was sold by the first Earl of Haddington 
in 1721, to the Earl of Hopetoun, in whose family it now re-

Antiquities.— Among the antiquities of this parish, the ancient 
Castle of Dundas is entitled to a prominent place. It stands in 
conjunction with the modern mansion on the brow of a craggy hill 
of that name, which signifies, " the hill of fallow deer," and from 
which numerous bones of deer, and others of large dimensions 
have been dug up. Its precise age cannot now be ascertained, 
though it is supposed to have stood since the beginning of the 
eleventh century. Several additions were made to it about 1416, 
when it was turned into a fortalice by warrant from Robert, Duke 
of Albany, and by a subsequent one, from James I. in 1424. 
Its walls, which are very massive, were at that time raised to the 
height of 75 feet. Its apartments are all arched, and a circular 
sisdr leads to the top, which is flat, and surrounded by a battlement, 
from which the view is magnificent. Immediately under the north 
front of the present castle, there still stands a stone fountain of 
most curious workmanship, which originally occupied the centre of 
a parterre enclosed with walls of hewn stone 12 feet, and of vast 
thickness, with flights of stairs in the middle, and a banqueting 
house at each corner. This fountain, which was supplied by water 
brought in pipes from a distance, is ornamented with numerous 
figures cut in the stone, and bears on its sides a long inscription in 
rather doggrel Latin, divided into stanzas, setting forth that the 
purpose for which it was erected by Sir Walter Dundas, in the 
year of man's redemption 1623, and 61st of his age, was to 
perpetuate his own memory to be an ornament to his country 
and family,— a gratification to his friends, and a terror to spoilers 
and depredators, and that the parched garden might be moisten- 
ed with the water of the fountain. Tradition relates that the 
cause of this most expensive work was his disappointment at the 
loss of the barony of Barnbougle, for the purchase of which he 
had collected a large sum of money, when it fell into the hands 
-of the Earl of Haddington. The expense of it was so enormous, 
as to involve him in difficulties from which he never recovered. 
Whilst it was in the course of erection, it is said that he delighted 
so much in the noise of hewing the stones, that in a fit of sickness, 
which confined him to his bed, he ordered the masons to perform 
that operation in his anticha.nber. At the west end of Queens- 
ferry is the ancient monastery of the Carmehte fnars, built about 



DALMENY. 



101 



ISS by Sir George Dundas of Dundas. It consists of a square 
tower with two wings, the one of which is entire, and is now the 
burial-place of the family. The tower, which was the dwelling- 
place of the monks, bears the marks of fire. One of the brethren 
of this monastery was Symon de Cramond, son of the family ot 
Cramond of that Ilk, who, going abroad, rose to the dignity of pa- 
triarch of Antioch. Father Hay, in his " Scotia Sacra, men- 
tions that there was a monastery of the order of the Holy Trinity 
at Dalmeny in 1297, and another of the same order at Queens- 
ferry 

The small island of Inchgarvey, which signifies rough or rocky 
island, in the middle of the Frith, between the south and north 
ferries, is another of the ancient possessions of the family of Dun- 
das. It was granted to John Dundas in 1491 by King James IV. 
in lieu of his extensive property of Bothkenner, which had been 
forfeited by his adherence to James III., with power to build a 
fort upon it, of which he and his heirs were to be perpetual gover- 
nors, and with the right of levying certain duties on vessels pas- 
sing up the Frith. In the regency of Albany, during the mino- 
rity of James V., Inchgarvey seems to have been employed as 
a state prison, to which the celebrated Secretary Panter was com- 
mitted by that weak and tyrannical ruler. When Albany went to 
France in 1517, he left Inchgarvey, together with Dunbar and 
Dumbarton, garrisoned with French soldiers, at the charge, and to 
the great oppression, of the nation. It surrendered to Cromwell 
in 1651. The fortifications seem from that period to have been 
much neglected, till Paul Jones appeared in the Frith in 1779, 
when they were repaired and mounted with four twenty-pounders. 

During the late war, when an invasion was threatened from 
France, it was again repaired, and strengthened with some addi- 
tional pieces of ordnance, which, together with the batteries on 
shore sweeping the whole range of the Frith, was judged sufficient 
to protect the upper part of it from any hostile aggression. Among 
the antiquities of this parish, not the least remarkable is the pa- 
rish church, though its early history is unhappily lost in antiquity. 

From the style of its architecture, which is Anglo-Norman, 
and from its striking resemblance to the church of Narcoide, near 
Carlisle, which was built before the time of William the Conque-

ror, but which is greatly its inferior in point of embellishment, W0 
cannot err in referring it at the latest to the tenth or eleventh cen- 
turies. It is a very elegant small fabric, all of cut stone, 84 feet 
long and 25 broad, except at the east end, where it contracts inta 
a semicircle- The pediments of the principal doors and windows 
are richly carved, resting on single columns with Gothic capitals, 
and round the upper part of the building there is an embossment 
of carved faces, all dissimilar and of grotesque appearance. But 
the chief beauty of the church is in the interior, which has a strik- 
ing effect on entering from the west, especially from the upper 
part of the gallery. The body of the church is divided into three 
parts by two semicircular arches, that over the chancel being so 
much smaller than the other as to render the perspective peculi- 
arly pleasing. They are both richly ornamented with successive 
tiers of mouldings of a zigzag or starry shape. This structure 
was repaired and refitted in 1816, in a manner corresponding to 
its architectural beauty, though it is to be regretted that so fine 
and perfect a specimen of that peculiar style of building should be 
deformed externally by the addition of a modern cenketery for the 
family of Rosebery, and more recently of a private room belorvging 
to that of Dundas. It seems originally to have formed part of the 
diocese of St Andrews, and to have been granted during the thir- 
teenth century to the Abbey of Jedburgh, in the reign of William 
or Alexander II., to which it pertained till the annexation of the 
church lands to the Crown by James VI. in 1596. From the 
crown-charter conveying the rights of the lands and barony of 
Dalmeny, and the fortalice of Barnbougle, with the patronage or 
capallanise et altaris Sancti Adamani infra ecclesiam parochia- 
lem de Dummany," it would appear to have been dedicated to 
St Adaman, as the adjoining parish of Craroond was to St Co- 
lumba and the Virgin Mary, the right of presenting to all these 
altars, which were frequently separate endowments, being vested 
in the family of Moubray. At the door of the church there is a 
stone-coflfin of large dimensions, cut from a single block, and co- 
vered both on the lid and sides with hieroglyphics which cannot 
now be deciphered. It was found near to its present position, in 
ditfing a grave belonging to the Stewarts of Craigie, but nothing 
can be traced of its origin. Coffins of similar material, but of 
much simpler and ruder construction, have been found in other 
]arts of the parish, one of which is still to be seen with its end 
projecting from the bank formed by a cut through Craigiehill on 
the road leading to Kirkliston. It scarcely seems to admit of

doubt, that the great Roman military way, which proceeded from 
Northumberland by Eildon and Soutra to the Pentland hills, and 
thence by Ravelston to Cramond, which was evidently a maritime 
station on the Bodotria, and where numerous vestigia have been 
discovered, was continued by Barnbougle and Dalmeny through 
Abercorn to Carriden to the eastern extremity of the wall of An- 
toninus. Abouta mile, accordingly, to the west of Queensferry there 
were, about a century ago, remains to be seen of what was suppos- 
ed to be "a Roman Speculatorium, consisting of a large carved 
window, a square pillar, and a considerable quantity of hewn stones, 
which, it is said, were carried to Dunkirk. There were found 
here also several silver medals of Marcus Antoninus, with a vic- 
tory on the reverse ; also, the carved handle of a copper vessel, 
and the bottom of an earthen urn, with the word adjecti, the rest 
obliterated." At Springfield, a little to the westward of this 
spot, there was discovered recently, in digging near the house, a 
skeleton of large size, and a trench of considerable breadth and 
depth, filled with human bones. A brass pot, and in it a pagan 
idol, were exhumed near Queensferry, on the lands of Dundas, in 
1738, which the workmen, through a mistaken zeal, instantly de- 
molished. Not far from Dundas Castle, there was found also, at 
a considerable depth between the parallel walls discovered under 
ground, a Roman coin with the letters ian distinctly inscribed, 
the rest illegible, and the handle of a vessel supposed to have been 
a sympusium used by the Romans in their sacrifices. About a 
mile to the west of Barnbougle Castle, on the top of a high sea- 
bank, is an ancient cairn, called Earl Cairney, of a circular shape, 
originally 500 feet in circumference, and 24 feet in height, though 
now considerably dilapidated, which was probably a sepulchral mo- 
numenti 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the parochial regis- 
ters is 1628. They are considerably dilapidated, and sometimes 
irregular, till within the last century ; from which time, they have 
been kept with considerable accuracy. 

The patronage of the parish, which was derived in 1540 from 
the abbot and convent of Jedburgh, has belonged since that pe- 
riod to the barony of Barnbougle, and was vested in Sir Archibald 
Primrose and his heirs, by the charter conveying to him that pro- 
perty. Since the restoration of the right of patronage by the act 
of Queen Anne in 1712, it has been uniformly exercised, accord-

"glyj by the Earls of Rosebery, under protest from the Earl of 
Hopetoun, who clanned the right allernis vicibns, in virtue of his 
possession of the parsonage of Auldcathie, which had been unit- 
ed to the parish of Dalmeny in 1618, Lord Binning being then 
the patron of both. By a judguaent of the Court of Session in 
1835, the latter nobleman was found to be entitled to the alter- 
nate presentation. 

Ministers of the Parish. — The earliest incumbent in this parish 
of whom there is any authentic record, was John Gibbisone, minis- 
ter of Dalmeny, and parson and vicar of Auldcathie from 1610, 
where he is said to have succeeded George Lawder of Bass, who 
united the advantages of patron and parson. Mr Gibbisone seems 
to have died about 1648, and was succeeded by John Durie, who had 
been appointed by the presbytery colleague and successor to him in 
the then united parish. At his death in 1G56, Alexander Hamilton 
was ordained and admitted minister of Dalmeny by a call from the 
heritors and elders, the act of 1649 abolishing patronage being 
then in force. He was deprived for nonconformity in 1662, re- 
poned in 1669, and transported to Edinburgh at the Revolution, 
where he died in 1696, and was buried in Cramond. Charles Gor- 
don, minister of a Presbyterian congregation in Campvere, in Hol- 
land, was appointed his successor in September 1691, in virtue 
also of a call from the heritors and elders, in terms of the act 1690. 
He was removed to Ashkirk in the same year, and died in 1710. 
From the date of his translation to 1700, the parish seems to have 
remained vacant, the rents of the ministers glebe being gifted by 
the Earl of Rosebery as patron, for the benefit of the poor, and 
two silver communion cups, bearing the family arms, presented by 
him for the use of the parish, and now its property, furth of apart 
of the vacant stipends yet undisposed of." Between 1700 and 
1711, John Steedman held the cure. The last appointment pre- 
vious to the Act 1712, was that of James Nasmyth, who was in- 
ducted in 1711, and died at Dalmeny in 1774, in the ninety-first 
year of his age. Dr Robertson, who was a person of some learn- 
ing, and furnished the previous Statistical Account of the parish, 
was settled in 1775, and died at Edinburgh, 15th November 
1799. In the following year, James Greig, the late minister, was 
appointed, and continued till his death in 1829, when the present 
incumbent was translated from Torphicheii. 

HI. — Population. 
The population of the united parishes was in 1891, 1-291, be- 



DALMENY. 



105 



ina a decrease of 204 from that of 1821. It is almost entirely 
aaricultural, with the exception of about fifty families m the town 
of Queensferry, part of which belongs to Dalraeny, and at New- 
halls,— who are engaged in fishing and various domestic trades. 
Amount of population in 1 84 1, 1393. 

IV. — Industry. 
Most of the farm-houses, and several of the office-houses, are 
slated • the former generally substantial and commodious, and in 
some instances elegant. The farms comprise from 80 to upwards 
of 300 acres ; some of them cultivated with a degree of skill and 
enterprise highly creditable. 

The four rotation system is that commonly in use j but, of late 
years, the grazing of cattle and the better breeds of sheep have 
thrown a much larger portion into pasture than formerly,— a prac- 
tice which is found not only to yield a better immediate return 
than a constant succession of white and green crops, but greatly 
to improve the land, and render it more productive. The parish 
is now almost universally drained according to the improved mode 
of placing the drains in every alternate furrow, at the distance of 
thirty-six feet apart, the tenant paying, besides the carriages, a 
per centage during his lease, on the outlay of the landlord. The 
soil of the higher grounds, which is chiefly clay on a cold bottom, 
bordering in some places on till, passes in its descent to the lower 
grounds into the richest loam. One field, in particular, known by 
the name of the Kirk Park, is so exceedingly fertile, as to have 
acquired the distinction of " perpetual soil." The minister's gar- 
den, which is of the same quality, and immediately adjoins it, is 
said to have produced abundant crops of potatoes and other ve- 
getables, for six or seven years successively, without manure. 

The number of acres in the parish is about 5850 imperial,, 
of which about 1000 belong to the estate of Craigiehall, 2600 
to that of Dalmeny, 1600 to that of Dundas, and 650 to that 
of Hopetoun. This last portion is chiefly in the disjoined part, 
called Auldcathy, of which the Earl of Hopetoun is the sole 
proprietor. The portion of it actually under the plough, which 
may be stated at 4000 acres imperial, is let on leases of nineteer 
years, at a rent of from L.l, 5s. to L.3, averaging L.2, 3s. 6d., 
payable for the most part in money and grain. The pasture, 
which may amount to 1000 acres, about 700 of which are within 
the grounds of Dalmeny Park, is let annually at from L. 2 to 
L.2, 10s. per imperial acre. There are under wood about 850

LINLTTHGOWSHIRE. 



acres, including that on the extensive poHcies of the respective 
proprietors, and the double hedge-rows of trees that line most of 
the parish roads, and subdivide several of the farms, adding much 
to the richness and beauty of the landscape, though perhaps not to 
its productiveness. The wood consists principally of oak, ash, elm, 
plane, and beech and fir, of about eighty years' growth ; though 
some of it, which is of large dimensions and of the finest quality, 
may have stood upwards of two centuries. 

The gross rental of the portions of the parish under cultivation 
may be estimated at L.8700, and in pasture at L.2230. The 
valued rent is L.9598, IDs. lOd. Scots, thus allocated: —

The produce may average three quarters wheat, five quarters 
barley, and six quarters oats ; a large proportion of the land on 
each farm being regularly under turnip'crop, which is partly eat off 
by sheep, and partly used for feeding cattle. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villages. — There are no villages of any extent within the parish, 
the greater part of the population, not purely agricultural, or at- 
tached to the establishments of the large proprietors being resident 
in the two ends of the town of Queensferry amounting to nearly 
400. 

The small village of Dalmeny, which is delightfully situated 
nearly in the centre of the parish, on the road leading westward 
to Dundas, and commanding a view of the Frith of Forth, consists 
only of about a dozen of cottages, besides the church, manse, and 
and school-house, with a green in the middle. 

Roads, Sfc. — The parish roads are generally excellent; the 
Great North Road from Edinburgh, unequalled perhaps in Bri- 
tain for its width and condition, entering it at Cramond Bridge, 
an elegant structure erected at great expense over the Almond, 
in the year 1821. It terminates at Newhalls, where there is a good 
and commodious inn. From this place the steam-passage-boats 
sail to North Queensferry every hour between sunrise and sunset, 
returning from the opposite side at each intermediate half-hour. 
The fares, which are generally considered high, are, for each 
passenger, 6d. ; for a horse, Is. ; a two-wheeled carriage, 2s. 6d. ; 
a four-wheeled do. 7s. 6d. ; and for cattle, 6d. a-head ; and for 



DALMENY. 107 

sheep, 2s. per score. They are let by public roup at present for 
three years, at a rent of L. 1900,— a sum which has been gradually 
increasing, notwithstanding the general establishment of steam 
conveyance to Dundee and Aberdeen, but which will probably 
suffer a diminution, should the plan now projecting, of building a 
deep water pier at Burntisland, in conjunction with that lately 
erected at Granton, and communicating with a railway north- 
Wards, be carried into effect. At present, the North Mail, the 
Defiance to Aberdeen, the Coburg to Perth, and the Antiquary 
to Dunfermline and Crieff, from' Edinburgh, cross and recross 
daily. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is conveniently situated for 
the parish proper, and is seated for about 350 persons. There 
is also a Dissenting meeting-house in the west end of the town of 
Queensferry, in connection with the United Associate Synod, 
which draws its supplies to the amount of about 500, from five 
adjacent parishes. Of these there are between twenty and thirty 
families belonging to the parish of Dalmeny. The rest are, or 
profess to be, in communion with the Church. The number of 
actual communicants is in summer about 250, and in winter some- 
what less. The attendance may be termed good, though the 
church is considerably too small for the amount of the population. 

The stipend, which was allocated in 1823, consists of 17 chal- 
ders victual, half barley and half oatmeal, at the Linlithgow fiars 
prices, with L.8, 6s. 8d. Sterling for communion elements. Ori- 
ginally, the teinds of the parish, as given up at a judicial court of 
the abbey of Jedburgh in 1626 were 20 chalders victual, whereof 
were to be paid to the minister two chalders and 400 merks. 

Education. — There is a Sabbath school taught in the church, 
during the summer months by the clergyman, while a number of 
the people attend as hearers ; and another at Cramond Bridge 
throughout the whole year, supported by the Christian liberality of 
a lady not immediately connected with the parish, — and taught by 
one or other of the agents of the Edinburgh Gratis Sabbath School. 
Society. 

The parochial school, which is the only one in the parish, is 
well attended. It has long been celebrated as a healthful and de- 
sirable place for boarders, of whom the present schoolmaster still 
receives a limited number. The salary is the maximum of L.34j 
4s. 8|d., with L.300 Sterling mortified by Lcidy Grizell Semple 
in 1723. This sum is vested at the instance of the Earl of Rose- 
bery and the minister for the time being, as trustees for behoof o4' 



108 LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 

the school, and the annual interest paid to the schoolmaster on 
condition of his teaching gratuitously as many poor children as the 
trustees or kirk-session may choose to send. Lord Rosebery is also 
in terms of this grant entitled to present to the office when it be- 
comes vacant. The fees are 2s. 6d. for reading, 5s. for other 
branches, and 7s. 6d. for Latin, Greek, French, and mathematics. 
The school-house and dwelling-house are commodious and com- 
fortable. The manse and offices are in good repair ; the latter 
neatly built for the present incumbent  the former nearly a cen- 
tury old, of plain construction and moderate dimensions. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The two ends of Queensferry, a&amp; 
may be supposed, contain almost all the pauperism of the parish, 
which, from the causes above-mentioned, is in large proportion to 
the amount of the population. The average number of paupers 
on the parish roll receiving supply regularly or occasionally is 35. 
In the summer months, several of them are cut off, and the annual 
expenditure for this department is L.90 Sterling. The funds are 
derived from collections at the church- door, amounting to from 
L.20 to L.30 yearly ; rent of land held in perpetual lease by the 
Earl of Rosebery to a similar amount, according to the fiars' price 
of oatmeal ; a sum of L.135, lent on bond ; and a voluntary as- 
sessment by the heritors for what may be short of the sum requir- 
ed for the poor and other parochial expenses. Besides this regu- 
lar provision for the poor, those of them who live in the suburbs 
of the parish of Queensferry are entitled to a share of the annual 
produce of a large bequest of L.5000 by a Mr Meek, a native of 
that place, who left it for the common behoof of both parishes, un- 
der the management of the kirk-session of the latter. There is also 
the interest of a sum of L.200 Sterling, bequeathed by James Da- 
vidson Esq. son of a former schoolmaster of Dalmeny, not inter- 
mixed'in any way with the parochial funds, but distributed at the 
instance of trustees named in his deed of settlement. To these 
benefactions, the Earl of Rosebery adds yearly the liberal sum 
of L20, to be laid out in the purchase chiefly of coals and meal 
during the winter, with an unlimited discretion to the minister of 
expending, at his Lordship's charge, whatever more may be needful, 
to provide for unforeseen contingencies,-an example which reflects 
the highest credit on the benevolence of that distinguished noble- 
man, Ind which, if generally followed throughout the country 
would greatly enhapce the comforts, and elevate the character of 
the deserving poor.

liSBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEE 

THE REV. JOHN SMITH, MINISTER. 



Topography and Natural History. 

]ame. The name of this parish, so far back as can be traced, 

'has been written Ecclesmachan. It is usually pronounced Inch- 
machan, a custom, apparently, of considerable antiquity ; for in a 
list of parishes existing in 1581, and contained in ' the Booke of 
the Universal Kn-k," it stands Inchmachame. Of this name, va- 
rious Celtic etymologies have been proposed, but none of them 
appear satisfactory. The most probable is that assigned in the 
former Statistical Report, viz. Ecclesia Machani, or, in Gaelic, 
Eaglais Machan, " the Church of Machan." In Keith's Calen- 
dar of Scots Saints is mentioned a St Machan, who, it is said, 
died about the middle of the ninth century. What connection he 
had with this part of the country, it is presumed, cannot now be 
ascertained. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is divided into two un- 
equal portions, distant about one mile from each other, and se- 
parated by an outlying district of Linlithgow parish. The west- 
ern division is about 2 miles long, and broad; the eastern 
division is If miles long, by 1 broad; and the extreme points 
are nearly 5 miles from each other. The extent in square miles 
is 3.83, or 2458 imperial acres. The outline is very irregular. 
It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Abercorn and Lin- 
lithgow ; on the west, by Bathgate ; on the south, by Livingstone 
and Uphall ; and, on the east, by Kirkliston and Auldcathie, a 
detached portion of Dalmeny parish. 

Topographical Appearances. — The two sections are each com- 
posed of a ridge of land. That on the west is the higher, as- 
cending, perhaps, to the height of 600 feet, intersected in several 
places by shallow ravines, and sloping chietly to the south. The 
eastern ridge is lower, having on its southern edge a pretty steep 



110 



LINLITHGOWSIIIIIR. 



acclivity, called the Tar Hill, or perhaps the Tor Hill. The 
climate in the upper district is cold ; but in general it is salubrious, 
and, so far as has been observed, is not marked by any epidemical 
peculiarities. Several small streams, tributaries of the Almond, 
flow eastward through the parish. 

Geology. — The district is on the edge of the great Lothian 
coal-field, and it appears that coal was formerly worked in various 
places on the north. Sandstone occurs on most of the farms. 
The most prominent rocks are of trap, which seem to have dis- 
turbed greatly the strata in this neighbourhood. In the vicinity 
of these are found immense beds of indurated clay, interspersed 
occasionally with seams of clay-ironstone. The upper soil, which 
is chiefly formed from decomposed trap and indurated clay, is 
heavy, and highly retentive of moisture. From the trap rocks of 
the Tar Hill issues a spring, weakly impregnated with sulphuretted 
hydrogen. It is called the Bullion Well, and, though formerly 
visited by invalids, is now neglected. 

From the uniform nature of the soil, and the extent of tillage, 
the vegetation of this parish, though repeatedly examined, has 
been found to exhibit nothing peculiar. On the western heights, 
some of the subalpine mosses, such as Trichostomum canescens, 
and T. heterosiichum, occur. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — Mr Alexander Hamilton, the first minister of 
this parish after the Revolution, was a man of distinguished talent 
and courage. It is said, that when a student, he took down the 
head of the celebrated James Guthrie from the Netherbow Port 
of Edinburgh, where it had stood a public spectacle for many 
years; and numerous stories are still current among the old people 
here about his skill as a swordsman, before he became a minister. 
He was translated first to Airth, and subsequently to Stirling, and 
was deeply involved in the " Marrow Controversy." 

The estate of Bangour gave designation to William Hamilton, 
Esq. a celebrated Scottish poet, in the early part of the last cen- 
turv. He was descended from one of the ancient families of the 
name of Hamilton, once numerous in the county of Linlithgow ; 
but whether he was born in this parish, or indeed resided in it, 
the writer has not ascertained. In his youth he distinguished 
himself by numerous songs, and among these, " the Braes of 
Yarrow," published in the " Tea Table Miscellany." He is said 



ECCLESMACIIAN. 



Ill 



to have been a man of elegant accomplishments, and of amiable 
manners. His poems are thus characterized by no mean judge, 
the late Lord Woodhouselee : " Hamilton's mind is pictured in 
his verses. They are the easy and careless effusions of an elegant 
fancy and a chastened taste ; and the sentiments they convey are 
the genuine feelings of a tender and susceptible heart, which per- 
petually owned the dominion of some favourite mistress, but whose 
passion generally evaporated in song, and made no serious or per- 
manent impression." Having entertained Jacobite predilections, 
he was engaged in the Rebellion in 1745; but, after a few years 
of exile, contrived to make his peace with the Government, and 
returned home. In 1754, he died at Lyons, in the fiftieth year 
of his age, leaving behind him, besides some unpublished pieces, 
a volume of poetry, which has been repeatedly inserted in collec- 
tions of the British Poets. His patrimonial estate is now in the 
possession of his great grandson, James Hamilton, Esq. of Ban- 
gour and Ninewar, in East Lothian. 

The late incumbent of this parish, the Rev. Henry Listen, de- 
serves to be noticed among its few eminent men. He had a strono" 
natural turn for mechanics and music. He was equally distin- 
guished for his scientific and classical attainments, and was in 
many other respects a man of genius. With talents adapted for 
a far wider sphere of usefulness, he spent his whole ministerial 
life of more than forty-two years in this secluded spot, endeared 
to his numerous friends by great warmth of heart and simplicity 
of character. His son is now a celebrated surgeon in London. 

Parochial Registers. — These exist in nearly unbroken sequence 
from 1662. The oldest, which is written in a fair hand, is en- 
titled " Episcopall Discipline exercised by the Kirk-Session of 
Ecclesmachan." On the 28th of March 168.3, it is minuted, 
" Mr John Moubray, according to the appointment of the pres- 
bytery, preached, and thereafter gave institution to Mr William 
Smairt to the ministry in this place, and the rest of the brethren 
off the presbytery gave the said Mr William the right hand off 
fellowship." The only other noticeable peculiarity is a commis- 
sion from the Bishop of Edinburgh, in exercise of the civil power 
now vested in presbyteries, to certain ministers, authorizing them 
to visit and report on the manse and kirk of Ecclesmachan. The 
registers, subsequent to the Revolution, are kept in the usual 
form, and contain nothing remarkable.

III. —Population. 
The population has probably diminished during the course of 
the last century, chiefly on account of the union of small farms, 
and the decay of the villages. There is now scarcely an individual 
in the parish who is not directly or indirectly employed in agri- 
culture. The following table will show the variations at the se- 
veral dates. We cannot account for the smallness of the number 
in 1792.

The last amount was partially increased by an influx of railway 
labourers. A private census in 1839, which ascertained only 263 
inhabitants, gave the following results : Persons under fifteen years 
of age, 103; between fifteen and thirty, 76; between thirty and 
fifty, 55; between fifty and seventy, 19; above seventy, 10. The 
number of unmarried men above fifty, 6; number of unmarried 
women and widows above forty-five, 10. There are 51 fami- 
lies. The average number of children in families where there 
are any, is 3. The number of inhabited houses is 50 ; uninha- 
bited, 4. For the last three years, the average number of births 
is seven annually; of deaths, two; of marriages, one. In these 
•three years have been born three illegitimate children. 

Forty-ofle families and 220 individuals belong to the Established 
Church ; ten families and 43 individuals are attached to the Dis- 
senters. Of these are eleven farmers, three blacksmiths, two car- 
penters, one mason, one tailor, two weavers, and ten day labourers. 
The rest of the males, and many of the females, are employed in 
agriculture. For many years past, there has not been a public- 
house in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The whole parish has been enclosed mostly by 
bedge and ditch, and only a few acres in it have never been sub- 
jected to the plough. The whole surface employed in tillage and 
pasture, little of which is permanent, may be estimated at 2310 



ECCLESMACHAN.

imperial acres. On many of the farms, the most improved sys- 
tem of husbandry has been introduced ; much, however, remains 
to be done in the way of draining. In the western district of the 
parish, where, on account of the elevation, wheat is seldom or 
never grown, the usual rotation of crop is the following : oats 
green crop or fallow; barley or oats; hay ; pasture for one or 
two years. In the lower district, on heavy land, the crops are 
usually arranged thus : fallow, wheat, beans, barley, hay or pas- 
ture, oats ; and, on the drier soils, thus, oats, turnip, barley, 
hay or pasture. In general, the tenant is restricted only to the 
extent that he is not permitted to take two green crops in succes- 
sion without manuring each of them. Throughout the whole of 
this country, there is an inclination to diminish the green crop, 
and to return to the old fallow system. 

With the exception of two or three, the farms are all under 
1 50 imperial acres. They are all let on leases of nineteen years. 
The maximum rent is about L.2 the Scotch acre, and the mini- 
mum, L.l, 5s. The average rent is about L.l, 10s. the Scotch 
acre. On the Earl of Hopetoun's property, the rent is paid 
chiefly by the value of grain, ascertained from the annual fiars of 
Linlithgowshire. The gross average rental of the parish is about 
L.2845. It may be worth while to add, that the annual value of 
real property, as assessed by Government in 1815, was L.305I. 

Live-Stock. — The rearing of cattle is not pursued to any great 
extent ; but a few short-horned bulls have been introduced, and 
between them and the Ayrshire breed, a valuable cross has been 
obtained, which is likely to be cultivated with success. Most of 
the grass is depastured, and the green crop consumed by Highland 
or Angus-shire o\en, purchased at the northern fairs, or by black - 
faced sheep procured from the same quarter. 

Produce. — The following may be taken as an estimate of the 
gross value of products from land in ordinary years : 

Grain, , . . L.5225 

Green crop, including beans, 1100 

Hay, . . . .765 

Pasture, . . . g70 

L.7960 

Plantations. — There are about 130 imperial acres of growing 
wood. It is mostly young, and little or none of it has ever been 
brought to the market. A considerable part of it was planted by 
the late Robert Warden, Esq., who thereby greatly improved and 
adorned his estate of Blackcraig. Shelter is still wanted in som6 
quarters of the parish.

LINLITHGOWSIIIUE. 



V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villages. — There is scarcely a village in the parish, the hamlet 
at the church containing only eighteen houses. 

Post-Office. — The nearest post-office is at Uphall, which is dis- 
tant little more than a mile. 

Market- Towns. — The markets frequented by the farmers are 
those of Linlithgow and Bathgate, which are about five miles re- 
spectively from the centres of the two districts of the parish. 

Means of Communication.— road from Edinburgh to Fal- 
kirk passes through the northern extremity for about half a mile, 
and the middle Glasgow road nearly touches the southern border. 
The parish roads are kept in excellent repair. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\iQ parish church is situate in the south- 
ern corner of the smallest section of the parish ; but in the most 
convenient position possible for the generality of the inhabitants. 
It was in a great measure rebuilt in the beginning of last century, 
and having undergone a thorough repair in 1822, it is at present 
in excellent order, and is neat and comfortable. It is provided 
with 153 sittings, which might easily be increased, if required, to 
about 200. It'is about four miles by the road from the most dis- 
tant house. Considering the smallness of the population, the at- 
tendance is generally good. The manse is supposed to have been 
built about 1606 ; but an addition was made in 1800 ; and though 
the accommodation is not extensive, it is, on the whole, sufficiently 
comfortable. The glebe and garden contain about four and a-half 
Scotch acres of good ground. The stipend consists of .58 bolls, 
3 firlots, 3 lippies of oatmeal ; 58 bolls, 3 firlots, 3 lippies of bar- 
ley ; and L.146, lis. of money. In the Report of the Religious 
Instruction Commissioners, it is valued at L.256, lis. 8d., from 
an average of five years previous to 1836. The same report va- 
lued the unexhausted teind at L.140, lis. Id. 

Education.— parish school and school-house, recently re- 
built, are in good order. The teacher has the maximum salary; 
but the fees are small, and sometimes not well paid. The average 
attendance may be about 50 scholars, who are instructed in read, 
ing, writing, and arithmetic. On the extreme border of the pa- 
rish, where it meets those of Uphall and Livingstone, a school 
was' erected by the late Robert Warden, Esq., to whom the pa- 
rochial institutions were, in many respects, beholden. Though 
highly useful in the locality, its attendance has fluctuated much ; 
and it would be greatly benefited by an endowment. In summer,

it is used as a jjreaching station in the Sabbath evenings. Every 
person in the parish, of suitable age, is able to read. It is not 
ascertained that they can all write. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — At present there are three paupers 
on the roll ; viz. an aged woman, who receives 5s. a month, an il- 
legitimate child, and a lunatic confined in a private asylum. The 
heritors support the latter by private assessment. A few re 
ceive occasional assistance. The ordinary collections amount to 
about L.ll, and there is, besides, the sum of L.2, 12s. per annum, 
the interest of bonded money. Hitherto, there has been no legal 
assessment ; but, it is feared, that one may at length become ne- 
cessary, from the demand of aliment for illegitimate children, to 
which this parish, owing to the shifting habit of its youthful po- 
pulation, and other unfavourable circumstances, is much exposec}-

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALE, 

THE REV. JAMES M. ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 
THE REV. JOHN LAING, Assistant and Successor. 

\, — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, c. — The length of the parish is between 4 and 5 miles 
from west to east, and it is nearly 1 mile in breadth at each end, 
but contracts in the middle to about half a mile. It contains 
4463 Scotch acres. It is bounded on the north-west by Bath 
gate and Ecclesmachan ; on the east, by Uphall and Mid-Calder ; 
on the south-east, by Mid-Calder; south, by West Calder, from 
which two parishes it is separated by the Ammon and the Briech 
waters ; and, on the west, by Whitburn. 

Topographical Appearances, — The surface of the parish, though 
much varied, does not rise into any very distinct eminence, except 
one in the north-east corner, in the lands of Knightsridge, called 
Dechmont Law, or Knightsridge Hill. Though only 686 feet 
above the level of the sea, it commands a very extensive prospect. 
The climate, though rather moist, is favourable to health. 

The Ammon which rises in the upper parts of Lanarkshire, 



116 



I-INLITIIGOWSIIIIIE. 



and after a circuitous and somewhat rapid course in a north-easter- 
ly direction, falls into the Frith of Forth at the village of Cramond, 
is, in this parish, except for the purposes of mills, a very insignifi- 
cant stream in general, but when flooded, rises so as to be almost 
magnificent, and increases in breadth to the great injury of its 
banks. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The Briech water has in its course 
gradually made several deep sections of the circumjacent strata. 
These are of the coal formation, such as clays, slate- clays, &amp;c. 
In the bed of the river quantities of boulders appear. The most 
striking natural feature of the parish is the eminence commonly 
called Dechmont Law, which, with the surrounding ridges, of 
which it is the apex, are of the trap-rock formation. The green- 
stone of the summit is succeeded by compact basalt lower down, 
and at the foot of the eastern side, fine blue shale appears. Coal 
and limestone abound at its eastern side, and thus, from its close 
connection with strata of the coal formation, it bears a striking ana- 
logy to the larger trap formation of Arthur's Seat, &amp;c. 

"a lake-stone rock, in the western part of the parish, is supposed 
to be fifty feet thick, dips one in every three feet to the north- 
west, and rises to the south-east. The lime, coal, and sandstone 
near it dip with equal rapidity, and in the same direction as the 
lake-stone. Sandstone is to be found in various directions, and 
from twelve to twenty feet thick. 

Lime, coal, and whinstone abound over almost all the parish, 
but hitherto they have not been very successfully worked. 

Boton/.— Dechmont Law is in summer beautifully adorned with 
the yellow mountain-violet {Viola lutea, and white saxifrage {Saxi- 
fraqa granulata. In a wood west from Livingstone village, the 
elegant lesser winter-green {Pyrola minor occurs. On the banks of 
a small stream half a mile above it, the great leopard's bane {Do- 
ronicum Pardalianches is met with ; and in the woods to the north, 
Hahenaria bifoUa, Listera ovata, and Hypericum lursutum are 
frequently seen. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men.— Patrick Murray, Baron of Livingstone, well de- 
serves to have his memory recorded. Living about the middle of 
the seventeenth century, this young nobleman, in possession of an 
am«le fortune, turned his attention to the study of natural history, 
and not contented with forming at his own country-seat a botanic 
aarden consisting of one thousand species of plants, a great col- 



LIVINGSTONE. 



117 



lection in tliose infant days of the science, he traversed foreign 
countries with a view to increase it. Having gone over the whole 
of France, he was, on his way to Italy, cut off by a fever, much 
to the prejudice of natural history in Scotland, and deeply 
regretted by those friends who could estimate the worth of charac- 
ter displayed by a youth, who, in the uncontrolled possession of an 
abundant fortune, could steadily devote himself to a praiseworthy 
pursuit. 

Patrick Murray had been the friend and pupil of Sir Andrew 
Balfour, who, after his death, had his plants transported to Edin- 
burgh, where, joining them to his own, Sir Andrew laid the foun- 
dation of the first botanic garden in that city. 

Land-owners. — These are, the Earl of Rosebery; John Pit- 
cairn, Esq., Nether Dechmont ; William Wilson, Esq., Dech- 
mont ; Alexander Gray, Esq., Knightsridge ; Misses Burd, Sea- 
field ; William Erskine, Esq., Blackburn House ; Robert For- 
syth, Esq., Redhouse ; Thomas Balfour, Esq., Murrayfield ; Heirs 
of William Baird, Westwood ; Heirs of the Rev. Mr Kennedy, 
Briech. 

Parochial Registers. — Parochial registers were begun in 1696, 
and have been regularly kept since, but, owing to the smallness of 
the parish, are not voluminous. 

Antiquities. — The house, or, as it was anciently called, the peel 
of Livingstone, was a fortified castle surrounded by a wet ditch 
about thirty feet wide, having a rampart of earth within ; more than 
three-fourths of this ditch and rampart remained entire till nearly 
the middle of last century. The more modern house of Living- 
stone was pulled down by the present proprietor, the Earl of Rose- 
bery, soon after his purchasing the principal part of the barony. 
About half a mile north-east of its site is the farm-house of New- 
Year Field : here, within these sixty years, stood the remains of 
a square tower, said to have been ahunting-seat of the Kings of 
Scotland, and frequented by them while Linlithgow was their 
stated residence, not only for amusement, but for the benevolent 
exercise of their prerogative of touching for the scrofula, for which 
disease the water of a spring-well adjoining was considered a spe- 
cific, when applied by a royal hand upon the morning of New 
Year's Day before sunrise. As no cures are recorded, may not 
we conjecture that the real benefit was inducing both monarch and 
subjects to practise early rising and morning ablutions, though as- 



18 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



suredly the substituting midsummer for tlie New- Year would seem 
to be an improvement on the plan. 

A field, called Maukes Hill, which, being intersected by the 
Ammon, is partly in that and partly in Mid-Calder parish, is con- 
sidered as a battle-field of long past years, but, as the tumuli con- 
taining stone-coffins, skeletons, and all that gives verisimilitude to 
the conjecture, have mostly been found in the part belonging to 
Mid-Calder, the elucidation of this somewhat obscure matter be- 
longs more properly to the account of that parish. 

III. — Population. 

The former Statistical Account gives the population in 1755 to 

be 598. The state of the population afterwards is as follows : 

1801, - 551 

1811, - 879 

1831, - 1035 

1841, - 1004 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— The whole of the parish is cultivated or in pas- 
ture, except about 500 acres. There are not 200 acres of moss 
which may yet be drained and planted. From 250 to 300 acres 
are under wood, viz. spruce, larch, and Scotch fir, with a few hard- 
wood trees intermixed. Great attention is paid to the manage- 
ment of the plantations, particularly upon Lord Rosebery's estates, 
where likewise they are most extensive, and where the yearly thin- 
nings are found very profitable. 

Rent— The rent of land is believed to be about L.l, 4s. per 

acre. 

The Ayrshire and Teeswater milch cows are commonly kept, 
often crossed with other breeds. The general character of the 
husbandry is a regular rotation of white and green crops, and then 
the land is laid down for pasture. Nineteen years is the dura- 
tion of the common lease. 

Quarries and Mines— There are lime, whinstone, and sand- 
stone quarries. The lake-stone quarry, on the property of James 
Scales, Esq. in the vicinity of Blackburn village, which has been 
wrought for many years, is much famed for supplying excellent 
floors for ovens. It has hitherto given employment to six men m 
hewing and quarrying, and is sent to all parts of the country for 
nearly thirty miles round. Quarry now given up for encroachmg 
on the public road. The limestone on the same property is six 
feet thick, and lies upon a bed of slaty sandstone, called by the 
workmen « blaes," four feet thick above the coal, which is like-

119 



wise fonr feet in thickness ; but the working of the coal and lime- 
stone have been given up for a number of years, the dip being so 
great as to make it unproductive. 

Manufactures.— There is a cotton spinning-mill at Blackburn, 
which employs about 120 men, women, and children above ten 
years of age. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 

There is no market-town in the parish. The nearest is Mid- 
Calder, at the distance of two miles. There are two villages, Li- 
vingstone in the east, and Blackburn in the west of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated on the border of 
Mid-Calder, about half a-mile from the eastern extremity of Li- 
vingstone parish. It is very inconveniently situate for at least 
three-fourths of the population. The church was rebuilt in 1732, 
and is in very tolerable repair. It affords accommodation for about 
300 people. The only free sittings are at the communion-table, 
which remains standing along the length of the church. 

The manse was built in 1803, at the accession of the present 
incumbent, and, being substantially built, has since received only 
trifling repairs. The glebe consists of six acres of land, valued at 
L.3 per acre. The amount of stipend, as allocated by the Teind 
Court, is 10 bolls bear, and 23 bolls meal, and L. 188, 5s. ld. ; 
but, owing to some part of the teind being claimed by Whitburn, 
formerly a part of this parish, the stipend is not fully paid. 

There is a Dissenting chapel in the village of Blackburn, be- 
longing to the Independent persuasion. The minister is paid from 
the seat-rents and collections at the door. It is but thinly attend- 
ed, and is believed to have only 11 joined members. 

Three hundred and fourteen males, and 322 females, are con- 
sidered as belonging to the Established Church. The number 
regularly attending is too fluctuating to be exactly ascertained. 

One hundred and eighty-nine males, and 180 females, belong 
to the United Secession ; 4 males, and 5 females, to the Church 
of England ; 9 males, and 12 females, to the Church of Rome. 
160 is the average number of communicants in the parish church. 

Education. — Number of schools, 2 ; 1 parochial and 1 unendow- 
ed. The parochial teacher has the maximum salary, with the legal 
accommodations of dwelling-house, school-house, and garden. 

A Sabbath school and parish library was set on foot in the vil- 
lage of Livingstone four years ago. It consists of nearly 300 well 
seTected volumes, and is supported by subscription, and much 
prized by the population. 



120 



LINLITIIGOWSIIIUE. 



Friendly Society.— h Friendly Society was established in Black- 
burn in the year 1799, which has been of much benefit to its 
■members, whose numbers are 30 at present, and their stock amounts 
to L. 125 Sterling. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are 27 persons on the roll 
of poor. The average weekly allowance is Is. 6d. 

Inns. — There are five public-houses in the parish, and three 
small shops in which spirits are retailed. 

Fuel. — The fuel in general use is from Benhar coal-work, about • 
four miles from the western extremity of the parish. The coal is 
of first-rate quality, and costs 5s. 6d. per ton on the hill.

rRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. KENNETH MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 

L— Topography and Natural History. 
BoRRowsTowNNESs has become the prevailing name of the unit- 
ed parishes of Kinneil and Borrowstownness, although Kinneil was 
the original parish, and the other existed as a separate parish, only 
twenty years. 

Name and Situation. — The town of Borrowstownness, commonly 
pronounced and written Bo'ness, owes its name to its locality, be- 
ing situated on a point of land, or ness projecting into the Frith 
of Forth, and about three-quarters of a mile north from the village 
of Borrowstown, formerly Burwardstoun. 

Extent, Boundaries cc. — The parish is of a triangular form, 
extending about four miles from east to west, the medium breadth 
from north to south being about two miles. The superficial ex- 
tent is about 4| square miles. It is bounded on the north by the 
Frith of Forth ; on the east by the parish of Carriden ; on the 
south and west by the parish of Linlithgow, and by the river Avon, 
which separates it from the parishes of Muiravonside and Polmont. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish is un- 
even, excepting the Carse of Kinneil. The highest part is in the 
south-east angle, which rises to an elevation of about 520 feet 
above the Frith. From this eminence, called Irongath Hill, or 



BORUOWSTOWNNESS. 



121 



Glour o'er 'em, the surface slopes gradually to the banks of the 
Avon, on the south and west. On the north the slope terminates 
abruptly in a steep bank, which extends the whole length of the 
parish, varying in elevation and in its distance from the shore, and 
is beautifully wooded from Kinneil House to the Avon. From 
the top of Glour o'er 'em, the admirer of nature may enjoy one of 
the finest views in Scotland. 

Meteorology. — The climate, though variable, is remarkably sa- 
lubrious. 

Hydrography. — The Frith of Forth is about two miles and a- 
half broad between Bo'ness and Culross, and about three miles 
broad between the mouth of the Avon and Culross. In the middle 
of the channel between these places, the depth is from five to nine 
fathoms. Between Bo'ness and Preston Island, the depth is about 
four fathoms and a-half, and gradually increases to seventeen and 
upwards towards Queensferry. Above Bo'ness the depth of mid- 
channel diminishes to three fathoms towards Grangemouth. Pres- 
ton Island lies near the north shore ; and the south side of the 
channel being free from rocks, the navigation is safe, and the an- 
chorage is good off the Port of Bo'ness. Between Bo'ness and 
Grangemouth the Frith is shallow, and, at ebb-tide, the water re- 
cedes to a considerable distance from the shore, leaving a great 
extent of muddy surface, through which the stream of the Avon 
passes in a channel which is variable. There is a rise of not less 
than 25 feet of water in the middle of the Frith at high spring 
tides. At Bo'ness it is full and changes about three o'clock ; and 
it is high water nearly eight minutes later than at Leith. 

The influence of the river Avon, and other tributaries, on the 
water of the Frith, is perceptible in the production of salt, as might 
be expected from the diminution of specific gravity. 

Specific gravity of surface water, taken from the middle of the 
Frith, off Bo'ness, after a long continuation of rain : 

High water, specific gravity, 1.0206, at 374° Fahrenheit. 
Low water, specific gravity, 1.0190, at 57° Fahrenheit. 

Specific gravity of surface water after a long duration of fair 
weather : 

High water, specific gravity, 1.02329, at 56° Fahrenheit. 
Low water, specific gravity, 1.02234, at 56° Fahrenheit. 

The river Avon, which forms the western boundary of the pa- 
rish, and has its sources in the high parts of the parishes of Fal- 
kirk and Slamannan, is a considerable stream, having a copious 
supply of water, and a considerable fall between Linlithgow Bridge 
and its discharge into the Frith. Several mills have been erected 



122 



LINLITHGOWSHIIIF. 



on its banks, but three only are in operation at present in the pa- 
rish, and belong to the Duke of Hamilton. Two of these are 
grain-mills ; the third was erected for grinding malt for the brewers 
in Bo'ness, but is employed at present for grinding flint for the 
pottery. 

The Dean or Den Burn, and the Gil Burn, two streamlets 
running in ravines near Kinneil House, add to the beauty of the 
scenery, but are too small for any mechanical advantage. 

The number of coal-pits sunk in the neighbourhood has ren- 
dered the supply of water in the town scanty ; but there are se- 
veral good springs in the landward part of the parish. One of 
these, at a small distance from the town, affords a copious supply 
of excellent water, part of which is conveyed to the town in pipes. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— strata in this parish are all of 
the coal formation. They lie with considerable regularity, and 
in general dip to the west, at the rate of from one in six, to one 
in ten. There is no appearance of trap dikes passing through the 
seams of coal, except at the south-east corner of the parish, where 
Irongath Hill, or Glour o'er 'em, appears protruded through them. 
There is a great quantity of apparently trap rock lying in beds in 
the strata ; and though there is a considerable number of dikes or 
slips in the. strata, almost all running nearly east and west, these 
slips seldom alter the quality of the coal. 

A general section of the strata at the Snab, a site lately 
spoken of as the best for a new winning of the coal-field the pre- 
sent being considerably exhausted, may be stated as follows :—

No coal has ever been found in this district under the Caursay 
coal • and as these lowest correspond closely with the lowest seams 
in the Fife strata, it may be safely inferred, that there are no 
workable seams below this one. It is remarkable, however, that 
the limestone, which, on the Fife side, makes its appearance about 
35 fathoms under the lowest seam, does not appear m Camden, 
where these lowest seams crop out to the surface. 

Above the strata mentioned in the section, to the west of the 
Snab takes on one or two inferior seams of coal, which were par- 
tially wrought in former times, when the duty was on the salt, for 
the salt-pans. And further to the westward at Craiginbuck, 
takes on a seam of limestome, which at one time was wrought, af- 
fording an excellent building mortar. This seam appears to be 
the same as that on the opposite side of the Forth, at Blair House, 
which was wrought three years ago. 

Some fine specimens of petrifaction have been found in a bed 
of sandstone, on the east bank of the Avon, near Inneravon. 

A remarkable bed of shells has long been known to exist in the 
bank near Inneravon. By recent excavations in various parts of 
the bank, between Inneravon and Kinneil House, the bed of shells 
appears to be, continuous between these two places. It consists 
chiefly of oyster shells. A species of muscle shell is seen in some 
places ; and in one place, part of the mass is petrified. 

Large trees have been found deeply imbedded in the mud in 
the Carse ; and horns and bones of deer and other animals have 
been found, about twelve feet below the surface, in the excava- 
tions for the bridge lately built across the Avon. 

Botany. — Bo'ness parish, although of limited extent, exhibits 
rather a numerous Flora, including a large proportion of the whole 
plants of Linlithgowshire, some of which appear to be confined 
within its limits. 

On taking a general view of the botany of the county, there is 
not perhaps much, excluding the Cryptogamia, which has not been 
found in the rich neighbouring district of Edinburgh ; while many 
of the more interesting plants of the coast disappear westward, 
and those of the higher range of the Pentlands are not met with 
on the less elevated hills of Linlithgowshire. Partaking, however, 
of the same advantage of situation upon the Frith of Forth an 
arm of the sea, it may be observed, which, besides being remark- 
able for the many rare plants found on its shores, would seem, 
by its influence upon the climate and scenery, to enrich the

LINLITHGOWSHIRK. 



botany of the whole valley of Forth ; possessing also the Im- 
portant requisite of every variety of soil, this county is far from 
being- deficient in a botanical point of view. If the observation be 
directed to that part of it which comprehends the parish of Bo'ness, 
although promising in its general features, it would scarcely be ex- 
pected, on a more particular inspection, to be the best locality for 
plants. The maritime species, which, as said before, gradually di- 
minish in numbers as the shore of the Frith is traced upwards,' will 
be seen, on reaching this, to have almost entirely disappeared, 
owing to the great accumulation of mud, and perhaps, also, the 
diminished saltness of the water. Besides this, there is no ground 
sufficiently elevated for producing the plants of high situations. 
The Flora of the parish is thus so far wanting in variety. There 
are, however, certain favourable circumstances which account for 
the large number of plants, on the whole, to be met with. The 
scenery is finely diversified with woods and plantations, which shel- 
ter in abundance their peculiar species. The river Avon, also, 
forming the boundary on the west, appears to have brought down 
the rarer plants which are found in ascending its higher course. 
The deep rocky dens at Tod's mill accordingly abound with such, 
and Scirpus sylvatims, Melica nutans, Chrysosplenium alternifolium, 
Eupatorium cannahinum, Trollivs europceus; and plants by no means 
commonly met with may there be gathered in abundance, if the 
romantic beauty of the scene, as the river winds amidst its steep 
and wooded banks, may allow the eye to rest upon the humbler 
vegetation around. The flowering fern, Osmunda regalis, is also 
seen in this spot, but does not extend higher up ; although frequent 
enough on the west coast, it appears in Scotland to shun the 
sharper breezes of the east ; and the station just mentioned is 
probably the nearest to Edinburgh. Tortula rigida, a small spe- 
cies of moss, which is chiefly confined to the south of England, 
also grows abundantly by the river side at Inneravon. The pre- 
sence of these two plants, especially the fern, seems to indicate a 
certain approach to a western climate, or is owing to the highly 
sheltered situation. The flowering fern becomes more frequent 
in Stirlingshire. 

Among the few maritime plants within the bounds may be 
mentioned Scirpus maritimus, and Aster tripolium, which are seen 
in the summer months plentifully covering the brackish marshes 
below Kinneil. The aster is not a rare plant, and is mentioned 
chiefly because it was found in the same place by Sibbald nearly

one hundred and eighty years ago; and what is more deserving of no- 
tice, as connected with the gradual changes which take place in es- 
tuaries, he also observed growing on the shore, Thalictrum mmus, 
and Arundo arenaria, a strictly maritime plant, and so well known 
to bind the loose sand of the sea shore ; neither of which are now 
to be seen ; a circumstance of some importance, as it confirms the 
supposition derived from other observations, that there has been a 
great increase of the sleeches since Sibbald's time, and in some 
spots even a change from a comparatively sandy to a muddy beach. 
On seai-ching the shore eastward, the same plants do not begin to 
appear for several miles, until the shore changes its character. 

The natural copse wood of Kinneil, the only one in the county, 
affords, as might be expected, some rather peculiar plants, among 
which may be reckoned Betonica officinalis, very rare in this part 
of Scotland, and Hahenaria albida, for which it is a singular sta- 
tion, that being a plant of hilly pastures. It is chiefly in this wood 
that the additions to the Scottish Cryptogamia were found, and 
which will be afterwards specified. Geranium phcBum, Listera Ni- 
dus-Avis, Arum maculatum, are a few of the rarer flowering plants 
to be met with in the woods. In regard to the comparative pre- 
valence of natural orders, the Graminise are the most numerous 
in species, the Orchidise somewhat deficient. The common reed 
fills the ditches and wet places of the carse lands. Poa aquatica, 
and Festuca elatior, grasses of highly nutritive properties, are 
abundant by the side of the Avon. 

Of the Cryptogamia, the Musci are not uninteresting. Hyp' 
num murale and Tortula revoluta are frequent in old stone walls 
about Kinneil. Tetraphis Browniana and Jungermannia furcata 
occur in fruit; the latter very rare in the Dean plantation. Di- 
cranum Jiexuosum covers the entire bank at Tod's Mill in abun- 
dant fructification. Hypnum piliferum is common, but not in 
fruit, although it may be obtained in that state about Hopetoun 
woods, in the parish of Abercorn. 

Of the Lichenes and Algse, there is nothing particular to be 
said. The marine are very scarce, from the nature of the beach. 

The Fungi now remain to be noticed, which, as they have not 
been so extensively investigated in Scotland, as other plants, may, 
on that account, be expected to afford greater novelties. The 
agarics are particularly numerous. In this parish two localities 
for these may be distinguished as abounding in kinds of generally 
different forms and qualities. In the rich old pastures of Kinneil 



126

those of fragile and delicate appearance often dissolving in decay 
may be looked for, while the surrounding woods and plantations har- 
bour the larger species, which are usually acrid or tufted. Among the 
latter, Agaricus Piperatus, Volemum, Flexuosus, Vellereus, Adustus, 
although not generally common, are abundant under Kinneil copse. 
Of the former A. Sowei'bei, a curious species, may be mentioned 
as growing on the bank by the shore. The following list of Fungi 
of different genera, gathered in the woods immediately around Kin- 
neil, are allowed to be additions to the Scottish flora ; the first nine 
are likewise quite new to Britain. The names are chiefly those 
of Fries and Berkeley. 

Several species, apparently undescribed, were met with ; but, as 
they have notyet been sufficiently examined, it is not judged proper 
to publish them in this place. Although Fungi are obscure plants, 
and little regarded, the subjoined list may be useful as a guide to 
those who attend to such things in other parts of the country, be- 
sides appearing necessary to complete this botanical view.

As the various species of fungi are more generally distributed in 
temperate regions, to which they are chiefly confined, than plants 
of higher rank, owing, perhaps, to their greater simplicity of struc- 
ture, it is very probable that all of the above might be found 
throughout Britain wherever those circumstances chiefly required 
for the production of the order, shade, and moisture exist. The 
fungi of the continent, indeed, are in a great many cases iden- 
tical with those of this country. To this law of comparatively ge- 
neral distribution, there are, however, exceptions, and some of the 
species appear to be very local, their diffusion depending upon 
causes which are not understood. There is also a peculiarity con- 

• Mr lames C Baucliop, who communicated this article on botany, submitted 
specimen's of nearly all the Fungi to the Rev. Mr Berkeley, the best authority on 
the sulycct in this country, who confirmed or determined the names of the species.

iiected with the stations of fungi : while some species are equally 
constant to these as the higher tribes of plants, there are others 
very uncertain in this respect, disappearing for a succession of sea- 
sons together, seemingly without any relation to the more obvious 
influence of moist weather. The causes of this would appear to 
be obscure as the plants themselves, but the fact probably points 
to a field of investigation in some measure peculiar to them, al- 
though, in regard to the more general views of botanical geogra- 
phy, they may have less claim upon the attention.

Ornithology. — The only bird at all rare is the fauvette [Sylvia 
hortensis. It seems to be as common some seasons about Kin- 
neil as the black-cap, and is probably generally so throughout 
Scotland, although overlooked from its similarity to others. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Records. — The parochial records consist of, \sty five 
volumes of minutes of session, regularly kept from 1694, and af- 
fording interesting information regarding the state of morality and 
religion in the parish in former times ; 2rf, six volumes of registers 
of births, baptisms, proclamations, and marriages ; the oldest vo- 
lumes are imperfect ; the earliest entry is dated 1648; two 
volumes recording deaths, the first from 1736 to 1783, the se- 
cond from 1808 to the present time ; Ath, several volumes relating 
to the management of the poor's funds. 

Antiquities. — The Wall of Antoninus, commonly called Gra- 
ham's Dyke, traversed this parish. This celebrated rampart, in 
its course between the Friths of Forth and Clyde, crossed the 
river Avon, the western boundary of the parish, near Inneravon, 
and proceeded in an easterly direction towards Carriden or Aber- 
corn ; and its tract is still visible at various places along the hio-h 



128 



LINLITIIGOWSHIUE. 



grounds of the parish. Traces of the military road on the south 
side of the rampart have been recently discovered near Inneravon, 
and also in two different fields east from Kinneil House. It is ge- 
nerally supposed that a station existed at Inneravon, and proba- 
bly there was another at Kinneil. The wall was constructed, not 
by one, but by several individuals, at different periods ; and they 
seem to have terminated the work at different places. Hence 
has arisen some diversity of opinion regarding the site of the place 
whose name Bede and Nennius have so particularly recorded, and 
near to which, according to them, was the eastern termination of 
the rampart. The notices of ancient historians, and the researches 
of modern times, point to one or the other of two localities, viz. 
to Kinneil in this parish, and to Weltoun in the parish of Carri- 
den, as the place referred to by Bede and Nennius. Perhaps the 
name or names mentioned by these authors refer to both places, 
and not to one of them exclusively. Cenail,§ which Nennius 
mentions as Scottish, i. e. Celtic, indicating an earlier period, 
may refer to Kinneil, || where the earliest termination of the wall 
is generally supposed to have been ; and Penguaul, Penfahel, and 

" The situation of Kinneil, commanding so extensive a view of the Frith of Forth, 
was most suitable for a watch-tower, and especially for one terminating the line of 
forts erected between Forth and Clyde by Agricola. The wall afterwards construct- 
ed by Lollius Urbicus might advantageously have terminated at this watch-tower ; 
and the situation being one of importance, and probably much frequented, a village 
might spring up in its vicinity at an early period. And though afterwards, on dif. 
ferent occasions, additional forts or towers were erected, and the wall was repaired, 
and extended farther east, yet the village in the vicinity of the original termination of 
the rampart would retain its name, even though another station might be erected near 
the more recent termination, and a name of similar import given to it. A village 
near the eastern termination of the wall of Severus was called Wallsend. 

f The termination of the wall, according to Gildas, was near Carriden, about two 
miles west from Abercorn ; — according to Bede, about two miles west from Aber- 
corn, at a place called Penfahel or Peneltun ; — according to Nennius, at a place cal- 
led Penguaul, or Peneltun, or Cenail ; — and, according to Fordun, near Carriden. 
It was the opinion of Sibbald, one of the earliest antiquarians who considered this sub. 
ject, that Penvahel or Peneltun of Bede was the very same as Walltown or Weltoun 
near Carriden. Yet more recent and abler antiquarians have considered Cenail, Pen- 
vahel, and Peneltun of the more ancient authors the same as Kinneil. 

J Regarding Nennius, Ritson remarks, " He had already confounded the wall of 
the real Severus with that of Antoninus, and now confounds another Severus with 
somebody else." Perhaps in this instance he has confounded two names which, though 
of similar import, refer to two different localities. 

§ Cenail is evidenly Celtic, and may be derived from Cean, " head" or " end," and 
fal, " sod," " turf," " wall," or " fence" — the possessive case of which isfliail, having 
fh perfectly quiescent. Cenail may thus signify " end of the turf wall" or " wall- 
end." Penguaul or Penvahel is Cambro-British, signifying " wall-head" or " wall- 
end ;" and Peneltun has the same signification, with the addition of the Saxon ter- 
mination " tun " 

II Cenail, mentioned only by Nennius, who does not specify distance nor incnfion 
Carriden or Abercorn, corresponds with Kinneil, at least in pronunciation ; whilst, 
in respect of both pronunciation and distance, Penvahel and Peneltun of Bede cor- 
respond better with Weltoun in Carriden than with Kinneil. 



BORIIOWSTOWNNESS,

Peneltun, Cambro- British, and Saxon, indicating a later period, 
may refer to Weltoun, which is farther east than Kinneil, and 
which, probably, is not far from the place to which the wall was 
finally extended. 

Near the farm-steading of Upper Kinneil, and a little south of 
the Roman wall, there was a snaall tumulus or cairn, locally known 
by the name of the Laughing Hill. On its being opened to ob- 
tain stones for drains, four stone-coffins and four urns were found. 
The coffins contained black mould ; and the urns, which were 
full of human bones, were inverted and placed upon flat stones. 
Probably the bodies were burned, and, after the calcined bones 
were collected and put into the urns, the remaining ashes were 
put into the coffins. The bones, when first discovered, were al- 
most white ; but, when exposed to the air, they very soon became 
black, and crumbled to dust. Several pieces of charcoal were 
found amongst them. 

A stone coffin and an urn, similar to those already mentioned, 
were found in the north side of an eminence called Bell's Knowt 
immediately above the town of Bo'ness. 

A curious battle axe, coins, and other antiquities, have been 
found in different parts of the parish. One of the coins last found 
is a large silver piece of James VI. 

Near Inneravon, there is an old tower, with traces of consider- 
able ruins connected with it. Sibbald calls it a Roman watch- 
tower; but it has not the aspect of a Roman tower. In the 
Auchinleck Chronicle of James II., it is mentioned, that, in the 
beginning of March 1455, " James II. kest down the Castell of 
Inveravyne, and sine incontinent passed till Glasgow," on an ex- 
pedition against Douglasdale, &amp;c. The old ruin at Inveravon is 
most probably one of the corner towers of the Castle of Innera- 
von, built on the site of the Roman station. 

Below Kinneil House, upon the coast, there was formerly a cas- 

• It is not surprising that Penguaul, Penfahel, and Peneltun should ultimately be- 
come Weltun or Weltoun, through the prevailing influence of the Saxon language. 
The omission of the initial syllable is not without example. Edinburgh was, and 
still is, Dun-Eiden in Celtic ; Incuningham is now Cunningham ; Linlithgow is oc- 
casionally written Lithgow, even in important documents. Tiie interchange of ffti 
le, and /in pronunciation, may be traced, even to this day, in different parts of Scot- 
land. Weltoun seems to have been a locality of some notoriety nearly 200 years be- 
fore Sibbald wrote his Account of Linlithgowshire. Alexander Hamilton m le 
tirange, had a charter, under the great fcal, of the lands of Weltoun in Linlithgow- 
shire, of date 8th February 1524. Two important requisites of a Roman station ex- 
ist ut Weltoun, viz. an eminence, and a good supply of water. These might liave 
rendered it an eligible site for a station, although the wall, probably, did not termi- 
nate al that place, but in its vicinity, and nearer to the Frith.

tie, named Castle Lyon. It was built by a lady of the house of 
Glamis, and was probably the jointure house of Lady Margaret 
Lyon, daughter of Lord Glamis, and widow of John, first Mar- 
quis of Hamilton. A path leading from the high ground towards 
the shore, still called the Castle Loan, and some remains of a wall, 
called the Castle garden wall, indicate that the site of Castle Lyon 
was near the Snab. 

Kinneil House. — Kinneil House, one of the family seats of the 
Duke of Hamilton, is the most remarkable building in the parish. 
The barony of Kinneil is one of the most ancient possessions of 
the house of Hamilton, and is associated with some interesting 
events in the history of that noble family. 

According to " Ffrier Mark Hamiltonis Historie," King Ro- 
bert the Bruce gave all the lands of Kinneil to Sir Gilbert Ha- 
milton, " for his trew service and grejt manheid," and especially 
for having slain " the greit Lieutennant of Ynglaiid upon Kyn- 
nale Muir." From the same authority we learn, that this Sir 
Gilbert had been with The Bruce in the field of Bannockburn, 
and was one of the seven knights that kept the King's person. 
For Sir Gilbert's exploit upon Kynnale Muir, " King Robert 
gaif till him his armis till weir in Scotland, thre sinkfuilzies 
in ane bludy feild." The descendants of Sir Gilbert have 
held the lands and barony of Kinneil by various charters from 
the kings of Scotland. One of the earliest is dated July 28th 
13-23, granted by Robert L, in favour of Walter, the son of Gil- 
bert. A charter of the lands and barony of Kinneil was granted 
to James, the first Lord Hamilton, who, in 1474, married the 
Countess of Arran, which event connected the house of Hamilton 
with the royal family of Scotland. 

When the Duke of Charterherault was Regent, he made large 
repairs upon Kinneil House. Considerable alterations were made 
upon it by Duchess Anne and Duke William, who, according to 
Sibbald, greatly embellished it. Probably, at this period, the old 
castle or keep was modernized in the front, but not in good taste. 
The battlement was converted into a cornice and balusters ; the 

" Id a place formerly known as Kinneil Muir, a remarkable stone lay near the 
road which used to be a thoroughfare between Linlithgow and Falkirk, or Stirling. 
It was seven feet long, five feet broad, and three feet thick. Its upper surface had 
been roughly dressed, a groove had been cut round the border, and a cross in the cen- 
tre It had a monumental appearance ; but there is no vestige of tradition regard- 
ine it Excepting theachievement of Sir Gilbert, there is no remarkable event associat. 
ed with the locality. About twenty years ago, the stone, being an obstrucUon to the 
plough, was blown to pieces and removed.

\vIndows were enlarged, and a staircase was erected at each end. 
A wing projecting eastward was erected on the north ; and, appa- 
rently, a corresponding wing was intended to have been placed on 
the south, so as to form three sides of a square. 

Kinneil House is built on the edge of a bank, about sixty feet 
above the level of the sea, and is surrounded with a considerable 
quantity of natural wood. The approach is from the east, along 
a beautiful avenue of aged trees. From the roof of the main build- 
ino-, which is flat, and covered with lead, there is an extensive and 
beautiful prospect. The admirable situation of Kinneil House, 
and the natural beauties connected with it, warrant Sibbald's mag- 
nificent description of this ' princely seat." But the hand of time 
has changed the scene ; the natural beauties of the place remain, 
but those of art, which Sibbald so much admired, have been ef- 
faced, and the internal decorations are gone. The numerous and 
spacious apartments of Kinneil House are at present uninhabited. 
Though in former times it was the abode of nobles, and the re- 
treat of kings, the present generation will regard it rather as the 
favourite residence of the philosopher and philanthropist. The 
celebrated Dugald Stewart resided here about twenty years ; and 
from this place he has dated most of those works which are the 
imperishable monuments of his genius. The removal of Mrs and 
Miss Stewart, who were the last occupants of Kinneil House, was 
much regretted by every inhabitant of the parish ; and the active 
and extensive benevolence of that family will be long and grate- 
fully remembered. 

Celebrated Characters. — Other names besides Professor Stew- 
art's may be mentioned, as connected with both Kinneil and the 
University of Edinburgh. Principal Wishart was the son of the 
last minister of Kinneil ; and Principal Baird, whose name will ever 
be associated with the cause of education in the Highlands and 
Islands of Scotland, was a native of this parish. 

A considerable number of clergymen might be mentioned as 
connected with this parish by birth or residence. One family has 
produced four clergymen of the Church of Scotland, all of dis- 
tinguished excellence, though perhaps the editor of the last edi- 
tion of Wodrow's Church History is best known to fame, 

The celebrated James Watt matured some of his improvements 
01 the steam-engine, during his residence at Kinneil House. In 
1769, Mr Watt, on the recommendation of Dr Black of Glasgow, 
entered into an engagement with Dr Eoebuck, of Carron Iron-

works, a man equally eminent for kindness of heart, ability, and 
enterprise. Dr Roebuck at this time rented the coal-works on the 
estate of Kinneil. Under the superintendence of Mr Watt, a 
small steam-engine was constructed at Kinneil House. The cy- 
linder was made of block tin, and was eighteen inches diameter. 
The first experiment was made at one of the coal-mines, and the 
action of the engine far surpassed even the sanguine expectations 
of the proprietors. Indeed, so great was Watt's success, that he 
procured a -patent " for saving steam and fuel in fire-engines." 
Another place, however, was destined to be the field of his pros- 
perous career. The pecuniary difficulties in which Dr Roebuck 
became at this time involved, checked the proceedings at Kinneil ; 
and soon afterwards, Mr Watt formed a connection with Mr 
Boulton, under the celebrated firm, Boulton, Watt, and Co. Soho, 
Birmingham. 

The building at Kinneil in which Watt constructed the im- 
proved engine still remains. 

There are several circumstances connected with this parish, and 
referring to the troublous times before the Revolution, which are 
worthy of being noticed. Many of them are recorded by Wodrow. 

Mr William Wishart, the last minister of the parish of Kinneil, 
was amongst the earliest victims of the persecution which com- 
menced in 1660. In the month of July he officiated at Kinneil, 
and in September following, he was imprisoned in Edinburgh. 
On an application from the presbytery of Linlithgow in 1661, he 
was freed from confinement; but in 1675 letters of intercommun- 
ing were issued against him. He continued in prison till 1685, 
when a sentence of banishment was pronounced against him ; but, 
owing to the death of the King, this sentence was not carried into 
effect, and he was liberated under bond to compear when called. 
He was residing at Leith in 1691. He had three sons who attain- 
ed to great distinction, Sir George Wishart of Clifton Hall, 
Rear- Admiral Wishart, and Principal Wishart of the University 
of Edinburgh. The admiral, having no children, left his fortune, 
amounting to L.16,000 or L.20,000, to the Principal. 

Mr John Wauch was the first minister of the parish of Bo'ness. 
He, too, sufi'ered in the persecution, having been denounced m 
1673. He probably retired to Ireland, as did some of the other 
members of the presbytery of Linlithgow. 

During Episcopacy, the induction of Mr James Hamdton m

1678, and also that of Mr William Thomson in 1685, are noted 
in the parish record. 

On November 30th 1687, the brethren of the presbytery of 
Linlithgow met at Bo'ness, " and having called upon the name of 
God, they did constitute themselves in a presbytery." This was 
probably the first of the regular meetings of the presbytery after 
the liberty. And on December 7th they met again at Bo'ness, " in 
order to the settling of Mr Michael Potter to be minister unto the 
Presbyterian congregation of the Ness." 

This Mr Potter had been subjected to the most rigorous per- 
secution. In 1673, he passed his trials before some Presbyterian 
ministers, and soon after was privately ordained upon a call from 
a great body of Presbyterians in the parish of St Ninians. At 
the instigation of the Bishop of Dunblane, a violent persecution 
was raised against him, which compelled him twice to retire to 
Holland. He was at last apprehended in his own house in Bo'ness 
in 1681, and imprisoned in Edinburgh, and afterwards sent to the 
Bass. In 1685, his confinement in the Bass was altered into an 
act of banishment. But circumstances preventing his going once 
more to Holland, he remained in secrecy till the liberty in 1687, 
when he was settled in Bo'ness. In 1693, he was called to Ec- 
clesmachan, and afterwards to Dunblane, where he died. His son 
was minister of Kippen, and afterwards Professor of Divinity in the 
University of Glasgow. 

Mr Robert Hamilton, afterwards Sir Robert, son of Sir Tho- 
mas Hamilton of Preston and Fingalton, who was very promi- 
nent and zealous in the cause of the Covenanters, resided at Bo'- 
ness for some time previous to his death, which took place in 1701. 

The following names are recorded amongst the worthies who 
experienced the violence of persecution. Belonging to Kinneil, 
Mr Robert Hamilton, son of the Chamberlain of Kinneil, regard- 
ing whom there are still some traditional recollections, was impri- 
soned and tortured, and Andrew Murdoch was banished. Be- 
longing to Bo'ness, Archibald Stewart, William Gougar, William 
Cuthill, and the intrepid and devoted Marion Harvey, were exe- 
cuted. 

John Gib, a sailor in Bo'ness, was the leader of that remarkable 
sect of fanatics who appeared a short time before the Revolution, 
and assumed the name of " Sweet Singers," but were generally 
called Gibbites.

high estimation in this place. He was born in 1686, and died in 
1758. He was a man of singular humility, benevolence, and 
piety, spending much of his time in divine meditations, which he 
was in the habit of committing to writing, " to keep his heart from 
wandering, and fixt it upon divine and spiritual subjects." A 
small selection from these meditations was published after his 
death, and ibrms a composition remarkable for the regularity of 
its structure, and for the simplicity, spirituality, and fervour of its 
devotional sentiments. 

Illr — Population. 
Kinneil was a considerable town long before any population had 
collected at the Ness. In the year 1661, there were 559 "com- 
municable" persons in the parish of Kinneil, the greater part of 
whom resided in the town of Kinneil. Probably the increase of 
trade at the Ness, and other causes, withdrew the population from 
the town of Kinneil ; so that in 1691, it was almost wholly demo- 
lished ; a few families only remained. But the great improve- 
ments in agriculture, since the middle of the eighteenth century, 
have in some measure restored the population of the barony, al- 
though the town of Kinneil has wholly disappeared. 

In 1753, the population of the parish was 2668

The town of Bo'ness, notwithstanding its unpromising external 

appearance, is remarkable for the healthiness and longevity of the 

inhabitants. By a table, constructed with much care from the 

register of deaths for a period of twenty- five years immediately 

preceding 1834, it appears that the number of deaths was 1342; 

that during that time, 167 persons died between 60 and 70 years 

of age; 227, between 70 and 80; 119, between 80 and 90; and 

] 1, upwards of 90. , 

• The following notices refer to the commotions in 1743, Instructions and war- 
rants were sent on different occasions, through the Custom- House here, to the She- 
riff of Linlithgow, the Magistrates of South Queensferry, and " the baillie of this 
town," regarding suspected persons and ships. 

The Custom- Mouse was robbed by the rebels, who carried off a number of broad- 
sword blades, cutlasses, &amp;c. which formed part of a shipment from Germany, made 
by an armourer in Glasgow, on a Treasury warrant. 

A troop of dragoons, brougiit to protect Kinneil House, accidentally set fire to 
some of the seats which remained in the old church of Kinneil. Kinneil House 
had, on former occasions, been exposed to violence. In December 1339, during 
popular commotions, it was pillaged, and in February following it was burned ; and 
again it was burned, in 1370, by some of the English army who had invaded Scot- 
land.

The inhabitants of Bo'ness are in general shrewd, intelligent, 
d enterprizing ; and, as many of them are early trained to the 
sea, natives of the parish may be found in the most distant parts 
of the world. The farmers on the barony of Kinneil are a most 
respectable and exemplary part of the community. The general 
character of the colliers has improved much of late years. 

IV. — Industry. 
The Duke of Hamilton is proprietor and superior of the whole 
parish, with the exception of a farm of 169 imperial acres, morti- 
fied for behoof of the minister. 

Agriculture.— Excepting the natural wood near Kinneil House, 
the wooded banks of the Avon, and various strips of planting in- 
tersecting the parish for ornament or shelter, the whole surface is 
arable. The average rental may be stated as follows : 

430 acres of carse land, at L.3, 3s. per acre, . L.1354 10 0 
2230 acres of dry field, at L.l, 16s. do. . . 4014 0 0 

270 acres under plantation at 12s. do. . 162 0 0 



2930 Total, I'.3330 10 0 

The whole valuation of the parish stands in the cess-books of 
the county at L.3559, 8s. Scots. 

The carse land is of excellent quality. The dry- field consists 
of various kinds of soil. The greatest part is thin, lies on a tilly 
bed, and requires extensive draining, which has been, and still is, 
carried on to a considerable extent on modern principles, and with 
beneficial results. 

The rotation of crops for carse land is that called the six-shift 
course ; \st, oats ; d, summer-fallow ; 3c, wheat ; 4th, beans ; 
5th, barley ; and, 6th, clover-grass, which is cut for hay. The 
rotation for dry-field is the same, where the land is stiff, and on a 
retentive bottom ; but where the land is free, and not retentive of 
moisture, a green drilled crop is substituted for summer fallow. 
In this case, the ground remains in pasture a year or two after the 
removal of the hay crop. 

Leases, Sc. — Although a few are for a shorter period, the leases 
are usually for nineteen years, by which means the farmer is en- 
couraged to employ his capital in the improvement of his farm, 
and his industry is stimulated. The farms are generally let upon 
corn rents, convertible according to the fiars prices of the county 
for the crop and year for which the rents are payable. By this 
mode of adjusting the rents, agricultural distress may be said to 
be unknown in the parish.

Coal. — The outcropping of some of the seams of coal in this 
neighbourhood must have attracted notice to this mineral at an 
early period. About the middle of the fifteenth century, Pope 
Pius II. expressed his astonishment at "black stones" being given 
in alms to the poor of Scotland. Even as early as 1291, a char- 
ter was granted in favour of the Abbots of Dunfermline, giving 
the right of digging coals in the neighbourhood of the convent. 
The seams of coal in this neighbourhood are, generally speaking, 
of good thickness, and excellent quality ; and most of them appear 
to have been wrought at a very early period, in different places, 
and frequently to a great extent. When the salt-works consist- 
ing of sixteen pans, producing about 37,000 bushels annually, 
were in full operation, the average quantity of coal raised in twelve 
months might be about 44,000 tons. For nearly forty years past, 
however, no pit has been in operation in this parish, the coals be- 
ing raised in the neighbouring parish of Carriden. But lately, ow- 
ing to a serious irruption of water, the works there were interrupted, 
when an old pit was re-opened in Bo'ness, and was wrought for a 
short period. At the hill, the great coal was then sold at lOs, 
per ton, and the chews at 6s. per ton. The great coal was shipped 
at 9s. per ton, and the chezos at 7s. per ton. 

The neighbourhood of the Snab has been proposed as the most 
favourable situation for a new winning of the coal-field. The es- 
tablishment of a colliery at this place is expected to be of consi- 
derable advantage to the town. 

Ironstone was formerly wrought to a considerable extent, but is 
wrought only in small quantities at present, along with the coal. 

Quarries. — From the trap rock or whinstone quarries are ob- 
tained stones for building, and excellent metal for the roads. 

There are several freestone quarries in the parish, the best of 
which is at Craigenbuck. The stone which it yields is of excel- 
lent quality, and is much used for hearths and ovens. 

The limestone, which is more suitable for mortar than for ma- 
nure, is not wrought at present. 

Fisheries.— The inhabitants of this place turned their attention 
to whale-fishing about sixty years ago. At one time eight whale- 
ships belonged to Bo'ness. But this branch of industry, though 
attempted at different periods, has not been prosperous, and only 
one vessel is employed in it at present. There are two boilmg- 
houses for preparing the whale-oil ; one of which has been repan-ed 
lately, and made very complete in its arrangements.

Herrings seldom appear here in great quantities. In 1794-5, 
there wasa very successful fishing, but there has been none here 
since. 

The establishment of a salmon-fishery at the mouth of the Avon 
has been proposed, but not yet carried into effect. 

Haddock, cod, and skate, are found in the Frith ; but little at- 
tention is paid to fishing, owing, probably, to the want of bait. 

Small quantities of trout and flounders are occasionally taken 
with hand-nets, in the stream of the Avon. 

Manufactures. — Tambouring was formerly a very profitable em- 
ployment to a great number of females in this place. This branch 
of industry now aff"ords but a small remuneration, although a con- 
siderable number is still employed in it. 

The Bo'ness Pottery commenced on a small scale in the year 
1784, and has been carried on by various individuals since that 
time. The present proprietors have greatly enlarged their pre- 
mises, and extended their works. They manufacture almost every 
variety of stone and earthen-ware. 

The Bo'ness Foundery is generally well employed. The che- 
mical has lately been much enlarged. 

At the east end of the town there is an extensive bonded wood- 
vard, and an open woodyard on the Links. Connected with them, 
and driven by steam, is a saw-mill, containing both circular and 
vertical saws, and a very ingenious and efficient planing machine. 
The same steam-engine moves machinery for preparing bone 
manure. 

There is a rope-work on a small scale on the Links. 

The Bo'ness distillery, at" the west end of the town, is an exten- 
sive establishment ; but the present proprietor is working it on a " 
limited scale, producing only spirit of superior quality. The re- 
venue paid to Government, including malt duty, is sometimes con- 
siderably above L. 300 per week. The farmers obtain a large 
supply of excellent manure from the distillery, as there is connect- 
ed with it extensive accommodation for feeding cattle. 

Besides the grain malted and used at the distillery, a conside- 
rable quantity is malted elsewhere, and sent out of the parish.. 

At this port there is an extensive grain trade, foreign and Bri- 
tish. The grain merchants have accommodation for warehousing 
15000 quarters. Almost all the granaries have been used asr 
bonded warehouses. 

Shipping. — In the course of the 17th century, Boness became

the great emporium of commerce with Holland and the Baltic. 
Probably it profited much by the declaration of Parliament in 1672, 
that burghs of regality and barony were entitled to the same free- 
dom of trade as royal burghs. The strict regulations of the En- 
glish customs laws, introduced at the Union, proving a great re- 
straint upon the trade of Scotland, the Scottish merchants turned 
their attention to the English colonies, then opened to them, and 
a great trade in tobacco, and other colonial produce arose, by which 
the merchants of this place acquired much wealth. Between 1750 
and 1780, Bo'ness was one of the most thriving towns on the east 
coast, and ranked as the third port in Scotland. But since the 
opening of the Forth and Clyde Canal, and especially since the 
erection of Grangemouth into a separate port, the commerce of 
this place has decreased, and at present it is in a very languishing 
condition.

• The ships and duties of 1805 and 1810 include those of Grangemouth. At this 
period the inward trade consisted chiefly of timber, deals, iron, flax, blubber, grain, 
bark madder ; and the outward trade, of grain, salt, coals, earthen-ware. The out- 
ward' and inward trade is similar at the present time. The flax is importetl into the 
creeks on the north side, and conveyed to Dunfermline.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

It apjjears from the recollection of Sir R. Drummond of Meid- 
hope, referred to by Sir R. Sibbald, that, about the year 1600, 
there was but one house where Bo'ness and the other villages east- 
ward to Carriden now stand. And about the year 1700, accord- 
ing to Sir R. Sibbald's own observation, " from the Palace of 
Kinneil, for some two miles eastward, are almost continued build- 
ings upon the coast ; and above it, upon the sloping ground from 
the hills of Irongath, there are several seats of the gentry, and 
several villages well peopled, because of the frequent coal-pits all 
over the ground." To this period, therefore, we may refer the ori- 
gin of Bo'ness and the neighbouring villages. And the great and 
rapid change which took place between 1600 and 1700, may be 
ascribed to the extensive trade with the lo\v countries, which 
sprung up during that interval. The merchandise brought from 
Holland, Bremen, Hamburgh, Konigsberg, and Danlzic, was land- 
ed on the south shores of the Frith, and conveyed to Linlithgow, 
Stirling, Glasgow, and all the west country. Blackness was the 
only place on the south side of the Frith where ships could lie 
safely ; but causeways or gravelled roads are said to have been 
made on the beech, by which carts might be brought alongside of 
vessels at low water, for the purpose of landing or shipping goods. 
The Ness, on which the town now stands, presented a situation 
favourable for such operations ; and, most probably, the compact 
piece of causeway, which was discovered about twenty years ago, 
at the depth of several feet below the sill of the dock-gate, was part 
of the original landing-place at the Ness. 

The abundance of coal in the neighbourhood, as well as the 
local convenience of the Ness, probably attracted shipping to it at 
an early period ; and the prosperous trade, which commenced in 
the beginning of the seventeenth century, induced many rich mer- 
chants, ship-owners, and others, to acquire property, or to reside 
here ; so that the town and population rapidly increased. 

Town. — The town of Bo'ness is situated in the north-east cor- 
ner of the parish, close to the harbour, and nearly on a level wiih 
the sea. It is uncertain when it was erected into a burgh of re- 

creelcs of Limekilns and Inverkeitliiug. In 1794, 25 sliijjs belonged to tlie town ; 
whereof 17 were brigantines, 11 of them engaged in the Baltic trade, and 6 under 
contract to sail regularly once every 14 days, to and from London. 

 Sir John Hamilton of Grange, and Sir John Hamilton of Beircrofts, had sa- 
sines of various houses and tenements in Bo'ness, from the Marquis of Hamilton, in 
1620 and 162.3.

gality ; bat it was made a burgh of barony when the Jurisdiction 
Act was repealed : and it is governed by a bailie appointed by 
the Duke of Hamilton. Bo'ness is a post-town, having two arrivals 
and two departures of the mail daily. A weekly market is held on 
Monday. There is an annual fair in July, which is observed now 
chiefly by the colliers and carters, who then choose the office- 
bearers of their friendly societies, and ride in procession, gayly 
decorated with ribbons, feathers, and flags. 

Harbour. — The harbour is formed by two piers carried out into 
the Frith. The western pier, which was first erected, has its ex- 
tremity bent towards the east. The eastern pier extends as far as. 
the other ; so that the harbour is completely protected from 
storms, and is one of the safest and most accessible in the Frith. 
A double wall, forming a broad road, has been run across the har- 
bour, between the two piers, so as to form a basin on the land side 
of the harbour. This basin is allowed to fill with the flowing tide, 
and at low water it is emptied by opening four sluices, through 
which the water flows with a rapid current, so as to clean and 
deepen the harbour with very little trouble or expense. A small 
jetty has been run out from the middle of this wall, and parallel 
with the piers, which increases the accommodation of the harbour ; 
and at the west end of the wall is a gateway, the gate or lock 
has lately been removed, through which vessels are admitted to a 
patent slip, which has been laid down at the west side of the ba- 
sin. The breadth of the harbour, or the length of the basin wall 
and dock-gate between the two piers, is 240 feet : the length of 
the west pier from this wall is 568 feet. A part of the east pier, 
386 feet long, was built in 1733 ; and an addition, 180 feet long, 
was made in 1787. The depth of water in the harbour at spring 
tides may be from 16 to 18, or even 20 feet. 

The improvements of the harbour have been effected chiefly 
by a impost on ale and beer, and on anchorage duty le- 
vied by an Act of Parliament, which has been repeatedly renew- 
ed. By the last act, of 1816, for twenty-five years, an assess- 
ment of Is. per pound is levied on all buildings within town, 
along with the old impost of 2d. Scots on the pint of ale or beer, 
and an anchorage duty of 2d. on coasters, and 3|d. on foreign 
vessels. 

The impost, duty, and assessment of the town and harbour are 
under the management of fifteen trustees, elected from the mer- 
chants and shipmasterF. 



BORllOWSTOWNNESS.

It is a remarkable circumstance, that no shore dues or wharfage 
on goods are levied at this harbour ; and it is much to be regret- 
ted, that, during the last lease of, the colliery, almost all the coals 
from the Duke of Hamilton's property were shipped, not at Bo'- 
ness, but at Bridgeness in Carriden. These circumstances have 
proved exceedingly disadvantageous to the funds of the town. But 
it is hoped, when the Act of Parliament, and the lease of the coal- 
works, shall be renewed, these serious disadvantages will be 
avoided. 

Owing to the deficiency of funds, the trustees have not only 
been prevented from undertaking various desirable improvements 
in the town and harbour, but have also incurred a heavy debt, as 
will appear from the following statement : 

Annual revenue ; average for ten years. Expenditure for same period.

The debt due by the trustees in the year 1823 was L.1769. 
At one period the debt was above L.2000. At present, however, 
it is less. 

The petty customs are the property of the Duke of Hamilton, 
the superior. 

Port and Custom- Houses. — Before the Union, the magistrates 
of royal burghs collected the greater customs belonging to the 
Crown, as well as the petty customs belonging to the burghs, and 
they accounted for the former to the Exchequer ; but at, and 
probably for some time before, the Union, the greater customs 
were taken ou.t of the hands of magistrates, and let to tacksmen, 
or farmers of the revenue, as appears from the minutes of the 
Commissioners of the Union. The King's duties were collected 
at Blackness, for the goods imported in this district. By the 
treaty of Union, the English customs laws were extended to Scot- 
land, and custom-houses were then established at the principal 
ports. The influence of the Hamilton family procured the Cus- 
tom- House to, be established at their own town of Bo'ness, instead 
of Blackness, and the first ledger of the " Port of Borrowstoun 
Ness" commences on 26th December 1707. The district of this 
port embraced both sides of the Frith of Forth, from Dumbrissle 
Point and Cramond Water, upwards to the boundaries of Alloa,

LINI,ITHGOWSHIRE 



On 1st December 1810, Grangemouth, previously a creek of this 
port, was erected into a separate port. 

The establishment of the port consists, at present, of one col- 
lector, one comptroller, and one tide-waiter at Bo'ness, and eight 
other individuals at the creeks, &amp;c. connected with the establish- 
ment. In 1795, the establishment consisted of forty-four indivi- 
duals.  

Ecclesiastical State. — According to the " Taxationes Ecclesia- 
nim," quoted by Sibbald, Kinneil was in the diocese of St An-

rated at twenty-five merks. It had been given to the canons of 
Holyrood in the twelfth or thirteenth century, and was confirmed 
to them by the Bishop of St Andrews in 1240. The canons en- 
joyed the revenues, and the cure was served by a vicar. In 1633, 
the parish of Kinneil was in the diocese of Edinburgh, -f 

The ruins of the old parish church, and the burying-ground of 
Kinneil, are still to be seen a little west from Kinneil House. X 
No records remain ; but the inhabitants of the barony still observe 
some old customs connected with the ancient parish ; and there 
are a few relics which they hold in veneration, and preserve with 
great care. The communion table linen, and part of the com- 
munion table, and some other articles, are in the possession of 
Mr William Thomson, farmer. Upper Kinneil. 

About the year 1634, the inhabitants of Bo'ness, induced by 
the increasing prosperity and importance of the place, and consid- 
ering the parish church at Kinneil at an inconvenient distance 
from the town, built a place of worship for themselves. The 
minister of the parish, to accommodate the inhabitants of the town, 
preached in this place of worship, as well as in the parish church 
of Kinneil, till the year 1649, when a petition was presented to 
the Parliament of Scotland for a disjunction from Kinneil, and a 
separate minister. Parliament granted the prayer of the petition, 
and, after several visitations, the presbytery of Linlithgow found

it necessary, that Bo'ness should be erected into a parish by itself, 
bounded on the south, by Graham's Dike ; on the north, by the 
sea ; on the east, by Thirlestone ; and on the west, by the castle 
wall, commonly called " Capie's Wall." Some objection appears 
to have been made to the measure, as it was effected whilst James, 
Duke of Hamilton, the sole proprietor of the lands and teinds of 
the parish, was detained in England. However, in December 
1669, William and Anne, Duke and Duchess of Hamilton, ob- 
tained an Act of the Scots Parliament, declaring the church built 
within the town to be " the kirk of the hail barony of Kinneil 
and Bo'ness/' From that period, the parishes have been united, 
and considered as one. 

The following have been the ministers of Bo'ness after Mr M. 
Potter : Mr John Brand, ordained 3d January 1694; Mr William 
Brand, ordained 1739 ; Mr Patrick Baillie, ordained 14th May 
1747; Mr John Morton, ordained 10th May 1792 ; Dr Robert 
Rennie, ordained 9th April 1795 ; present incumbent, admitted 
13th February 1834. 

The parish church of Bo'ness, at the period of the disjunction 
from Kinneil, was a long narrow building, with round-topped win- 
dows. Having become the church of the united parishes, an act 
of Parliament was obtained for repairing it, in the year 1 672, and 
the Duke of Hamilton added a large aisle for himself and his ten- 
ants. In 1775, according to an agi-eement between the Duke's 
commissioners and the town, the aisle was taken down, and the 
church nearly rebuilt, of an oblong figure, 69 feet by 48, within 
the walls. In 1820, the south wall, and part of the east wall were 
rebuilt, and the galleries were reconstructed and made uniform ; 
so that the church is now a plain, neat, substantial building, and 
in good repair. 

The church is seated for the accommodation of 950, but might 
accommodate 100 more, if the vacant spaces in the galleries were 
seated. 

The Duke of Hamilton has 30 pews, containing 169 seats, oc- 
cupied by his tenants, and by the colliers connected with his 
works. The representatives, who manage the church-funds, let 

 Several curious memorials of the frequent intercourse between Holland and 
Bo ness still remam. I he pulpit was brought from Holland, and is a curious speci- 
inen of ancient art and taste ; and the oldest pulpit Bible is an Amsterdam edition of 
the Geneva Bible, reprinted from an Edinburgh edition of 1610, having several of 
the usual nnaps and figurative illustrations. The New Testament is an English 
translation, by L. lomson, of Beza's version. Tlie volume is clasped and ornamented 
wiih brass.

10 pews, containing 88 seats ; and 45 pews, containing 279 seats, 
are private property, but pay an annual feu into the church funds. 
From L.20 to L.30 per annum are realized from these seats. 
There are 46 pews, containing 274 seats, which pay no feu, being 
the free property of private individuals ;and 14 pews, containing 
99 seats, are the property of different societies. Many of the seats 
belonging to the societies, and of those which are the property of 
private individuals, are let, at the will of the proprietors, at rents 
varying from Is. to 4s. per annum. There are fourteen free seats 
before the pulpit. 

The church, being in the town, is situated near the eastern ex- 
tremity of the parish ; yet the farmers, even in the most distant 
parts of the parish, are remarkably regular in their attendance at 
church. 

The manse was built about thirty years ago, and, though not 
well planned or neatly finished, is a good house, and in tolerable 
repair. 

The glebe consists of about six acres of excellent land, about 
L.20 yearly value ; and the grass glebe is let at L.4 per annum. 

When the parishes of Kinneil and Bo'ness were united in 1669, 
the act of Parliament appointed the old stipend of Kinneil to be 
added to the stipend given by the town, and the whole to be the 
constant stipend of the minister serving the cure of the united pa- 
rishes. According to the act of erection in 1649, the stipend of 
Bo'ness was 800 merks, with a glebe, and the rent of the minis- 
ter's house. A stock of 10,000 merks was invested in land, and the 
annual rent of this mortification was designed for the stipend, but 
not amounting to 800 merks, the Act of Parliament appointed the 
inhabitants of the town to be stented 200 merks, L.ll, 2s. 2|d., 
and representatives were to be chosen annually to fix and levy the 
assessment. The farm of Muirhouse, in which the stock was in- 
vested, is about two miles south from the town, and consists of 
169 acres. As it was not very productive at first, the assessment 
was frequently levied during the first" century after the disjunction 
of Bo'ness from Kinneil, but this has long since become unneces- 
sary, as the farm has been greatly improved, and its value and 
yearly produce have been much increased. 

The rent of this farm, together with a bond of L.6, 18s. lid. 
by Duchess Anne Hamilton, and the seat-rents formerly mention- 
ed, constitute the funds of the church of Bo'ness. These funds 
are chargeable with five-sixths of the expense of all repairs of the

church and churchyard wall, the Duke of Hamilton being charge- 
able with one-sixth. After deducting the expense of repairs on 
the church, and of the management of the funds, the free surplus 
is payable to the minister. This destination of the surplus funds 
was determined by a decision of the House of Lords in the year 
1806. The church-funds are under the management of the re- 
presentatives, who are chosen annually on the first Wednesday of 
January by the heritors, portioners, householders, and heads of fami- 
lies in the town, in conjunction with the minister and kirk-session. 

The management of the church funds, in which the Dissenters 
take a part, is conducted in a manner most creditable to the com- 
munity, without regard to party views or private interest. 

The average sum of surplus paid to the minister is about L. 1S5 
per annum. 

The stipend payable as from the parish of Kinneil is six chal- 
ders victual, the greatest part oats and barley ; L.5 are allowed 
for communion elements ; and coals are furnished to the minister 
by the family of Hamilton, conform to use and wont. 

The sacrament of the Supper is dispensed in the parish church 
twice in the year. Number on the general roll of communicants, 
644; number of male heads of families, communicants, 182; ave- 
rage number of actual communicants, 450. 

There is but one Dissenting congregation in the parish, which 
is connected with the United Secession Church. Their place of 
worship will accommodate about 400, and is well attended. 

Contributions for Religious and Charitable Purposes. — The peo - 
ple of this parish are very liberal in their contributions for religious 
and charitable purposes. Last year the sum of L.24, 12s. was 
raised by a parochial association in aid of the General Assembly's 
schemes. 

There is also a Bible and Education Society, in the support and 
management of which Churchmen and Dissenters unite. By the 
annual contributions to this society, about 25 poor children re- 
ceive a plain education ; and the Scriptures, the Shorter Catechism, 
and school-books are supplied to the poor gratuitously, or at re- 
duced prices. 

Th ere is an Association of Ladies for the purpose of supplying 
the poor with clothes, meal, and coals in winter. The farmers ge- 
nerously aid this work of benevolence by carting the coals gratui- 
tously. The contributions obtained by the ladies, and the value 
of the services of the farmers, may amount in some years to L.30.

A small sum is occasionally collected for defraying the expenses

the parish, church to the extent of L.8, L.IO, or L.12, for religious 
and charitable purposes.

There is a Provident Union Society, which divides its funds 
yearly. In 1834, there were 422 members, the payments in the 
course of the year amounting to L.69, 5s. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The inhabitants of the barony still 
observe some customs of their forefathers, which have a reference 
to the old parish of Kinneil. This appears particularly in the 
management of their poor, which is quite distinct from that of Bo'- 
ness. The inhabitants of the barony put their church-door col- 
lections for the poor into the old ladle of Kinneil church, whilst 
the inhabitants of the town put theirs into a different receptacle. 
After the poor belonging to Kinneil are supplied, the remainder 
of the funds that can be spared is distributed to the poor of the 
town. 

The following statement of the expenditure and receipts of the 
poor's funds of the barony and of the town respectively, is the 
average of three years, 1835, 1836, and 1837 :

The Kinneil funds, which are occasionally augmented by vo- 
luntary contributions from a Hearse Society connected with the 
barony, are always more than sufficient for supplying the poor in 
the barony. Indeed, the greatest part of the Kinneil funds is 
given to the poor of the town in occasional relief; and this ac- 
counts for the great number of occasional poor, in the Kinneil list. 
The large deficiency in the Bo'ness funds is made up by the Duke 
of Hamilton. 

Education. — For several years past there have been about ten 
schools in the parish. There is but one parochial school, which 
is very ably conducted by Mr John Stephens, who has been pa- 
rochial schoolmaster here upwards of forty years. He has the 
maximum salary, L.34, 4s. 4i\d.~ His house, which was the first 
in this Presbytery built under the act 1803, contains more than 
.the kgal accommodations ; but the garden ground is rather defi- 
cient in size, for which he receives an equivalent in money. The 
schoolmaster is also session -clerk, the fees of which office are about 
L.14 per annum. The average of school-fees is at present under 
L.40 per annum. The average of scholars, for upwards of thirty 
years, was considerably above 100; these last three years it has 
scarcely exceeded the half of that number. 

There is a school at Upper Kinneil, supported by the tenantry, 
for the convenience of children in the barony. That the school- 
fees may be moderate, the Duke of Hamilton allows the teacher 
a small salary. 

The Dissenters, for three or four years past, have supported a 
school, which is numerously attended. This and the other schools 
in the town are not endowed, and most of them are taught by fe- 
males. 

Library. — A subscription library has existed in the parish above 
thirty years. It contains about 1250 volumes, many of them va- 
luable works. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
A great part of Kinneil Carse has evidently been reclaimed 
from the Frith, and, being under high-water-mark, is preserved 
from its encroachments by strong embankments. It is uncertain 



148 



LINLITHGOWSUIIIE, 



when or by whom these embankments were made ; probably tliey 
were effected by James, first Lord Hamilton. 

Between Bo'ness harbour and the mouth of the Avon, about 
1000 acres of a muddy surface are exposed at low water. These, 
if reclaimed from the sea for agricultural purposes, would be a va- 
luable addition to the Carse of Kinneil. This part of the Frith 
is becoming shallower, owing to the accumulation of mud brought 
down by the Avon and Carron, and especially by the Forth; and 
the beach is assuming more of a fluviatic character. Sir Robert 
Sibbald says, " These shallows have the name of the Lady's Scaup. 
The Dutch did offer some time ago to make all that scaup good 
arable ground and meadow, and to make harbours and towns there 
in convenient places, upon certain conditions, which were not ac- 
cepted." 

It has been the general opinion that the eastern termination of 
the Forth and Clyde Canal should have been at Bo'ness, as this 
town and harbour possess important advantages which can never 
be obtained at the mouth of Grangeburn. The merchants and 
inhabitants of Bo'ness, perceiving that this canal commenced m 
1768 would put an end to their trade with Glasgow, hitherto 
carried on by means of pack-horses and carriers' carts, in order to 
retain at least a share of it, proposed to make a branch from the 
great canal to the harbour of Bo'ness. Two Acts of Parhament, 
and subscriptions to the amount of L.l 0,000 were obtamed; the 
canal was cut from the river Avon eastward, within a mile of the 
town, and an aqueduct across the Avon was nearly comjjleted ; 
but, after an outlay of about L. 7500, the work was abandoned, 
when not half- finished. The circumstances which prevented the 
accomplishment of this desirable undertaking need not be stated; 
but they were, and still are, deeply regretted by the inhabitants of 
this town, especially on seeing their trade turned into another chan- 
nel. Much of it passed by the canal direct to Glasgow, and the 
larger vessels discharged at Grangemouth, which was only a creek 
of this port, but then became its rival, and was eventually erected 
into a separate port.

When this phice was much frequented by shipping, ship-build- 
ino-, for which the beach and the patent slip afforded great conve- 
nience, was carried on to a considerable extent. The names of 
Hart and of Boag were well known, even in Greenock. Very few 
vessels are built here now ; but the patent slip has been frequently 
employed of late. 

As shipping and commerce now find more direct and easy ac- 
cess to various parts of the country than formerly, there seems to 
be but little prospect of any great return of trade to this place, 
except by the establishment of manufactures; and few places pos- 
sess greater advantages for this purpose. A harbour, the safest 
and most accessible in the Frith, — a ready communication with 
all parts of the country by land and water, — an abundant supply 
of coal, — and a large population, having at present but irregular, 
or inadequate employment, — present unusual advantages for the 
investment of capital in manufactures.

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALE. 

THli REV. SAMUEL MARTIN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History, 

Name In a grant by Malcolm IV. to the monks of Holyrood, 

this parish is named Batket. In other charters and deeds of the 
twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, the name is written 
Bathket, Batket, Bathcat, and Bathkat. The etymology the 
writer is unable to explain. The modern name is a manifest cor- 
ruption of the original appellation. 

Extent, Boundaries and Figure. — The greatest length of this 
parish, which is in a line running nearly from west-south-west to 
east-north-east, is 7 miles ; its greatest breadth at right angles to 
its length, is 4 miles. It contains 17.53 square miles : 8921.72 
Scotch, or 11214.6 imperial acres. 

 Any one wlio takes the trouble to compute tbein, will find that these statements 
are not exactly, though very nearly, equivalent. They arc taken from Forrest's large 
map of Linlithgowshire, and the writer believes Ihem nil to be beyond the truth. 



150 



LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 



The ligui e of lUis parish is nearly that of a parallelogram, of 
5| miles by rather less than 3, with a projecting branch running 
a mile more to the west, a similar one, extending about two-thirds 
of a mile to the east, and a larger protuberance on the north. It 
is bounded on the north, by Torphichen, and a small portion of 
Linlithgow ; on the east, by Ecclesmachan and Livingston ; oh 
the south, by Livingston and Whitburn ; and on the west, by 
Shotts and Torphichen. 

Hills and general aspect of the Parish. — The centre of Linlith- 
gowshire is composed of a somewhat elevated plateau, surrounded 
on all sides by hills of considerable height. The south-west cof- 
ner of this bounding range, which has no general name, forms the 
north-eastern portion of the parish of Bathgate, covering nearly 
one-seventh of its whole extent. Close upon the boundary be- 
tween Bathgate and Torphichen, the range attains its highest ele- 
vation in the hill of Cairnapple, or Cairnpapple, which is said, in 
various maps, to be 1493 feet above the level of the sea. This, 
it is apprehended, is considerably beyond the truth. There are 
two eminences within the boundary of Bathgate, one named the 
Knock, and the other Reiving Craig, which are not more than from 
20 to 30 feet lower than Cairnapple. . The western, and to some 
extent, the southern slope of the hilly mass is rather steep, but 
contains in it the best land in the parish. The tract at its foot 
is the lowest ground in the parish, is naturally marshy, and 
appears once to have been, to a considerable extent, covered with 
water. The surface water is now removed, and the wetness of 
the soil somevhat corrected by draining. Beyond this, the rest 
of the parish, both south and west, is very level, though having on 
the whole a gentle and continuous rise towards the boundary line 
in these directions. On the southern half of the west boundary, 
however, the ground again sinks into a deep moss, which extends 
between this parish and that of Shotts. 

Our climate is rather moist, and vegetation is about a fort- 
night later here than it is nine or ten miles to the east. 

Lakes, c. — The only lake is a small one of about eleven acres 
in extent in the park of Balbardie. It is partly artificial, and has 
an average depth of five feet, though in one place upwards of 
twelve. It forms a very pretty object in that beautiful and well- 
wooded park. There is no stream of importance connected in 
any way with this parish, except the Amond, which forms the 
boundary for little more than a mile between Bathgate and Whit- 



BATHjATE.

burn Springs abound in this parish. The water from them is 
in many places tinged with iron. One, on the estate of Couston, 
seems to resemble very much in quality the celebrated Dollar 

water. . . , 

Geology and Miner alogy.~i:\e dip of the strata is- universally 
to the west and north-west. The inclination is exceedingly vari- 
ous, ranging from 5° to as much as 45°. The latter is found, 
however, only where some violent disruption of the strata has taken 
place. Almost the whole of this parish forms part of the great 
central coal Held of Scotland. In regard to every part of it except 
the east and south-east, it has been ascertained from working sand 
from recent borings, that .coal is to be found, and generally in 
workable seams. Whinstone dikes are of frequent occurrence, 
deranging the seams and oft spoiling the coal. There are also 
frequent dislocations of the strata, elevating or depressing the beds, 
sometimes as much as several fathoms, without any intervening 
dike at all. Above the coal, and so far as has been ascertained, 
beneath it too, beds of freestone occur. The crowning points of 
the hilly part of the parish are all formed of secondary trap rocks, 
such as basalt and whin or greenstone. These give place on the 
western ridge and slope to coal, as already mentioned, and to thick 
beds of sandstone, and mountain limestone. These beds are oc- 
casionally intersected by a bed of trap, taking sometimes the form 
of basalt, and amygdaloid, and are all rich in organic remains. In 
the coarse sandstone, and among the intervening beds of shale le- 
pidodendra have been found, and grasses in the finer grained sand- 
stone. The limestone is supposed by some geologists to be of two 
distinct formations, the one a marine, the other a lacustrine depo- 
sit. The workings in these supposed different deposits are not 
half a mile asunder ; and if the strata are continuous, which has 
been ascertained only partially, they must lie within a hundred 
yards of each other. In the one, various species of corallines, am- 
monites, and other marine shells of every kind, the pecten, nautilus, 
mytilus, anomia, orthoceras, &amp;c. abound. They often form, in 
fact, to a great extent, the mass of the stone. The principal stra- 
tum of this formation is about forty feet thick, including seams of 
flint of varying thickness. Many fissures occur in it, and the lower 
portion of it may be called cavernous, as it occasionally presents, 
openings into which a man may enter to unknown depths. Vari- 
ous spars occur in the fissures, and stalactites in these openuigs..

supposed lacustrine formation, has been described by Dr Hibbert 
in the Appendix to his valuable memoir on the Burdiehouse Lime- 
stone. He states that its mineralogical character indicates that it 
was elaborated under a very powerful chemical action : and he 
specifies the separation of the miscellaneous earthy matters which 
compose it into thin laminae, some of them of remarkable tenuity, 
and their assumption of a striped {rubane, as it is termed, dispo- 
sition, — the blistered appearances, as if from heat, exhibited by the

on the large scale, but even in hand specimens — and the botryoi- 
dal and mammillary structure, which other portions present, as all 
" tending to the hypothesis, that the calcareous beds of Kirkton 
were elaborated under the action of great heat, or, in other words, 
that they had their origin in deep fissures, intimately connected 
with a volcanic focus." He remarks, indeed, that this is no more 
hypothetical matter. For, " an interposed mass of volcanic tufa 
of a green colour, which occasionally assumes the compactness of 
greenstone, is developed among the higher beds of the deposit." 
This limestone, with its accompaniments, Dr Hibbert pronounces 
"one of the most unique formations of which Great Britain can 
boast, indicative of thermal waters belonging to the carboniferous 
epoch." This limestone, says Mr Cunningham, " contains the 
usual plants of the coal series, and also fossilized wood." Speci- 
mens also have been discovered of a crustaceous animal of very 
large dimensions. Dr Hibbert has identified them with the Eu- 
ry-pterus of North America, described first by Dr Harlan, and re- 
ferred by him to the class Crustacea, and order Branchiopoda. 
The Kirkton specimens, however, are of a different species from 
those found in North America, and are distinguished by their ex- 
traordinary size. 

In the limestone beds, lead is found in small, and often interrupt-

fresh-water origin from the statements of Dr Hibbert in the 13th Vol. Trans. Hoy. 
Soc. Ed. ' that a decidedly fresh-water limestone is there exposed, which is character-

its being so characterized is incorrect, in as much as we have found in it specimen 
of the productus."

ed veins, exhibiting also traces of silver. One lime-work retains 
the name of Silver mine from silver ore having for some time been 
wrought in it. After yielding a considerable quantity of silver, the 
veins became so small, that the produce would not repay the ex- 
pense, and the lime alone is wrought now. Traces of zinc brown 
blend are said to have been observed. Iron pyrites is frequently 
found, disseminated in its crystalline forms. Iron bands are ob- 
served in the Kirkton formation. In connection with the coal 
strata, iron ore is sometimes found. Formerly this ore was wrought 
on the estate of Couston, by the Carron Company. It was found 
in masses like rolled boulders, imbedded among clay, and was a 
very rich ore. Thin beds of mineral pitch are found in the limestone. 
Calcspar is, of course, plentiful ; heavy-spar, pearl-spar, and Ly- 
dian stone, are occasionally found, and, but more rare rarely, chal- 
cedony. In the hilly part of the parish, whinstone, greenstone, 
and basalt are the prevalent rocks ; in the level parts sandstone. 
The rocks, except on the hills where they frequently crop out, are 
covered with earth to the depth of 30 or 40 feet. The general 
subsoil is a wet tenacious clay. Beds and knolls of sand and 
gravel are, however, of frequent occurrence ; and the general sub- 
stratum of the south-east part of the parish is deep gravel. On 
this, peat-moss is in some places superimposed. Peat abounds in 
the parish, and is sometimes of great depth. Fire-clay is also 
abundant. In all the mosses, trees — generally oaks, — are found im- 
bedded in considerable numbers. Mr Weir, Junior, of Boghead, 
is in possession of a fine specimen of the head and horns of the 
red-deer, which were found in a meadow on his property in 1836. 
The antlers measure respectively 3 feet 2 inches, and 3 feet 3 
inches. 

There are four limeworks in this parish ; and a fifth Kirkton 
recently suspended, besides older workings. One of these works, 
on the East Mains of Ballincrieff, is wrought in the great stratum 
already mentioned, to the depth of about '25 feet, including a si- 
licious bed about 5 feet thick, which is not worth burning. The 
tirring is here from 12 to 40 feet. The covering consists first of 
earth, then indurated slaty clay, or shale, freestone, and flint; 
The freestone is often wanting. Another work is carried on a 
little farther south, on the same property. It is in the same stra- 
tum, but more advantageously situated for working, being partly 
on the crop of the bed. The part of the stratum wrought is here 
somewhat thicker, and contains between 3 and 4 feet of matter not

fit for burning. Close by this work, on the property of Balbar- 
die, a third one is situated in the same stratum. Between them is 
interposed a whinstone dike, the effect of which is very great. 
It changes the dip from 10° to 45°. The thickness of the work- 
able bed is here about 40 feet, with the same proportion 3 to 4 
feet of waste. The tirring here is only about 15 feet, and be- 
tween the surface earth and the lime, nothing but a little loose sand- 
stone is interposed. Dikes of very various thicknesses, it should be 
added, occur very frequently in this lime, often within every hun- 
dred yards. The Silver mine work, opened originally in the pa- 
rish of Torphichen, has, in the course of time, extended into that 
of Bathgate. It has been wrought as a lime-work about 100 
years. It lies higher in the hills, and is wrought in a different 
stratum, or, at least, cut off from the other by a wide mass of whin. 
The bed of lime, which dips to the north-west at the rate of 1 in 3, 
is about 55 feet thick. Of this 40 feet are wrought, the other 15 
feet being generally so much coarser as to be neglected. The 
tirring is from 60 to 70 feet, consisting chiefly of blaes, with 8 feet 
of very hard freestone. Toads have been found in this lime. 

The lime produced at all these works is good. 

Coal has been wrought long and extensively in this parish. On 
the western slope of the hills, and round the town are many old 
workings, which have been abandoned for a considerable time. 
Of works at present open there is, 1. Barbauchlaw. The earth 
is here about 24 feet deep, succeeded by common freestone, a black 
Maes, bituminous shale, /aiAes, thin beds of friable sandstone, 
intermingled with shale and clay, twenty inches of red sandstone, 
grey blaes, common shale, very coarse ironstone, 18 inches of 
coal, fire-clay, grey blaes, 6 to 8 feet of freestone, fire-clay of va- 
riable thickness, averaging 3 feet, but sometimes wanting altoge- 
ther, and then at the depth of 16i fathoms the main coal, 4 feet 
thick. 2. In the Hardhill coal-work, the first workable seam is 
found at the depth of 16 fathoms. There is nothing between it 
and the surface earth hwifaikes. The coal seam presents first 3 
feet 2 inches of coal, then 3 inches of clay, and then 10 inches 
more of coal.. The next seam of coal presents 2 feet 10 inches 
of coal, 4 inches of blaes, and 9 inches of coal. It lies 4 fathoms 
deeper than the first seam, and between them lies some excellent 
and very white sandstone. From 4 to 6 fathoms deeper lies a par- 
rot coal, which is not yet wrought. The coal here dips to the north- 
west, at the rate of about 1 in 14. 3. In the Colinshiel coal- work, 



hathgaTe.

after 6 fathoms of earth, freestone appears, succeeded by a seam of 
coal 2 feet thick ; freestone very hard and white, lies between this 
and the coal now wrought, which is 3 feet 10 inches thick, and 
situated 12 fathoms from the surface. 11 fathoms deeper it has 
been ascertained that another seam occurs, 2 feet 4 inches thick. 
Four works have been recently given up. 

Zoology. — On the banks of Bathgate water, a small stream, which 
draining the lands east and south of the town, flows past it, and runs 
towards the north-west, till it joins the Barbauchlaw water, the otter 
was a few years ago rather abundant. Though its numbers have 
been very much thinned, it is still occasionally seen and killed 
there. In the Barbauchlaw water, which is an affluent of the 
Avon, trout are plentiful. Salmon come up it to spawn in the end 
of autumn, and return in spring. The following birds are found 
in the parish : Grasshopper warbler [Salicaria locustella. Mr 
Weir found a nest of this rare bird in a thick furze bush on the top 
of Bathgate hills, " This," he states, " is, I believe, the only nest 
of this bird which has as yet been discovered in Scotland." Sis- 
kin or aberdevine {Carduelis spinus. In 1834, a nest of the sis- 
kin was discovered in this parish. As the representations of na- 
turalists respecting its habits differ, it may be important to state 
that the nest was on a spruce fir in the middle of a strong hawthorn 
hedge, and about 5 J feet from the ground. The birds fed on the 
ripe seeds of the dandelion. In winter small flocks of them are oc- 
casionally seen on Bathgate hills, feeding on the seeds of the knap- 
weed, Centaurea nigra. The kingfisher {Alcedo ispida is a re- 
gular winter visitant of Bathgate water. In severe seasons, it often 
seeks its food almost under the wheel of a mill on the stream, 
although people are constantly passing and repassing. The night- 
jar or fern-owl {Caprimulgus Europoeus, — several of these curious 
birds breed here every year. White's minute and interesting ac- 
count of their habits agrees exactly with the observations made on 
them here. The crossbill {Loxia jEMropeajMacgillivray, has late- 
ly been seen in considerable numbers. Their food has been chiefly 
the seeds of the larch, which they obtain by separating the scales 
of the cones with their powerful bills. The European dipper 
{Cindus aquaticus, and the sandpiper {Tutanus hypoleucos build 

• This account of the birds is abridged from a communication furnished to the wri- 
ter by his friend, Mr Durham Weir, who has paid much attention to this department 
of natural history, and who has procured within the parish specimens of nearly all the 
birds mentioned. 

t Montague states that this bird is extremely early in its sinking. It is so also in it&amp; 
breeding. On April 25, 1834, its first brood was found by Mr We ir to be ripe.

on the brink of the BarbauchUiw water. A few pairs of the ring- 
ouzel [Merula torquuta breed every year about the rocky ground 
on the top of Bathgate hills. The black-headed gull {Larus ridi- 
hundus, the coot {Fulica atra, the gallinule or water-hen {Galli- 
7iula chloropus, and wild-duck {Anas boschas breed about the 
banks of Balbardie loch, and Bathgate water. The same si- 
tuations are visited during autumn and winter by the redshank 
sandpiper {Totunus calidris, the heron {Ardea cinerea, the teal 
{Querquedula crecca, the wigeon {Mareca penelope, the crested 
grebe {Podiceps crisiatus, the little grebe {Podiceps minor, and 
the h'MemBotaurus stellar is. The great cinereous shrike {Lanius 
excubitor. Linn. the ruff {Machetes pugnax, Cuvier, and the kite 
{Milvus regalis have been occasionally observed. Golden orioles 
Oriolus galbula were once observed, and the turtle-dove CWwTwJa 
turtur once killed in the parish. Most birds that are reckoned 
game are found in this parish. Black and red grouse, pheasant, 
and partridge all breed in it. The golden plover {Charadrius 
jAuvialis appears in large flocks during winter, and a few breed 
with us. Small flocks of the dotterel {Charadrius morinellus a.n- 
nually visit our hills in April and May. The quail has also been 
seen. The common snipe, curlew, and lapwing breed with us. 
Woodcocks, jack-snipes, fieldfares, and redwings visit us in winter. 
So do also flocks of snow-buntings, mountain finches, and starlings. 
In summer we have the spotted fly-catcher, the redstart, the wheat- 
ear, the whinchat, the sedge warbler, the black-cap warbler, rare, 
the greater and lesser pettychaps, the white-throat, Sicf There 
are two rookeries in the parish ; one, which is extensive, in the 
wood close by Balbardie House ; the other, which is but the scanty 
remains of a large one, is on the estate of Boghead. 

 A few years a"-o partridges were very abundant. The inclemency of the last 
two or three seasons has thinned their numbers to such an extent that there seems a 
dane-er of their becoming altogether extinct. In the very cold and wet summer of 
1836, several pairs were found dead in the fields with their broods under their wmgs 
_a striking proof of the strength of their parental affection. There are at present 
two to be seen on the estate of Barbauchlaw with beautiful white wings.  

t It is impossible to notice the more common birds. From Mr Weirs notes 
however, the following facts may be added : Goldfinches have repeatedly built their 
nests in trees in the town of Bathgate. On one occasion, a pair selected lor this pur- 
pose a poplar growing on the side of one of the most frequented streets. They be- 
came so tame, as to alight in the gutters with the sparrows in quest of food A fe- 
male goldfinch was known, twice at least, to pair with a male linnet in the wild state. 
The produce from this union were not admired as songsters. It is wcU known that 
hnllfinrhos commit great devastation among the buds ot fruit trees and bushes. Mr 
Wei ctgl a female on their nest in the actof feeding .he r young ones 

He fountl their mouths full of small maggots. It is not improbable, therefore, that 
" destroying ihe buds, the birds are in- tact destroying n far worse plague to ihcgar- 
dener than they themselves are imagined to be.

II. — Civil History. 
There is little of historical interest connected with this parish. 
The barony of Bathgate formed part of the dower of Marjory 
Bruce, " the lass who brought the sceptre into the Stewarts' 
house." A castle on it, situate in the low grounds south of the 
town, which must then have been a morass, was from this date 
occasionally inhabited by the royal family. Here Walter Stewart 
himself died in 1328. Hardly a vestige even of the foundations 
of the castle is now to be discovered. Kitchen utensils of brass, 
have, however, sometimes been found about it j and coffins, formed 
of flat stones, have been torn up by the plough in the neighbour- 
ing grounds. Some of the inhabitants of this parish suffered 
hardship and loss in the time of the Covenanters. One man, by 
name James Davie, was shot by one of a party of dragoons, who 
dispersed a congregation assembled in a hollow on the farm of 
Blackdub, in the western part of the parish. The worshippers had 
escaped across a strip of deep moss, which interposed an effectual 
obstacle to the progress of their mounted pursuers. But while 
they stood on the other side gazing at their enemies, and thinking 
themselves quite safe, the troopers fired their carbines at them 
across the moss. The only shot that took effect killed Davie. 
His body lies in the old churchyard of Bathgate,f with this in- 

" Some remains of the causeways, by which access was obtained to the castle 
through this morass, still exist. 

■j" There are two grave-yards in this parish. The old is a full mile to the south- 
east of the town. It surrounds the crumbling walls of what was once the parish 
church. When this church was built, and when abandoned, is utterly unknown. 
There was at least one other church between this ancient one and the present church. 
No feasible conjecture occurs to account for the adoption of a site for the church so 
far from the town, and so inconvenient for almost the whole inhabitants of the pa- 
rish, except this, that it might have been originally the chapel connected with the 
Stewarts' castle. The new churchyard is in the centre of the town, surrounding the 
present church.

scription, " Here lies the body of James Davie, who was shot at 
Blackdub, April 1673, by Heron, for his adhering to the word of 
God and Scotland's covenanted work of Reformation, in opposi- 
tion to Popery, Prelacy, perjury, and tyranny." 

Eminent Men. — Dr Fleming, the celebrated naturalist, and 
now Professor of Natural Philosophy in King's College, Aberdeen, 
is a native of this parish. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are the Earl of Hope- 
toun ; Colonel Swindel Norval of Boghall ; Mr Marjoribanks of 
Marjoribanks ; Mr Hart of Kirkton ; Captain Sandilands of Cous- 
ton, &amp;c. 

Parochial Registers. — The registers of this parish are somewhat 
voluminous. They had been well kept, except about the com- 
mencement of the present century. Portions, however, have been 
lost. The register of births begins in 1672, and, with a blank 
between 1684 and 1687, and another between 1694 and 1721, 
continues to the present time. The register of proclamations 
also begins in 1672, and is perfect with the omission of but two 
years to 1767 ; from that date to 1789, a record is possessed only 
for six years ; from 1789, the register is complete. The register 
of deaths begins 1698, and continues to 1710. From 1710 to 
1769, a record is preserved only for eighteen scattered years. 
From 1769, the register is complete. Of the Records of the 
Kirk-session's Actings, Vol. I. embraces the period from 1633 
to 1645, and from 1647 to 1650; Vol. ii. from 1672 to 1689. 
In other three volumes, the record is complete from 1694 to 
1792. From that year to 1820, only some loose scrolls of mi- 
nutes are in existence; but from 1820 to this day they are com- 
plete. 

Antiquities. — "Near Bathgate," says Penney, "are me- 
morial remains of Druid worship." The writer of this notice 
gives the statement as he finds it, but does not know to what it 
refers. In the stone coffins already referred to, some copper 
coins were found. There have also been turned up, in different 
parts of the parish, coins of Edward I., Queen Elizabeth, and 
Charles II. 

Modern Buildings. — Building goes on steadily in the town of 
Bathgate. The principal recent buildings are the Academy, a 
distillery, brewery, and gas-work. Freestone, either from the

quarries of the parish, or from those in the neighbourhood, is al- 
ways employed. 

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish has been steadily increasing, as 
the following table will show : 

In 1 755, the population was . 1594 

1791, .... 2325 

1801, .... 2513 

1821, . . . . 3283 

1831. .... 3610 

1841, .... 3927 

The increase in the last ten years being 317, or less than ten 
per cent, on the whole, seems to be nothing more than might be 
expected in the natural progress of population. Of the above 
number, 2809 resided in the town of Bathgate, 103 in a small 
village, and 1015 in the country part of the parish. 

The yearly average of births it is impossible to state accurately. 
Many parents will not be at the trouble or expense of registration. 
Estimating'fromthe number baptized in the parish church, the num- 
ber of births will be about 97 or 98 per annum. The average of 
deaths for the last seven years previous to 1838 has been 73, of which 
19, or 26 per cent, were above seventy years of age, and 9, or 12.33 
per cent, above eighty. Taking the population during these seven 
years as averaging 3700, the annual mortality was 1.973 per cent. 
This very low rate proves the general healthiness of our climate 
and situation. It may be also partly attributed to the copious 
supply of excellent water brought into the town from the high 
gounds above. The yearly average of marriages for the same 
period was 28. 

This parish has few resident heritors. Only five or six families 
of independent fortune reside in it. There are connected with it 
nineteen proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and up- 
wards. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of imperial acres, either constantly 
cultivated or occasionally in tillage, is 8712; those which have 
never been cultivated, and which remain constantly waste or in 
pasture, amount to 803 ; under wood, 506, of which only 2 or 3 
are natural. The rest of the area of the parish is occupied by 
the site of the town with its gardens, by fences, and roads. Pro-, 
bably one-half of the waste land might be reclaimed at a profitable 
rate. The only thing like common occurs in the case of two pieces 



160 



LINLITHGOWSIIIUK. 



of ground ; one of four or five acres, over which a number of peo- 
ple have the right of feal and divot taking turf for putting on the 
ridges of houses thatched with straw ; the other of four acres, on 
which the burgh has the right of holding the annual fairs. The 
trees that are chiefly planted are la-rch, silver, spruce, and Scotch 
firs, oak, elm, ash, and plane. The management of the planta- 
tions is in general good. 

Rent — Wages. — The rent of land varies exceedingly, according 
to situation and quality. Inclosures round the town are sometimes 
let as high as L. 3, 3s. per imperial acre. On the other hand, 
there is land let at very little more than 7s. The average per im- 
perial acre may be 16s. 6d. 

Husbandry. — Sheep are hardly kept in this parish at all. The 
only pure breed of cattle found here is the Ayrshire. Mixed 
breeds are very numerous. The husbandry is fully more pas- 
toral than arable, the vicinity of the metropolis, and the nature 
of the soil, making the dairy a very profitable part of the farmer's 
arrangements. Most of the late improvements in husbandry are 
finding their way into this parish, in so far as climate and soil will 
admit of them. The improvements most required are draining 
and planting. In regard to the latter, some proprietors have of late 
done a good deal. Mr Weir, Senior, of Boghead, has been the most 
extensive improver in this way, having, in the course of twenty 
years, planted 86 acres. But many properties continue almost 
destitute of wood, though its shelter is in this district very valu- 
able. In the way of draining and reclaiming waste land, a great 
deal has of late been done by the resident proprietors, who farm 
their own land, and by tenants. Some tenants have put drains in 
every field of their farms. The ordinary duration of leases is nine- 
teen years. Rents generally are fixed in money. The terms of 
leases are commonly fair to both landlord and tenant. If the sti- 
pulations of a lease are strict, yet deviations from them are never 
challenged, if the proprietor sees that the tenant is doing justice 
to the land. Farm-houses and buildings have latterly been con- 
siderably improved. In very many cases, however, they are much 
inferior to what they should be. This, with want of capital, and, 
in some cases, want of encouragement by the proprietors, are the 
greatest obstacles to improvement in the agricultural state of this 
parish. 

Quarries, Sfc. — Besides the lime and coal-works already noticed, 
there are several freestone and whinstone quarries. Of the for-

mer, only one is constantly wrouglit. It is in the park of Balbar- 
die, and affords a very excellent and beautiful building stone. The 
whinstone quarries are chiefly wrought for materials for the roads. 
Produce. — 

The produce of grain crops averages in value, as nearly as can be as- 
certained, . . . • . L.7541 5 3 
Potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. .... 3448 5 0

Other produce, gardens, woods, &amp;c. at least . . 500 0 0 

Total, . . . L.34541 10 3 

Manufactures. — The mass of the town population is manufac- 
turing. There are about 500 handloom weavers, all supplied with 
work from Glasgow, except a few employed by an Edinburgh 
shawl-manufacturer, and a few engaged with customer-yiovk. 122 
women and girls are employed in tambouring, and 38 in sewing- 
webs. The wages of weaving, though occasionally good, have, 
on the average, afforded but a, scanty remuneration to the work- 
man for years past. Tambouring and sewing webs have, for a 
considerable period, been very inadequately paid. Two brick and 
tile-works afford occupation to several hands. A distillery has 
been in active operation for a number of years. A considerable 
brewery was established somewhat later. 

Associations. — There is an Agricultural Society here, which has 
an annual show, at which premiums are distributed. Its influence 
has been decidedly beneficial. A Horticultural Society has been 
in existence for six years. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Toim.~ T\\e town of Bathgate had in 1841 a population of 
2809. It was originally a burgh of barony, a baron baillie being 
appointed by the proprietor of the estate of Bathgate. In 1824, 
with the consent of the late Mr Marjoribanks of Balbardie, who 
was then superior of the town, an Act of Parliament was obtained, 
by which it was erected into an independent burgh of barony, and 
all provision made for the government, police, &amp;c. of the town. 
It is now governed by a provost, three baillies, treasurer, and twelve, 
councillors, the jrovost, two baillies, treasurer, and four council- 
lors being elected yearly by the burgesses. The burgh funds con- 
sist of road money, customs, common good, and an assessment li- 
mited by the act to Is. -a-pound on the valued rent of the houses 
in the burgh ; from these funds the " paving, lighting, and im- 
provnig the burgh, and establishing a police therein," are defray-

ed. Much has been done in the last four years to improve the 
pavements and causeways ; and, a gas- work having been establish- 
ed, the principal streets are now tolerably lighted. The chief 
employment of the inhabitants is, as already mentioned, manufac- 
turing. There is a weekly corn-market, held on Wednesday, at 
which considerable quantities of grain are sold. It is by much 
the most important market within the county. The National 
Bank of Scotland and the Glasgow Union have each a branch 
here. At the last revision of the roll of electors for the county, 
the number of electors deriving qualifications from property in the 
town was 72. In the landward part of the parish, the number 
was 61 ; total, 133. 

There is only one place deserving the name of a village, viz. 
Armadale, two miles west from the town of Bathgate. 

Means of Communication. — The post-office here receives letters 
twice a-day from the east, and once from the west. But the dis- 
patch of letters is not so convenient, the letter-bags being all made 
up at night. The communications by roads are on all hands very 
commodious, and the roads in general well kept. The turnpike- 
road from Borrowstownness towards Lanark runs for about four 
miles and a-half through the parish, and the middle Edinburgh 
and Glasgow road for a trifle more than seven. On the latter 
there travelled for some years from twelve to eighteen stage- 
coaches daily. All have been given up since the railway was open- 
ed. Good bridges are found wherever bridges are needed. The 
fences consist chiefly of thorns, with here and there a considera- 
ble mixture of beech. Much attention has been paid to them ; 
and generally they are in pretty good order. An act has been ob- 
tained for a railway from Bathgate to the Slamanan Railway ; but 
there is little likelihood of its being soon acted upon. 

Four mills in the parish, two provided with steam-engines, af- 
ford all facility for making flour, meal, and pot-barley. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the town 
of Bathgate, and stands very near the centre of the parish, being 
very little more than four miles from the western, and about three 
miles and a-half from the eastern end of the parish. Only two 
families are above four miles from it. Though built in 1739, it 
is in very good repair. But, built when the population was not 
much more, if more at all, than one-third of its present amount, 
it has become totally inadequate to the number of inhabitants. It 
is seated at the rati of IS inches a-sitting for 719 persons. Ac-

cording to the ordinary method of procedure, the sittings, with the 
exception of the comniunion seats, which are free to every one, 
and the minister's seat, were divided among the heritors in pro- 
portion to the valued rent of their lands, and by them allotted to 
their tenants. From this arrangement it results, that the whole 
inhabitants of the town can have right to sittings only in the seats 
pertaining to the Bathgate property, on which the town is built, 
and even these must be shared with the rural population on that 
property, so that the provision for 2664 persons is just 100 sit- 
tings. Though this is much the worst case, it is not a solitary in- 
stance of inadequate supply. In 1836, when these calculations 
were made, the estate of Barbauchlaw had dwelling on it '217 per- 
sons, while its proportion of sittings is only 33 ; that of Couston 
145 persons, and 36 sittings; that of Boghead, 86 persons and 
27 sittings. One or two other estates, it should at the same time 
be stated, have more than a needful amount of sittings. The utter 
inadequacy of the accommodation has occasioned a number of dis- 
putes about seats, and has compelled some persons to join Dis- 
senting congregations, who otherwise would not have left the Esta- 
blished Church. 

The manse was built in 1828. The glebe is about 1 1 acres in 
extent, and worth, on an average, about L.19. The stipend con- 
sists of L.76, 18s. 2id., 45 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 2 lippies of 
meal, and 19 bolls, 1 peck of barley. 

There are three Dissenting chapels in the parish. Two belong 
to the Relief and the Associate Synod, and the third is at present 
in connection with no religious body. The ministers of all are 
paid by their congregations. 

With the Established Church are connected 2185 persons; 
with the Relief, 674; with the Associate Synod, 193 ; and with 
the other congregation, 267. With congregations out of the pa- 
rish are connected 78 persons, of whom 14 belong to the Esta- 
blished Church, 5 are Episcopalians, and 7 Roman Catholics, 
leaving 353 not belonging to any congregation, or whose religious 
profession was not ascertained at the time of making the census.f 
In none of the places of worship is the attendance on divine ordi- 
nances what it should be. In the Established Church it varies from 

• All the statements here made refer to August 1836, when they were given in 
evidence before the Religious Instruction Commissioners. 

t This number is much larger than that returned by the writer, many having re- 
presented themselves to him as Dissenters, whom tlie Dissenting ministers did not 
acknowledge as belonging to their congregations.

about 500 in summer to 300 in winter. In the three Dissenting 
chapels, which contain 1569 sittings, the average attendance was 
stated by the ministers to be 780, and the number of sittings let 
630; but as these congregations embrace 392 persons beyond the 
bounds of the parish, the proportion, allowing both classes to be 
equally exemjlary, would give an attendance from the parishioners 
of 603, and 487 sittings rented by them. The number of persons 
who have been admitted to the communion of the Established 
Church, and have not been cut off from that privilege, nor have 
joined themselves to any other congregation, is about 6t0 ; but as 
this includes old people who cannot attend, some careless people 
who will not attend, and some whose necessities keep them back 
from the house of God, it is greatly above the number who join 
at any given communion. In winter, about 320, and in summer 
about 350 communicate. 

There is no religious society in the parish. The collections in 
the Established Church for religious and charitable objects, inde- 
pendent of the ordinary collections for the poor, have averaged an- 
nually L.20, 5s. 6d. 

Education. — Besides two schools exclusively for sewing, there 
are three schools in this parish, viz. one parochial, one endowed, and 
one unendowed. In the unendowed school, only English, writing, 
and arithmetic, with a little geography, are taught. The parochial 
schoolmaster, though qualified to teach classical literature, F'rench, 
and mathematics, is seldom required to teach anything more than 
the teacher of the unendowed school. The endowed school is 
an institution known by the name of the Bathgate Academy, es- 
tablished under the will of Mr John Newlands. Mr Newlands was 
a native of the parish, who, after being bred a carpenter, left Bath- 
gate at an early age and proceeded to Jamaica, where by degrees 
he amassed a considerable fortune, and ultimately became a 
wealthy planter. He died in that island in 1799, leaving by his 
will the bulk of his property to certain trustees, " to erect a free 
school in the parish of Bathgate." The will, however, was chal- 
lenged by friends of the testator in Scotland, and the claim of the 
trustees opposed by the executors in Jamaica. The trustees took 
alarm at the prospect of being involved in heavy law expenses, and 
would probably have abandoned the trust, had not one of them, 

 When the will came to be acted on, a numhcr of the nomhiiitioiis to the office 
of trustee fell, from misnomers, &amp;c. The only nominations which held, were those 
of Mr Mnrjoribanks of Balbiirdie, Lord Polkeminet, Colonel Gillon of Wallliouse, 
and the minister of the parish. The eldest sons of the three first, and the successor 
of the last, are llie present trustees.

the late Mr Marjoribanks, given his own personal security to his 
co-trustees, that thev should not be put to expense in the matter. 
After a litigation which lasted till 1814, the will was almost en- 
tirely set aside. Onlv L. 14,500 were received by the trustees, m- 
stead of L.60,000 oi- L.70,000, as the testator intended.  As the 
remittances reached this country, the trustees began to salary the 
teachers in the parish, and to employ others, till they had five 
schools with six teachers in different parts of the parish, to all ot 
which the children of the inhabitants had gratuitous admission. In 
1831, the funds having considerably increased, the trustees com- 
menced the erection of a building to the south-east of the town, 
which was opened as the Bathgate Academy in the autumn of 
1833. It is a handsome structure, consisting of a centre and two 
wings connected by two colonnades. In each wing are two class- 
rooms 36 feet by 24. Behind one of the colonnades is the room 
for writing and arithmetic, 36 by 29. The centre, and the part 
of the building behind the other colonnade, are occupied by the 
library-room and a very good house for the rector. There is a lull 
acre of play-ground in front. There are, at present, four masters 
in the Academy: a rector, who takes charge of all the pupils who 
learn Greek, Latin, or French, and who also has classes for draw- 
ing, music, and composition ; a master for writing, arithmetic, and 
mathematics ; and two for English. The rector and two Knglish 
masters also teach their own pupils geography. A sewing mistress 
was added to the establishment a year ago. 

At these three schools, above 600 scholars are in steady attend- 
ance ; and from 60 to 80 more may be entered in the course of a 
twelvemonth. At the last examination of the Academy, which 
was in August, there were 537 attending, of whom 6 studied 
Greek; 47 Latin; 71 French; i 78 geography ; 71 drew geogra- 
phical sketches ; 75 practised English composition, and were train- 
ed in drawing, and the elements of musical composition ; 368 
learned writing; as many arithmetic; and 8 mathematics. 

The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommodation and 
the maximum salary, and receives about L. 26 in fees. The rec- 
tor of the academy has a free house, garden, and a salary of L. 140 
per annum ; the other three masters each L. 105. The unendow- 
ed teacher receives about L.26 from fees. The rate of fees in the 
parochial school is, for English, 2s, 6il. a-quarter; Enghsh with

writing, 3s. ; and with arithmetic, 3s. 6d. ; I.atin or French, 5«. ; 
practical mathematics, 5s. 

There is hardly a house in the parish so situated as to make it 
a matter of much hardship for a child of six or seven years of age 
to attend some school. The numbers in actual attendance, com- 
pared with the population, show that the people in general are 
alive to the benefits of education. The Academy being free to 
the children of all parishioners, no additional school is needed in 
this parish, though an additional teacher in the Academy would 
be of great advantage. But the funds do not at present admit of 
the addition. 

Literature. — Connected with the Academy, there is a library 
for the use of the pupils, containing above 700 volumes, chiefly 
suited to youth. There is also a subscription library in the town, 
recently begun, and now containing above 280 volumes. 

Friendly Societies. — There are seven such societies in the pa- 
rish ; one, still the largest, instituted some years previous to 1734 ; 
the others respectively in 1759, 1792, 1799, 1806, 1809, and 
1810. They are all supported by annual payments from the 
membei-s, who amount to 969. They are all intended for the 
support of the members in sickness and old age. Some of them 
also pay a certain sum for the funeral charges of the members. 
These societies are of vast benefit to the members ; and though 
it may well be doubted whether they promote industry, they help 
to cherish among them a spirit of independence. 

Savings Bank. — There has been a savings bank here since 
1827. A view of its operations for the last six years shows these 
results :

At the last balancing of the books, there was in the bank L.629,

mechanics, &amp;c. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor are not more numerous 
than might be expected in such a population as that of Bathgate, 
though it must be acknowledged that unwillingness to apply for 
parochial relief is on the decline, and that relatives in many in- 
stances seem to feel little annoyance at those near to them becom- 
ing the objects of public charity.

The proprietors of three-fourths of the land being non-resident, 
the ordinary funds could not be expected to be adequate to the 
support of the poor. The heritors made a voluntary contribution 
for that end ; and to make their contributions equal, ihey are just 
according to the valued rent of their lands. The great increase in 
1 842 is chiefly to be ascribed to the depression of trade. The 
interest is the produce of L. 1100, which was left to the poor of 
Bathgate by Henry Calder, Esq. of Edisto Island, Carolina, a 
native of the parish, in 1820, but was only recovered by the pre- 
sent minister in 1828. The other funds arise from dues.on procla- 
mations, mortcloths, &amp;c. 

Prison. — Bathgate is a sheriffdom by itself, a distinction which 
it probably owes to -its ancient connection with the royal family of 
Scotland. Practi6ally, however, the Sheriff of the county is now 
always appointed Sheriff of Bathgate too. Sheriff-courts are held 
at Bathgate four times a-year. There is a small prison, compris- 
ino- three strong cells for criminals, and a debtors' room, the whole 
government of which is in the magistrates of the burgh. It is 
much too confined to be a very healthy place of confinement. 
During last year 1838 there has been no person confined in it 
either for debt or police offences, but upwards of twenty deserters 
or persons charged with military offences, mostly for a single night, 
on their route either to Glasgow or Edinburgh. 

Fairs, Sfc. — There are seven fairs for the sale of cattle and 
horses held annually in Bathgate, the principal of which take 
place on the Wednesdays after Whitsunday and Martinmas, O. S. 
There are seven inns in the parish ; and, altogether, 31 persons li- 
censed to retail intoxicating liquors. This excessive multiplication 



LINLITIIGOWSHIUK. 

of licenses, and the facility with which they are granted, have 
proved very injurious to the economical and moral habits of many 
of the population. 

Fuel. — The fuel used in this parish is almost entirely coal. The 
use of peat has, almost universally, given place to that of coal. 
The price of the latter varies from 8d. to lOd. a-load. Many of 
the parishioners, however, get coal, not from any of the pits in the 
parish, but from Sir William Baillie's coal-work at Benhar, parish 
of Whitburn, which yields the best coal in this part of the country. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Very great changes have taken place in this parish since the 
foi ■mer Account was published. The middle road between Edin- 
burgh and Glasgow, which is by much the most frequented line 
between these two cities, and which passes through the town of 
Bathgate, was not at that time even contemplated. No direct 
road to the east and west existed, except parish roads, the Hnes, 
levels, and keeping of which, were all extremely bad. Increased 
facility of communication has been of material service in helping 
forward the other improvements, to which the gradual progress of 
the country has been leading. Considerably more than double 
the number of acres is now regularly under the plough ; and, from 
draining, better modes of culture, &amp;c. the produce is even more 
than proportionally augmented. Dairy-farming is now followed 
to a much greater extent than formerly, and has in considerable 
measure taken the place of the feeding of cattle. A very large 
quantity of milk and butter is sent to Edinburgh and Airdrie every 
week. 

The greatest change, however, has been efifected by the intro- 
duction of the cotton manufacture into the town. The increase of 
the population previous to the publication of the former Statistical 
Account, was ascribed mainly to the increase of the coal-works. 
The coal-works then were situated close by the town, and the 
colliers were chiefly resident in it. I'he working of coal is pro- 
bably as extensive now as it was then. But the old works having 
been abandoned, the collier population is now more numerous iu 
the country than in the town. Yet the whole increase of popula- 
tion in the rural part is but 100, while the town population has 
very nearly doubled. One-half of the whole inhabitants of the pa- 
rish are now, in one way or other, dependent on manufactures. 
We share, of course, in both the good and the evil of such occu- 
pations.

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN &amp; TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. ANDREW BELL, D.D., MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Na7ne.—TaE earliest form in which the name of the parish ap- 
pears, is in the charter of David I. to Holyrood, where it is spelt 
LinHtcu. From the time of that prince, the orthography is very 
various, changing with the fashions of different times, and the taste 
of different writers ; thus it appears as Linliscu, Lynlithkon, Lin- 
liscoth, &amp;c. till it assumes its present form, Linlithgow, popularly 
contracted Lithgow. The etymology of the name is variously 
given ; some ascribe to it a British origin, its component parts be- 
ing traced to words in that language, which signify the lake of the 
expansive hollow; others derive the word from the Gaelic, and 
render it, the lake of the grey dog, supporting this opinion by 
a reference to the armorial bearings on the common seal of the 
burgh, which represent a dog tied to a tree,— referring, as is said, 
to the old legend of such an animal being discovered bound to a 
tree on the island which adorns the east end of the lake. An- 
other, and perhaps the most probable etymology, is that which de- 
rives the word from the Saxon, in which language, Linlithgow sig- 
nifies the lake of the sheltered valley, an appellation descriptive 
of the situation of that beautiful sheet of water, which, being the 
most remarkable object in the scenery, would naturally determine 
the name of the town and district. 

Extent, c'C. — The mean extent of the parish is, from east to west, 
about 5 miles, and about 3 from north to south. Its boundaries are, 
on the north, Borrowstownness, Carriden,and Abercorn; on the east, 
Abercorn and Ecclesmachan ; on the south, Uphall, Ecclesma- 
c.han, and Bathgate ; and on the west, Torphichen and the river 
Avon, which divides it from Muiravonside in Stirlingshire. The 
purface of the parish is very unequal ; towards the east and north- 
east it is level, but it rises toward the south, where it is crossed

in its whole extent by that range of hills which runs obliquely 
through a considerable part of the county. Several of the eini'- 
nences in this range within the parish attain a considerable eleva- 
tion : the most remarkable are the heights named Cocklerue and 
Bmny- Craig, the former of which rises more than 600, and the other 
GOO feet above the level of the sea. Nearer the centre of the range 
there is a lower set of heights, named from the now nearly ex- 
tinct village of Riccarton, and connected with the former series by 
lateral rising grounds, which slope down towards the town of Lin- 
lithgow. On the north side of the lake, there is another hill, 
which, though not so elevated as those already named, from its 
neighbourhood to the Frith of Forth, commands a very extensive 
and beautiful prospect. All of these heights are either cultivated 
or in pasture ; some of them are wooded, and the acclivity is gentle. 

Meteorologij.—o regular register has been kept in the parish. 
It may be stated, however, that the prevailing winds are from the 
west and south-west; that the climate is good, and excedingly fa- 
vourable to health. Only a few years back, an individual died in 
the town, considerably above 100 years of age. Several persons 
now living in the parish are above 90 ; while 80 and upwards is no 
uncommon period of life. There are no diseases peculiar to the 
parish : It has often escaped the ravages of those severe epidemics 
which have, from time to time, desolated other parts of the coun- 
try. In 1646, the Scottish Parliament held its meetings in Lin- 
lithgow, when the plague was prevalent in the metropolis. 

Hydrography. — The parish abounds with springs, furnishing a 
copious supply of the purest water. A well at Carubber was for- 
merly resorted to, as possessing similar properties to the Moffat 
Spa ; it is now totally neglected. Even the site of it is known to 
few. 

There is only one loch in the parish — that, on the north bank 
of which the town and palace of Linlithgow are situated. This 
fine lake is about one mile in length, about a-quarter of a mile at 
its greatest breadth, and covers 154 English acres ; in some places 
the depth is considerable. Several springs well up from the bot- 
tom, which, with a rivulet toward the east end, and the surplus 
water from the town, are its feeders. It discharges itself by a 
. rivulet, named the Loch-burn, which, after a short course, emp- 
ties itself into the Avon. Embosomed amid rising grounds, some 
of which are finely wooded, with the gardens to the north of the 
town stretching along its shore, and overlooked by the noble

ruins of the ancient palace— the scenery of this lake is very 
lovely and from several points where the town is not seen, it 
has much the appearance of a sheet of water in some seques- 
tered Highland vale. There is no river properly belonging to the 
parish, "xhe Avon bounds it for several miles on the west, and, 
during that part of its course, presents some very pleasing scenery, 
the effect of which is now much heightened by the aqueduct which 
carries the Union Canal across the valley, and the viaduct which, 
at a lower point, conducts, over the same valley, the Edinburgh 
and Glasgow Railway. 

n. — Civil History. 
With the exception of the account in the last Statistical Ac- 
count, no history of the parish has been published. Copious no- 
tices of it are, however, to be found in the histories of the county, 
published by Sibbald and Penny. A MS. history of the town, 
by Crawford, author of the history of Renfrewshire, is said to 
exist. It may also be stated, that a very beautifully illustrated ac- 
count of the Palace has lately been published by Mr Collie, ar- 
chitect, Glasgow. 

Historical Notices.—Fvom its locality, and the residence of the 
Scottish monarchs in the palace of Linlithgow, the parish has 
been the scene of several memorable incidents. The most re- 
markable of these are mentioned in the last Statistical Account ; 
and the present notices embrace the same incidents, with some addi- 
tional details. It was on the lands now belonging to the town, and 
lying to the east of it, that Edward I. encamped on the night pre- 
vious to the battle of Falkirk, so disastrous to the Scottish patriots 
under Wallace. The warhke monarch slept in the open fields, 
with his horse beside him. During the night the animal struck 
the King on the side. The accident caused great confusion in 
the camp and, to allay the tumult, Edward, regardless of pain, 
mounted his charger, and, by riding through the army, convinced 
the soldiers that he was in safety. The same monarch is said to 
have built a castle or peel at Linlithgow in the year 1300, where 
he spent the following Christmas. This castle was left by him 
garrisoned with English troops. Its capture by the Scottish pa- 
triots was one of the many daring exploits which distinguished the 
war of independence under Bruce. The following account of the 
surprisal is given in Tytler's History of Scotland : " Binny, who 
was known to the garrison, and had been employed in leading hay 
into the fort, communicated his design to a party of Scottish sol- 



172 



LINLITHGOVVSHIUE. 



iliers, whom he stationed in ambush near the gate. In his large 
warn he contrived to conceal eight armed men, covered with a 
had of hay. A servant drove the oxen, and Rinny himself- walked 
carelessly at his side. When the portcullis was raised, and the 
wain stood in the middle of the gateway, interposing a complete 
barrier to its descent, the driver cut the ropes which harnessed 
the oxen ; upon which signal, the armed men suddenly leapt from 
the cart, the soldiers in ambush rushed in, and so complete was 
the surprise, that, with little resistance, the garrison were put to 
the sword, and the place taken." Bruce, who, it is said, was privy 
to the design, rewarded the brave peasant with a grant of lands ; 
and his descendants long survived, bearing in their coat-of-arms a 
hay-wain, with the motto, " virtute doloque." 

Linlithgow is memorable as the place where the remarkable 
apparition warned James IV. against his expedition into England, 
which terminated in the fatal field of Flodden. An aisle in the 
church, where the King was, as Pitscottie says, " verrie sad and 
doUorous, makand his prayers to God to send hinp guid success in 
his voyage," is shown as the place where the scene occurred. 
The probability is, that it was a device of the Queen, then in 
the neighbouring palace, abetted by some of the nobles, in or- 
der to dissuade James from an undertaking to which she and 
many of the nobility were averse. The unfortunate issue of the 
war corresponding with the warning given, would, in that super- 
stitious age, lead men to regard the agent in this device as a mes- 
senofer from heaven. 

In the year 1526, the battle of Linlithgow Bridge was fought 
between the faction of the Earl of Angus, who had the possession 
of the person of James V., then a minor, and the party which 
sought to deliver the Prince from the influence of the Douglases. 
The conflict began on the haugh of Manuel, but the main con- 
flict was close by the village of Linlithgow Bridge, which has given 
its name to the engagement. The Earl of Lennox, the chief of" 
the party opposed to Angus, was, after being promised quarter, 
slain by Sir James Hamilton. The place of his interment was 
long known as Lennox's Cairn. 

The Regent Murray was shot in the street of Linlithgow by 
Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh. The house from which the assassin 
took aim is still shown, though, from the removal of the old front, 
which projected considerably further out on the street than the 
present, it must now present a very difierent appearance. Situ- 
ated in the most narrow part of the town, where the street is not

many feet wide, it presented'a most favourable position for the 
execution of the murder, as the Regent, on horseback, was com- 
pelled to advance slowly, owing to the multitude by which he was 
surrounded. Hamilton, it is said, had the walls of the room hung 
with black cloth, to prevent his shadow being seen ; and the tra- 
dition of the town is, that the neighbouring lane leading to the 
back of the town, where his horse was stationed, was choked with 
bushes and other substances, to retard pursuit. 

At the rejoicings, in 1662, in celebration of the restoration of 
Charles II., Linlithgow obtained an unenviable notoriety in Scot- 
tish history, by the burning of the Solemn League and Covenant. 
This act was not, however, authorized by the inhabitants, but ap- 
pears to have been the deed of the chief actors in it, Mr Ramsay 
the minister, and Mr R. Mylne, then dean .of guild ; both of whom 
had signed the document which, with every circumstance of igno- 
my, they then consigned to the flames. In the records of the 
council there is no minute bearing upon the incident. There is a 
minute of a previous date enjoining the celebration of the restora- 
tion in 1660, which, though not bearing upon this incident, may 
be quoted as a specimen of the manner in which our fathers were 
wont to keep their holidays.

Various meetings of the Scottish Parliament were held in Lin- 
lithgow. The last of them was in 1646, when Edinburgh was infect- 
ed with the plague. A curious minute of the town-council, relating 
to the sitting of this Parliament, may be given as illustrative of the

state of society at the time. " The counsall, upon the coming'

and the groomes and footmen are to pay for their bede 3 shillings." 
In the last Statistical Account, mention is made of a singular in- 
stance of revenge which occurred in the early part of last century. 

Eminent Characters. — Linlithgow is famed as the birth-place of 
the beautiful, but unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots. 

Several of the rectors of the burgh school have been men of emi- 
nence. Among these may be mentioned Ninian Winzet, the rector at 
the time of the Reformation, and who is distinguished as the defen- 
der of the falling Church of Rome, in several encounters with John 
Knox. Kirkwood is a better known individual, as the author of 
the Latin Grammar, which was used in Scotland till superseded 
by that of Ruddiman. He also made himself famous in his day 
by his long controversy with the council, and his satire upon that 
body entitled " The Twenty-seven Gods of Linlithgow." The ce- 
lebrated John Earl of Stair is said to have been educated by Kirk- 
wood, and to have boarded in his house. In later times, the resi- 
dence of the Lord President Blair was in the parish, who built the 
House of Avonton, near to Linlithgow. 

Land-owners. — The principal proprietors of land are Mr Stew- 
art of Physgill ; the Earls of Rosebery, Hopetoun, and Selkirk ; 
Mr Seton of Preston ; and the Duke of Hamilton. 

Parochial Registers, — The earliest date of parochial registers 
is February 1613, and the volumes are regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — Of the Roman period, few remains exist in the 
parish. A Roman road runs along the summit of the height on 
the north side of the lake, terminating, at its western extremity, 
in the parish of Bo'ness, at an old military station on the line of 
the great wall. The road appears to have formed part of the com- 
munications connected with that remarkable rampart. Near to 
the road, an urn containing ashes, was dug up a few years back. 



LINLITHGOW.

In the last Statistical Account, it is said, that, at the bottom of the 
Hill of Cocklerue, vestiges of a military station may be traced ; 
and " that, on an eminence in the south-east of the parish, above 
Ochiltree Mill, traces still more distinct of a camp are to be 
seen." Some years before that Account was written, above 300 
Roman coins were found in the Boroughmuir  

" The Carmelites, or White Friars, had a convent at Linlithgow, 
which stood on the south side of the town. The eminence bears 
still the name of the Friars Brae, and the adjoining well bears a 
similar designation. The application of their revenues cannot 
now be traced. This establishment, in point of antiquity, was the 
third of the kind in Scotland. It was founded in 1290 by the in- 
habitants of Linlithgow, and consecrated to the Virgin Mary. 

" There is said also to have been a monastery of Dominicans or 
Black Friars, here. Some remains of a religious house, probably 
this, may still be discerned in the east part of the town. There 
was also a chapel, sacred to St Ninian, at the West Port, though 
no traces of it now remain. There was another erection of a si- 
milar kind at East Binny, in the extremity of the parish ; but no 
satisfactory account of it can now be had. 

" St Magdalene's, on the east of the town, was an hospitium, or 
place of entertainment for strangers. It had originally belonged 
to a set of Lazarites ; but, on their extinction or secularization, 
it was applied to this purpose, according to the beneficial institution 
of James I. The eminence, at the bottom of which this hospital 
stood was designed Pilgrim-hill." The Union Canal now passes 
over it. 

There are two eminences on the west of the town, on one of 
which. Courts of justice are said to have been held in ancient times. 
The plain below had, probably from this circumstance, the name 
of Doomsdale given, which it still retains. 

To the west of the town, near the bridge, is a field which was 

 They had been deposited in an earthen urn, which the plough broke, and were 
picked up in lumps, by some persons who followed it to gather stones. The town, 
as superior, claimed the treasure. The pieces were not above the size of a sixpence, 
all silver, and having different dates and impressions. They were probably the collec- 
tion of some virtuoso, and, being involved in rust, would furnish a sweet morsel to 
antiquaries. Some coins were also found lately in an old house of the town, when 
the workmen were digging for sand, about 500 in number, — of which 20 were gold, 
the rest silver. Many of them had impressions of the different James's, and some 
of Henry IV. of England. Some of the gold coins were about the size of a guinea, 
otiiers the half. Tliese iiad their lustre unimpaired, but the silver pieces were over- 
grown with rust.

anciently used for military exercises and amusements. It has still 
the name of Joisting-haugh. 

A stone tablet, of elegant sculpture, was, a good many years 
ago, found in digging a grave within the church. One compart- 
ment exhibits our Savour praying, while the three select disciples 
are fast asleep. The other represents him saluted by Judas, and 
seized by the guard. He is at the same time healing the ear of 
Malchus, while Peter is putting his sword in the sheath. Though 
the stone be broken, the figures are not essentially injured. 

The Palace is the most interesting relic of former days, in the 
parish. It is supposed that the site now occupied by the magni- 
ficent ruins of this abode of ancient royalty, was the site of a Ko- 
man station. Some have imagined that Linlithgow is the Roman 
Lindum. Be this as it may : it was very early selected by the 
Scottish princes, as one of their residences. It is supposed that 
there was a royal mansion at Linlithgow, as early as the reign of 
David I., — who occasionally resorted here to enjoy the pleasure of 
the chase, and to consume the local royal revenues " payable in 
oxen, sheep, grain, and other descriptions of produce." The pre- 
sent structure is of much more recent date. In 1424, the Palace 
was consumed by fire, and the oldest portion of the existing edi- 
fice is referred, by competent authorities, to the time of the first 
James. It received considerable additions during the reigns of 
James IV. and his successor ; and the most modern part of it was 
built by James VI. on his visit to Scotland in 1617. It was the 
frequent residence of many of these princes, and was repeatedly, 
with its lake and park, assigned as a jointure house for the Queens 
of Scotland ; — particularly, we may mention, Mary of Guise, who, 
when she saw it, declared that she never saw a more princely pa- 
lace. The sincerity of the compliment was shown by her frequent 
residence. Nor need we wonder at the partiality of our monarchs 
for Linlithgow, — as a more delightful situation cannot be imagined. 
Situated upon an eminence projecting into the middle of the lake, 
which it divides into two nearly equal parts, the Palace commands 
several views of very pleasing scenery ; and when the park was de- 
corated with wood, of which some fine old trees still survive, the 
royal domain must fully have justified the eulogy of Sir Walter 
Scott. To enter into minute details of a building so well known, 
would be superfluous. It may suffice to state, that, as it now stands, 
the Palace is of a quadrangular form, having an open court within, 
on the north side, five stories in height, with a tower in each corner. 



tjNLITHGOW.

It measures 175 feet from north to south, and 165 feet from east to 
west. The appearance of the inner court is particularly imposing. 
Much attention has been paid to the architectural decoration of 
its various fronts, which exhibit some very pleasing effects. The 
centre is occupied by the remains of what has been a magnificent 
fountain, built of white freestone, of superior workmanship, the carv- 
ings being well cut, and highly relieved. The main entrance was 
formerly from the east, which is highly decorated. That, how- 
ever, was closed, and the present one opened by James V. The 
same monarch built the fortified gateway, which leads into the outer 
court. This gateway is said to have been the model of the one 
at Abbotsford. The stranger, after contemplating the tame and 
ungainly aspect of the exterior of the Palace, is much impressed 
with the interior, which, with its remains of ancient grandeur, its 
ruined fountain, and grass- grown court, produces feelings of pleasing 
solemnity in the mind. The principal portions of the building 
which are shown to visitors, are the room where Mary was born, one of 
ample dimensions ; the dining-room, long and narrow ; the chapel ; 
and the Parliament Hall, a noble apartment, measuring 98 feet 
in length, 30 feet in width, and to the summit of the walls, which 
still stand, 35 feet. The building abounds with places of conceal- 
ment, and out-of-the-way corners. One of these is still shown as 
the place where James III, hid himself, during a rebellion of his 
nobles. This noble structure might have been entire to the present 
day, had it not been burned, it is not easy to say whether by acci- 
dent or intention, in the year 1746, by the English dragoons un- 
der Hawley, who were quartered in the dining-room. There is a 
well-known story of the lady Mrs Glen Gordon, who acted as 
deputy-keeper of the Palace, remonstrating with Hawley upon the 
danger likely to result from the large fires his men were kindling; 
the General replied that he did not care though the Palace were 
burnt to the ground, upon which the indignant lady said, " Weel, 
weel, General, an' that be the case, I can rin awa frae fire as 
fast as you," alluding to the General's route at Falkirk. Much is 
now done by the Barons of Exchequer to preserve the venerable 
pile from further decay. The present keeper is Sir Thomas 
Livingstone of Westquarter. 

HI. — Population. 
There is an increase in the last census, to some extent more 
apparent than real : as, at the time it was taken, there was a consi- 
derable surplus population, owing to the operations on the Glas-

gow and Edinburgh Railway, and since the opening of the railway 
many workmen have removed to other districts. 

There are no nobility, and but few individuals of independent 
fortune, residing in the parish. The people are in no respect re- 
markable for personal qualities. The language in common use is 
the ordinary dialect of the Lowlands. 

The only custom which may be mentioned as peculiar to the 
parish is the annual procession of the magistrates, council, mem- 
bers of the various corporations, and others, termed the " Riding 
their Marches." They visit the village of Linlithgow Bridge and 
Blackness, of which the town is the superior ; and at the place last 
named, a court is held by the provost. On the return of the proces- 
sion to the town, the evening is passed in festivity. Though the 
custom might at one thne have been necessary, it is now one 
which would " be more honoured in the breach, than in the ob- 
servance." 

TV. — Industry. 

For the following account of the agriculture of the parish, I am 
under obligations to an intelligent agriculturist. 

Agriculture. — The parish of Linlithgow contains in whole 
11,960 imperial acres, all enclosed and judiciously subdivided. 
The whole may be said to be cultivated, as the planted ground, 
and a few acres upon hill tops inaccessible to the plough, form the 
alone exceptions. The system of culture is of the most approved 
description. On the free lands, the five-shift rotation is generally 
adopted ; upon the clay lands, the six and seven-shifts are followed, 
but all conducted in the same style in which the counties of Ber- 
wickshire and East Lothian are farmed. The soil of the parish may 
be about equally divided between light and heavy. The low dis- 
trict is gravelly and loamy, the high division is stifif, thin, wet soil, 
lying upon a retentive subsoil. 

Draining.— 1\\oxongh draining has done much towards the 
amelioration of the high grounds; but still there is much to do. 
The expense of this drainage falls almost wholly upon the tenants ; 
with the exception of those of the Earl of Rosebery, Captain Stewart 
of Binny, and Mr Seton of Preston, no other proprietor takes any 
part in the expense. 

Farms vary in size from 100 to 400 acres Scots; the average 
may be computed at 180 acres. Rents are payable partly in 
money, and partly in grain, for the most part, from one-half to 
one.fourth in cash, the remainder in grain or oatmeal, convertible

J79 



at the fiar prices of the county. The average rent of the parish 
may be somewhere about L.2 or L.2, 2s. per Scots acre. 

Farm-buildings are commodious, and suited to either rearing or 
feeding. DwelHng-houses are comfortable, and in general large 
enough to accommodate a large family. Several steadings are ex- 
cellent, and one is now in the course of erection upon Champ- 
fleurie estate, which will be very superior. 

Leases— Leases are, in general, granted for nineteen years, and 
the conditions are of the usual style, viz. restrictive during the last 
four years of the endurance. One farm in the highest part of the 
parish let last year is under extreme restrictive conditions, by 
which the tenant is bound to improve. Time will show the result ; 
but never yet was an improvement in agriculture discovered or ef- 
fected by the specialties of an agreement. 

Plantations— The parish is well-wooded. Near the residence 
of the proprietors of the soil, some fine trees are to be seen, but 
large plantations have been lately made, which are now orna- 
mental, and ultimately will be beneficial. The management of 
plantations is now much better understood than formerly, as to 
thinning, training, and drainage of the ground, as also the descrip- 
tion of plants suited to the various soils. 

CaZe.— There is no distinct breed of cattle peculiar to the dis- 
trict ; the mongrel race of nondescripts are all but extinct, and in 
lieu of these, some fine beasts are now reared. In consequence of 
many large dairies being in the vicinity, the Ayrshire cow is the 
prevailing sort. There are also a good many short-horns. The cross 
between these may be said to constitute the breed reared in the 
parish ; but the numbers reared form but a small proportion of the 
stock kept. From the nearness to the great markets held at Fal- 
kirk, the greater portion of animals fattened are bought at these 
trysts. Of sheep there are but few raised ; but a great many more 
are fed than used to be, a few years since. There are a few flocks of 
Leicesters, but these are exceptions. Draught horses are almost 
entirely of the Clydesdale breed ; and there are few counties in 
Scotland better horsed than Linlithgowshire. 

Quarries and Mines. — Lime abounds in the parish. Silver- 
mine, Hillhouse, and Carrubber works are now in full operation. 
Coal is also found in thin seams in the southern part of the parish, 
but none wrought just now. A vein of silver is understood to lie 
in the southern district of the parish, upon Lord Hopetoun's lands.

It was once wrought and lost sight of, and, after several attempts 
to hit upon it were unsuccessful, it has long been given up. Free- 
stone and whinstone are more abundant. Two freestone quarries 
are now wrought, — Kingscavil, from which the palace of Linlith- 
gow was built, — and East Binny, well known in modern public 
buildings in Edinburgh and elsewhere. This quarry is remarka- 
ble for the bitumen which is found in it, and which is sometimes 
melted and made into candles, which burn with a bright flame. 

Manufactures. — This is not a manufacturing district ; but there 
are several species of manufacture in the town and neighbourhood. 
The leather trade, in its various branches, may be called the 
staple of the town. It is said to have been introduced into the 
town by the soldiers of Cromwell. There are 24 master boot 
and shoe-makers, employing 276 journeymen, and 43 apprentices. 
The wages of the former are 10s. per week, and of the latter 3s. 
Thirty women are also employed as women's boot-binders, whose 
weekly wages average 4s. 6d. There are five master tanners, 
employing 28 men in this trade, the rate of wages is determined 
by the skill of the workmen. A tanner, bred to the employment, 
receives 13s. per week, while the average wages of what are called 
labouring tanners, that is, men not brought up to the work, are 
only 9s. The master curriers amount to nine, employing about 
50 men, whose average rate of wages is 14s. per week. In the 
shoe trade, the hours are long — from six to six, and often later. 
In the currying branch of the trade, the men work only ten hours 
a-day. The tanning and currying departments are in a prosperous 
condition, and the shoe-makers are well employed. There was 
a temporary depression in the last-named trade some time back, 
but it has again revived. 

There is a very extensive distillery in the town, which gives 
employment to a number of men. There is also a brewery. 

In the vicinity, upon the river Avon, there is a paper-mill, and 
a large calico-printing establishment, both in full employment ; 
the former produces a considerable quantity of paper, made by 
machinery, and the latter has been, even during the late melan- 
choly depression of trade in other parts of the country, prosperous. 
The village of Linlithgow Bridge is almost entirely dependent 
upon the print field. Two glue-works are also in activity, and 
supply work to a portion of the population. A number of women, 
principally unmarried, are engaged in sewing for Glasgow manu- 
facturino- houses. This employment can scarcely be termed re-

munerative, for the utmost that a female can earn, working with 
the most untiring diligence from morning to night, is about 6d. 
per day— a most miserable pittance, when we consider the toil of 
the over-tasked female, who, however, but for this, scanty as it is, 
would be often entirely destitute. The employments of the ope- 
ratives are generally healthful, and noway injurious to correct moral 
habits. A portion of the workmen are, as in every town, dissi- 
pated ; but this arises from other causes than the nature of their 
occupation : others, again, are highly intelligent and religious, 
most favourable specimens of Scottish intellect and piety. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Town, Sfc. — Linlithgow, which is the county town, is the only 
one in the parish. It is a place of great antiquity. Its earliest 
existing charter, as a royal burgh, is dated in the reign of Ro- 
bert II. ; but, previous to that period, it undoubtedly enjoyed that 
rank, since, in the parliament of David II., held at Perth in 1348, 
it was statute and ordained, " that, so long as the burghs of Ber- 
wic and Roxburgh are detained and holden by English men, the 
burghs of Lanark and Lithcow shall be received and admitted in 
their place," as constituent members of the court of the four 
burghs. In early times, when the residence of the Scottish mo- 
narchs, it was a place of considerable importance, trade, and opu- 
lence, and, though shorn of its former splendour, it has by no 
means sunk so low as many other towns once of consequence, but 
now lost sight of, in the increase of younger and more active 
communities. It extends about a mile along the high road be- 
tween Edinburgh and Stirling, along the south bank of the lake 
already mentioned. The principal portion of the population is con- 
fined to this single street, which is of various width, expanding at the 
cross into a large open square, narrowing in other places to but a 
few feet, and widening at either end. The place has an antique air, 
many of the houses having that aspect of decayed grandeur, which 
testify to the power and opulence of their ancient owners. It is, 
however, gradually changing in its look of " venerable eld," as mo- 
dern buildings are usurping the place of these worn-out edifices. 
Several houses are still called Templar Tenements, having been 
the property of the preceptory of the Knights of St John at Tor- 
phichen. The superiority of these tenements has now, with one 
exception, been acquired by the town-council. Mention has been 
made of the trade of the town and its principal antiquities, under

LINLITHGOWSHIUE. 



previous heads. It is governed by a council, consisting of twenty- 
seven members, including provost, four bailies, dean-of-guild, and 
treasurer. There is no local police, the public peace being suffi- 
ciently preserved, in ordinary circumstances, by the town-officers. 
Formerly the council appear to have exercised an authority which 
would now be deemed despotic. In their minutes, various acts, 
for example, occur in relation to the observance of the Sabbath. 
One of these is as late as the year 1711, which enforces church at- 
dance, shutting of the shops of brewsters and tapsters under a pe- 
nalty, and forbids walking on that day in the yards and yard heads un- 
der penalty of a fine, — holdingparents answerablefor their children, 
and masters for their servants and apprentices ; and in the follow- 
ing year, the council, for the preservation of the peace of the town, 
order a guard of fifteen burgesses to keep watch and ward nightly, 
from ten o'clock till five o'clock in the morning. If any should be 
absent when regularly calledin his turn, his house to be poinded next 
day for payment of a fine of L.12 Scots. At an earlier period, a 
similar act, calling upon the burgesses to march, on some public oc- 
casion, is enforced under pain of death. The town is amply supplied 
with the finest waters, brought from springs in the high grounds to 
the south of the town, and distributed throughout the various public 
wells. One of these in particular deserves notice, — the crosswell, re- 
built in 1816 by a one-handed mason, in exact imitation of a previ- 
ous structure which had gone to decay. It is of a hexagonal figure, 
adorned with a variety of sculptural and grotesque figures, said to 
have been originally designed in ridicule of the irregular habits of 
the regular Romish clergy. It has thirteen very beautiful jWs d'eau, 
and the whole is crowned by a lion rampant, supporting the royal 
arms of Scotland. The town is also lighted with gas. The revenue 
of the town amounts to about L.700, arising chiefly from property, 
the borough mills, and the town and bridge -customs. Alexander II. 
had bestowed the mills of Linlithgow, with all their pertinents, on 
the priory of Manuel, of which the remains are still to be seen on 
the opposite side of the river. These, in 1586, were granted to the 
town by Lady Jane Livingston, prioress of that convent, on condi- 
tion of their paying annually 20 merks Scotch. That grant was 
renewed after the Reformation by James VI., and other privileges 
conferred, by a charter of novodamus in 1592. The bridge-custom 
was exacted in terms of ancient charters, giving the town right of 
custom from Avon Bridge, to the sea. A claim has been made on 



LINLITHGOW. 



183 



the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway for payment of the ordinary 
dues on goods carried by the Company across the Avon and through 
the burgh ; and though the claim has been resisted, the council 
are prosecuting it with a reasonable prospect of success. Should it 
be successful, it will add immensely to the revenue, placing very 
ample funds at the disposal of the council for burgh purposes. 
At one time, the town had an exclusive right of trade from the 
water of Cramond to the mouth of the Avon ; and when North 
Queensferry was created a royal burgh, the design was resisted by 
Linlithgow, on the ground of its infringing the privileges of the 
latter. The matter, however, was compromised by the Ferry, 
among other articles, paying ten merks Scotch annually, which 
sum is still exacted. Linlithgow ranks as the sixth in order of 
the Scottish burghs. By act of Parliament, it had the charge of 
the standard firlot measure ; but since the introduction of the im- 
perial measures, the Linlithgow firlot is only a matter of antiqua- 
rian curiosity. The town house was built in 1668, and contains 
the jail. Sheriff- Court-house, and town-hall. The county build- 
ino-s in the rear of the town-house are plain in their exterior. 
The hall is a fine apartment, adorned with fine portraits of John 
Earl of Hopetoun by Raeburn, and of Sir Alexander Hope by 
Watson Gordon. The town enjoys the benefit of a branch of the 
Commercial Bank. 

Means of Communication. — There is one post-office in the pa- 
rish, that of Linlithgow. The district enjoys the advantage of ex- 
cellent roads. There are, in the parish, about seven miles of turn- 
pike road, under the management of two separate trusts. These 
roads are in good order, and the funds of the trusts are in a better 
state than most, having but a small amount of debt. The parish 
roads extend to about thirty miles, and are in a good state of repair. 
They have been sixteen years under the management of one indi- 
vidual. The Union Canal and the Edinburgh and Glasgow Rail- 
way both pass through the parish. There is a railway station 
at Linlithgow, where all the regular trains call, and from which 
omnibuses run to Bathgate and Bo'ness. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which, being situated in the 
town, is near the mass of the population, is a very fine building, of 
great antiquity, and one of the most perfect existing specimens of 
the early ecclesiastical architecture of Scotland. It is supposed to 
have been founded by David I., that " sair saiint for the crown."

LlNLITHGOWSHIRi:. 



By recent measurement, its length is 187 feef, and its breadth, in- 
chiding the aisles, 105 feet. From the centre of the west front 
there rises a square tower, which was formerly surmounted by an 
imperial crown. This, however, was removed a number of years 
ago, from an apprehension that it was too weighty for the tower. 
At the time of its removal, it was proposed to replace it by a si- 
milar crown made of iron. This, however, has never been effect- 
ed. Some of the windows are very beautiful, and, previous to the 
Reformation, the exterior was decorated with statues, of which 
only one now remains, that of St Michael, the old patron saint of 
the burgh. The church, with its pertinents, was assigned by Da- 
vid 1. to the prior and canons of St Andrews. It was afterwards 
served by perpetual vicars, several of whom attained high rank in 
the church. Formerly, the west end was used as the place of wor- 
ship. In 1812, the east end was fitted up as a church at a cost of 
nearly L. 4000, and now forms a very elegant church, seated for 
1100 persons. The charge was once collegiate, but has been long 
single. In some accounts, mention is made of an abrogated pa- 
rish, that of Binny, having been, at the Reformation, united to the 
parish of Linlithgow. Some, however, doubt whether Binny was 
ever a distinct parish, and conceive that the chapel there was sub- 
sidiary to the church of Linlithgow. There is now an excellent 
manse built, since the last Statistical Account was written. The 
glebe is valued at about L, 11 per annum, and the stipend ave- 
rages somewhere about L. 300, There are two congregations con- 
nected with the United Secession Church in the parish, one place 
of worship containing about 600 sittings and the other nearly 500. 
The former was rebuilt, not many years ago, at an expense of 
L. 1 150. There is also a congregational chapel lately rebuilt, at 
an expense of L. 700, and containing about 350 sittings. More 
recently, a congregation has been formed in connection with the 
Free Protesting Church. They have it in contemplation to erect 
a place of worship ; their number cannot be correctly stated, but it 
is believed that it is on the increase. When the Church Commis- 
sion was here, it was computed by the Established minister, that 
there were 1300 Dissenters in the parish, and by one of the Se- 
cession ministers, that there were 1526,— all the rest being church- 
men. Since then, their relative numbers have not changed, with 
the exception of the recent secession from the EstabHshinent, the 
extent of which, as already mentioned, cannot be distinctly slated.

The members of all the religious bodies contribute to the support 
of the religious and benevolent objects of the respective denomina- 
tions ; in some cases liberally. There were various religious In- 
stitutions in the town, but for some time past they have been in 
abeyance. It is hoped, that they will soon revive into more than 
former activity. 

Education. — There are nine schools in the parish. Of these 
one is the burgh school, under the patronage of the town-coun- 
cil, and the rector of which receives a salary of L.30 per annum ; 
another is a charity school for girls, founded by Mrs Douglas, 
sister of the late Dr Dobie, minister of the parish; the rest are 
private unendowed schools. The burgh school had formerly 
two teachers; but since the election of the present rector, there has 
been no assistant. In former times, it would appear from some 
old minutes of council that there had been a music school, under 
the patronage of the council, though no information can now be 
given regarding it. In 1834, there were 547 children attending 
all the schools in the parish, and since then the number has not 
decreased. 

Literature. — Dr Henry the historian left his valuable library to 
the parish. For a series of years, it continued to prosper, but for 
a considerable period, it has been completely neglected, the books 
being left to decay on the shelves, without one single reader. It 
is difficult to say what is the reason of this singular fate of a be- 
quest which, in most circumstances, would have fared very diffe- 
rently. The cause commonly assigned is the terms of the bequest. 
The presbytery and town-council were to enjoy the benefit of the 
library upon paying 5s. per annum, the members of the former 
body having the first reading of all new works. Other readers 
were to pay 10s. annually, and to wait for the new productions 
often till they had become old. Such a constitution could 
scarcely be expected to insure prosperity. Various efforts have 
been made to revive the library ; but, until some alteration is ef- 
fected in the terms of admission, it is to be feared they will be all 
hopeless. 

There is a subscription library at Linlithgow Bridge, and one 
in connection with the First United Secession Church, which, 
upon payment of a small annual sum, is open to all who choose 
to read. 

There is a news-room in the town, and a society for the purchase 



186 



LINLITMGOWSHIUE. 



and perusal of periodicals. A small monthly sheet, entitled Dick's 
Advertiser, is published in Linlithgow, and circulated through- 
out the county, and the eastern district of Stirlingshire. 

Charitable Institutions. — There are nine Friendly Societies in 
Linlithgow, the Masons', Dyers', Gardners', Crispins', Tanners', 
Trades' Friendly, Odd Fellows, and Rechabites. The main ob- 
ject of these Societies is, for the purpose of alimenting sick and de- 
cayed members. Their funds are raised by monthly and quarter- 
ly subscriptions of the members. The rate of aliment differs. 
One of them, the Dyers, in addition to the aliment they give, al- 
lows a small sum annually for educating the children of deceased 
members between six and twelve years of age. They also give a 
sum in the shape of funeral expenses at the death of a member or 
a member's wife. The Rechabite Society is founded upon the 
principle of total abstinence, a member forfeiting all claim to its 
benefits, should he violate the pledge. Several of these Societies 
have accumulated money and property to a considerable extent, 
and all of them are prosperous. Their term of existence is va- 
rious. Some are of long standing, others are very recent. Several 
of them have existed as Societies, long prior to their becoming 
Friendly, — as, for example, the Society of Gardeners has existed for 
several centuries, the person who founded it having been Gardener 
to the palace in its days of splendour, and the individual by whom 
the fine old trees which still beautify its eastern front, were plant- 
ed. As Friendly Societies, the oldest is that of the Dyers, which 
has existed for eighty years ; then the Gardeners, which has exist- 
ed for sixty years ; the Tanners, also sixty ; the Crispins, nineteen ; 
the Masons, thirty-two ; the Rechabites, two years ; and the Odd 
Fellows, a branch of the Manchester Union, only a few months. 

The Incorporated Trades who have funds, give a small annual al- 
lowance to decayed members. These allowances are more cha- 
ritable, than granted as a matter of right. 

Poor. — There are at present about 140 persons on the poor's 
roll ; the number having very considerably increased within the 
last two years. The monthly distribution is about L. 24. The 
rate per month varies according to the circumstances of the per- 
son, from 2s. to I5s. The rent of land belonging to the session, 
together with the collections at the church doors, and other dues, 
has, till within these last two years, been sufficient for all expenses. 
Prison. state of the prison here has been materially im-

proved within these last few years, under the inspection of the 
Prison Board. The number of prisoners confined during last 
year, was 123. This, however, includes the county, and affords 
no criterion by which to judge of the amount of crime in the pa- 
rish. The prison is well secured, and every attention paid to the 
health and even comforts of the prisoners ; each cell is healed 
with a stove and lighted with gas, regularly cleaned, and as well 
ventilated as the situation of the prison will admit. Each pri- 
soner, when brought in, is washed and clothed in a prison dress. 
The diet is excellent, consisting of six ounce of oatmeal made in- 
to porridge, for breakfast, with three-fourths of a pint of buttermilk. 
Dinner, ox-head broth, four ounce barley, four ounce bread, and 
a proportion of vegetables, each alternate day, pease-brose, fish, 
and potatoes. Supper the same as breakfast. Provision is also 
made for the religious instruction of the prisoners ; in addition to 
the services of a chaplain, each cell is provided with a Testament. 

Mr Alison the governor instructs the male-prisoners, who cannot 
read or write ; and his wife, the female prisoners. Many of them 

appear to value the instruction they receive, and some of them 
make considerable progress. A new jail is to be immediately erect- 
ed, in which greater facilities will exist for the exercise of the im- 
proved prison discipline. 

Pairs. — There is a weekly market, and six annual fairs in Lin- 
lithgow. 

jnns. — There are two inns in the town, one adjoining the Rail- 
way station, of a superior class. There are a number of public- 
houses. It would be well for the town, were they much reduced 
in number ; for many of them only serve to administerto the crav- 
ings of intemperance. 

Fuel — The only fuel used is coal, which is procured from the 
Duke of Hamilton's and other coal pits to the west, and from 
Borrowstownness. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was written, considerable 
changes have taken place in the parish. Several branches of trade 
then prosecuted in the town are now extinct, such as the trade in 
wool, then a staple commodity, carpet -weaving, and tambouring in 
factories. But though various branches of trade have become ex- 
tinct, there is no reason to imagine that any great decline has taken 
place in the prosperity of the town ; population has increased, and 



188 



LiNLlTHGOWSHiriE. 



the general comforts of the inhabitants augmented. In agricul- 
ture, the change has been great. But though agriculture be as 
far advanced as in any district, and little remains to be desired in 
the matter of improved communication, — much may yet be done 
to promote the happiness and comforts of the people.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. ROBERT LORIMER, LL.D. \ MINISTERS 
THE REV. JOHN COOK, / 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Haddington, the county town of Haddingtonshire, or 
East Lothian, hes in 55° bl' north latitude, 17 miles east from 
Edinburgh, on the great post road to London. The name, though 
apparently of Saxon origin, is of uncertain etymology. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The parish is 6 miles in length; 6 in 
breadth; and contains 22 miles square, orabout 12,000 acres Scots. 
It was formerly of much greater extent; but in 1674 part of it was 
annexed to the smaller parish of Athelstaneford ; and in 1692 a 
considerable portion, including several baronies on the west, was 
taken off to make up the new parish of Gladsmuir. On the north 
it is bounded by part of the lands of Gladsmuir, Aberlady, and 
Athelstaneford ; on the east by Prestonkirk and Morham ; on the 
south by Yester and Bolton; and on the west by Gladsmuir. 
The parish has chiefly a northern exposure, the land gradually ris- 
ing from the vale of PefFer, near the sea, to the height of Brown's 
Hill, which looks down upon the village of Gilford. 

Topographical Appearances. — The appearance of the parish 
is beautifully diversified by a waving irregularity of surface, thriv- 
ing plantations, well enclosed and richly cultivated fields, ex- 
tensive parks of verdant pasture, and elegant seats of the nobi- 
lity and gentry. Besides trees disposed for ornament around the 
seats of the nobility and gentry, there are plantations of some ex- 
tent on the grounds of Amisfield, running up in broad regular 
belts to the Garleton Hills ; on the south of Stevenson ; on the 
higher grounds of Coalston ; and on the lands of Sir Thomas Hep- 
burn, Bart, towards Gladsmuir. On some parts of Coalston are 
copse woods, composed of dwarf or Scotch oak, the hazel, the 
birch, and other indigenous trees, which seem to be a remnant of 

HADDINGTON. A

that species of copse which, it is said, in early times covered the 
greater part of the south of Scothxnd. Coalston wood is mention- 
ed in some of the ancient deeds of the family so far back as the 
thirteenth century. 

The climate is very salubrious, remarkably free from endemic 
disease, or visitation of contagious fever. It is still, however, in the 
recollection of aged people, that in their early days, some were laid 
aside from work every spring, with ague : but now, the soil being 
so well drained, this disease is rarely if ever heard of in the district. 
There are at present upwards of 150 persons above seventy years 
of age, a considerable number beyond eighty, and several above 
ninety. As an instance of extraordinary longevity in one family, it 
seems worthy of record, that Alexander Maitland, and Catherine 
Cunningham, were married 6th August 1657. The ages of nine 
of the children of this marriage amounted to no less than 738 years. 
Another thing remarkable of this marriage is, that the eighteenth 
year of it produced trines, and the twenty-first twins. The ages of 
the trines amounted to 256. 

Hydrography. — The Tyne is the only river in the parish. Its 
source may be traced into the parish of Crichton, about twelve miles 
westward. After receiving the tributary streams of Salton and 
Coalston, it passes through Haddington, dividing the burgh from 
the suburb of Nungate, and proceeding nine miles eastward, falls 
into the sea below Tyninghame, about a mile to the westward 
of Dunbar. Though generally of moderate breadth and depth 
averaging ten or twelve yards in breadth, two feet in depth, and 
flowing, when unimpeded by embankments, somewhat less than two 
miles an hour, yet being as a trough to a large extent of sloping 
surface, particularly the Lammermoor range of mountain on the 
south, it sometimes suddenly swells, and overflowing its banks oc- 
casions considerable damage. There are four stone bridges over 
it in the parish. 

It is stated by the Rev. Dr Barclay in a former account of the 
parish of Haddington, Transactions of Antiquaries of Scotland, 
Vol. i. page 46, on the authority of Fordun, lib. xiv. c. 21, 
" That on Christmas eve 1358, there happened a most extraordi- 
nary inundation. The rivers swollen by excessive rains, rose above 
their banks and swept away many villages, houses, and bridges, and 
many persons lost their lives whilst endeavouring to save their pro- 
perty, not only cattle but tall oaks and other large trees were torn 

up by the roots and carried off to the sea. Sheaves of corn were

carried otF the adjacent fields, from whence it appears that the har- 
vest that year must have been remarkably late. As it approached 
the Abbey of Haddington, a nun snatched up the statue of the 
Virgin, and threatened to throw it into the water, unless Mary 
protected her Abbey from inundation. At that moment the river 
retired," says Bowmaker, the continuator of Fordun, "and gradu- 
ally subsided within its limits." On consulting, however, Goodall's 
edition of Fordun's Scotichronicon the words are " In vigilia nati- 
vitatis nostrcB Domince" not nostri Domini, as some must have 
read or imagined, that is, the 7th of September, the nativity of the 
Virgin Mary being the 8th of that month. In Hearne's edition of 
Fordun, Vol. iv. p. 1053, the words are, " In vigilia nativitatis 
beatse virginis." The harvest that year, therefore, was not late. It 
is probable that Dr Barclay proceeded on the high authority of Lord 
Hailes, who mentions it in his Annals among the miscellaneous and 
memorable occurrences of that year. 

It appears by our MSS. histories, that upon the festival of St 
Ninian, 1421, the waters, by constant rains, swelled to such a 
height, that there were a great many houses entirely defaced in 
the town, and the people went into the church in a boat, so that the 
Sacristy, with their fine library and ornaments for divine service, were 
greatly damaged,  Spottiswood's Account of Religious Houses in 
Scotland, p. 274. A similar flood happened on the 4th October 
1775, which was 350 years after. The Tyne then rose seventeen 
feet above its level in less than an hour, and inundated more than 
half the town in its vicinity. This sudden swell is supposed to 
have been owing to the bursting of a water-spout to the southward 
above Gilford, as there was not much rain to the north or in the 
neighbourhood. As this happened during the day, mercifully no 
lives were lost. 

Geology. — There are few sections, natural or artificial, in the pa- 
rish, from which one can ascertain the disposition and direction of 
the strata. The rock of which the Garleton range of hill is com- 
posed appears to be a secondary trap, approaching to what is cal- 
led cHnkstone, contemporaneous with North Berwick Law and Trap- 
rain, the two principal heights in the neighbourhood. Heavy 
spar is found near the west end of the hills. In the lower grounds 
is sandstone of different colour and quality. The alluvial matter 
m the bed of the river is the debris of secondary trap, with nodules 
of quartz. 

There are no mines in the parish. It appears from the ancient 



4 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



records of the burgh, that attempts have been made at different 
times for 300 years back, to obtain coal from lands belonging to 
the town on the borders of Gladsmuir. In 1823, the attempt was 
renewed, and L. 1800 at least expended on the trial, but without 
Success. The thinness of the coal seam did not repay the work 
and remunerate the proprietors. 

The only mineral spring in the parish is a weak chalybeate at 
Dobson's well, about half a mile west of the town of Haddington. 

The soil of the parish is various. In some places, towards Glads- 
muir, it is thin and of inferior quality : but in general it is good, 
and in a high state of cultivation. 

11. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — Haddington, as appears from the Civia 
quatuor Burgorum, is a town of great antiquity; but when it was 
erected into a royal burgh is uncertain — its ancient records having 
been destroyed by the inroads of the English, who several times 
burnt the town and laid it waste. There is a charter  amongst 
the public records, from James V., dated 1542; but the most an- 
cient charter in the records of the burgh is one from James VI., 
dated 13th January 1624, confirming all their ancient rights and 
privileges. Haddington is the tenth in the order of precedency 
among the royal burghs, and pays L. 1, 16s. in every L. 100 of their 
assessments. 

There are only two villages in the parish, and both inconsi- 
derable. Of the one, St Lawrence House, about a mile to the 
westward of the town of Haddington, there is neither record nor 
tradition of any importance ; the other is the Abbey, somewhat 
more than a mile to the eastward. Here in 1178, Countess Ada 
of Northumberland, mother of Malcolm IV. and William the Lion, 
Kings of Scotland, founded and richly endowed a convent or priory 
of Cistertian nuns, which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary; and 
here on the 7th July 1548, the Parliament of Scotland was con- 
vened, and their consent obtained to the marriage of the young 
Queen Mary with the Dauphin, and her education at the court 
of France. 

Haddington was the first place in Scotland visited by cholera 
asphyxia in 1831. This pestilential disease, originating in the 
jungles of Hindostan about the year 1817, and progressing west- 
ward, after spreading death and destruction over a vast extent of 
territory, reached the eastern coast of Britain in summer or autumn 

• It is noticed as a demesne town of the Scottish King in the twelftli century.

-1831. From Sunderland and Newcastle, its next step was to Had- 
dino-ton, passing over the intermediate country and populous towns 
of Berwick and Dunbar. As soon as its arrival was ascertained, 
a board of health was formed, and the most prompt measures 
were used for cleansing the streets and alleys of the town ;  white- 
washing and fumigating infected or suspected houses, liberally 
distributing flannel clothing to the poorer classes, and amply sup- 
plying them daily with nourishing food from a soup-kitchen. A 
commodious hospital was found and fitted up to receive patients, 
and the medical faculty were in constant attendance. The num- 
ber of cases in all was 125, of which were, 50 men, 66 women, 1 
boy, and 8 girls. Of these 57 died, two or three of the cases hap- 
pened to be passing strangers who brought the disease with them. 
It chiefly attacked the intemperate and dissipated in the humbler 
ranks, though others of better condition and habits, but of feeble 
constitution, fell victims to its violence. It reached Haddington on 
17th December 1831, and entirely left the place on 22d February 
following. In one night there were 8 deaths. The expenses incur- 
red during these two months amounted to about L. 400, of which 
L. 150 were contributed from the county subscription fund, L. 112 
by collections at the church doors, and the remainder by voluntary 
subscription. 

Seats of the Nobility and Gentry. — The landward part of the 
parish is studded and embellished with the family seats or mansions 
of the nobility and gentry ; — Amisfield, on the south bank of 
Tyne, belonging to the Earl of Wemyss and March ; Stevenson, 
about half a-mile to the eastward, the seat of Sir John Gordon 
Sinclair, Bart. ; Lennoxlove, anciently Lethington, about a mile to 
the south of Haddington, the seat of Lord Blantyre. Part of this 
latter mansion is very ancient, having been built by the Giffbrds. 
The square tower, it is believed, is not surpassed in strength and 
height by any fortalice in Scotland. Lethington was long the chief 
residence of the Lauderdale family. Sir Richard Maitland, and 
Secretary Maitland lived here, and John Duke of Lauderdale was 
born, and spent most of his days in same place.f A little to the 

• The change of name was made by Alexander Lord Blantyre in honour of, and 
gratitude to his relation and munificent benefactress, Frances Duchess of Lennox and 
Hichmond, who, by a large bequest, enabled him to purchase it. She was a lady of 
great beauty and accomplishments, and so passionately admired by Charles 11. that 
he sought to honour her by having her person represented on the coinage under the 
embleniatic figure of Brilannia. 

f '1 he first park wall, enclosing an extent of surface somewhat more than a mile 
square, was built by the Duke of Lauderdale in the space, it is said, of six weeks, 
in consequence of a sarcastic remark of the Duke of York — intimating that, before

east is Monkrigg, the elegant new mansion of the Honourable Cap- 
tain Keith, R. N. To the south, again, and within view of Lennox- 
love .is Coalston, the seat of the family of Brown, the most an- 
cient family in the parish, now possessed by its amiable and ex- 
cellent representative, the Countess of Dalhousie. On the north 
of the Tyne, and west of the town of Haddington, are the estates 
and Houses of Clerkington, belonging to Colonel Robert Houston : 
Letham, the property of Sir Thomas Hepburn, Bart. ; Alderston, 
that of Robert Stewart, Esq. M. P. ; and Huntington, of William 
Ainslie, Esq. 

Eminent Men. — It appears that Haddington was at one time a 
royal residence, and that Alexander H. was born there in the year 
1198. But it is much more distinguished as the birth-place of the 
illustrious Scotch Reformer, John Knox. He was born in the Gifford- 
gait, adjoining to the town, in 1505, and afterwards educated at the 
grammar-school of the burgh. Some writers, misled probably by 
the name of the GifFord-gait, or way that leads to GifFord, have 
said, " that he was born at Gilford, near Haddington." But, 
in the first place, immemorial, unopposed, unchallenged tradition 
has fixed this suburb of Haddington on the old GifFord road, as the 
place of his nativity, and the site of the house is still shown ; and 
next, though GifFord, as a barony, has existed and been known by 
that appellation since Hugh de GifFord settled in East Lothian 
under David I., and received from William the Lion the manor of 
Yester ; yet there is reason to believe that GifFord, as a village, did 
not exist in the time of the Reformer, nor for more than a century 
afterwards. Indeed the present village of GifFord is comparatively 
of modern origin ; owing its rise and locality chiefly to the removal 
of the ancient church of Bothans from the vicinity of the mansion 
house of Yester to its present site, about the beginning of the eight- 
eenth century. Previous to this period, tradition speaks only of a 
single house there, Gifford-ha\ which, in the colloquial parlance 
of the country, is still applied to designate the village. 

his fii"st visit to this part of the island, he heard there was not so much as a park in 
Scotland. The wall was twelve feet in height, but many years ago, was reduced to 
seven. At this place the excellent species of apples called Lethingtons were first cul- 
tivated, having been brought from France about the middle of the sixteenth century. 

 The following extracts from the records of the town-council of Haddington, which 
extend as far back as 6th March 1424, are illustrative of the antiquities of the burgh 
and of those olden times as to education. " October C, 1559. The council thought it

The Ministers of Haddington.In 1531, Sir James Mauchlyne i« "ent " 
as curate of the kirk of Haddington, Sir Thomas Mauchlyne Lady Pnest there 
and Sir Patrick Mauchlyne, Count kirk master m the same.-It may observed 
that the title Sir was not formerly peculiar to knights; it was also given to priests 
and sometimes to inferior personages. Dr Johnson thinks this title J:'];', 
such as had taken the degree of A. B. in the universities who are styled do7mm, Sir , 
to distinguish them from the M. A.'s who are styled Tnairfn, masters—Percy s Heli- 

""Mratrick Cockburn, son to Cockburn of Langton, was the first Protestant miiiis- 
ter settled at Haddington after the Reformation. Having, when young, entered into 
holy orders, he went over to the university of Paris, where he taught the Oriental 
languages with great applause. On returning home he embraced the reformed re- 
ligion, Ind officiated as minister of Haddington till his death m 1568. Dempster 
characterizes him as the most learned and moderate of all the Scotch reformers. On 
31st March 1570, the council ordained John Ayton, Provost, and Barnard Thom- 
son, bailie, to pass to Edinburgh to mein to the session for a minister— that is apply- 
to the session to obtain a minister. On 13th April same year, the council ordained 
the Provost and " ane othair honest man with him" to pass to the Assembly ot l.din- 
burgh, at midsummer next to get an answer to the giving of a minister to the town, 
—June 14th. To speik the kirk for obtaining a minister and his stipend — 25 August, 
the council ordained John Douglas, bailie, to pass to Edinburgh, to convoy the mi- 
-nister, Mr James Carmichael, to the burgh against Sunday next, 1571 — 1572, January 
10. The council authorized the treasurer to deliver to Mr James Carmichael, mi- 
nister, X. merks, to pay his « chalmer maill" for one year from Martinmass in the year 
of God 1571 years alanerlie. From the presbytery records it appears that the cure 
of the churches of Haddington, St Martin's in the Nungate, and Athelstaneford were 
served by Mr James Carmichael from 1592 to 1602. Mr George Grier was ordain- 
ed minister of St Martin's church in 1602. Mr Carmichael was also schoolmaster, 
for which he received forty pounds Scots yearly. But May 28th 1574 the provost, 
bailies, and council, with advice of the deacons, stated and ordained, that in no time 
coming the minister of the kirk should be admitted schoolmaster of the burgh — -1 588, 
December 9th, An act was passed respecting a manse for the minister. The highest 
stipend of the reformed clergy was 1,. 600 Scots; the fourth minister of Edinburgh 
had only L. 60, being little more than L. 5 Sterling — 1572-73, February 28. The 
council conducit Mr Walter M'Canquell BalcanqueU to read the common prayers 
in the kirk at vii, hours before noon in summer, and viii. hours in winter, and that on 
Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday, and to be clerk in the session and doctor m the 
school — the council agreeing to pay to said reader 50 merks in the year. 

Members of Parliatnent. 20 November 1579. The council authorized the trea- 
surer to pay ito James Cockburn his expenses at the parliament, extending to xxiii. 
days ; and to William Brown xiii. days ; and to John Thomson xxiiii. days, each day js. 
money. 

On 5th October 1669, John Hay of Baro, was elected commissioner to the Par- 



a 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



tury by the purchase of Lethington, which was afterwards their 
chief residence. Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington, born in 
1496 and died 1586, aged 90 years, was a man of distinguished 
merit and abiUties. He was many years a Lord of Session and 
Lord Privy- Seal. Two small vol umes of his poems have been pub- 
lished by Mr Pinkerton. The eldest son, William, was secretary 
of state during the reign of Mary Queen of Scots. The character 
and fate of this accomplished statesman are well known. All his 
brothers were men of uncommon merit and talents, and, like him- 
self, reflect a lustre on the place of their nativity. John, the se- 
cretary's next brother, rose to the highest offices and honours in 
the state, being advanced to the dignity of Lord High Chancellor 
of Scotland, which he held till his death, 3d October 1595. In 
1590, he was created Lord Maitland of Thirlestane. Thomas, 
the youngest brother of the Secretary and Chancellor, was high- 
ly accomphshed as a scholar and gentleman. He is one of the 
Colloqutors in Buchanan's celebrated dialogue, " De jure regni 
apud Scotos." Some of his Latin poems published by Scotstarvet 
are extremely elegant. John Earl of Lauderdale, son and heir of 
the Chancellor, was a nobleman of the greatest worth.f 

liament, and allowed 6s. 8d. per day for his expenses. The allowance 5th July 
1681 to Provost Cockburn and his man for each days' attendance in Parliament was 
L. 5 Scots. 

On 24th September 1698, the large sum of L. 236, 2s. Scots was voted as commis- 
sion fees to the Parliament in July, August, and September last, so that the practice 
of paying members continued till the period of the Union. 

Before the Revolution every parent was obliged, under a penalty, to have his 
child baptized by the Established clergyman, and registered. At present few Dis- 
senters register the names of their children. 

It appears from the records of the town council, that the feat, after making fearful 
ravages in Edinburgh, travelled eastward; for it is stated 20th September 1530, 
that the weekly mai-ket was suspended, and all travel to or from Edinburgh, Leith, 
or other suspected places was interdicted by the magistrates, under severe pains and 
penalties. 

In 1244, the town, composed chiefly of wooden buildings, according to the custom 
of the times, was totally consumed by fire. That this happened not by accident, 
but by wilful design, seems evident, as in the same night Stirling, Roxburgh, Lanark, 
Perth, Forfar, Montrose, and Aberdeen shared the same fate. In 1598, almost the 
whole town was again consumed by fire, owmg, it is said, to the carelessness of a 
maid-servant. Ever since this calamity, a curfew goes through the town at eight 
o'clock at night during the winter months, when, after tolling a bell, a crier repeats 
a few rude rhymes, alluding to the misfortune, and warning the inhabitants to great- 
er caution in future. This is called " coal and can'le." 

 There is a most superb and costly monument of the chancellor and his lady in 
the aisle of the church of Haddington, belonging to the Lauderdale family, 24 feet in 
length, 18 feet in width, and 18 feet high. Tliero are two compartments supported 
by three black marble pillars, 5 feet high each, with capitals of white alabaster of the 
Corinthian order, arched above. In the western compartment are figures of Lord 
Thirlestane and liis lady at full length, in white alabaster, close to cacli other, in a re- 
cumbent posture. 

+ In the east compartment of the marble monument referred to in the aisle of the 
church of Haddington, arc figures of the Earl and his Countess, similar to those of

Husbandry. — The farms are considerable in size, and the rent 
is generally paid in grain, at the medium or second fiars of the 
county. Since the former Statistical Account was drawn up, various 
and important improvements have taken place in the husbandry 
of the parish, in a more complete drainage of the soil, the rota- 
tion of crops, the culture given to the land, the introduction of 
new species of manure, and of farm implements. Drainage is now 
both better understood and more extensively practised than at the 
period referred to. Drains formerly were not made of such depth 
as to render them efficient. Now they are executed with that at- 
tention to the nature of the soil which renders them permanently 
subservient to its amelioration. The rotation of crops was then 
generally of a scourging nature, as it is called, being for the most 
part a succession of culmiferous grains, without a due mixture of 
the leguminous. The land, therefore, was then much less pro- 

the Chancellor and his lady. The famous John Duke of Lauderdale, eldest son and 
heir of the Ear, was born at Lethington, 26th May 1616. The leaden coffin which 
contains his body, and a vase enclosing his bowels, are deposited in a vault in the aisle 
of Uie church of Haddington.

ductive than it is now, when the succulent plants are more exten- 
sively cultivated, and pasturage more frequently introduced ; for 
besides its renovating mfluence on the productiveness of the earth, 
the farmer is thus enabled to carry on the operations of his farm 
at less expense, while it is believed an equal, if not a greater quan- 
tity of corn is produced than when nearly the whole farm is kept 
in tillage. New manures have also been recently introduced, as 
rape and bone dust, to render the soil more proHfic. The former 
has been successfully applied to clay soils, and the latter to those 
of a light description. 

The implements of husbandi-y have likewise been progressively 
improved, and a greater variety introduced into farm management. 

Tenantrij.— Though the tenantry are remarkable for their 
intelligence and cultivation— their superior domestic accommo- 
dation—and style of living, it may safely be affirmed that in no 
profession has so little profit of late years been realized from an 
equal outlay of capital, as in that of the agriculturist, chiefly ow- 
ing to the high rent of land. Though no expensive course of edu- 
cation be required in order to attain sufficient skill to conduct the 
diversified operations of the farm, yet the capital necessary to an 
advantageous outset has doubled if not tripled within the last forty 
years. And then the prices of corn during the late continental 
war, having risen to an exorbitant height, farmers felt encouraged 
to offer a higher rent than the decreased price of corn produce 
has since enabled them to pay, without trenching on their capital. 
Several landed proprietors, however, convinced of the necessity of 
a reduction, have made considerable abatements of rent, and others 
have consented to an interchange of the terms and conditions of 
the lease ; substituting a corn rent, regulated by the medium fiars 
of the county, instead of the stipulated sum of money formerly paid. 

Farm-Servants.— The parish of Haddington being agricultural, 
farm-servants constitute a considerable proportion of the popula- 
tion. Being commonly paid in farm produce, and allowed to keep a 
cow, they are generally considered to be in a more comfortable and 
thriving condition than any other description of labourers or even 
than common tradesmen whose wages are paid in money. Farm- 
servants are mostly married men, and their wages are paid in kind, 
viz. 9 quarters of oats,— 2| quarters of barley, and 1 quarter of 
pease or beans; a cow kept for them during the year; 750 yards 
of good well-manured land to crop with potatoes, and one pound 
or guinea in lieu of about 540 yards of ground which was former-

ly allowed on which to raise flax for family use. The cottage 
ent is commonly paid by the wife of the cottager gmng twenty 
Ls reaping in harvest, or paying the wages of a reaper wh ch 
mZy aveL: between L. 1, and L. 1, 10s. ; for which sum besides 
Tis h use;he has a garden attached worth 8s. or 10. and his fuel 
carried free of expense ; so that what he recves with the cotge 
is of more value than the shearer's wages. Women and children 
receive from 6d. to lOd. a-day, according to their ability, but m 
harvest their wages are regulated by the market Oatmeal and 
potatoes form a considerable proportion of the diet of farm-ser- 
vants. They also use mixed bread, and keep a pig to consume 
the offal and refuse of the garden. 

Though in general acquainted with the elementary branches ot 
education-as reading, writing, and arithmetic-and amply provided 
with the means of information in most departments of knowledge, 
by having access to libraries, parochial and itinerating, they are not 
niuch given to reading, nor remarkable for their attainments m 
general information. Indeed, persons so early at work in the morn- 
ing, and occupied with the labours of the field through the day, 
can have little leisure or in general inchnation for hterary pursuits, 
when they return to their cottage in the evening, exhausted and 
weary. Besides, they want the excitement of conversation and discus- 
sion from frequent intercourse, which give so much interest and 
impulse to the working-classes in manufacturing districts. In all 
their cottages, however, is commonly to be found a family Bible ; 
the catechetical formularies of our church, and some approved po- 
pular works in Theology. 

As the farmers have as few inefficient persons on their premises 
as possible, their servants when old or infirm, either pass the re- 
mainder of their days with some member of their family,— for in ge- 
neral they have numerous families,— or they retire to some neigh- 
bouring village or town, and take such work as they may still feel 
themselves equal to. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of gross produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Produce of crain, being white crop grown on say 4800 Scots acres, L. 8 per acre 
'      L. 38,400 0 0

coutv T the practice of this 

county to hx, by pubhc authority, the fiar or average prices of vheat 
bar ey, oats, and pease, -these four species of grain being the staple 

calls before him a considerable number of respectable tenants from 
different parts of the county, and also extensive dealers in gra n 
who have bought and sold, delivered and received it within the 
county from the separation of the preceding crop to the day on 

price of considerable quantities of each of these four species of 
grain, he strikes one general average of the whole prices for each 
species,-next finds the quantity or number of bolls that have fetch- 
ed a price higher than the general average, and strikes a second 
average of this quantity He then finds the quantity that has been 
sold at a price below his first general average, and strikes a third 
average also of this quantity. To each of these averages he adds 
two and a-half per cent., and these three averages, with that addi- 
tion, form the first, the second, and third fiar prices for the year. 

The late Sir George B. Hepburn, Bart, took pains to ascertain 
the reason of two and a-half per cent, being added to the fiar ave- 
rages, and found that the record of fiars goes as far back as 1627 
—that It was some time the practice to strike the fiars twice in the 
year, at the terms of Candlemas and Lammas,-that on examin- 
ing the fiars for twenty-six years, during which they were struck 
at Candlemas and Lammas, and taking the average of both, which 
seems to be the fair medium price, it turned out, in point of fact 
that the Candlemas, with the addition of two and a-half per cent 
was somewhat below the above medium of the double fiars. Candle'- 
mas, on several obvious considerations, is too early a period to take ■ 
the average price forthewholeyear,—Whitsundayseemspreferable 
It may also be stated, that the present mode of striking the fiars has 
received the sanction of the Supreme Court. On 8th March 1771 
the Lords gave judgment, finding, " that the rules by which the 
Sheriff proceeded seemed well qualified for fixing the price of vic- 
tual with the greatest accuracy." 

V- — Parochial Economy. 
Town of Haddington.~The town of Haddington is pleasantly 
situated at the foot of the Garleton range of hills on the north, and 
bounded by the Tyne on the east, which divides it from the popu- 
lous suburb of Nungate, to which, however, it is joined by a 
bridge of four arches. The town consists principally of two paral- 



HADDINGTON. 



13 



Ipl streets -i-unning- east and west, and a long cross street which 
bounds one of these and intersects the other nearly at nght angles. 
The hi.h or main parallel street, which is a contmuation of the 
road from Edinburgh, is spacious, and the houses m general regu- 
a and handsome. The appearance of -the town has of late been 
greatly improved by the erection of a lofty spire to the own-house, 
fJet in height, by side pavement on the streets and gas lights 
and by county buildings on a large and elegant scale for the better 
accommodation of the Sheriff's court, meetings of the county, and 
suitable apartments for the public records. 

The approaches to the town from the west and east are orna- 
mented by a number of beautiful villas with gardens and nursery 

m-ounds adjoining. _  . • i 

The church is a venerable Gothic fabric, 210 feet in length, 
supposed to be of the thirteenth or fourteenth century. Fordun 
.tyles it Lucerna LaudonicE, the lamp of Lothian, on account of 
the beauty of its structure, and because, being lighted at night, it 
was visible at a great distance. The quire and transept are now 
in a somewhat dilapidated state : but the square tower which 
surmounts the building, andis ninety feet high, is entire. The west- 
ern part of the cross has been lately fitted up in a superior style, 
and is used as the parish church. 

The municipal affairs of the burgh are now managed by a council 
of twenty-five persons, elected according to the provisions of the 
Burgh Reform Act, by a constituency of 174, at present quahfied 
to elect, the greater part of whom are also qualified to hold office. 
The magistrates consist of a provost, three baihes, a treasurer, and 
dean of guild. The council annually elect a baron bailie over the 
adjoining village of Nungate, and also one over their dependencies 
in Gladsmuir, consisting of lands mostly feued from the town. 

There are nine incorporated trades, having exclusive right to ex- 
ercise their several crafts within the burgh. 

The funds of the burgh arise from land, mills, feus, customs, and 
amount to about L. 1400 a-year. 

Haddington joins with Jedburgh, Dunbar, Lauder, and North 
Berwick, in electing a Member of Parhament. 

There are no manufactures in town, but there are two breweries 
and two distilleries in the vicinity ; an iron forge and coach-work ; 
a considerable trade in wool, in tanning and currying leather, in 
preparing bones and rape cake for manure, and in supplying the

second seventeen chalders of victual, with L. 33, 6s. 8d. money

Besides the Established church there is an Episcopal chapel, a 
congregation of Old Light Seceders; two meeting-houses of the

Educatio7i.— Besides a grammar school for classical learning, a 
school for English reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography, 
with a department for mathematics appointed and endowed by the 
burgh, there is a parochial school supported by the landward he- 
ritors at the maximum salary. Fees may amount to L. 50 per 
annum. English reading, 2s. 6d. a quarter, writing do. 3s. 6d., 
arithmetic, 4s. 6d. The proportion of those who learn reading 
alone is two-thirds. The class books in use at present are Mr 
Wood's, and the Scriptures alternately. There are also several 
schools taught by private individuals. 

Under the head of education it may be mentioned that there 
are several Sabbath schools taught by the elders of the Establish- 
ed church ; each taking charge, as far as practicable, of the young 
in his own allotted district of the parish. 

Mechanics Institution. — A mechanics School of Arts was com- 
menced here so early as 1823, in which lectures in chemistry, in 
several branches of mechanics, and in physical, moral, and eco- 
nomic science, have been delivered. The institution is provided 
with a suitable apparatus, museum, and library. 

Tyneside Games. — These games, consisting of various gymnastic 
exercises, as running, leaping, wresthng, &amp;c. &amp;c. have' been cele- 
brated these two years past in Amisfield Park, amid a great con- 
course of spectators, and under the patronage of the neighbouring 
noblemen and gentlemen. 

Societies. — Many societies hold their regular meetings here, as 
the Agricultural, Horticultural, and the Ancient fraternity of gar- 
deners of East Lothian. There are also societies for extending 
the knowledge and influence of religion over the world, as the East 
Lothian Bible Society, and the Society for Propagating Christianity, 
with their auxiliaries of a penny a-week, and a Juvenile society of 
Id. a-week. 

Various benevolent Societies have been instituted, and are in 
operation for the aid and relief of sick or indigent members. Late- 
ly, a Mutual Assurance society has been formed, on the best prin- 
ciples of calculation, embracing, 1st, a Sickness fund for granting 
weekly payments during sickness ; 2iZ/, a deferred Annuity fund 
for affording allowances to members for life after completing sixty

years of age ; 3f, a Life Assui •ance fund for affording a sum on 
the death of members. 

A Female Society has been for a long time in use, to visit and 
afford pecuniary relief to the sick and aged poor, and to minister 
to their instruction and comfort, by reading the Scriptures, and giv- 
ing them suitable tracts. 

There is also a Dispensary for supplying flannel clothing, wine, 
and porter, as cases certified by a medical attendant require, ac- 
cording to the number or amount of subscriptions of 10s. 6d. or- 
dered by the subscriber. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Paupers are maintained by legal as- 
sessment on the valued rent of the landward heritors ; the town of 
Haddington paying a stipulated proportion out of its own funds or 
patrimony. Besides weekly collections at the church doors, which, 
now that an assessment is established, do little more than pay the 
salaries of the session-clerk, precentor, beadles, and other inci- 
dents, — the session have L. 300 of mortified money under their 
management, for behoof of the poor. 

The late David Gourlay, Esq. bequeathed a field of four acres, 
with L. 450, and L. 840, 3s. 2d. stock, the rent and interest of 
which he directed to be applied by the parochial ministers, as they 
might deem fit, to aid the industrious poor ; but by no means to 
relieve the heritors from their legal obligations. The average 
amount of church collections for the poor is betvieen L. 50 and 
L. 60 a-year ; — of assessments, about L. 800 ; of legacies, L. 300. 

Banks. — There are two banks, — branches of the Bank of Scot- 
land and of the British Linen Company. 

Savings Bank. — In 1815a savings bank was established. Those 
who avail themselves of the benefit of this institution are general- 
ly mechanics, day-labourers, and servants. At last settlement 
with the treasurer in March 1833, there were 133 depositors, and 
about L. ] 000 in deposit. The amount yearly invested is L. 205 : 
withdrawn, L. 175. 

Libraries. — There are several valuable libraries worthy of notice, 
as the Presbytery library for the use of that Reverend body ; a gift 
from a society of pious individuals in London more than a century 
ago ; a library bequeathed to the town of Haddington, by the Rev. 
John Gray, Episcopal minister at Aberlady, withoOmerks a year, to 
add to it from time to time by the purchase of new books ; a Parish 
library established from the funds of the late Mr Andrew Begbie, 
farmer in Barneymains, and a respectable member of session ; a

• As the introduction of itinerating libraries is a new and cheap means of difFus- 
in" useful knowledge, especially among those in the humbler walks of life, — and as 
it appears, from authentic printed reports and memoirs, that much good has already 
been done by this mode of circulating information, it seems proper to insert a letter 
from the worthy and benevolent author of the institution at present chief magistrate 
of Haddington to the writer, giving a general view of the origin, progress, and pre- 
sent state of these institutions : — 

Rev. and Dkab Sir, Haddington, 5th May 1835. 

I beo-an the plan of itinerating libraries in East Lothian in 1 81 7, with five divisions 
of 50 volumes each, and there are now 1835 under my superintendence in this coun- 
ty, forty-three divisions of 50 volumes, besides about 450 volumes of new and agricul- 
tural books for the use of the annual subscribers of 5s. ; in all '2600 volumes. The 
new books are kept at Haddington, Dunbar, and North Berwick, for a few years for 
the use of subscribers to the above amount, and are afterwards arranged into divisions 
of 50 volumes, and stationed in the towns and villages of the county for two years, 
when they are removed and exchanged. The regular removal and supply of new di- 
visions has excited and kept up such a disposition to read, that in several stations dur- 
ing the winter months, scarcely a volume is left in the book-case. To persons ac- 
quainted with the issues from the usual settled libraries of 2t00 volumes, and of 
eighteen years standing, the following statement will appear almost incredible. The 
issues by a calculation I made in 1830 of the new books at Haddington to the sub- 
scribers have been nearly eight and a-half times for every volume. The gratuitous 
issues at Haddington have been seven and a-half times every volume ; at Gilford, 
Salton, Aberlady, North Berwick, Belhaven, and Spott, they have been seven times 
every volume ; and the issues of the whole establishment, so far as reported, have 
been on an average five times every volume. In all cases the librarians give their 
services gratuitously. Until 1831, the books were lent gratuitously, the new except- 
ed ; but the readers made voluntary contributions at the greater number of the sta- 
tions. In that year the plan was so far altered, that one penny was required for the 
use of a volume during the first year a library was in the station ; and during the se- 
cond the books were lent gratuitously. This alteration has considerably increased 
the funds, while the gratuitous reading during the second year is training the young 
to a taste for i-eading. In 1831, with the assistance of the Scottish Missionary So- 
ciety and several West India proprietors, I sent four divisions to Jamaica, to be un- 
der the direction of the missionaries of that society. In 1831 and 1834, I received 
from a few friends of the plan about L. 400, to promote the introduction of libraries 
into certain specified districts, and 1 have since sent to various parts of Scotland, Eng. 
land, Ireland, Jamaica, Canada, South Africa, St Petersburgh, ninety divisions con- 
taining 4500 volumes. They were furnished at cost prices, and to some districts at 
half the cost price, and those sent to Ireland still lower. They were placed under the 
superintendence of gentlemen or ladies in the different districts. In 1826, a society 
was formed in Edinburgh for establishing itinerating libraries in Mid-I.othian, but 
its exertions had been greatly neutralized by deaths amongst its original members, 
and various other circumstances. Last year I agreed with the committee to take the 
superintendence of their libraries, and in Edinburgh, Leith, and the vicinity, there 
are now twenty-one divisions, besides stations for new books at Buccleuch Place, and 
Hill Street Academies, and the Young Ladies Seminary, George Street. 

As I am convinced that the plan is calculated to be extensively useful at a small 
expense, 1 will be always happy to give any information in my power on the subject 
to any person who may wish it. I am, your's sincerely, Signed Samuel Bhown.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES THOMSON, MINISTER. 

THE REV. JOHN THOMSON, ASSISTANT &amp; SUCCESSOR. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of this parish was originally, and so early as 
the twelfth century, Linton, — the name still given to the principal 
village in the parish, which appears to have been so called from a 
lynn or waterfall in the river Tyne, at the place where the village 
is situated. This continued to be its principal name till the Re- 
formation ; but before that period it was also known by the name 
of the Halch or Haugh, from the circumstance of the church being 
situated near a haugh on the banks of the Tyne ; hence it was af- 
terwards called Prestonhaugh ; and at a later period it received its 
present name of Prestonkirk. It is still designated " Preston- 
haugh, otherwise called Prestonkirk," in Presentations and other 
legal writings. 

Extent and Boundaries. — Its extent is about 4 miles from east 
to west, and about 7 miles from north to south ; and it consists of 
about 15 square miles. . It is of an irregular figure, stretching out 
for 2| miles into a narrow stripe of land to the northward, which 
is detached from the rest of the parish. It is bounded on the west 
by the parishes of Haddington and Athelstaneford ; on the north 
by Dirleton and North Berwick; on the east by Whitekirk and 
Dunbar; on the south by Stenton, Whittingham, and Moreham. 

TopograpMcal Ajjpearances. — The surface is a little varied, but 
there are no hills or valleys of any considerable extent, with the ex- 
ception of Traprain-Law, a hill situated towards the south boundary 
of the parish. The extent of this hill is about 40 Scotch acres, and it 
affords excellent pasturage for sheep, but is too steep and precipi- 
tous for cattle. On the south side it is very nearly perpendicular. 
A little to the north of this hill is a curious irregular valley of con- 
siderable depth, and very narrow, in the bottom of which runs a 
very small rivulet. This valley is considered the most fertile part 



PRESTONKIRK. 



If 



of the farm in which it is situated, except near the river, where 
there are some rocks. 

The parish is remarkable for the healthiness of its inhabitants, 
having seldom been visited by any epidemic disorder. 

Hydrography. — The only river in the parish is the Tyne, run- 
ning from west to east, and dividing the parish nearly in the centre. 
It has its rise ten miles above Haddington, and falls into the sea 
about three miles north-west from Dunbar. The course is little 
varied, except at the village of Linton, where it falls over a con- 
siderable height of claystone rocks, forming the lynn from which 
the village derives its name. These rocks are mentioned in the 
former Statistical Account as supposed to obstruct the progress of 
salmon up the river. Since that period, a passage has been opeuT 
ed for them, but without the desired effect, few or no fish having 
ever been found farther up, while the levelling of the rocks has 
materially hurt the beauty of the waterfall, which is indeed entire- 
ly destroyed, except in the time of a flood. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — In this parish there are only three 
species of rocks found, — uncovered claystone, clinkstone, and lime- 
stone. Of these, by far the most widely diffused is claystone. It 
occurs in an obscurely basaltic form at many different places in the 
parish, as, on the Smeaton estate, and on the Phantassie estate, to 
the westward of the village of Linton ; it also forms the lynn above- 
mentioned. It is of a dark purplish brown colour, often porphyr 
ritic, containing crystals of felspar, and in general deeply impreg- 
nated with iron. The rock next in the frequency of its occurrence 
is clinkstone. This forms the whole of Traprain-Law, and of the 
rocks which are quarried close by the turnpike road at Pencraig, 
about a mile and a quarter to the west of Linton. Its structure is 
slaty, with seams running across the slates dividing it into imper- 
fect columns. Its colour is generally a light mottled brown, 
sometimes porphyritic. At one part of Traprain-Law it has a 
bluish gray tint, greatly resembling greenstone, to which rock it 
also shows an approach at the summit, where it contains grains of 
hornblende. At Pencraig it contains veins of a yellow jasper, sus- 
ceptible of a good pohsh, and also veins of heavy spar : in this it 
resembles the chnkstone of the Garleton hills, a few miles to the 
westward. Limestone occurs along the ridge extending eastward 
from Traprain-Law ; its colour is mostly a brownish red, and it 
contams a great quantity of flinty matter disposed in veins. Its 
strata are nearly horizontal, and are covered with a deep formation

of a calcareous marl, which is sometimes employed for agricultural 
purposes instead of lime. 

These three rocks are the only ones occurring in this parish, — 
probably partly traversing and partly resting on the red sandstone, 
which forms the regular strata of the district, resting on the transition 
rocks of Lammermoor, and covered by the coal formation of Mid- 
Lothian. The soil of the parish is, for the most part, near the river, 
of a sandy or gravelly nature. To the north of this it becomes gra- 
dually of a stronger nature, till it ends in a very stiff clay; and, far- 
ther north again it becomes lighter. To the south it is calcareous. 

Zoology. — Under this head, it may be mentioned that our birds 
of prey are, for the most part, confined to the kestril  Falco tinnun- 
culus, the ringtail {F. cyaneus, and the sparrowhawk {F. nisus, 
and two species of owls. We have no grouse of any kind, but 
partridges and pheasants are numerous. In severe winters the 
Bohemian chatterer [Garrulus Boliemicus has once or twice been 
seen. The kingfisher once frequented the river, but is now ex- 
tinct. Perhaps the sand martin {Hirundo riparia is more numerous 
than in most places. In autumn various sea birds, as the gull ge- 
nus, particularly i}\eLarus canus, and the cormorant and duck tribe, 
visit us. The latter, especially the common wild duck and the 
widgeon, frequent the mouth of the river in flocks of many hundreds 
every winter. Herons are common, and breed in the neighbour- 
ing parish of Whitekirk. 

The Tyne contains very large trout, eels, flounders, and a good 
many small salmon, with several minute species. From our in- 
land situation, our invertebrate animals are almost wholly confined 
to insects. Concerning these there is little particularly worthy of 
notice. The Death's- Head Sphinx {Sphinx atropos was found 
very frequently in 1825 in the pupa state in potato fields. The 
Puss Moth {Cerura vinula is also common. The damage done 
to wheat crops of late years by the Cecidomyia tritici, or wheat-fly, 
is well known. The Stomoxys calcitrans, or common stinging-fly, 
which in hot weather persecutes men and beasts with its pamful bite, 
•is more numerous in this district than n most parts of Scotland. 

Botany.— Omng to the highly cultivated state of this district, 
it aff'ords a still less interesting field to the botanist than to the 
zooloo-ist. There are no natural woods in the parish, but a good

many very fine trees, particularly near the church, and the vil- 
lao-e of Preston. There are no rare plants, unless the following: 
Geranmm sanquineum, Arenaria verna, Viola lutea, Dianthus del- 
toides, SedumTelephium, which grow on Traprain-Law ; the Py- 
rola minor, and Hi/pericum pulchrum, occur on Smeaton grounds. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Mew.— Two of the most eminent agriculturists of East 
Lothian lived and died in this parish, viz. George Rennie, Esq. of 
Phantassie, and Robert Brown, Esq. tenant of Markle. The for- 
mer died in 1828, the latter in 1831. Both have long been ce- 
lebrated for their exertions in the improvement of the husbandry 
of this country.— The late John Rennie, Esq. long an eminent 
engineer in London, and brother to George Rennie, Esq. was also 
born and brought up in this parish.— Mr Andrew Meikle, the in- 
ventor of the thrashing machine, lived for a considerable time, and 
died here. Though his claims as the inventor of the thrashing 
machine have been disputed, there can be no doubt that he brought 
the machine to its present state of perfection, by inventing the fixed 
beaters or skutchers now in universal use, and from want of which 
all previous inventions had proved useless. A tombstone erected 
to his memory in the churchyard of Prestonkirk testifies this fact. 

Land-oimers. — There are six principal heritors,- — the Trustees 
of the late George Rennie of Phantassie; Miss Dalrymple of 
Hailes; the Earl of Wemyss; Sir Alexander Hope ; Sir David 
Kinloch ; and Sir Thomas Buchan Hepburn, and four smaller pro- 
prietors- 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers began in 1663, 
and are complete, — that is, none of the volumes are wanting ; but 
the number of names registered varies at different periods. Of late 
years almost every birth in the parish has been regularly entered. 

Antiquities. — There is mentioned in the Saxon annals a place 
of worship under the name of Ecc. S. Baldridi, which stood on the 
site of the present church so far back as 1000 years ago. The 
principal ruin in the parish is Hailes Castle, famous for once hav- 
ing been the temporary residence of Queen Mary when carried off 
by the Earl of Bothwell, then possessor of the castle. It is now 
rapidly going to decay, though part of it is still used as a granary. 
It is now the property of Miss Dalrymple of Hailes. The only 
other ruin in the parish is an old religious house on the farm of 
Markle, the property of Sir David Kinloch of Gilmerton. It ap- 
pears that a monastery was early established here, and continued till 
the Reformation ; but it is testified in the Parliamentary records, 



22 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



that, in 1606, a considerable part of the land originally belonging 
to the monastery was resumed by the Crown, and annexed to the 
Chapel Royal of Stirling. That the whole lands were not resumed 
is manifest, because the park in which the ruin is situated, and an- 
other adjoining to it, still called the Provost's Park, have for more 
than a century and a half belonged to the proprietors of the barony 
See Farmers' Magazine for March 1811. Very little is known about 
this religious establishment, but from the present state of the 
building, which is very ruinous, it seems to have been of consider- 
able extent, but of very rude workmanship. There are several 
rude stones of considerable height erected in different parts of the 
county, seemingly intended to mark the burial places of some chief 
or officer who had fallen in battle, one of which exists in the pa- 
rish, a little to the west of the village of Linton. Tombs, or stone 
coffins, have been found by the ploughmen in several places, mark- 
ing the site of a field of battle. 

Modern Buildings. — Smeaton House, the residence of Sir Tho- 
mas Hepburn, is the only mansion house,in the parish. There is 
indeed one at Beanston, belonging to the Earl of Wemyss, but it 
has been uninhabited for several years, and will soon be in ruins. 
There are in the parish four oatmeal and barley mills, one flour 
mill, one exclusively for barley, and one connected with a distillery. 
The distillery employs 50 men, is capable of distilling 500,000 
gallons per annum, and pays L. 112,000 of duty. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the amount of the iJopulation was 1318

1811, .... 1471 

1821, . . . 1812 

1831, . . . 1765 



The causes of the diminution which has taken place since 1821 
ai'e probably these; \st, In some farms where new leases have 
been granted in that period, several old houses have been pulled 
down which were not required to afford labourers for the farms, while 
in some instances two or more farms have been united, and con- 
sequently the number of inhabitants diminished. 2d, In 1821, there 
was an academy kept by the Dissenting clergyman, which has since 
been given up, causing a diminution of twelve or fifteen. 

The population in the village and the country part of the parish 
is as follows :

is six or seven. 

Character of the People.— The farm-servants in East Lothian 
enjoy the comforts of society in a greater degree than persons m 
the same rank of life in any other part of the country. They are, 
for the most part, allowed a cow's grass and potato land, and have 
an opportunity of keeping a pig, and, in some instances, poultry, 
which enables them to keep their families in a state of comfort su- 
perior to that of most of the labouring classes elsewhere, and they 
are in general quite contented with their situation and circumstances. 
But work of all kinds is more difficult to be had than formerly, 
which sometimes presses hard upon those who are employed upon 
days' wages. They are in general exemplary in their moral cha- 
racter, there being no instance within the memory of the writer 
of this of any person connected with the parish having been con- 
victed of any crime before the Justiciary Court. They are in 
general attentive enough to the outward duties of religion, though 
it must be confessed there is far less of the knowledge and the spirit 
of it than is to be desired and is to be found in some other districts : 
but there is no reason to mark any late declension in this respect ; 
perhaps rather, an improvement is gradually taking place.

SO. There is no natural wood, and the extent of land under plant- 
ed wood is very limited. 

Rent of Land.-T\\e average rent of arable land is aboutL. 2, 2s. 
per Scotch acre. There is no pasture ever let at so much per 
ox ; but the average rent is from L. 3 to L. 5 per Scotch acre. 

Live-Stock. — The breed of cattle to which most attention is now 
paid is the short-horned, introduced into East Lothian about ten 
years ago by Mr John Rennie Junior, of Phantassie. The Lei- 
cester and Cheviot breeds of sheep are principally propagated, but 
many of the black-faced species also are yearly fattened on turnips. 

Husbandry. — The general character of husbandry pursued is of 
the most improved kind. Turnips are cultivated to a considerable 
extent in drills, and consumed on the ground by sheep, and a por- 
tion of them by cattle in the straw yard. Drilled white crops are also 
common upon dry soils. The usual rotation of crops is either, \st, 
oats ; 2c/, beans ; 3c, wheat ; 4tth, fallow or turnips ; bth, wheat or 
barley; Qth, grass; or lsif,oats; 2/, turnips; Qd, wheat sown in spring, 
or barley ; 4ih grass. The last rotation is only used on light soils. 
The peculiar features of the agriculture in this parish and county, 
are, 1, The early ploughing of stubble in winter. 2c, The tho- 
rough eradication of weeds, and pulverizing of the soil in fallow or 
before the sowing of turnips, 3c, The careful extraction of annual 
weeds from amongst the growing corn ; and lastly, never in ordinary 
circumstances having two white crops in succession. The only im- 
provement which can be suggested would be to have the land long- 
er in grass, and to sow wheat less frequently. But the high rents 
render the former of these impracticable for tenants. The latter 
is, however, frequently adopted. There is no waste land in the 
parish capable of cultivation. Draining is carried on to a great 
extent. Irrigation has never been practised. Bruised bones, rape 
dust, and other manures, not the produce of the farm, are now more 
or less used by almost every farmer. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. There are 
still two liferent leases in this parish, which have proved highly 
detrimental to the interest of the landlord, without communicating 
any corresponding advantage to the tenant. 

The state of farm buildings is, with a few exceptions, good. A 
considerable improvement has taken place both in them, and in en- 
closures of late years. Steam-engines have been erected on three 
farms in the parish, for the purpose of driving thrashing machines. 



PRESTONKIRK.

The first, which was erected seven years ago, is a low pressure ; and 
the other two are high pressure ones. 

The principal improvements since the date of the last Statisti- 
cal Account are the cultivation of a large extent of common, and 
the much better state in which the roads are now kept. 

Fisheries.— There is a small salmon fishing in the river Tyne, 
but the part connected with the parish is so insignificant as to ren- 
der it not worth mentioning. The greater number are caught at 
the mouth of the river, in the parish of Whitekirk. It is rented, 
however, by a person residing in this parish ; but it is generally 
believed to be scarcely sufficient to pay any rent, as it is attended 
with considerable labour, and expense of time. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish is computed to be nearly as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, wheat, oats, barley, beans, - L. 23000 0 0 
Potatoes, turnips, mangel wurzel, &amp;c. - - - 4300 0 0 

Hay, - - - - - - 1200 0 0 

Land in pasture, at from L. 3 to L 5. per acre Scotch, - 4300 0 0 

Gardens and orchards, . - - - - 230 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, - L. 33450 0 0 

Rental, L. 10500. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office at Linton, 
where letters are delivered from Edinburgh every day, and the 
mail to Edinburgh from London passes daily. The great Lon- 
don road passes through the middle of the parish ; its extent is four 
miles ; on which at present five public coaches travel daily, — the 
London mail, one stage coach to London, one to Berwick-upon- 
Tweed, and two to Dunbar, all from Edinburgh. There is only 
one bridge, which is over the river Tyne, in the line of the great 
London road, near the village of Linton ; it is in good repair, but 
too narrow, and awkwardly situated for carriages. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is upon 
the whole convenient. It is only half a-mile from the eastern ex- 
tremity of the parish, but it is at an equal distance from the other 
extremities ; its greatest distance from any part being from three to 
four miles. It was built in 1770, and enlarged in 1824 to the ex- 
tent of 200 sittings. The whole number which it can contain now is 
about 800. The whole of the sittings were originally free, and 
divided among the heritors ; thus excluding all the inhabitants of 
the village, which constitutes nearly one-half of the population. 
But the heritors agreed to give up so many sittings for the use of 
the villagers, fifty of which are let for the sum of Is. each per

annum, which goes to the poors' funds. The manse was built in 
1795, and has never been repaired. The glebe, including garden 
and site of the manse and offices, consists of about 8 Scotch acres ; 
it may be computed to be of the value of L. 5 per acre. The 
whole stipend is 18 chalders, with the usual allowance for corn- 
munion elements. There is one Dissenting chapel in the parish, 
in connection with the United Associate Synod, the minister of 
which is paid from funds arising from the seat rents and collections 
among the members of the congregation- His stipend is L. 90. 
There is no Episcopalian chapel in the parish. The number of 
families attending the Established church is 360. The number at- 
tending the meeting-house, belonging to this parish, is 47. Divine 
service in good weather is well attended in both places of wor- 
ship. The average number of communicants in the Established 
church is 610. There is no society for religious purposes at pre- 
sent connected with this parish alone, but there are collections in 
the church annually for different religious and charitable institu- 
tions, which amount on an average to L. 15. 

Education. — Total number of schools in the parish, 5 ; paro- 
chial schools, 2; one of whichis a female school upheld by the 
heritors. Private unendowed schools, 2, of which one is female; 
subscription school, 1. In the parish and subscription schools 
all the ordinary branches are taught, in the private male school 
the learned languages are not taught. Besides the above-men- 
tioned schools, there was another female school, in which the 
higher branches of female education were taught; but the numbers 
attending it were very limited. The salary of the parochial school- 
master is the maximum ; that of the parochial schoolmistress is 
L. 3, with a house and school-room ; the school fees of the for- 
mer amount to L. 40 per annum; the amount of the school fees 
of the private schoolmaster will be nearly the same ; the master 
of the subscription school has a salary of L. 40, and a free school- 
house. The parochial schoolmaster has all the legal accommoda- 
tions. 

There is a regulation made by the heritors of this parish, that 
no hind or farm-servant shall pay more than 10s. per quarter, 
whatever number of children he may have attending the school. 
The present parish schoolmaster was also bound by the heritors when 
they granted the last augmentation of his salary, to keep an assist- 
ant, who must be approved of by the minister and heritors. 

All persons in the parish of a proper age can read, and, excepting 



PRESTONKlllK. 



27 



perhaps a few old people, all can write. The attendance of the young 
at school, however, is irregular,— as they are withdrawn at certain 
seasons of the year, when their labour is required in the fields, and 
accordingly their education is not so perfect as it should be. The 
schools are all in the village of Linton, from which there is no part 
of the parish so distant as to prevent attendance upon the schools. 

Libraries.— Theve is one subscription library in the parish and 
a branch of the East- Lothian itinerating libraries. 

Charitable Institutions.— There are three Friendly Societies in 
the parish, one of very old standing and nearly inefficient, consist- 
ing of very few members ; one is a yearly society, to which the 
members pay 6d. per week, from which a certain sum is paid out 
in case of sickness, according to circumstances, and the balance is 
divided at the end of the year ; the other is not well regulated, and 
does not seem likely to endure for any length of time. 

Savings Banks.— There was once one in the parish, but it was 
given up, because it did not answer the purpose for which it was 
intended ; those who ' had their money in it being solely from 
among a description of people who were able to put their money 
in ordinary banks, and who availed themselves of the 
merely on account of the higher rate of interest given in it. The 
farm-servants, receiving their wages in victual, and consequently 
having httle money in their hands, renders saving banks of com- 
paratively little use in this county. The nearest is in Haddington. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 32, receiving the average sum of 5s. each 
per month, or L. 3 per year ; none receive more than 8s. per month, 
except in cases of lunacy. There is an annual assessment of about 
L. 120 ; the amount of church collections is only L. 15 yearly. 

There are some instances of a disposition among the poor to re- 
frain from seeking parochial relief as long as they can. But in no 
instance are the session the first movers in placing any one on the 
poors' roll, and there are few who are fit applicants who do not apply ; 
at the same time, instances of persons applying who are not entitled 
are very rare, and we have a few noble instances of aged and infirm 
persons supporting themselves upon the savings of their youth, even 
after bringing up large families. One old woman died last winter up- 
wards of eighty years of age, who was left a widow with two daugh- 
ters in early life, who lived comfortably, and never applied to the 
session or received aid of any kind. 

Inns and Alehouses. — There is only one house entitled to the 



28 



HADDINGTON SHIRK. 



appellation of an inn in Linton ; besides which there are nine ale- 
houses in Linton, and one in Preston. Their very mischievous 
effect on the morals of the people, especially of young unmarried 
men, cannot be questioned. 

Fuel. — The fuel universally used is coals, and whatever brush- 
wood can be obtained free of expense. The nearest coal pit is at 
a distance of ten miles. The price at the pit is 4d. per cwt. or 
15s. per ton. Coals are also to be had at Dunbar, which is only 
six miles distant ; but they are much more expensive. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

It does not appear that since the last Statistical Account the 
condition of the peasantry has undergone much change in respect of 
comfort, though some change has taken place in their style of liv- 
ing, especially in the use of cotton in place of woollen goods. Blank- 
ets, which used formerly to be spun by the females in every family, 
are now becoming a rare article of household furniture among young 
people. There is now no employment for old women in spinning, 
which was formerly the support of many when unfit for out-doorwork, 
and kept many from the poors' roll, who have now no other resource; 
and this is a branch of industry which few of the present rising ge- 
neration learn. In connection with this the trade of country wea- 
vers is altogether destroyed, which has brought some upon the poors' 
roll, who, though still able to pursue their own occupations, are too 
old and infirm to betake themselves to new ones. 

The great unnecessary increase of public-houses since the duty 
on spirits was lowered has led to very dissipated habits in many 
of the labouring classes, which cannot be too much regretted. It 
is some matter of consolation, however, that their number is less 
than it was a few years ago. Now the whole number in the 
parish, as stated above, is eleven; once there were no fewer 
than nineteen, but still their number far exceeds what can be re- 
quired for the necessary wants of the population. There is rea- 
son, however, to suppose that the diminution arises from want of 
employment. A greater number of resident tenants and heritors 
would unquestionably have a material effect on the morals of the 
people. There is only one resident heritor, and three none-resi- 
dent tenants, who have thirty-five families under them.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES WALLACE, D. D., MINISTER. 



I —Topography and Natural History. 
amB.—Tn-E parish of Whitekirk, as now constituted, compre- 
hends thL ancient parishes of Tynninghame, Hamer, and Aldhara. 
Tynninghame is understood to signify the hamlet on the meadow 
by the river Tyne ; Hamer signifies the larger village, in contra- 
distinction perhaps to Aldham, the ancient village, at two miles 
distance, but of which hardly a vestige now remains. The church 
of Hamer, from the whiteness of its appearance, had been long 
known by the name of Whitekirk, and under that name are com- 
monly included the three parishes as now united. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The parish approaches to the figure of 
a square. It is situated at the mouth of the Firth of Forth, and 
in the best district of East Lothian. It stretches between 3 and 
4 miles along the sea shore, and between 4 and 5 miles into 
the country, being about an equal distance from Dunbar and 
North Berwick, and having these parishes and the parish of Pres- 
tonkirk for its boundaries. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general aspect of the parish 
is beautiful. The point of greatest altitude above the medium 
level of the sea is 243 feet, yet it possesses a sufficient variety of 
surface, and when viewed either from Whitekirk hill, or from Law- 
head, the two most considerable eminences in the parish it pre- 
sents a rich and varied landscape of land in the highest state of 
cultivation, and of woods of great extent and beauty. The Bass, 
the castles of Tantallon, and Dunbar, in the immediate vicinity, 
and other objects of prominence and celebrity, both on the land 
and in the sea, may be favourably seen from these points. From 
the above eminences, which are cultivated to the top, and more re- 
markable for their extensive and diversified prospects than for their, 
elevation above the sea, the land slopes with a gentle declivity.

HADDINiTCNSIlIRE. 



chiefly towards the south and south-west ; — almost the only per- 
fectly flat ground beuig the rich haughs on both sides of the river 
Tyne, extending from the Knowmiln to the sea. 

Climate. — The climate is dry and salubrious. Less rain is observ- 
ed to fall here than in many of the neighbouring parishes. Clouds 
from the west charged with rain, and of a threatening appearance, 
often break at the end of the Pentland, and still nearer, on the 
Garleton hills, and taking the direction of Lammermoor, or of the 
Firth of Forth, or of both, leave our fields comparatively dry. 
This may not be in every case for the advantage of the farmers ; 
but the soil being generally strong and deep, is not soon affected 
by drought. From this greater dryness of atmosphere, and conse- 
quently from a brighter and less interrupted sunshine, no less than 
from the fertility of the soil, may probably proceed that superior 
quality of grain, for which this district has been long remarkable. 
During the months of April and May, the east winds are often 
keenly felt, but against their ungenial influence there is no shelter 
anywhere. They have been occasionally felt to blow as piercingly 
in the town of Dumfries one of the mildest climates in Scotland 
as on the coast of East Lothian. The population are subject to no 
peculiar disease. Ague, formerly prevalent, has long been un- 
known ; and the climate may be pronounced a decidedly healthy 
one. 

Hydrography. — The Tyne is the only stream of water in the 
parish that can be called a river. It rises near Borthwick, in the 
county of Edinburgh, and after pursuing a north-easterly course 
of nearly thirty miles, it intersects the old parish of Tynninghame, 
and falls into the sea at Tynninghame bay. By the reflux of the 
tide, which aff"ects the course of the river for nearly two miles, the 
water spreads at full tide into an extensive lake on the Salt Greens, 
in front of the Earl of Haddington's house, and forms one of the 
enlivening and admired features of that magnificent residence. The 
gentle ebbing of the tide leaves no sediment to spoil the beauty of 
the greens, which in a short time are seen covered with sheep, 
• and in summer with a profusion of sea-pink. 

The gray salmon frequent the Tyne, but not in such abun- 
dance as to be an article of much profit to the proprietor. The 
Earl of Haddington has the sole right of fishing the Tyne, and 
the sea coast on both sides of it, for three or four miles, from the 
small rivulet Peffer, to within a cable's length of Belhaven water, 
within a mile of Dunbar. 

There was, till within these twenty years, a celebrated well 



WHITKKIRK AND TYNNINGIIAME. 3l 

called our Lady's Well, in honour of the virgin, within a gunshot 
of the church of Whitekirk, and partaking, as was formerly be- 
lieved, of the sanctity of that establishment. In times when more 
miracles were supposed to be wrought than at present, ajid pilgrim- 
ages more in vogue, it was said to be famous for the cure of bar- 
renness. But the well and its virtues have been sacrificed to what 
the creed of those times would have considered a sordid and un- 
hallowed agriculture. Drains and ditches have not left the pilgrim 
a drop to drink. 

Geologij and Miner alogr/.— There is a great variety of soil in the 
parish. On both sides of the river it is alluvial, but much of it be- 
yond the reach of running water, is of a dark-coloured loam, and 
in some places more or less mixed with red clay. Even on the very 
highest ground, the soil is good, though thin, being incumbent on 
whinstone rock, but so near the surface, as to admit only of a very 
shallow furrow. 

The sea coast from the mouth of the river Tyne to Peffer, a 
small rivulet, a mile and a half westward, is sandy, with the excep- 
tion of Ravensheugh and the small promontory of Whitberry, 
which are of trap augite greenstone, basaltic greenstone, trap tuf- 
fa, and red sandstone. The sandstone near to the trap is variously 
changed. From the farm-house of Scoughall to the boundary 
of the parish at Tantallon Castle, especially that part of it to the 
westward of the old mansion house of Auldhame, the cliffs are 
precipitous and rugged, in some places not less than about 100 
feet high, overhanging the sea. These cliffs, and the ledges of 
rockwhich run from them into the sea, composed of red sandstone, 
red clay iron stone, red and green slaty clays, red trap tuff, &amp;c., 
have been described by the highest authority. Professor Jameson, 
in his Geognosy of East Lothian, published in the Memoirs of the 
Wernerian Society. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-oivners. — There are but three heritors; each of them 
possessing what was formerly a separate parish. Tynninghame be- 
longs to the Earl of Haddington, the present Lord Lieutenant of 
Ireland; Whitekirk to Sir David Baird of Newbyth, Bart.; and 
Auldhame to George Sligo, Esq. The residences of the two for- 
mer have the benefit of great shelter from the woods which sur- 
round them ; and Seacliffe House, where Mr Sligo lives, has the 
command of some of the finest sea views that are any where to be

cording to Mr Hay Cunningham, Whitberry Point.

found. The heritors have been generally resident, and exceed- 
ingly ready to promote in every way the comfort of the inhabit- 
ants. 

Parochial Registers. — The schoolmaster's house at Whitekirk 
was burnt in the year 1760, and the session registers previous to 
that date destroyed. The records of the old parish of Tynning- 
hame extend as far back as 1615, and besides their more appro- 
priate contents, contain frequent allusions to passing events. There 
are several entries, for instance, relative to the defeat of the Mar- 
quis of Montrose in 1645. After mentioning that a paper had been 
read from the pulpit, from the committee at Dunbar, " anent any 
that had any midling with James Graham or his complices," and 
after alluding to a public thanksgiving " to be keepit and maid 
for the great victorie at Philiphauche" the observance of that so- 
lemnity is thus recorded : — " 19 October 1645. This day the 
publick thanksgiving weill keepit, praised be God for the notable 
and great victorie never to be forgot at Philiphauche, quherin James 
Graham and his forcies were utterlie defaitt and overthrawin, we 
thank the Lord God of our Salvation throuch Jesus Chryst there- 
for forevir." 

The records have not been uniformly kept with very great ac- 
curacy. 

III. — Population. 
The increase of population for the last forty years has been 
inconsiderable. There are no feus in the parish, and a new house 
is rarely built but in room of an old one, the existing population 
being found sufficient for the purposes of agriculture. The hinds, 
who constitute the bulk of the inhabitants, are removable every 
year, and it depends on their having larger or smaller families, at 
the time the census is taken, whether the population has the ap- 
pearance of considerable increase or diminution. 

In the year 1792 it amounted to . . • 994 

1807 953 

1822 . ... 1023 

1834 1062 

In the last of these years there were above 1 2 years of age, 785 

under 12, . 277 

The oldest person in the parish was born in the year 1745. 

Character of the People. — The population is entirely agricultu- 
ral. The parish has long had the advantage of a skilful and re- 
spectable tenantry, and the habits of the people generally are in- 
fluenced in no small degree by their ordinary pursuits. The skil- 
ful and successful cultivation of the soil requires, and has establish- 
ed the incessant industry of the inhabitants ; and being removed 



WHITEKIRK AND TYNNINGHAME. 33 

from the contamination, too often arising from the vicinity of large 
towns, they are delivered from many temptations, to which a more 
exposed and less industrious population are liable. The people 
therefore are, on the whole, exemplary, civil in their manners, and 
decent in their life and conversation. They enjoy in a reasonable 
degree the comforts and advantages of society— shew no disinclina- 
tion to labour— and would be more contented with their situation 
and circumstances, were there more encouragement, than of late 
years, to the industry of the husbandman, and consequently a 
o-reater demand for the services of the labourer. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Agriculture is an art in which the skill of the hus- 
bandman has been here long conspicuous. In the last Statistical 
Account the land was described as being in the " highest state of 
cultivation." There is, however, one particular, in which a valuable 
change has taken place, and that is in live-stock. 

iiue-SiocA.— About eight or ten years ago, Mr John Rennie, at 
that time resident in an adjoining parish, had the merit of intro- 
ducing extensively both the Teeswater breed of cattle and the 
Leicester sheep, and a considerable number of cattle are now bred 
and fed off at two years old, fetching from L. 10 to L. 15 each. 
The sheep stock are bought at the spring and autumn markets. A 
few Leicester ewes for early lambs are kept ; and to a greater ex- 
tent Cheviot and black- faced ewes, with their lambs, are fattened 
upon grass for the Edinburgh market. Besides these, a large pro- 
portion of the grass lands is pastured with cattle, and Cheviot and 
black-faced wedders. Very little hay is made. About 2000 sheep 

 Then, and afterwards, there were several distinguished agriculturists in the pa- 
rish ; and more recently several premiums have been awarded by the Highland So- 
ciety to Mr Andrew Howden, Lawhead, to whose kindness I am indebted for what 
may be stated under this head, for several very accurate reports on agricultural sub- 
jects. The first premium was for a report on the comparative value of farm- yard 
dung with other manures, in growing turnips. The result of the experiment was, 
that well decomposed farm-yard dung was superior to any of the thirteen varieties 
which were put to the test, and that bone dust upon light soils, and fish garbage mixed 
with earth produced full crops. 

The second experiment related to the sowing of white crops, broad cast, or in drills. 
When the land is infested with weeds, or when the crop is likely to suffer from over 
luxuriance, drilling is recommended, and only under these circumstances. 

In a third experiment, with a view to ascertain whether it be profitable or other- 
wise to steam food for cattle, Mr Howden was the first, it is believed, to ascertain 
that loss was occasioned by steaming. He received the society's silver medal for his 
report on this subject. 

The last communication whicli Mr Howden made, related to the growth and qua- 
lities of upwards of a hundred varieties of the potato. The report contains several 
interesting facts, amongst others, that it is safe and profitable to plant the tubers 
whole, rather than to cut them, as is commonly done.

are fed on turnips. When the turnips are let, the price per week 
is from 4d. to 6d. for each sheep. 

Husbandry. — All kinds of grain are cultivated. The rotation 
followed uponth clay soil is, \st, fallow, manured; 2c, wheat; 3rf, 
grass; Uh, oats; bth, beans, drilled and manured; Qth, wheat. Upon 
the free loam and lighter soils, the four-course shift is practised ; as, 
\st, turnips, partly with bone dust first introduced into this parish 
by Mr Alexander Dudgeon, who, it is believed, was the second far- 
mer in Scotland who applied this useful manure ; after turnips, the 
2fZ crop is spring wheat or barley ; Qd, grass ; oats. In some 
cases the continuance of the grass a second year is thought, in the 
present depressed state of agriculture, to be for the interest of the 
farmer. 

Of the 6000 imperial acres which the parish may contain, there 
may be about 4000 under a system of alternate cropping, the re- 
mainder being under wood and grass. There is a waste and sandy 
marsh of about 300 acres, formed at the estuary ot the river Tyne, 
which the Earl of Haddington has it in contemplation to embank, 
and which it is supposed will amply repay the expense. 

Leases and Rents.— Leases are granted for nineteen or twenty- 
one years' endurance, and possession in this way is held to be an 
unquestionable advantage to the proprietor, the farmer, and the 
community at large ; indeed the want of possession for a number of 
years certain is an acknowledged bar to successful agriculture. 

In the last Statistical Account of this parish, the writer mentions, 
that, « in some cases, former rents had tripled;" but the return 
of peace and other causes rendered it difficult, and, in several of 
these cases, impossible, for the farmers to fulfil their engagements, 
even after great sacrifices. A scheme for the relief of his tenants, 
worthy of so distinguished a nobleman, was devised by John late 
Earl of Hopetoun, whereby the money rent which had been pro- 
mised was converted into a proportion of wheat, at the price it 
was expected to realize when the contract of lease was made, and 
at the same time a maximum price was fixed, to protect the far- 
mer against contingency; and this mode of paying rent is now 
generally adopted. We have only one or two exceptions withm 
the parish ; in these instances the average money paid is L. 2, 17s. 6d. 
per imperial acre. The average proportion of wheat per acre, paid 
at the fiars price for East Lothian, is nine bushels. The average 
produce from land under crop may be thirty-six bushels of wheat 
and beans ; forty-eight bushels of barley ; and sixty bushels of oats. 



WHITHKIRK AND TYNNINGHAME. 



35 



The valued rent of the parish is L. 7671, Is. 2d. Scots. The 
real rent when wheat is at L. 2. 16, per quarter is L. 9727, 8s. 

There are at present nine farmers who occupy from two to five 
hundred acres each, and there is one small farm with a mill attach- 
ed. This was the residence of the late ingenious Mr Meikle, at 
the time he invented the thrashing-machine. , 

The sum assessed for the parish roads amounts toL. 85, besides 
L. 17 for the public road running through the parish. The roads 
are kept in excellent repair. The fences chiefly thorn hedges 
are also generally well kept, and the farm offices are substantial and 
commodious. The dwelling-houses which the farmers themselves 
possess are adapted to the most prosperous state of their profession. 

Rate of Wages.~\n winter the wages for stout labouring men 
are 8s. per week ; and in summer 9s. The women's wages for 
bondage work, as it is called, working in the fields or in the barn, 
are 8d. or 9d. per day. The hinds or horsemen receive for a year's ser- 
vice nine imperial quarters of oats, two quarters two bushels of barley, 
one quarter of pease, and if they sow and stack the crop, one bushel of 
wheat in addition. Besides this they have the keep of a cow, 960 yards 
upon one drill of potatoes, L. 1 for hnt money, and their meat in 
harvest. These gains, taken together, amount at present to about 
8s. per week. 

In a retrospect of forty years we find that within that period, 
the hind has had an augmentation of five Linlithgow bolls of grain 
to his yearly income; and that smiths and wrights are paid more 
than double by the farmer ; saddlers, and tailors and shoemakers, 
not less in proportion. The value of farm produce on the other 
hand has for a considerable time greatly decreased, and is said to 
have been of late years disproportioned to the rent and the labour. 

Woods. — Thomas sixth Earl of Haddington began his planta- 
tions at Tynninghame in the year 1705, and has left a noble mo- 
nument of his perseverance and success. Previous to that period, 
the formation of any considerable body of planted trees was unknown 
in Scotland, and he may therefore be fairly considered as the father 
of plantation in that country. In a letter to his grandson, which 
was afterwards printed, he wrote an excellent treatise on the man- 
ner of raisingforest trees, &amp;c., containing the result of his own success- 
ful experience. He commenced his operations at the instance of his 
Lady, sister of the first Earl of Hopetoun, whose taste for planting 
was at first much stronger than his own, but he afterwards requir- 
ed no stimulus. In his account of the planting of Binning Wood, 



31 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



which is now so vahiable and so beautiful, he says, " There was a 
field of 300 Scots acres, called the Muir of Tynninghame, that was 
common to some ofmytenants, and a neighbouring gentleman. This 
ground she Lady H. desired to enclose and plant. It seemed too 
great an attempt, and everybody advised her not to undertake it ; of 
which number I confess I was one. But she said if I would agree 
to it, she made no doubt of getting it finished. I gave her free 
leave. The gentleman and tenants had their loss made up to them, 
and in the year 1707 she began to inclose it, and called it Binning 
Wood." The trees radiate from three centres, and this mode of 
planting has conduced both to the beauty and growth of the 
wood. 

Encouraged by the success of this undertaking, and now taking 
great pleasure in it, the same enlightened improver, after enclosing 
and sheltering his fields by strips of planting, proceeded to plant 
several large sandy fields, close upon the sea shore. From a re- 
ceived notion that no trees would grow there, on account of the sea 
air and the north-east winds, these fields had been of little or no use, 
but as a rabbit warren. But the project succeeded perfectly. The 
trees grew, as they do still, to the water edge, and his Lordship's 
fondness for planting growing with the growth of his trees, he re- 
solved " to fight no more with the cultivation of bad land, but to 
plant it all." The trees were adapted with great skill to the dif- 
ferent soils in which they were planted ; and yet what he says of 
the oak is worthy of being here recorded ; " As the oak is my 
favourite tree, I have planted it everywhere; and I can show them 
very thriving on rich, poor, middling, heathy, gravelly, clayey, 
mossy, spouty, and rocky ground, nay, even upon dry sand. It 
is visible that the oak grows every where on my grounds faster 
than any other tree, some of the aquatics only excepted." Thus 
arose, under the skill and perseverance of this spirited nobleman, 
and where trees were almost before unknown, woods to the extent of 
800 acres ; the plantation and care of which afforded much useful 
occupation, and ultimately much enjoyment to himself ; have been 
profitable to his descendants ; and are at this moment the great- 
est ornament of the country. 

On the estate of Newbyth also there is much fine tuiibcr ; and 
near the mansion-house many noble and lofty trees. 

There are in the parish probably upwards of 1000 acres of tim-

famed, and are indeed so remarkable as to deserve particular no- 
tice. ' They were planted about the same time as the woods above- 
mentioned ; and by the same nobleman. They are of great size 
and extent, comprising altogether 2952 yards. On the south-western 
side of the mansion-house there is a grass walk, on each side of 
which the hedges most remarkable in point of length are planted. 
The walk is 743 yards long, and 36 feet wide ; and the hedges on 
each side of it are 11 feet broad at the base, and 15 feet high. 
To the east of the garden and melon ground, they have been per- 
mitted to rise higher; being kept there at a height of 18, 21, and 
even 25 feet. The hedge on the west boundary of the park is of 
the same dimensions, and strangers have been rarely observed to 
pass it, without some expression of their admiration. 

At the time these hedges were planted, Tynninghame possessed 
little of that complete protection from the sea breeze which it 
now enjoys ; and so judicious an improver as Lord Haddington 
saw readily the superiority of ever-green, and especially of holly, 
over deciduous hedges. His successors have preserved them with 
the utmost care ; they are clipped twice a year, and carefully de- 
fended from cattle and sheep. The hedges seem to have been 
planted on banks so much raised as to keep the roots dry and suf- 
ficiently drained ; and their growth has been most vigorous in a 
deep light loam. There are many beautiful single holly trees, of 
very considerable dimensions, not only in the neighbourhood of the 
mansion-house, but all over Binning Wood ; from 5 feet to between 
7 and 8 feet in circumference; and rising to a height of from 46 
to 54 feet. These add greatly in winter to the beauty and gaiety 
of the place. 

Grass, Sfc. — Rye-grass and clover, and the practice of fallowing- 
land, were introduced into East Lothian by the same patriotic 
nobleman, to whom the county owes its finest woods and hedges. 
The Earl of Haddington had brought down to Tynninghame seve- 
ral English farmers, to assist him in executing his plans ; and in 
1708 " he fell heartily to work," and showed in practice, the im- 
portance of these two most essential agricultural improvements. 
His example was soon followed in the neighbourhood, and by de- 
grees over the whole country.  

" It may gratify cviriosity to mention some of the items of the sumptuous enter- 
tainments given at Tynningliamc, on the 21st of August 1679, at the baptism of this 
early and clistinguislied benefactor of the country. Every thing connected with him 
seems to have been on a great scale. The account of them has been preserved in the 
family household-book, and is as follows ; — « For dinner : of fresh beef, six pieces ;

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — Dunbar and Haddington, the former seven, 
the latter nine miles distant, are the market-towns chiefly resorted 
to, although the town of North Berwick and the village of Linton 
are both nearer. 

Means of Communication. — The nearest post-office is Preston- 
kirk, a distance of three miles and a-half. The great road from 
Edinburgh to London passes through the south end of the parish ; 
and a number of public carriages, at different hours, ply daily on 
that road. The turnpike road from Dunbar to North Berwick, 
passes for about four miles through the middle of the parish ; and 
the only considerable bridge, the bridge across the Tyne, is on 
this line of road. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The Gospel was introduced into East Lo- 
thian in the sixth century. St Baldred, the disciple of Kentigern 
or St Mungo, being the first Christian Apostle, fixed his cell at 
Tynninghame, where a monastery was afterwards erected, but his 
pious labours extended far and wide, — the boundaries of his pasto - 
ral care being thus described by Simeon of Durham, " Tota ter- 
ra quae pertinet ad monasterium sancti Baltheri quod vocatur 
Tyningham a Lambermore usque ad Escemuthe," so that his minis- 
try embraced the whole length of the county, from Lammermoor to 
Inveresk. All accounts concur in representing this early and zeal- 
ous propagator of the Christian faith as being held in extreme ve- 
neration when living; and several of the conterminous parishes are 
said to have contended for his body when he was dead. But we 
leave the miracles ascribed to St Baldred, and the stories about his 
boat and cradle, rocks on the shore and within sea mark to those 
who are inclined to clear the obscurities, and investigate the le- 
gends of the sixth century. Suffice it to say of him, what Arch- 
bishop Spottiswood says of his instructor, St Mungo, " That he 
appears to have been a man worthy to have been a subject of truth 
to posterity, not of fables and fictions, as the legends of monks 
have made him." He died in the year 606. Anlaf, the Dane, spoil-

ed the church of St Baldred, and burnt the village of Tynninghame, 
in the year 941. " This, says Chalmers, is a very early notice 
of the kirk-town of Tynningham." 

The manor and patronage of the church of Tynninghame camein 
after ages into the hands of the bishops of St Andrews ; and seem, on 
the erection of the College of St Mary's, to have beenconferred on 
that college. But how much soever that learned body may have been 
gainers by this liberality, the parishioners of Tynninghame appear 
to have gained httle, for in 1565, a complaint was made by them 
to the General Assembly, that though they paid their tithes to the 
new college, neither word nor sacrament were dispensed among them. 
The tithes still belong to the college, but the lands and lordship 
of Tynninghame since the year 1628, and the patronage more re- 
cently, to the Earl of Haddington. All that now remains of the 
ancient church of Tynninghame, which had formerly the privi- 
lege of sanctuary, are two elegant arches of Anglo-Saxon architec- 
ture, between which is the cemetery of the Haddington family. 

The church and manor of Whitekirk belonged to the monks of 
Holyroodhouse in the twelfth century. When Edward HI. invad- 
ed East Lothian in 1356, the sailors who attended him robbed 
the church ; a profanation which the canons of Holyrood, who re- 
sided there for the service of the Virgin, were unable to prevent ; 
although she is said to have raised such a storm as to have made 
themrepentof their temerity. Whitekirk {Album fanum became a 
place of great resort to those who had faith in the efficacy of pil- 
grimages. It was under the pretence of repairing thither, in ful- 
filment of avow for the safety of her son, James H. that the Queen 
Mother outwitted the unsuspecting Chancellor Crichton, who had 
the custody of the young King, by removing him clandestinely from 
the castle of Edinburgh, and conveying him to Stirling. 

The church lands and barony of Whitekirk were in the year 
1633 granted to the Bishop of Edinburgh, and on the suppression 
of that bishoprick, the patronage of the church fell to the Crown. 

The present church of Whitekirk is a very venerable edifice, sur- 
mounted by a square tower, and lately put into excellent repair. It 
is ninety-six feet above the level of the sea, and is supposed to have 
been built before the end of the fifteenth century. 

In the year 1761, the parishes of Whitekirk and Tynninghame 
were united, and since that period the congregation has assembled 
for public worship at Whitekirk. The situation is not inconvenient ; 
none of the people are three miles from the church, and the greater

proportion within two. Tiiey are exemplary in their attendance 
on divine ordinances ; and it may be mentioned as an evidence, 
it is to be hoped, of their sense of the importance of the duty, that 
out of a population of about 1050, between 416 and 432 persons, 
have for several years past been annual partakers of the sacrament 
of the Lord's Supper. 

Almost the whole population belong to the Established church. 
The very few families which at any time dissent from it are gene- 
rally of the class of hinds, or farm-servants, and these, frequently 
removing from one parish to another, their numbers are constant- 
ly varying. The number of Dissenting families is 16 or 17. 

The manse was built about forty years ago. The stipend 
consists of eighteen chalders of victual, ten bolls being of wheat, 
and the remainder of barley and oats, in equal proportions. The 
glebe is upwards of six acres, which, including h. 12, in lieu of 
the old glebe of Tynninghame, may be worth L. 30 a-year. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools conveniently situ- 
ated, and at present well taught, each schoolmaster enjoying the 
maximum salary of L. 34, 4s. 4d. Their dwelling-houses are such 
as the law requires, but better accommodation seems desirable for 
teachers who have been students in a university, who hold so respect- 
able a station, and are intrusted with so important a charge. Read- 
ing, arithmetic, and writing, are the branches commonly taught, few, 
comparatively, desiring instruction in the Greek, Latin, or French 
languages. The charge for teaching Latin is L. 2 per annum, 
for writing and arithmetic, L. 1, and for English alone 10s. — the 
average number of scholars in both schools being about 120. Each 
of the parochial schoolmasters may receive annually about L.35 
of school-fees. The people are in general alive to the benefit of 
education, and care is taken that the children of the poorest shall 
not be in this respect neglected. 

Poor. — The average number on the roll for the last seven years 
is 20. The funds from which they receive aid are the inte- 
rest of between L. 500 and L. 600, and the weekly collections at 
the church doors. We have been hitherto able, from private li- 
berality, to avoid an assessment. 

A scheme which seems to have been afterwards abandoned 
was proposed by the Justices of Peace of this county, in the year 
1745, for erecting a pubUc poor-house; but it appears from the 
session book of Tynninghame, which was then a separate parish, 
that the session refused to accede to the proposal, as they had poor- 



ATHELSTANEFORD.

houses of their own, sufficient to lodge, and funds to maintain their 
poor. These houses, eleven in number, still remain, and are oc- 
cupied by widows, who, together with their houses, get each of 
them a small allowance of coals. The ground on which the houses 
stand, and the gardens behind them, were originally given by the 
Earl of Haddington. There is generally more than one applicant 
when any of these houses become vacant; and there appears some- 
times too great a willingness, even on the part of healthy, young, and 
vio-orous persons, to obtain an establishment in the Widow's Row. 

"Fuel The principal families in the parish import their coal, 

the only species of fuel used, from Fife ; it is conveniently landed 
at different places on the coast ; and is preferred, though dearer, 
to that which is brought from Gladsmuir or Tranent ; a distance of 
fourteen or fifteen miles. In consequence 3f the difference of price, 
however, the inhabitants generally supply themselves from the in- 
land collieries. A ton of Fife coal, carriage included, costs at the 
centre of the parish about 16s. The same quantity from the 
nearest inland coal-hill would cost about 12s. The poor find their 
interest in picking up the broken and decayed branches in Lord 
Haddington's woods, to which they have at all times free access. 

There are but two alehouses in the parish ; and they are said 
to be necessary for the public convenience.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. WILLIAM RITCHIE, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Athelstaneford is named from Athelstan, an Eng- 
lish commander, who was slain here in a battle with the Scots about 
the beginning of the ninth century. \n the second volume of 
Camden's Britaimia, there is the foUowinsf statement : — " A little 
from Haddington stands Athelstanford, so named from Athelstan, 

 Several liaiiilets, built in places much exposed to the wind, are named the Gowl, 
and sometimes Windy Gowl, which last is a reduplication. Of ancient names, we 
have the foliowiiig, Congal-ton, Dongal-ton, Fingal-ton, and Fingal Street.

an English commander, who was slain with his men there about 
the year 815; but that this was Athelstan, the warlike King of 
the West Saxons, must be utterly denied, if we have any regard to 
the time and manner of his death." Tradition still points to the 
place, near the ford of the brook, where Athelstan fell and was 
buried. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish is four miles in length, and 
about three in breadth, being on the south side somewhat irregu- 
lar. In breadth it extends from the stream called Peifer, which 
divides it from the parish of Dirleton on the north, and reaches in 
one part to the river Tyne, where it is bounded on the south by 
the parish of Haddington. It is bounded by the same parish on 
the west, and on the east by the parish of Prestonkirk. The church 
and village of Athelstaneford stand near the middle of the parish, 
— three miles from Haddington, six from North Berwick, and nine 
from Dunbar; the two last towns being seaports. The village 
stands somewhat elevated, and commands an extensive view of the 
adjacent country, of the Frith of Forth, the county of Fife, the 
Bass Rock, and the Island of May. 

Topographical Appearances. — The low lands of East Lothian 
have an undulating appearance; they are formed into large ridges, 
lying east and west, and sloping gently toward the sea. On one 
of these ridges stand the church and village of Athelstaneford. 
The surface of this parish exhibits considerable inequalities, the 
lower parts having most probably sunk down at an early period, 
and the rocky places, left almost bare, retain their ancient eleva- 
tion. The columns of rock lying at a gentle slope, and in some 
places almost horizontal in the large knoll called Sydserf Hill, and 
some very remarkable appearances near Balgone, the property of 
Sir James Grant Suttie, afford striking indications that the low 
lands of East Lothian do not now retain their former elevation. It 
is certain the strata in most places in this neighbourhood have been 
greatly disturbed, and are seldom found in their natural state. 
The rocks in this parish are of whinstone and gray porphyry, the 
last of which is exceedingly hard. No limestone nor freestone has 
been found in this parish, and the coal, lying deep in the bowels 
of the earth, has not as yet been discovered, though various at- 
tempts have been made to find it. The quarries in this parish 
have produced nothing remarkable, except some beautiful speci- 
mens of rock crystal.

Meteorology. — The climate of East Lothian has changed greatly 
for the better within the last sixty years. About that period the air 
of this county was far from being salubrious, particularly in the low 
district, or north of the Tyne, At that time the lands were not 
laid dry, large stagnant pools were to be found in many places, field 
drainage not being practised, except in open cuts or furrows ; and 
fevers and ague greatly afflicted the inhabitants. Many young per- 
sons were carried off by consumption, and a number of respectable 
families were greatly diminished, and some entirely swept away, by 
the prevalence of that disease. Since the beginning of the present 
century, fevers and consumption are far less common in this dis- 
trict, and ague has completely disappeared. The people now en- 
joy much better health than formerly, and generally arrive at a 
greater age. Three persons have lately died in this village at the 
age of ninety, another at the age of ninety- one. During the in- 
cumbency of the present minister, two women have reached ninety- 
five. These persons retained their mental faculties to the last, and 
died apparently without pain. 

A considerable change of the atmosphere of this county in win- 
ter has taken place of late years, so much so, that we have had al- 
most no frost in the lower district of this county until the begin- 
ning of January. Last season, 1834, we had, strictly speaking, no 
winter, the plough having been never arrested by the frost; and 
spring began early, accompanied with an agreeable and genial 
warmth. During that period the wind was almost always from the 
west, and the number of deaths in this parish was few, compared 
with what usually happens here at that season of the year. The 
heavy rains which visit this county are from the east and north-east, 
and these sometimes continue without intermission two or three 
days. Rain from any other point is of short duration. Formerly, 
dense fogs frequently spread over this county, particularly in the 
months of April and May, and would have remained two, and some- 
times three days ; but since the lands have been drained, that dense 
vapour appears less frequently, and when it comes, is of shorter 
duration. Whatever effect it may have on the human frame, it is 
favourable to the growth of plants. When this county is visited 
by a thunder storm, the thick and dark cloud generally appears 
first above the hills which separate this county from Berwickshire, 
and spreading wide, it either passes along the same range of hills 
to the eastern sea, or crosses the county by Gladsmuir, to which

it seems powerfully attracted, and enters the frith at Aberlady 
Bay. 

Hydrography. — There is no river or considerable stream of 
water in this parish, except two brooks which run along the sides 
of the ridge which comprehends the parish of Athelstaneford. 
That on the north side is named the Peffer. It rises in a meadow in 
the lower district of the parish, and dividing itself into two branch- 
es, the one flows eastward and enters the sea, north of Tynning- 
hame; the other moves slowly westward to Aberlady Bay. Each 
branch flows about five miles before its waters unite themselves 
with the sea. When the course of the Peff'er was widened and 
deepened some years ago, several stag horns were found, about two 
and a half feet iDelow the surface ; and large oak trees have been 
oftimes found imbedded in moss on the banks of that stream ; and 
the farmers who discovered them told the writer of this account, 
that the trees were generally found with their tops lying to the 
south ; for in this quarter the most violent storms come from the 
north and north-east. Before the waters of that district were con- 
fined and carried off" by the course made for that purpose, the whole 
strath extending from Aberlady Bay to Peffer mouth near Tyning- 
ham, about eleven miles in length, was one continued morass, and 
anciently covered with wood, the habitation of wild beasts. But 
the banks of that slow running stream are now converted into fertile 
corn fields. Before that improvement the valuable fields on both 

• That a considerable part of the low lands in this part of the county was covered 
with wood in the thirteenth century appears from the history of the family of Living- 
stone of Saltcoats, in the parish of Dirleton. The whole line of the Peffer, including 
part of the lands of Fenton and Chapel, and stretching towards North Berwick Law, 
is said to have been at that time covereil with wood, the den of wild beasts, and 
greatly infested with wild boai-s, one of which is said to have been of great size, and 
exceedingly destructive to those who dwelt in that neighbourhood. At that time tire 
arms were not used for defence, and' the only way of attacking and destroying the 
ferocious beast, was with a spear, or sword, in hand. A reward was offered to any 
one who should destroy the monster, and the reward promised was a track of land 
extending from Gulan to North Berwick Law, or rather the right of pasturage for 
cattle on that district, which appears to have remained in commonly so late as the 
beginning of the last century, when these lands were divided by the Sheriff of the 
county, among those who had a servitude upon them. A man named Livingstone 
had courage to undertake, and strength to perform the enterprise. Having arnicd 
himself with a strong spear, and his right hand and arm shielded with a glove of thick 
leather, he encountered and killed the ferocious beast, and obtained ihc promised re- 
ward. When a division of the lands took place, the heirs of Livingstone got about 
four hundred acres of land in four separate parcels, the first commencing at Gulan, 
and the fourth being the farm of Hard-Rigs, which is bounded on the cast by North 
Berwick Law. These four parcels, now distinct farms, still comiirchcnd tiie estate 
of Saltcoats. The family of Livingstone of Saltcotes became extinct about the mid- 
dle of last century, and when the houseliold furniture was sold, the ancient spear and 
glove were found hanging in the garret of the mansion house, and were sold for a 
trifle to a gentleman of the name of I.ivingstonc, then resident m hduiburgh.

sides of the stream were covered with water, at least during the 
winter season, and that fine alhivial strath rendered in a great de- 
gree unproductive ; now they produce luxuriant crops. When the 
bed of the Peflfer was deepened, marine remams were expected to 
be found in it, but nothing of that kind appeared, though the source 
of the stream is said to be not more than twenty-five or thirty feet 
above the level of the sea. 

11. — Civil History. 
About the middle of the thirteenth century, a branch of the an- 
cient family of Frazer of Tweeddale possessed the lands of East and 
West Forton, in this parish, amounting to 1500 acres; for we find 
various grants made about that time, to religious houses in Scot- 
land, by the proprietor of those lands, and in particular one donative 
was given to the brethren of the Cross Church of Peebles from the 
lands of East Forton, the value of which is known. The princi- 
pal part of the revenue of the Cross Church of Peebles was given 
to the Duke of Queensberry at the Revolution 1688, and by him 
conferred on his second son, William Earl of March. Among other 
favours he obtained the grant by Frazer, of Forton, and that do- 
native had been reckoned of so much value that it was named in the 
deed of entail of the March estate, and has descended to the Earl 
of Wemyss, the present proprietor. The particulars of that dona- 
tive are as follows : Wheat 8 bolls ; barley 16 ; rye 8i ; money 
Sterling L. 4, 16s. Sd. 

The same person, probably Barnard Frazer, son of Sir Simon, 
the elder, gave a large meadow out of his lands of west Forton to 
the Abbey of Newbottle. At the Reformation, when church lands 
fell to the Crown, King James the Sixth, at his accession to the 
tl.rone of England, conferred that meadow on his faithful servant 
Sir Gideon Murray. It forms a valuable farm of upwards of 200 
acres, and is named Prora, the property of Lord Elibank. It is 
the only parcel of land in this parish that has remained in one 
family since the above-mentioned period. 

One of the most valuable baronies in this parish is the barony 
of Drem, containing above 800 acres of fine land. In former 
times it belonged to the Knights Templars, where they kept a 
considerable establishment. The priest's house is still standing ; 
and his garden adjoining, defended by a holly hedge, wliich is still 
in a vigorous state. The chapel, the greater part of which still

remains, appears to have been a small, but a neat structure ; and 
the burial ground attached is now converted into a fruitful garden. 

Eminent Men. — The lands of Athelstaneford, 200 years ago, 
belonged to a gentleman named Hepburn. When General Les- 
lie's army were encamped on the west of Haddington, near to 
Gladsmuir, before the battle of Pliiliphaugh, Hepburn of Athel- 
staneford, attended by his five sons, paid a visit to the General at 
his camp ; and Leslie was so much struck with the appearance of 
one of the sons, that he offered him a commission in his army, which 
was readily accepted. Young Hepburn conducted himself in the 
Scottish army with propriety and courage ; and when peace was 
restored to Scotland, Hepburn, fond of the military profession, 
entered the service of Gustavus of Sweden, received the honour of 
knighthood from that sovereign, and was made Colonel of the 
Scottish Brigade. Afterwards, he went into the French service, 
and died a field-marshal of France. The Memoirs of Sir John 
Hepburn is a scarce but interesting narrative. 

Mr John Walker, who possessed considerable property in this 
parish, is celebrated as the person who first introduced the system 
of fallowing land, and of thereby raising wheat crops far more ex- 
tensively than formerly. He was a person of great intelligence 
and enterprise, and set an excellent example of superior farm cul- 
ture to his neighbours. He was descended from the family of 
Walker of St Fort in Fife, and flourished about the time of the 
Revolution. He was great great-grandfather to Sir Francis Walker 
Drummond of Hawthornden, Bart. 

The Rev. Robert Blair, author of The Grave, was fifteen years 
minister of this parish, and was buried in this churchyard, where 
a monument is erected to his memory. 

 A young gentleman, now a minister of the Church of Scotland, walking one 
day, some years ago, in the minister's garden, which is sepai'ated fi-om the chuich- 
yard, and particularly from the spot where the poet's ashes rest, only by the breadth 
of the garden wall, composed the following lines :

f The spot where the old manse stood is now part of the minister's garden ; and 
the room where the poet sat and wrote was called The Grave, so long as the old 
manse stood.

The late Robert Blair, Lord President of the Court of Session 
in Scotland, a gentleman distinguished no less for his private vir- 
tues than for his high attainments as a lawyer, and his unrivalled 
character as a judge, was a native of this parish, of which his fa- 
ther was minister. When but a boy, in the fourth year of his age, 
he had the misfortune to lose his revered father ; but his educa- 
tion was carefully attended to by his excellent mother, and by his 
maternal uncle, William Law, Esq. of Livingston, Sheriff of Had- 
dingtonshire. Mr Blair died 1811, aged sixty-eight. His death 
was greatly lamented, and deemed a public loss. 

Mr John Home, author of the Tragedy of Douglas, succeeded 
Mr Blair, as minister of this parish. He was ordained at Athel- 
staneford, llth February 1747. Although he was ten years mi- 
nister here, he never took up his residence in the manse. When 
at home he lodged in the village ; but he had a very unsettled ha- 
bit, generally moving from place to place, and living with his friends. 
He was a welcome guest at the houses of many of the gentlemen 
of East Lothian ; and was exceedingly fond of gay company. 

Mr Archibald Skirving, distinguished as a portrait-painter, was 
a native of this parish. He pursued his studies at Rome for a 
considerable time with intense application, and rose to eminence 
in his profession. He was never afflicted with any bpdily trouble 



In this same spot, at such an hDur, 
He viewed the scene, and felt its power j 
At this same hour, a saint in Heaven, 
He feels o'er death the triumph given. 

Charmed by thy verse, to court thy theme, 
Cheered by thy Scripture borrowed beam, 
Sweet Poet, may we fearless trust 
To God our souls, to earth our dust. 

• It appears that he was admonished by his Presbytery for being absent from his 
parish three months, 1755, without leave asked or given. His Tragedy of Douglas 
appears to have been performed for the first time in the month of December 1756 j 
for, in January following, the Presbytery of Edinburgh wrote a letter to the Presby- 
tery of Haddington, informing them, " That a gentleman of their number had at- 
tended the Play-house in Edinburgh, for a number of nights successively, during the 
representation of a profane play called Douglas, of which that gentleman was com- 
monly reported to be the author ; and that, as the scandal happened within the bounds 
of the Presbytery of Edinburgh, that body had thought themselves bound in duty to 
give regular intimation of the same to the Presbytery of Haddington." Before the Pres- 
bytery of Haddington could enter on this matter, Douglas had begun to be acted on the 
London stage, and Mr Home had set off for that city in the beginning of February, 
and lid not return to his charge until 4th May that year. It does not appear, from 
the Record of the Presbytery, that any thing was done by the Presbytery relative to 
the letter from the Presbytery of Edinburgh, nor with respect to Mr Home's long 
alscnce from his charge; it being understood that, after the term of Whitsunday, 
he was to resign Iiis charge; and this he did at a meeting of Presbytery held at 
Athelstaneford, 7th June 1757.

during his lifetime, and he died suddenly, when pursuing his usual 
exercise, having just completed the seventieth year of his age. His 
dust rests with that of his ancestors in Athelstaneford church-yard, 
where a marble monument is erected to his memory. " By simpli- 
fying the comforts of life, he rose to private independence," as one 
has said of him, and left considerable property to his relatives. For 
some years before his death, he kept a riding-horse, and lived more 
in the style of a country gentleman than of an artist. About that 
time his professional labours did not exceed one likeness in the 
twelvemonths, and its price was one hundred guineas. The time 
and labour he bestowed on his likenesses were great beyond what 
can be expressed. Had he painted for gain, he might have left a 
large fortune ; but his great object in painting seemed to be to 
please his own fine taste. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers of this parish 
have been kept correctly since the beginning of last century, and 
are generally written in a fair hand. The register before 1688 is 
imperfect. The record of the Presbytery of Haddington com- 
mences at the first establishment of Presbytery after the period of 
the Reformation, is entire, and appears to have been correctly kept. 

Modern Buildings. — The only modern building of large dimen- 
sion in this parish is the mansion house of Sir David Kinloch, Ba- 
ronet, of Gilmerton. 

An old baronial mansion of large extent stands in this parish, 
formerly the residence of the Earls of Winton. Part of it is still 
inhabited, but the greater part is in ruins. It had been built in 
the form of a square : an excellent garden and fine bowling green 
are attached. The house had been defended by a strong wall, and 
on the north side also by a deep moat. George Earl of Winton 
in large gilt letters is still legible in the ceiling of the principal 
room. 

Ancient Families. — Of the ancient families of distinction in East 
Lothian, whose ancestors swore fealty to Edward I. of England at 
Berwick A. D. 1296, there does not appear to be any now existing, 
and in possession of the lands they then held, except Brown of 
Colestone, the last branch of which family is the Right Honourable 
Christian Brown, Countess of Dalhousie. 

It is perhaps not unworthy of notice, that the lands of East For- 
ton, after passing into various families, are again in the possession 
of a lineal descendant of the renowned Sir Simon Frazer of Peebles- 
shire, whose eldest daughter was married to the ancestor of the 



ATHELSTANEFORD. 



49 



Marquis of Tweeddale, and brought with her a large accession of 
property. The present proprietor of the estate of East Forton, Sir 
Francis Walker Drummond of Hawthornden, Bart., being a lineal 
descendant of the noble house of Tweeddale, has the blood of Sir 
Simon Frazer flowing in his veins. 

Ajitiquities. — When the road-man was opening a new quarry 
three years ago for metal to the roads, in the spot where Athel- 
stan is said to have been buried, he and his men being engaged re- 
moving the stratum of earth which covered the rock, found a stone 
coffin containing the remains of a human body in a very decayed 
state. Part of the cranium was not decomposed ; a considerable 
part of the under jaw remained, and the enamel on the teeth was 
surprisingly white, considering the length of time the body had been 
buried. The coffin was but two and a-half feet below the surface. 
It was formed of five handsome freestones, — one at each side of the 
body, one at the head, another at the feet, placed at right angles, 
and one for a covering. The stones forming the coffin had been 
cemented together with a fine paste made apparently of clay, to 
prevent the admission of the external air. A cavity had been cut 
in the surface of the hard rock, six feet two inches in length, thirty 
inches in breadth, and four in depth, in which the body had been 
laid, and where it was found. The stones that formed the coffin 
rested on the sides of the cavity on a bed of fine clay. Nothing- 
was found in the coffin but what has been stated. An intelligent 
mason examined the stones, and was of the opinion that no free- 
stone of the same quahty as that which formed the coffin has hitherto 
been found nearer to Athelstaneford than at the distance of eight 
miles. The under jaw and coffin of the warrior are in the posses- 
sion of Sir David Kinloch, the proprietor of the estate of Athel- 
staneford. 

History records that the lands on which the battle of Athelstane- 
ford was fought and won, were given by the King of the Scots to 
the Culdee Priory of St Andrews, as an acknowledgment of gra- 
titude to Heaven for the victory obtained. At the Reformation, 
when monkish institutions were abohshed in Scotland, these lands 
were conferred on the Chapel Royal of Holyroodhouse, with 
which they are still connected, and form a considerable part of the 
mcome drawn by the present dean or deans of that venerable fane. 
The late Sir David Kinloch, Bart, of Gilmerton, obtained from the 
Crown a perpetual lease of these lands at the following rent : — 
wlicat, 46 bolls, Linlithgow measure ; barley, 5 1 bolls ditto ; oats, 

HADDINGTON. n  



50 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



35 bolls ditto. Kain fowls : 1 dozen of hens, 2 dozen of poultry 
or chickens. The rent is doubled for one year at every singular 
succession of the family of Kinloch of Gilmerton. 

On the barony of Drem are the remains of a Pictish town, si- 
tuated on the top of a low hill, of a conical form, which is almost 
level on the summit, and which contains about two acres of land. 
The houses, the foundations of which are still obvious, had been 
built round the sides of the summit in regular rows, and the greater 
part in a conical form. In the centre are the foundations of ob- 
long houses of larger dimensions. The conical houses are gene- 
rally twelve feet in diameter within the walls. The town had been 
strongly fortified, — first by a deep circumvallation, and higher up 
the sides of the hill by three ramparts quite perpendicular ; from 
the top of the one rampart to the bottom of the higher there is 
a level space of eighteen feet, from whence the inhabitants could 
defend themselves with great advantage from their assailants. On 
the west side of the hill, looking towards Edinburgh, are three deep 
trenches in succession, before coming to the first circumvallation. 
These out-works appear to have been raised on account of a small 
Roman station in that direction, about half a-mile from the Pictish 
town ; for several Roman implements have been found there, and 
two years ago a large urn of superior workmanship, containing cal- 
cined bones, was found in the same spot. The name of the farm- 
stead is commonly called Captain- Head, which is evidently a cor- 
ruption for Camptown Head. The urn is in the possession of Mr 
David Skirving, farmer, of Camptown Head. The lands belong 
to the Earl of Hopetoun. 

HI. — Population. 
The population of this parish amounted at last census to 931 ; 
at present it amounts to 951. Of these, twelve are Dissenters, 
but during the last thirty years the number of Dissenters have sel- 
dom exceeded one for every hundred of the inhabitants. The na- 
tive inhabitants of the parish are sober, industrious, and well be- 
haved : The strangers amongst us are less so, with some excep- 
tions. 

The number of families in the parish is . . . 212 

chiefly employed in agriculture, . • 132 

in trade, manufacture, or handicraft, 46 

, There is but one family of independent fortune resident in this 
parish, and the whole lands belong to the following persons of dis- 
tinction. Sir David Kinloch, Bart. 18 ploughgates ; Earl of Hope- 
toun, 1 3 ditto; Earl of Wemyss, 7 ditto; Sir Francis W. Drummond, 



ATHELSTANEFORD. 



51 



Bart, of Hawthornden, 11 ditto; Sir Alexander Hope, 6 ditto ; 
Lord Elibank, 3 ditto ; Miss Grant of Congalton, 2 ditto. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — This parish consists of somewhat more than 4000 
acres, 3750 of which are arable. The remainder is planted with 
wood, except 40 acres of hill pasturage. The writer of this account 
has not been able to ascertain the value of the whole agricultural 
produce of this parish ; but he can state that the quantity of wheat 
produced in it annually is about 4000 quarters. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The old church of Athelstaneford was 
built about the middle of the twelfth century by Ada, daughter of 
the Earl of Warenne and Surrey, and wife of Henry Prince of 
Scotland. She built and endowed an Abbey in the neighbour- 
hood of Haddington, and gave the church of Athelstaneford to that 
religious establishment, to be served by its monks. She survived 
her husband twenty-six years, and like her father-in-law. King 
David I., left various proofs of her attachment to the church. 
She died, according to Lord Hailes, a. d. 1178, and in the 13th 
year of the reign of her son William, surnamed the Lion. The 
church she built here, part of which is still standing, continued the 
parish church until the year 1780, when a more suitable one was 
built. It is not inconveniently situated for the inhabitants, and con- 
tains about 500 sittings. 

The manse was built about the same time, and affords sufficient 
accommodation for the minister's family. 

The glebe land consists of five acres, and is worth L. 15 per 
annum. 

The stipend is fifteen chalders of victual, consisting of 116 bolls 
of barley, 116 bolls of oats, and 8 bolls of wheat, Linlithg ow mea- 
sure, payable according to the highest fiar prices of this county. 
When the present minister obtained an augmentation of his sti- 
pend a number of years ago, he asked of the Court a larger pro- 
portion of wheat, that being the kind of grain chiefly raised in this 
parish, and as there is a considerable portion of tithe wheat still 
unappropriated; but the Judges, with the exception of the late Lord 
Meadowbank, refused to grant the request. The minister receives 
also an annuity of L. 1, 8s. left by the late Mrs Hepburn of Monk 
Rig, who died about 180 years ago. 

When the last Statistical Account of this parish was published, 

• I'lic iiiirony of Athelstaneford was part of Ada's dowery lands. 



52 



HADDINGTONSHIRE, 



the number of Dissenters is stated to have been thirty-four. Dis- 
senters are not numerous within the bounds of this Presbytery, ex- 
cept in those parishes where the inhabitants cannot find accommo- 
dation in the parochial churches. The people in general are re- 
gular in their attendance on Divine ordinances, and decent in their 
deportment. The number of communicants is about 385, and 
sometimes 400. 

Education. — There are three schools in this parish. The pa- 
rochial school is in the village of Athelstaneford, and the school- 
master has received a liberal education. The branches taught at 
this school are English, writing, arithmetic, geography, and the 
Latin and French languages. The schoolmaster's salary is the maxi- 
mum ; he is well accommodated with a house and garden, and the 
school room is one of the best within the county. The school fees 
are fixed at a low rate, and the number .of scholars during winter 
and spring are between eighty and ninety, and they are in summer 
about seventy. 

There is another school in this village estabhshed by the heri- 
tors for girls, taught by a woman, who instructs them in the first 
principles of the English language, and in needle-work. The 
number of young persons who attend this school is about twenty. 

The Earls of Hopetoun have, for more than a century past, 
estabhshed a school on their lands in this parish, at which the 
common branches of education are taught. The schoolmaster has 
about L. 10 of salary, and a house and garden ; and the number of 
his scholars is generally thirty-five in summer, and sixty during 
the winter. 

In all these schools the principles of the Christian religion are 
carefully attended to. Lord Hopetoun's schoolmaster has been 
wont to keep a Sunday school in that part of the parish where he 
is settled, and a school of the same kind is kept in the village of 
Athelstaneford. 

The people of this parish give their children the common 
branches of education taught at the parochial school ; and although 
there be an influx of strangers at every Whitsuntide, yet the mi- 
nister is not aware of any in this parish above six years old but 
have been taught to read. The kirk-session pay for the education 
of orphans, and a benevolent lady who resides in this parish pays 
for the education of those whose parents are in mean circumstances. 

Libraries.— k parochial library was established here about thirty 
years ago; and the people are also well supplied with Mr Samuel 



ATHELSTANEFORD. 



53 



Brown's Itinerating libraries, presently consisting of 2600 volumes, 
in forty three divisions, each division remaining a year at one sta- 
tion, so that there is no want of books to them who are disposed 
to read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There never had been any assess- 
ment for the ordinary poor of this parish until a few months ago. 
The receipt of money from the weekly collections at the church 
doors, what is received for the use of a hearse, under the manage- 
ment of the kirk-session, and for mortcloths, have, with some sav- 
ings previous to 1770, been adequate to supply the wants of the 
parochial poor. The people are regular in attending the church, 
and liberal, according to their circumstances, in giving to the poor ; 
and it is for these reasons chiefly, that assessments for the support 
of the poor had not been found necessary in this parish until 1835. 
The kirk-session disburse to the parochial poor about L. 130 an- 
nually. Thirty years ago, when the present incumbent was settled 
here, the number of poor on the roll was almost the same as at 
present, but the monthly allowance to each is about one-third more 
now than it was then. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

At the time the last Statistical Account was published, the farms 
in this parish v/ere too small, and a number of the farmers had not 
sufficient capital to carry on improvements. Grazing was not then 
practised to any considerable extent, and this prevented a proper 
rotation of crops. A large portion of the land was wet, and no 
proper means had been taken to lay it dry. The feeding of sheep 
and cattle on turnip was not then much practised, a great part of 
the land being unfit for that kind of crop. An improved mode of 
drainage has now greatly altered and ameliorated the soil ; so much 
so, that a large extent of land in this parish formerly unfit for tur- 
nips, now bears weighty crops of that valuable root. 

The present farmers are intelligent and skilful in the line of 
their profession, and the far greater part of them are doing every 
thing that wisdom joined with prudence can suggest for the im- 
provement of their possessions. Nine-tenths of the land of this 
county being under entail, the improvements in agriculture which 
East Lothian exhibits, have arisen not so much from encourage- 
ment given by the landlords, as from the spirit and enterprise 
of the farmers. Drainage, however, when well executed, being 
deemed a permanent improvement, many of the landlords now 
show a readiness to bear a fair proportion of the expense of that 



54 



IIADDINGTONSHIIIE. 



undertaking. Drainage, which ought to be one of the first im- 
provements in agriculture, is now the crowning work in that de- 
partment in this district of the country ; and whilst it does honour 
to the proprietors and possessors of the soil, it is, as has been ob- 
served, diftusing an increase of health and comfort among the in- 
habitants. 

The working classes in this parish are sober and industrious, and 
generally well behaved ; they are lodged in comfortable houses, and 
their gains are equal to the maintenance of themselves and the edu- 
cation of their children. They are generally well qualified to per- 
form the kind of work they undertake, and the male part display con- 
siderable knowledge and skill in rural affairs. To these topics, 
however, their knowledge is in a great measure confined. On the 
subjects of sacred history and rehgion their knowledge is very li- 
mited, particularly those of them who are somewhat advanced in 
years, and this ignorance arises from the want of religious instruc- 
tion in youth. But the younger part of this class of the popula- 
tion is better educated and more intelhgent than the aged, and the 
rising generation promises progressive improvement. This change 
is to be ascribed to a better educated and more efficient class of 
parochial teachers. It has been often found that a marked diffe- 
rence exists between the inhabitants of those parishes where the 
clergymen visit and catechise their parishioners annually, and where 
the youth have the benefit of Sunday schools, and the people of 
other parishes, where these advantages are not enjoyed. An in- 
telligent, moral, and religious population, is an object so pleasing 
to a rightly constituted mind, and so advantageous to the interests 
of all, that it may well excite the ministers of the Gospel and in- 
structors of youth, to increased diligence in their vocations, as 
they must be aware that their perseverance will be followed with 
the happiest results.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. D. LOGAN, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
JSlame. — The name of the parish is of Saxon derivation ; it was 
originally Stanton, Scotice Stanetoun. The parish was supposed 
by some to have been so called from parts of the adjacent lands 
abounding in small stones, but more likely from the proximity of 
an excellent freestone quarry, and the cottages in the village being 
built of that material, earher than those in the surrounding neigh- 
bourhood. 

Extent. — The low and populous part of the parish extends to 
about 3 miles from north to south, and to about 3 from east 
to west. It is bounded on the north by parts of the parishes of 
Prestonkirk and Dunbar; on the east by Spott; and on the west 
by Whittingham. A portion formerly insulated from the rest 
stretches into the Lammermoor, to the distance of about 8 miles 
from the church, and is bounded on the south by the Whitewater, 
and Berwickshire. By the late division of the Dunbar common, 
however, and the allotment of portions thereof to the landed pro- 
prietors in the parish, the line to the southern extremity is now 
nearly unbroken, and this line includes Spartledown, the highest 
peak on the Lammermoor range, at the base of which on the south, 
points of the parishes of Spott, Cranshaws, Longformacus, and 
Whittingham, come so near to that of Stenton, that inhabitants of 
each parish might almost hold converse with one another from their 
respective parishes. 

The height of the parish above the level of the sea is about 180 
feet. The climate is salubrious, and before the woods were pro- 
tected, Pressmennan, where there is still an old mansion once in- 
habited by a branch of the Beil family, used to be a place of resort 
to invalids for goat's whey. Instances of great longevity are not 
uncommon here. Within these few years, one person died having 



56 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



very nearly completed her hundredth year, and two considerably 
above 90 in the immediate neighbourhood. 

Hydrography. — Springs abound in many parts of the parish, and 
the vater is generally very cool, and of the best quality. There 
is one near the village called the Rude-well, covered by a circular 
stone building, surmounted by the form of a cardinal's hat, and 
there is a legend that the tenure of the Beil estate depends upon 
the keeping on of this hat. 

Into a deep ravine there issues from the base of a high hill a 
most magnificent spring of the purest water. About the year 1819, 
William H. Nisbet, Esq. built a breast-work, on the east, where 
two opposing hills begin to slant"' down into more level ground. 
A most beautiful lake, about two miles in circumference, was here- 
by formed. Trout were brought from Lochleven, at considerable 
trouble and expense. The experiment succeeded, and along with 
tench and carp, they are now caught in abundance and great per- 
fection. As the hills surrounding the lake are undulating and finely 
wooded, the scenery has been compared to parts of the Rhine. A 
Mr Hamilton, cadet from the Belhaven family, and a Lord of 
Session, took the title of Lord Pressmennan, from this place. So 
attractive is the scenery in summer, that party excursions to sail 
on the lake, dine under the shady tree, and drink from the living 
spring, are frequent. 

Soils. — Clay, from the more stiff and tenacious to the loamy, 
predominates ; although there is also a considerable breadth of 
light turnip soil. The latter generally abounds with small stones. 

Botany. — Mr Street, gardener and florist at Beil, has naturaliz- 
ed or acchmatized the following exotics, which not only live but 
flourish on the Beil terraces : Coronilla valentina, C. ylaiica, Cactus 
Jiagelliformis C. opuntia, C. strictus, Mimulus glutinosus, Coronilla 
juncea, Phormium tenax, or New Zealand flax, Calla Ethiopica pro- 
ducing ripe seeds in pots, Eucomis striata." 

There is a cedar of Lebanon in the Beil grounds, one of the 
largest in Britain. It was brought in a flower-pot from London, 
by the anti-unionist Lord Belhaven, and planted about the begin- 
ning of the last century; girth 14 feet, height about 60 feet, 
expansion of branches from trunk 30 feet, drop from do. in cir- 
cumference about 200 feet. 

" Mr Street has not only been successful in his attempts to naturalize exotics; but 
is also well known to horticulturists, as possessing very considerable science in his 
profession. 



STENTON. 57 

II. — Civil Hisiory. 
Principal Land-oioiiers.— Mrs H. N. Ferguson of Dirleton and 
Belhaven is patron and proprietor of about nine-tenths of the pa- 
rish; J. B. Sydserff, Esq. of Ruchlaw, William Hay, Esq. of 
Hopes, and Sir J. Suttie, Bart, are also heritors. 

The Beil estate came into the Dirleton family by intermar- 
riage. Hence the Nisbets prefixed Hamilton to their name. Soon 
after the death of the late Mr Nisbet, Sir J. Nisbet of Dean re- 
sio-ned all claim to the estate of Dirleton, and the two properties 
are therefore now united. 

The late Mr Nisbet, after the death of his mother Mrs Ha- 
milton, added greatly to the mansion-house at Beil, from a plan 
by Atkinson ; and extended the range along the face of the bank 
on which the building stands to about 500 feet. In a series of 
about seven years, nearly L. 40,000 were expended. The addi- 
tion harmonizes well with the ancient structure. There are three 
tiers of flower terraces to the south, which are always kept in the 
best style, and greatly admired, at the base of which flows a beau- 
tiful stream. In the interior there is a fine variety of marbles fit- 
ted up, as side tables, &amp;c. ; also a few good pictures by the best 
masters. Altogether the mansion is one of the most splendid to 
be seen in any country. It is unique from the terraces ; and the 
correct taste of the late proprietors, Mr and Mrs H. Nisbet, every 
where discovers itself. 

As the old church was very incommodious, Mrs H. N. Ferguson 
with a liberality peculiar to herself, proposed to the other heri- 
tors to assess them at the rate only of L. 900 for a new church, — 
she giving a much larger sum if they would allow her to adopt that 
plan which she might prefer. This was readily agreed to. The 
design was by Burn, modern Gothic, with a magnificent tower ; no 
galleries ; the pulpit in the centre, and the family seat opposite. 
There is accommodation for 400, about 70 more than the law re- 
quires. It cost above L. 2000 ; and was opened by Dr Chalmers, 
October 4, 1829. 

Parochial Registers. — These begin in 1669, and have been pret- 
ty regularly kept. 

III. — Population. 
The population has varied very little from time immemorial. 

According to Dr Webster - - 631 

the former Statistical Account, 624 
And what is very remarkable, a unit makes up the difference of the three last census.

The disparity in the number of males and females probably 
arises from a number of young men leaving the' parish in search 
of employment ; and the young women remaining as outworkers, — 
in which occupation a good many single women, householders, are 
employed, who receive 9d. every day they are called upon to work, 
with 600 yards of potatoes planted, coals driven, &amp;c. for their year- 
ly service.

Poaching in game is beginning to shew itself, from the strict 
system of preserving recently adopted by the surrounding landed 
proprietors. This, along with night watching in the game season, 
is not favourable to the improvement of morals. 

During the last three years there have been six illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

The population is purely agricultural, with only its proportional 
accompaniment of carpenters, masons, blacksmiths, &amp;c. The coun- 
try weaver was formerly one of these accompaniments, but he has 
now almost disappeared. About twelve years ago there were no 
less than nine in the parish, whereas now there are only two ; and 
were it not that spinning is given out at Beil to the old women, 
these two would not be half employed. This change in the do- 
mestic economy has operated injuriously on in-door industry, and 
is the cause why many a bride is unprovided with gear of this kind 
at the time when the nuptials are celebrated.

rially to improve tena'cious soils. Bruisedbones and rape-dust render 
the distant farmer almost independent of dung as a manure. Cattle 
likewise at two years old are brought to the same perfection, with re- 
gard to weight and fat as formerly at three. Altogether a great im- 
petus has lately been given to agriculture in all its branches. Land- 
lords are too enlightened not to se6 it to be their interest to give 
every encouragement to the tenantry ; and Mrs. H. N. Ferguson 
takes the lead in all that is liberal. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Dunbar is the nearest market-town, distant about five miles. 

Villages. — Stenton and Petcox. The latter for ages gave the 
name to the parish. In olden times it was a rectory, and a Mr 
Cockburn, the rector, was the first Protestant minister of Hadding- 
ton. He does not seem to have been a zealous Protestant, how- 
ever; for in 1564 and 1565 he was complained of for absenting him- 
self from the General Assembly. In Bagimont's roll, the Rec- 
tory of Petcox is rated at L. 2, 13s. 4d. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stands near the west boundary 
of the parish, and not very convenient for a part of the population. 
All the sittings are free. The manse was built in 1783, and re- 
paired in 1820, having been struck by lightning. The glebe is 
7 acres in extent. Rent 9 quarters wheat at second fiars. Sti-

About one-eighth of the inhabitants are Dissenters, whogo to Dun- 
bar and East Linton. The collections for religious purposes may 
average about L. 10 annually. 

Education. — There is only one school in the parish, but all the 
children are within reach either of it or schools in the surrounding 
parishes. All are taught to read. Above one-sixth of the popu- 
lation are regularly receiving both week-day and Sabbath tuition. 
All the usual branches are taught. The salary is the maximum; 
the fees amount to about L. 40 per annum. Reading per quarter 
2s. 6d. and other branches in proportion. 

Libraries. — There is one parish library and two itinerating. 

Friendly Society. — A friendly society has lately been instituted. 

Poor. — Average number who get regular assistance, 16; occa- 
sional ditto, 5; average annual allowance, L. 4, 5s. There has 
been an assessment for upwards of thirty years. It varies at pre- 
sent from L. 50 to L. 60 per annum. Collections and mortcloths, 
L. 21 ; interest on mortified money, L. 25. Precentor, beadle, &amp;c. 
paid out of these funds. There is a growing disposition on the 
part of the poor to seek relief: aged parents wish to ease their 
children, and children to throw off parents. Still, however, there 
are many honourable exceptions. 

Alehouses. — There are two" alehouses in the parish. 

Puel. — Coals rate very high; lid. per cwt. Carted from Pen- 
caitland and Penston, or sea carried to Dunbar.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN LUMSDEN, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, c.— The name of the parish is derived no doubt from the 
Saxon Whit-ting-ham, the dweUing on the White Mead. There 
are several places in England of the same name. The village and 
church of Whittingham stand upon the bank of a winding stream, 
which arises in the parish of Garvald, but is here called Whit- 
tingham Water. This parish formed two chapelries, which were 
subordinate to the church of Dunbar. The lower part of the pa- 
rish was served by the chapel of Whittingham, and the higher 
part in Lammermoor was served by the chapel of Penshiel, and 
these two chapels formed two of the prebends of the collegiate 
church, when it was settled under that form in 1342. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish extends in length from north 
to south 11 miles, and its mean breadth from east to west is 4 
miles, and contains 44 square miles. It is bounded on the south- 
west by the parish of Garvald ; on the west by Moreham ; on the 
north by Prestonkirk ; on the east by Stenton ; and on the south by 
the parishes of Cranshaws and Longformacus, in Berwickshire. 

Topographical Appearances, SfC- — The figure of the parish is ir- 
regular. Its surface southward is varied and uneven, rising and falling 
gradually from the village to the foot of Stoneypathhill; from the top 
of which there is an extensive prospect of the German ocean, Island 
of May, the Bass rock, the Frith of Forth, the coast of Fife, and 
almost all the lower part of East-Lothian, and part of Mid-Lo- 
thian. The village, which is but a small one, stands on an eleva- 
tion of about 360 feet above the level of the sea. The air is keen 
and the climate healthy, both in the lower part of the parish, and 
in that extensive tract of it among the Lammermoor hills. 

Hydrography. — There are several excellent springs of water in 
the parish ; and several salubrious streams run through both its 
lower and higher districts. The Whittingham water rises in the 



G2 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



parish of Garvald, and joining the Nunraw burn at the east extre- 
mity of that parish, flows in an easterly direction through a beautiful 
glen or valley, in a winding course, bending sometimes to the right 
bank and sometimes to the left bank, both of which are covered 
from the top to the bottom with the finest trees of various kinds. 
This stream runs through a beautiful and romantic glen, by 
Beil, Belton, West Barns, and falls into the sea at Belhaven. The 
Whittadder rises on the north-west point of the farm of Johns- 
cleugh, and flows from the white well southward about three miles, 
and joins Fasseney water at Millknow. This last mentioned stream 
rises on the eastern part of Westhope's farm, in the parish of Gar- 
vald. The Whittadder having received this addition at Mill- 
know, rolls on in a south-east direction, till it falls into the Tweed 
four miles above Berwick. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— h\ the parish of Whittingham there 
are several excellent quarries of red freestone, which have been 
wrought to great extent. The Fasseney water, in Lammermoor, 
will ever be a spot peculiarly interesting to the geologist, from the 
appearance which it presents. It is well known that the extensive 
range of mountainous country called the Lammermoor hills extend 
across the whole island, from the east sea to the west. It consists of a 
series of transition rocks, especially greywacke. It is obvious, that, 
however high their situation is at present, they must have once been 
laid at the bottom of the sea, and must have been raised up to their 
present situation by some immense expansive power from below, 
and which not only gave their elevation but their inclination, which 
in the whole range is almost vertical. It is not improbable that 
this has been eff'ected by amass of granite under them. Granite, it 
is generally admitted, appears either in mass, or in veins from it. 
The granite here is in mass ; but, so far as I know, it has never 
been discovered, as thrusting its veins into the superincumbent 
schistus. 

The appearance that it makes here is equally interesting both to 
the Wernerian and the Huttonian, each maintaining that it affords 
a confirmation of their respective theories. The Wernerian holds 
that granite is of the oldest formation of rocks, supporting all others. 
The Huttonian, on the other hand, maintains that it is a rock va- 
rying in age, consequently alternating with Neptunian rocks of dif- 
ferent epochas. The Wernerian, of course, affirms that it owes its ori- 
gin to water, the Huttonian to subterranean heat. But its present 
elevation and inclination could not have been produced by water, but 



WHITTINGHAM. 



63 



by some igneous force below. And the point of difference here is, 
whether this granite is stratified or not; and Dr Hutton was of opi- 
nion that no granite is stratified, for if so, this he imagined would 
set aside his theory. His disciples, however, differ somewhat from 
their master in this. And his acute and learned illustrator, Mr 
Playfair, and the scientific Sir James Hall of Dunglass, admitted 
that oranite was to be found stratified, or in masses of great size, 
with seams in it ; yet, if it might be called stratified, it was very 
different from other rocks having this name. 

The granite in Fasseney water has certainly some appearance 
of stratification, or of being divided by seams of considerable thick- 
ness. And Mr Playfair affirms, that, though it was not admitted 
by Dr Hutton in his theory, yet he was of opinion that it does not 
oppose that theory in the smallest degree. Geologists may examine 
and judge for themselves. Upon the banks of this stream iron 
and copper ore have been found ; a small piece of the former was 
presented to Dr Hope many years ago. The writer of this has 
a small specimen of each of them in his possession. 

H. — Civil History. 

The Earls of March held their Baronial Court at Whittingham. 
In 1363, Patrick Earl of March granted to Alexander de Riek- 
linton the half of the lands of Spot, which Sir Alexander Ramsay 
had resigned, " in plena curia nostra apud Whytingeham." In 
1372, George Earl of March gave in marriage with his sister 
Agnes, to James Douglass of Dalkeith, the manor of Whittingham, 
with the patronage of the chapel, when Whittingham and Penshiel 
became a separate parish from Dunbar, which estate and patron- 
age the Douglasses of Dalkeith possessed about 190 years. 

In October 1564, Queen Mary granted to James Earl of Mor- 
ton, who represented the Douglasses of Dalkeith, all their estates, 
with the barony of Whittingham, the castle and mills, and also the 
advowson of the church of Whittingham, and the Queen's grant 
to that unworthy servant was ratified by Parliament the 19th day 
of April 1567. 

The next historical event which here occurred respects the 
murderers of Darnley, King of Scotland. It appears from history 
that the scene of this dreadful treason was laid in the castle of 
Whittingham. Part of this ancient building is still inhabited. 
Morton had just returned home from England, where he had been 
expatriated for the murder of Rizzio, being now pardoned by the 

• Vide Caledonia. 



04 



H ADD I N GTON S H 1 R H . 



Queen ; here he met the Earl of Bothweli to concert the murder 
of Darnley, during the first week of December 1566. 

Morton, being accused and tried for his share in the King's mur- 
der, was openly convicted by an impartial jury of his countrymen, 
and finished his guilty career on the scaffold, for the very deed of 
which he had unjustly accused his Queen, who had so often par- 
doned his crimes and loaded him with favours. The night before 
his execution, being examined by the ministers of Edinburgh, he 
with his dying breath confessed his guilt. 

It appears that Lethington, as well as Archibald Douglas, was 
present in Whittingham at the time referred to, persuading Mor- 
ton to take part with them in the King's murder. And no doubt 
remains that he yielded to their importunities.  

The Earl of Morton was forfeited in 1581 ; but James VI. 
soon returned the traitor's estates to his family, which were pos- 
sessed by them for a considerable time, till at length the estate 
of Whittingham passed to more worthy proprietors. For ear- 
ly in the seventeenth century. Viscount Seton of Kingston, 
married the daughter of Sir Archibald Douglas, who succeeded 
her father as heiress of Whittingham, by whom he had eleven 
children, six sons and five daughters. Both Archibald, the second 
Viscount Kingston, and James, the third Viscount, having died 
without issue, the honours became extinct. The Honourable Lady 
Elizabeth Seton, the youngest of the family, having survived all 
the rest, became heiress of Whittingham. She was married to 
the Honourable William Hay of Drummelzier, second son of the 
first Earl of Tweeddale, in the year 1695, as appears from the 
parish register of marriages : and by this marriage came into the 
possession of the estate of Whittingham and Stoneypath Tower. 
They had a numerous and highly respectable family of sons and 
daughters. The Hays of Drummelzier were long the proprietors 
of Whittingham. They were accounted most excellent landlords, 
— were highly esteemed by their equals, — and revered and beloved 
by their tenants in every county where they had property. Their 
representatives still retain the same amiable character. This 
estate was sold in the year 1817, to James Balfour, Esq. second 
son of John Balfour, Esq. of Balbirnie. 

Land-owners. — The principal proprietors of this parish now are, 
James Balfour, Esq. of Whittingham and Papple, Lord Wemyss,

and in tlie Appendix to Crawford's Memoirs.

the Marquis of Tweecldale, the Earl of Haddington, Captain 
Buchan Svdserff, of Ruchlaw, Andrew Houston, Esq. of May- 
shiel, Mrs"'H. Nisbet Ferguson of Beil, and Miss Dakymple of 
Hailes. The two last mentioned have each but a small possession 
in the parish. 

James Balfour, Esq. the principal proprietor of this parish, has 
built a splendid mansion upon the south bank of the Whittingham 
water, of Grecian architecture, delightfully situated, and com- 
manding a view of the country towards the sea. It is surrounded 
by beaudful plantations tastefully laid out. Through the adjacent 
grounds, a variety of beautiful walks are interspersed, and, what 
seldom happens in other places, they have always a dry bot- 
tom, both summer and winter, and are so planned and contriv- 
ed, that on some of them, it is very easy at any season to find 
shelter from the wind and the storm. Towards this elegant 
edifice of Whittingham House, there are three magnificent ap- 
proaches,— one from the east, one from the south, and one from 
the west. 

Parochial Registers.— The date of the earliest entry in the pa- 
rish register is 1626. There have been some part of it lost ; but 
it has been kept pretty regularly for the last ninety years. 

Antiquities.— Uonihe Marquis.of Tweeddale's estate of Priest- 
law, at the south-east extremity of the parish, there is the appear- 
ance of a strong encampment, all the parts of which are still en- 
tire, as described in the former Statistical Account of this parish. 
This camp is of an oval form, with the broadest end, which is in- 
accessible, toward the north. On one side are four ditches paral- 
lel to each other, and the distance betwixt each is about twelve 
yards. On the north side are three ditches, and the outer one is 
carried round the whole. The circumference of this ancient mili- 
tary work measures about 670 yards. 

Part of the Castle of Whittingham is still in good repair, and 
is inhabited. It bears evident marks of great antiquity. There 
is another old building upon this estate called Stoneypath Tower, 
which was occupied in the year 1414, by James Douglas, design- 
ed of Roberton, who got it from his father James Douglas, the 
first Lord Dalkeith. It seems to have been strongly fortified both 
by nature and by art. A considerable part of its lofty walls are still 
standing. These estates seem to have been united and in the pos- 
session of one owner prior to the period in which Queen Mary be-

Stowed the barony of Whittingham on the Earl of Morton in 1564, 
as mentioned above. 

The ruins of the baronial residence of Penshiel are still visible. 
The pend or arch of one wing of the building is still standing. 
The chapel of Penshiel stood below the house in a glen still cal- 
led Chapel Haugh. There seem to have been a good many build- 
ings about it. It is not certain whether any religious services 
have been performed in it since the Reformation. 

There are also the ruins of another religious house in this pa- 
rish on the estate of Papple ; but at what period it -Vt-as erected, 
or when it was demolished, is not now known. About twenty feet 
of the height of one of its walls are still standing, covered over 
with ivy. A story concerning it has been handed down from fa- 
ther to son, to the present time. There was a religious house at 
Friardykes in the parish of Stenton, to which the refractory priests 
from Melrose were occasionally banished ; and betwixt the in- 
habitants of that place and Papple House, there was a frequent 
intercourse. A servant of one of the monks at Friardykes had 
by accident become aware of the murder of one of the nuns at 
Papple by the monks ; but not knowing that his master was con- 
cerned, communicated to him the discovery. The master there- 
upon takes measures to secure a similar fate for the servant him- 
self ; and the tradition bears that this was prevented by M. De 
Lisle, the proprietor of Stoneypath Tower, discovering the pur- 
pose of the master in a letter which the servant was carrying from 
him to the master of the house of Papple. 

III. — Population. 
In the former Statistical Account, it is said, that in 1755, the 
number of inhabitants in this parish was 714. In 1821, it was 
750; in 1831, 715. This decrease of 35 persons was owing to 
the principal resident heritor's family being in London at the 
time when the list was made up, and also on account of several 



houses in the village having been taken down.

Character and Habits of the People,— TXe' are in general elean- 
ly in their houses and persons, orderly and decent in their behavi- 
our. Most of them attend regularly on public worship, and show 
a proper respect for the solemn ordinances of religion. There is 
only one public-house, which, as it is well regulated, has no bad 
eftect upon the morals of the parishioners. 

During the last three years, there have been four illegitimate 
births in the parish.

Agriculture and Rural Economy.—

under wood,  '  

The greater proportion of the lands are enclosed with ditch and 
hedge, and in some places with stone dikes. The soil on the south 
side'of Whittingham water is inferior to that on the north side. 
A part of the former division is of a light and sandy soil, and some 
of it poor clay ; however, there are several fields even here of a rich 
fertile good turnip soil. Upon the north side of the water, the 
soil is of a superior quality, some of it is a deep rich loam, capable 
of producing as rich crops, when the season is favourable, as any 
land in the county. 

There are six large farms in the upper part of the parish among 
the Lammermoor hills ; part of some of them is arable, and in 
favourable seasons yields tolerable crops. The sheep grazed in 
this extensive district .amount to about 270 scores, which, besides 
other profits, yield about 800 stones of wool. There are few black 
cattle fed here. The rental of these six farms is about L. 900. 
Two of them were let for three nineteen years leases and a life- 
time. 

The modes of husbandry generally followed in the lower part 
of the parish are the following : On a rich clay soil a rotation of 
seven shifts, viz. fallow, wheat, grass, grass, oats, beans, wheat ; 
on a poor clay soil a five-sbift rotation, fallow, wheat, grass, grass, 
oats ; on rich turnip soil seven-shift rotation, turnips, wheat, or 
barley, grass, grass, oats, beans, wheat ; on a poor turnip soil five- 
shift rotation, turnips, barley, grass, grass, oats. • 

Rent of Land. — In the lower part of the parish the maximum 
rent is L. 3, 10s. and the minimum L. 1, 10s. per acre, Scots 
As some of the farms are now let at a grain rent, the average can- 
not be exactly ascertained. The rent for the grass of an ox or

COW is betwixt L. 3 and L. 4. The real rent of the parish is about 
L. 7596. 

The average gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish, 
as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of gi ain of all kinds - - L. 13466 0 0 

potatoes, turnips, and hay, 2068 0 0 

land in pasture, - - 1696 0 0 

thinning of woods, - - 45 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, - L. 17275 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is only one village in the parish, from which, to the nearest 
market-town, Haddington, is a distance of six miles ; Dunbar is 
seven miles distant from Whittingham. The roads through this 
parish are no less in extent than thirty miles. There are 57 
ploughgates in the parish, and each pays L. 2 for keeping these 
lines of roads in proper repair. 

Ecclesiastical Stefe.— The church is situated on the north side 
of Whittingham Water. It was built in 1722, and was repaired and 
made very commodious though still rather small in the year 1820. 
It can only accommodate about 350, though it should contain 476. 
There are usually about 270 communicants. The greatest part of 
the population reside to the westward of it, — some of those, in the 
Lammermoor district, being ten miles distant from their parish 
church. The manse was built in 1765, and is still in good order. 
The glebe, garden, and ground occupied by the manse and offices, 
contain 6 acres of good ground. The stipend was augmented in 
1829, to 16 chalders of victual, half oats, and half barley, and L. 8, 
6s. 8d. for communion element money. The number of families 
attending the Established church is 133 ; of Dissenting or Seced- 
ing families, 3. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only seminary in the 
parish, the master of which has the maximum salary, L. 34, 4r. 4d. : 
and his school fees may amount to L. 27 per annum. He has also 
about L. 14 a-year from other sources. The average number of 
scholars is 75. There are no persons in the parish above six years 
who cannot read, nor above ten who cannot write, or are not learn- 
ing to do so. There are about 50 Sunday scholars. 

Poor. — The number of persons on the poor list at present is 
17 old persons, and 12 children, who cannot yet support them- 
selves. The old persons receive from 15s. per quarter, to L. 1, 5s., 



WHITTINGIIAM. 



69 



the children get 8s. 6d. per quarter each. The total amount dis- 
tributed among the poor, young and old, is about L. 88, 8s. annual- 
ly, besides house rents to some, and occasional supplies to others, 
in time of distress. The sums for the support of the poor are 
raised by assessment by the collections at the church, which amount 
annually to about L. 15, and by proclamations of marriage, and by 
mortcioths, and by L. 4 of interest of money mortified by the late 
Alexander Hay, Esq. of Drummelzier, once the patron of this pa- 
rish. The assessment for this year amounts to L. 70. Out of the ses- 
sion funds, the session-clerk, the precentor, and officer, are paid small 
salaries. The patron of the parish occasionally sends donations 
to the minister for the support of the industrious poor, not on the 
list, who may stand in need of some temporary supply; and his 
lady benevolently distributes among them coals and clothes annu- 
ally, as their necessities require. 

The receiving of parochial aid is here now reckoned no degra- 
dation. Many demand it as a legal right ; and instances are not 
uncommon of active young men in good circumstances, who do not 
think it incumbent on them to supply the wants of their aged pa- 
rents, but who without scruple, consign them to the support of the 
parish.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN JAFFRAY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The richest part of East Lothian, which is the finest 
corn district in North Britain, is the parish of Dunbar. The name 
is evidently derived from the castle, which had the same appellation, 
and stood on a lofty rock within sea-mark, dividing equally the 
length of the parish. This castle, according to Hollinshed and 
■Buchanan, was conferred by Kenneth 1. of Scotland, about the year 
835, upon an eminent warrior, whose name was Ba'-, — hence it was 
called Dun-bar; but it is much more probable that this ancient hero 
took his name from the castle, and that the word is descriptive of 
the object and its situation, and signifies, both in British and Gae- 
lic, according to the learned author of Caledonia, the fort on the 
height, top, or extremity. 

Extent Boimdaries, 8fc, — The parish consists of a royal burgh 
and a landward district. The former is near the castle, to which 
it owes both its name and existence. The latter stretches along 
the coast from east to west, 7 miles, 6 furlongs, and 160 yards in 
length, and from south to north 3 miles, 6 furlongs, and 70 yards 
in breadth. The mean length is 6 miles and 6 furlongs, and the 
mean breadth 1 mile 5 furlongs, — which gives 11 square miles 
of extent. It is bounded by the parishes of Tynninghame and 
Prestonkirk on the west ; Stenton and Spott on the south ; In- 
nerwick on the east ; and the German ocean on the north. 

Topographical Appearances. — The figure is very irregular, being 
much indented both by the sea and by other lands. The coast to 
the east of the castle is of low rocky ledges, and to the west it is of 
craggy cliffs, which are lost under the sand of the beautiful bay of 
Belhaven. The surface presents a pleasing variety of hill and dale, 
ascending gradually from the sea towards Lammermoor — com- 
manding an extensive prospect which embraces a great variety of 
striking objects,— St Abb's Head, Traprain-law, the beautiful woods

of Tynninghame, the Bass, the May, and the boundless ocean. 
The highest ground is Brunt-hill, which is 700 feet above the level 
of the sea: near to which, on the march, is Downhill, which is 580 
feet above the level of the sea, and is famous as the place where 
Leslie encamped previous to the battle afterwards noticed. 

Hi/dro/raph2/.— The land is naturally so dry, that it would be 
difficult to find a spring on the surface. The water which supplies 
the town is brought two miles in leaden pipes from St .John's well, m 
the parish of Spott,— which well is 200 feet above the sea.— The 
difference between high and low water is 18 feet.— There are four 
streams which wind their way from the hills, and run through the 
parish into the ocean,— the Tyne, which separates Dunbar from 
Tynninghame,— the Belton water, which, after running through the 
old parish of Belton, joins the sea at the old port of la Belle Haven, 

Broxburn which gives its name to Broxmouth Park, and joins 

the sea there, — and Dryburn water, which is the eastern boundary. 

Geology. — The rocky formations are all of the secondary class, 
and upon the coast they are laid bare, as if on purpose to attract 
the notice of the geologist. The strata are either horizontal or 
inclined, and at particular places nearly vertical. The direction is 
N. E. and S. W. and the dip is to the S. E. From the eastern 
march west to the inlet of Broxburn, these . rocks are grayish, and 
at some places yellowish sandstone, stratified and nearly horizon- 
tal, with numerous superincumbent beds of bluish gray hmestone. 
One of these calcareous rocks east of Catcraig is a bed of petrifi- 
ed shells; and another of them, on the west of the same place, 
is petrified coral, and resembles masses of worms. There is a 
boulder east of the Vault, and another on the west, both just with- 
in flood -mark, and not belonging to the neighbouring rocks, but 
of granite formation. West of the said inlet, is a narrow bed or 
dike of porphyritic basaltic greenstone. Here the grayish sand- 
stone disappears, and the place is occupied by red sandstone, more 
inclined, and at places nearly vertical. Next in succession is a 
rock of greenstone, of red coloured trap tuff, and of red conglo- 
merated sandstone. These rocks are marked with beautiful moun- 
tain-green spots and they fill up the space right on to the harbour, 
which is cut out of a thick bed of red-coloured trap, which Profes- 
sor Jameson calls an iron shot porphyritic greenstone, — the colum- 
nar structure of which is visible all around, but particularly on the 
north-west side of the battery. These columns are either penta- 
gons or hexagons, but not of equal sides, having one large and one 
small, and the rest nearly equal. They are jointed, but not so regu-

larly as those in the Island of Staffa, having convex ends answer- 
ing to the concave bottoms of the incumbent joints ; and they are 
neither in horizontal norvertical layers,butare formed of anhundred 
concentric circles like the coats of an onion, and, what is still more 
peculiar, they are intersected by a thousand jasper veins as small as 
horse hairs, traversing but not intercepting one another in all direc- 
tions. The septa of red and white sparry matter fills up the space be- 
tween them, and they are pervaded transversely by veins of the same 
matter. Such is the external and internal formation of these ba- 
salts, which resemble the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and are 
considered a great natural curiosity. Under these pillars, is a 
bed of red-coloured trap tuff resting upon sandstone, succeeded 
by lofty rugged rocks of the trap series, upon which the vestiges 
that remain of the ancient Castle of Dunbar are founded. Here the 
softer rocks have yielded to the perpetual motion of the waters, 
while the more compact remain, forming large caverns and rugged 
arches, — through which the tide rushes with impetuous fury, present- 
ing a grand spectacle at all times, but awfully sublime during a 
storm. West of the castle, is a tract of sandstone, through the cen- 
tre of which a mass of trap rock called the " doo rock" rises to a 
considerable height, and not being hid by debris, it may fitly be 
compared to the skeleton of a mountain in miniature. Craggy cliffs 
of trap rock continue onward until they are succeeded first by cliffs, 
and then by ledges of red and white sandstone, which disappear 
under the sand of Belhaven bay. 

Soil. — The general character of the soil is a rich brown loam, 
having a substratum of clay or gravel of great depth resting, to the 
west of Belton water, upon trap ; and from that water to Broxburn, 
upon a tract of red sandstone, which runs west through the county; 
and from that stream east, upon limestone, corresponding with the 
rocks upon the coast. Coal has been found here at several places, but 
not of sufficient thickness to be wrought. It abounds west of Had- 
dington, and also directly opposite in Fife; and as Dunbar is in the 
same basin, there is a great probability that workable seams exist 

• The Fox man-of-war was unfortunately stranded off Dunbar in 1745, and there 
went to pieces. The wreck remained under water above thirty years, when a violent 
storm laid a part of it bare, and several masses, consisting of iron, ropes, and balls were 
found on the Belhaven sands, near the place, covered over with a very hard ochry 
substance, of the colour of iron, which adhered thereto so strongly that it required 
great force to detach it from the fragments of tlie wreck. Upon examination, this 
substance appeared to be sand, concreted and hardened into a kind of stone. In a

Epipactis palustris, marsh near Duubar ; Verrucaria maura, ba- 
saltic rocks at Dunbar; and Menyanthes trifoUata, marshes at Brox- 
mouth. The following Algse are found on the rocks and coast of 
Dunbar, Lichina minor, Lichina conjinis, Alaria esculenta, lio- 
dovienia laciniata, Sp/icerococcus laciniatus, Ceramium cirrosum, and 
Fiicus loreus. 

Trees. — There are scarcely any plantations but such as adorn 
the houses of proprietors. The land is considered too valuable 
to be laid out in that way, and the farmer has but little fancy for 
that kind of produce. He prefers a well-dressed hedge to the in- 
numerable rows of brushwood which in England occupy at least a 
tenth part of the soil. At Broxmouth, there are many stately well- 
grown trees of all kinds, and at Belton there are lofty silver fi rs about 
two hundred years old, and a magnificent beech tree which, three 
feet from the ground, measures 18 feet 6 inches. The timber is 
toughj weighty, and of excellent quality. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is a history of Dunbar by Mr James Miller, a useful and 
meritorious work; it was published in 1830. 

The origin of parishes in North Britain, says Chalmers, cannot 
be traced beyond the ninth century. The time when Dunbar was 
established is unknown ; but, from the circumstance of its being 
the most valuable parish in Lothian, it is probable that it was one 
of the first formed in that district. It is distinguished for its 
fertility and cultivation, and it derived all its ancient importance 
from the castle, which was accounted the principal key of the king- 
dom. 

The lands of Dunbar and the eastern marches were conferred 
by Malcolm Canmore, in 1072, upon Cospatrick Earl of North- 
umberland, a princely nobleman, who fled from the wrath of Wil- 
liam the Conqueror, into Scotland, and there had a long suc- 
cession of potent and warlike descendants, who were created Earls 
of Dunbar and March, and held the same possessions till they were 
forfeited in 1435. The castle rendered Dunbar the theatre of 
many warlike exploits. Twice it was the field of very deadly strife: 
In 1296, when the whole force of Scotland collected for the relief 
of the castle, were defeated in battle with great slaughter, by Earl 
Warrene, the English Commander, who was sent to press the siege: 
And again in 1650, when Cromwell defeated Leslie on the same

oroLind " It is a sad reflection," says Chalmers, " that it was of 
fittle importance to a harassed people whether tlie fanatical Leslie 
or the miscreant Cromwell should prevail." The first of these 
actions is here called the battle of Dunbar, 1.e other the battle 
of Downhill.-During the civil war in 1745, Sir John Cope land- 
ed his troops at Dunbar, where he was joined by two regiments of 
draooons : he marched thence towards Edinburgh, and was mglo- 
rioily defeated in the battle of Preston.-In 1779, the famous 
Paul Jones lay off Dunbar several days with five ships, and alarm- 
ed the inhabitants, who prepared to defend the town.-In 1781, the 
American Captain Fall, another sea adventurer, tried to carry oft 
a vessel from the mouth of the harbour. This led to a brief and 
decisive action : three shots were fired on each side, and one ol 
them from the shore was so well directed by an old skdful seaman, 
that it nearly carried away the enemy's mast, and made him change 
his purpose. To defend the town and harbour agamst such as- 
saults, a battery was erected in the same year, of sixteen guns,— 
which at the general peace were removed to Edinburgh.— When 
an invasion of the French was dreaded, it was believed that a land- 
ing miht be attempted at Belhaven bay ; to guard against which 
ajQ encampment was made in 1803 on West Barns Links, under 
the command of General Don, a very active officer ; and thereafter 
barracks were erected west of the castle for 1200 mfantry, and 
at Belhaven for 300 cavalry. Dunbar was distinguished for its 
loyalty, and could boast of a corps of volunteers, and a troop of 
yeomanry cavalry collected from the parish and_ neighbourhood, 
equal to any in the kingdom. 

BurffL—BuchsLXiaiU mentions Dunbar so early as the year 856, 
when it was burned by Kenneth King of Scotland. It has evi- 
dently grown up under the protection of its castle. It was of old 
surrounded with a wall, had three posts or gates, and its principal 
street is regular and spacious. It was created by David IL a free 
burgh, with limits as extensive as the earldom of March, with a 
market cross, with power to buy and sell, with a coquet and trone, 
and with a free port at la Belle Haven. Its privileges were after- 
wards confirmed and extended by several royal charters. In one 
of the last of these charters, dated " apud palatium nostrum de 
Halyrudhaus, 1 Mar. 1603," King James VL confirmed to the 
provost, baiUes, and community of Dunbar, the charter of David II. 
—a charter by King James IL, dated 16th May 1445,— a cliarter

by Mary Queen of Scots, dated 18th June 1555,— and another 
charter by the same Queen, dated 31st March 1567; and defined 
the boundaries of the burgh according to a decision of the Court 
of Session, dated the 21st June 1569. 

A representative from Dunbar was admitted into the Scottish 
Parliament; but since the Union, it unites with Haddington, North- 
Berwick, Jedburgh, and Lauder, in sending one member to Par- 
liament. The town was entirely burned in 1548, by the English 
army which Henry VHI. sent to punish the Scots for refusing to 
allow the marriage of their young Queen with his son. It is go- 
verned by a Provost, three BaiUes, a Treasurer, and fifteen Coun- 
cillors. Its annual revenue is upwards of L. 1300 Sterling, derived 
from property and imposts. 

Eminent Characters. — Columba Dunbar was Dean of the Church 
of Dunbar in 1411, when he was promoted to the see of Moray. 

Thomas Hay, Dean of Dunbar, was, in 1532, appointed a Sena- 
tor of the College of Justice. 

Andrew Wood, Rector of Dunbar, was in 1676, promoted to 
the Bishopric of the Isles, and continued to hold it by dispensa- 
tion. He was translated to the see of Caithness, which he held 
till his episcopate was abolished at the Revolution. He died at 
Dunbar at the venerable age of seventy-six. 

George Home of Manderston, Lord High Treasurer of Scot- 
land under James VI., by whom he was, in 1605, created Earl of 
Dunbar, died at Whitehall the 29th January 1611, and was bu- 
ried in the Old Church of Dunbar. A splendid marble monument, 
superior, it is said, in sculpture to any thing of the kind in Scotland, 
was erected to his memory : it is still preserved in the present 
church, and is 12 feet broad and 26 feet high. It is alleged that 
the Earl was attached to the prelatic form of worship ; and ac- 
cordingly, he is represented at full length, clad in armour, kneel- 
ing on a cushion, with his prayer book open before him. His sup- 
porters are two knights in armour ; and above, on the one side stands 
Justice, and on the other Wisdom. There are other appropriate 
figures and devices, and the whole is crowned with the arms of 
Home. 

James Kirkwood, Rector of Astwick, in Bedfordshire, was born 
in the parish, and educated at the schools of Dunbar. He be- 
queathed in 1708, curiosities, books, and papers to the Presbytery 
of Dunbar, giving an account of his endeavours, in conjunction w ith

the Honourable Robert Boyle, in disseminating the Irish Bible 
throuohout the Highlands of Scotland. 

Patrick Carfrae, D. D. was translated from Morham in 1795, to 
the church and parish of Dunbar. He was perhaps the most elo- 
quent and accomplished preacher of his day. It is well known 
that such was the opinion of a very competent judge, the late Lord 
Liverpool, who was a regular hearer in the church of Dunbar, when 
stationed here with his regiment. Doctor Carfrae possessed m a 
high degree all the requisites of an orator ; and was one of the 
brightest ornaments of the classic age which is gone by. 

A family of the name of Fall established themselves at Dunbar, 
and became during the last century the most extensive merchants 
in Scotland. They were long the chief magistrates of the burgh, 
and preferred the public good to their own profit. They have left 
no one to bear their name, not even a stone to tell where they he ; 
but they will long be remembered for their enterprise and public 
spirit. 

Chief Land-owners.— The Duke of Roxburghe; Sir George 
Warrender of Lochend ; Robert Hay, Esq. of East-Barns ; Cap- 
tain Hay, R. N. of Belton ; General Hardyman of Heatherwick; 
Mrs Hamilton Nisbet Ferguson of Ninewar ; William Sandilands, 
Esq. of Barnyhili ; John Allan, Esq. of Links, &amp;c. Most of the 
estates of these land-owners have long been in possession of their 
famihes respectively. 

Parochial Registers.— Theiv earliest date is 1658. They have 
been regularly kept, and are not voluminous. The burgh register 
of sasines begins in 1620, the register of dispositions in 1737, and 
the council books in 1656. 

Antiquities, Castle, Sfc. — The ruins of the castle form a remark- 
able antiquity. They are particularly described by Sir Walter 
Scott in his Provincial Antiquities, and Grose has preserved two 
views of them. Founded upon a lofty rugged rock within the sea- 
mark, and connected with a battery on the adjoining land, by a 
wall through which there is a covered passage, this castle was so 
strongly fortified both by nature and by art, that before the inven- 
tion of gunpowder it was deemed impregnable. The date of the 
buildings is unknown ; but they are evidently the work of different 
ages. Several of the towers communicating with the sea gave it 
great advantages over inland forts. Being conferred on Cospa-

trick, it was the principal baronial residence of his descendants, and 
afforded the means of enabhng these warlike lords to maintain power 
and authority, little less than royal, through a long succession of 
rude and turbulent ages. In 1296, the eighth Earl of that family, 
adhering to the English interest, his wife Margery Comyn surren- 
dered his Castle of Dunbar to the Scots, when Edward I. sent Earl 
Warrene to press the siege of this important place, which led to 
the battle of Dunbar. Edward II. after his defeat at Bannock- 
burn in 1314, sought refuge in this castle, and went from thence 
by sea to Berwick. The ninth Earl razed his castle of Dunbar, 
that it might not fall into the hands of the English, and was oblig- 
ed by Edward III. to rebuild it at his own expense. It was often 
besieged, and as often bravely defended ; but perhaps the most bril- 
liant period of its history was about 1337, when it was defended 
by Black Agnes against the Earl of Salisbury. In 1434, George 
the eleventh and last Earl of Dunbar and March, was for his fa- 
ther's treason disinherited of his estates and seignories, which, with 
the hereditary castle of Dunbar, passed to the Crown, and were 
given to the Duke of Albany. 

Jane Seymour, dowager of James I. the most beautiful and ac- 
complished woman of her age, died in the Castle of Dunbar in 1446, 
and was buried at Perth. The Duke of Albany, on his flight from 
Edinburgh Castle in 1475, landed at his Castle of Dunbar, and pro- 
ceeded thence to France. He returned and regained possession of this 
castle, and was compelled to fly from it a second time in 1483, when 
he left it in the hands of the English, who surrendered it to James 
III. in 1486. An act of Parliament passed in 1488 directs the 
Castle of Dunbar to be cast down and utterly destroyed, in such 
manner as to render it incapable of repairs in time to come, " be- 
cause it has done great skaith in time bygone, and it were great 
danger to the realm if it were negligently keeped in future." This 
act was not carried into effect till nearly a century afterwards. 

Four times did this stronghold receive within its walls the un- 
fortunate Queen Mary. In 1565, after the assassination of Rizzio, 
she fled to it that she might be safe from the conspirators ; and in 
the same year Bothwell, who had assisted her escape, was appoint- 
ed its keeper. The Queen and her court on a tour along the Tweed 
by Berwick arrived at this castle on the 17th November 1566, and 
remained- there six days. After the murder of Darnley in 1567, 
Bothwell's guilty associates having recommended him to Mary for 
a husband, he marched at the head of a thousand horsemen, ar- 



DUNBAR.

rested the Queen at Almond Bridge, and carried her forcibly with 
her principal attendants to this castle, where he kept her twelve days 
imprisoned. One short month after her union with Bothwell, Mary 
was compelled to fly first to Borthwick, and next, disguised as a 
page, to Dunbar Castle, where she collected forces from Lothian 
and the Merse, and marched to Carberry hill ; there she joined the 
insuro-ents, and Bothwell deserted returned to Dunbar Castle 

" With shaine and sorrow filled, 
Shame for his folly ; sorrow out of time 
For plotting an unprofitable crime." 

Bothwell's dependents shortly thereafter surrendered the castle to 
the Earl of Murray, Regent of Scotland ; and in 1567 Parliament 
ordered it to be demolished, and the artillery carried to Edinburgh, 
which was so literally executed some months thereafter, that no- 
thing now remains of this important place of strength but the ves- 
tiges of its former grandeur. These are in many parts now so 
completely effaced that the antiquary may here give full scope to 
his imagination, and delight himself with rebuilding this ancient 
castle m the air. 

Patrick the sixth Earl of Dunbar, in 1218, founded in this pa- 
rish a monastery of Red or Trinity friars ; part of the building is 
still standing in the Friars Croft. The lands which piety or zeal 
had given them, says Spottiswood, were transferred after the Re- 
formation to George Home of Friarsland. 

In 1263, the seventh Earl founded here a monastery of Carme- 
lites or White friars ; but no vestiges of it now remain. Some Ro- 
man medals inscribed Judea captiva were found, on digging the site 
of the reservoir : hence it was supposed to have been formerly the 
site of the Carmelite friary. There was also a Maison Dieu at 
the head of the High Street ; but its pious founder is now unknown. 

In Broxmouth Park, there is a small mound of earth where Crom- 
well stood and which is still called Cromwell's Mount, when, look- 
ing through a glass, he beheld Leslie's army descending from the 
hill, and exclaimed the " Lord hath delivered them into my hands." 

In a sequestered spot, not far from the door of Broxmouth House, 
is a rough tombstone, having the name of Sir William Douglas 
rudely inscribed upon it ; he was one of the Douglasses of Kirkness, 
a branch of the Morton family, and the only individual among the 
fallen in that battle who has been honoured even with such a frail 
memorial to mark the warrior's bed. 

Modern Buildings. — There is a Gothic church, having its base 
65 feet above the level of the sea, with a magnificent tower 107 feet 
6 inches high, — forming a well known land-mark to the mariner. It

was designed by Mr Gillespie Graham ; and for accommodation, 
comfort, and chaste elegance, it is not surpassed. The burgh, by 
agreement, contributed one-fifth of the expense, and the heritors 
the remainder, according to their respective valuations. The church 
will long remain a proud monument of their liberality and attach- 
ment to the established rt igion of the land. There are also new 
Burgh schools. The Assembly Rooms built by subscription are 
erected in a bad situation. Dunbar House, where the Earl of Lauder- 
dale generally resides, is situated within the Old Castle park, and has 
a very handsome front to the sea. Had it been placed near to the 
ruins of the castle, it would have had the most picturesque situation 
in the kinofdom. Broxmouth Park is a modern mansion, sheltered 
from every wind, surrounded with hills and dales, woods, and waters, 
and every thing to render it a most desirable retreat. Lochend 
House is an elegant mansion in the Anglo- Gothic style, and is 
much admired for the chasteness of the building, and its commo- 
dious arrangements within. Belton House stands in a beautiful 
winding glen, embosomed among stately trees, and is finely shel- 
tered, with its native stream gliding by. Heatherwick House 
stands on a gentle eminence, which is well wooded, and commands 
views of the surrounding plain, the town of Dunbar, Belhaven bay, 
and the extensive grounds of Tynninghame. 

HI. — Population. 
The ancient state of the population of the parish is involved in 
the same obscurity as the early history of the country. The Cel- 
tic British, according to Chalmers, are the first names on the map 
of Lothian ; the Saxon, the second; the Gaelic, the third; and the 
English, the fourth, — corresponding to the several successions of 
the colonizing people. It is probable that Dunbar, from its ad- 
vantages, was one of the first selected settlements, and, from its 
name, that it was peopled by the first of these tribes. While the Earls 
of Dunbar were the sole proprietors of the parish, the population 
would consist of their retainers and followers ; and as the castle 
rendered it the theatre of perpetual strife, the inhabitants must 
have experienced greater changes than any other part of the Lo- 
thian territory. While different people contended for the soil, lit- 
tle attention was paid to cultivation, and the country was not po- 
pulous. 

In 1755, by rr Webster's account, the population amounted to 3281

The census of 1831 does not include the seafaring persons be- 
longing to the parish; and there were then in it 2174 males, and 
2561 females. The great increase in. 1821 was occasioned by an 
attempt to estabhsh a cotton factory at Belhaven, which introdu- 
ced about 500 persons, chiefly from Ireland ; and by an influx of 
discharged soldiers and sailors. The decrease in 1831 was occa- 
sioned by the failure of the factory. 

In a census taken by the minister in 1834, the population was . 4536

The yearly average for the last seven years of marriages is 31

It should be noticed, however, that many parents do not register 
the births of their children; and that the period which the average 
embraces includes two years when the mortality was unusually 
great. There are 1109 families in the parish, and the average 
number of persons in each family is 4\. 

There are 30 proprietors of land in the parish of the yearly 
value of L. 50 and upwards. 

Character of the People. — They are quiet, peaceable, and indus- 
trious, remarkably civil and obliging in their disposition, generally 
well-educated, and have less peculiarity in their dialect than is to be 
found in most other districts. They are at all times well dressed, 
and their houses are clean and comfortable. The inhabitants of 
the town have an abundant and cheap supply offish ; and the hinds 
command milk and meal, pork and potatoes. The latter class 
being paid in kind have but one interest with the farmer and land- 
lord ; and they have borne the present depression without a mur- 
mur. When the Reform Bill agitated the country, their voice was 
unheard. Both the burgh and landward inhabitants are loyal and 
well affected to church and state, and are regular in their attendance 
on public worship. They enjoy in a great degree the comforts 
and advantages of society, and are perfectly satisfied with their con- 
dition and circumstances. The heritors most cheerfully concur in 
every measure beneficial to the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— The parish is all arable, and contains 7197 acres. 
There is no evidence that Dunbar was ever wooded. 

It is known that agriculture flourished in this district during 
the twelfth and thirteen centuries. Kings, nobles, and churchmen, 
then amused themselves with rural pursuits; but the monks were 
the most skilful cultivators. The Union in 1706 was the grand 

HADDINGTON. 



82 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



era of agricultural improvement to Scotland, in which East Lo- 
thian had the honour to lead the way ; and nowhere is cultivation 
better understood and more perfectly executed than in this parish. 
The soil and climate are excellent ; limestone and sea-ware, two 
powerful agents in the hands of the tillers of the ground, are here 
in superabundance ; and there is a ready market for all kinds of 
produce. The farmers are respectable, skilful, and enterprising, and 
spare neither pains nor expense in availing themselves of their 
great natural advantages ; and their labours are annually crowned 
with an abundant crop of the " finest of the wheat." The lands of 
East Barns, belonging to Robert Hay, Esq. produce an average of 
14 bolls of wheat per acre, for a succession of years. 

Rent of land, Sc. — The valued rent of the parish is L. 16,953 
Scots; the real rent in 1792 was L. 8000 Sterling; in 1823, 
L. 23,405. Annual revenue of the burgh in 1792 was L. 500 ; 
in 1834, L. 1362. 

The highest rent, in the best times, was L. 8, and the average 
from L. 5 to L. 6, per Scots acre. When prices fell, these rents 
were generally converted into grain on the principle of a boll of 
wheat for every L. 1, 18s. of rent; but were still payable in money, 
at the rate of the fiars. The highest rent at present is L. 5, 5s. 
per Scots acre; near to the town, L. 6 per imperial acre. The 
average rent at present is L. 3, 10s. per Scots acre. 

Kate of Wages. — The annual wages of a hind are, 66 bushels of 
oats, 18 bushels of barley, 8 bushels of beans, 4 bolls, or 48 
cwt. of coals, L. 2 Sterling, a cow's grass and winter keep, 1500 
yards of land along a drill for potatoes, 1 bushel of wheat for stack- 
ing and sowing, one month's meat in harvest, with a house and 
garden ; for which he must furnish a shearer twenty days. The 
wages of a female servant are L. 3 the winter term, and L. 3, 10s. 
the summer; a worker, lOd. per day, summer and winter; a la- 
bourer, 9s. per week ; a carpenter, 2s. 6d. per day ; a mason, 2s. 9d. 
per day. Smith and carpenter work is all done by contract. A 
double horse cart fully mounted with narrow wheels costs L. 12 ; 
do. with broad wheels, L. 14 ; an iron plough fully mounted, L. 4; 
a pair of iron harrows fully mounted, L. 3, 15s. and upwards, accord- 
ing to weight ; upholding a pair of horses with cart, plough, and 
harrows by the smith and carpenter for a year, L. 6, 15s. Lime 
costs Is. 6d. per boll imperial measure. 

Cattle. Corn being the staple produce here, very little stock of 

any kind is bred. On a farm of 500 acres, perhaps but one cow is 
kept by the farmer. The soil is rich. Breeding, it is said, will not pay. 



DUNBAR. 



83 



The soundness of this opinion may at any time be questioned, but 
particularly at present, when the price of grain is so low. Great 
numbers, both of cattle and sheep of all kinds, are brought here to 
be fed ; and as the green crops partake of the richness af the grain, 
it is perhaps the best feeding district in the kingdom. Cattle must 
be well fed, indeed, if a Dunbar farmer cannot improve them. Not- 
withstanding the high character of the short horns, judicious farmers 
assert, as the resultof theirexperience,thatthewest Highland cattle, 
which either are, or retain the character of, the primitive breed, have 
the greatest aptitude to fatten and yield the largest-return. One thing 
is certain, that when full fed their beef is most prized by the epicure. 

Hushanclrij.—The soil being dry, it is easily pulverized, and 
cleared of rooted weeds; therefore, there is comparatively but 
little fallow. The rotation of crops is, 1. Turnips upon two or 
more ploughings dunged, and generally fed off ; when carried off, 
a compost of lime and earth is generally applied. 2. Wheat, with 
clover and rye-grass seeds. 3. Grass, fed off with cattle or sheep. 
4. Potato oats. 5. Beans drilled and dunged. 6. Wheat. Instead 
of oats, wheat is sometimes taken, and then the rotation is confined 
to four crops. This course, peculiar to the parish, has been called 
the Dunbar system; but objections have been made to it. Wheat, 
every second year, it is said, exhausts the soil ; the answer is, that 
the food of plants in the soil may be exhausted by any kind of crop, 
while the soil itself cannot be exhausted. Where there is a com- 
mand of manure, there is no system which will so richly repay the 
labours of the husbandman. It was adopted here, on one of the 
best farms, for many years, without any diminution either of quan- 
tity or quality; and in order to ascertain whether soil is injured by 
frequent crops of wheat — the glebe of Dunbar was properly dres- 
sed either with sea-ware, street-dung, or soot, and cropped with 
wheat, for five successive years. The result was, an extra crop every 
year, and the land left in such a condition that it may produce a 
crop or two of any kind without additional manure. The least crop 
in the succession was, on the third year, 10 bolls per acre ; it pro- 
mised to be the greatest, but it was lodged flat, as the surface soon 
after it came into ear. All the other crops in the succession were 
above 12 bolls per acre. One season, exactly suited to the soil, 
there were 16 bolls per acre; and the last of the five years, crop 
1834, there were 14 bolls per acre. It was ascertained, that, on 
each of three of these years, there were more than 300 stones of 
straw per acre. The soil is a sandy loam. There is another field 
in the parish which has produced oats four successive years with 



84 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



increasing produce and fertility. Hence it seems to follow that 
land properly cultivated and manured may produce abundantly the 
same kind of crop in regular succession. If the food of plants is 
exhausted in exact proportion to the weight of crop produced, it is 
worthy of investigation whether the advantage of changing the kind 
of crop does not arise from one kind giving off" food for another 
kind, but solely from the different modes of cultivation which diffe- 
rent kinds of crop admit of at different seasons. 

Varieties of wheat have been recommended; but where the 
soil and climate are good, the kind most prized, both by the skil- 
ful miller and baker, is the white wheat from Kent and Essex. 
Some of the best growers there import seed from America; the 
produce of which has been tried here. It grows freely, has a 
tapering stalk, yields well, has plenty of straw, is eight days ear- 
lier, and brings the highest price in the London market. The 
grain of wheat in its wild state is a very paltry seed. It has been 
raised to its present plump state by cultivation ; and by a little at- 
tention the process of improvement might be accelerated. The 
author has found, from experiments, that ears and even grains of 
wheat reproduced their like; hence, by a judicious selection of 
either, better and more prolific kinds than any hitherto in use might 
be obtained. 

The duration of leases is generally nineteen years. Farm-build- 
ings have here long been constructed after the most approved plans. 
The land is all inclosed either with stone dikes or thorn hedges ; 
the latter are regularly cleaned and neatly kept. 

Thrashing of corn by steam is the greatest improvement which 
has lately been introduced here. The work is thereby done so com- 
pletely, that, on a large farm, the whole outlay is saved the first 
year : the farmer is enabled to bring his corn to the market at any 
season ; and there is a great saving of horses, to which the rotatory 
motion of the mill is most pernicious. Pillars, whereon to build 
the corn in the barn yard, should have been more generally intro- 
duced. Some individuals have them of stone, but cast-iron ones are 
the best. They have a cover with a turned down edge, — which ren- 
ders them a complete defence against vermin. They admit a free 
circulation of air to the stacks, and the saving is beyond calculation. 

If there be any thing to censure in this improved district, it is the 
careless manner in which the corn is cut. Some seasons, in such 
a soil and climate, the whole crop is ripe at once. The country is 
then deluged with Irish reapers, who on their way south are here 
hired by hundreds, and perhaps the whole crop is cut in eight

85 



days. Some of these poor creatures appear never to have cut corn 
before, and they have no object but to remain their hours and to re- 
ceive their meat and wages. The field is too often a scene of con- 
fusion ; there is neither a sufficient portion of work done, nor is it 
done in a workman-hke manner. The corn being irregularly cut 
and laid in the sheaf, much of it is lost in working, and the irregu- 
lar heads escape the mill in thrashing. Perhaps it is thought, that 
where nature has been bountiful, the fowls of Heaven and the poor 
have a right to their share ; but it is certain, that when the corn is 
led from the field, a gleaner will with ease collect a bushel per day. 
It is true, some farmers rake their fields ; but grain which remains 
on the ground is discoloured and injured; and the best raking is 
clean-cutting. There are distinguished exceptions in the parish ; 
but the practice is too generally applicable to the district. It may 
safely be affirmed of the Dunbar farmers that they readily make trial 
of any thing that promises to be useful ; that there is amongst them 
a great deal of good-natured emulation ; and that they frankly com- 
municate the results of their experiments. In short, so much has 
been done here, both by nature and by art, to render the earth pro- 
ductive, that perhaps there remains but little to carry husbandry to 
perfection. 

Qiiarries. — Red freestone more or less compact abounds. There 
are also two quarries of gray limestone. The lime is very pure, very 
white, and forms a strong cement. Much lime for manure is carried 
from this quarter to Berwickshire. It is to be regretted that in this 
parish, where it abounds, it has nof been so copiously applied for 
that purpose as it ought, — from a belief that the free nature of the 
soil does not require it ; whereas Sir Humphry Davy asserts, that 
" all soils are improved by mild lime, and ultimately by quicklime, 
which do not effervesce with acids and sands more than clays." 

Fisheries. — White fish of all kinds and lobsters are caught off 
the coast. The cod are pickled, and sent to London ; the had- 
docks are smoked and sent chiefly to Edinburgh and Glasgow. 
The lobsters are preserved in pits cut out of the rock within sea 
mark, which are called bullies, and sent to London. In August 
and September, herrings of excellent quality are caught off Dun- 
bar : some years, 300 boats have been so employed ; but of late, 
either the fish have not been upon the coast, or, what is more pro- 
bable, the fishermen have not found them. 

Rav Produce. — Wheat having fallen in price so much of late, 
a considerable portion of barley is now sown after turnips, in place 
of wheat, in the rotation above stated; but supposing these two kinds 



IlADDlN]TONSIIlUK 



of crops to be equal in value, that will make no diiierence on the 
average gross amount of raw produce, — which, from the extent of 
land in the parish, and the rotation of cropping, may be calculated 
thus: Deduct from the whole parish 100 acres for roads and hedges, 
and 300 acres of linhs, which are not allowed to be ploughed, and 
then there will remain 6797 acres, which are either occupied as 
follows, or with some other produce equally valuable.

The average of the grain is taken from the examination of Mr 
Brodie of Thornton Loch, before a committee of the House of 
Lords in 1814; and the price is the average of the Haddington 
fiars for the last seven years. Bone manure having enabled the 
hill farmer to raise turnips, their price has fallen in the low lands. 

Manufactures. — The expectations formed of the flax mill erect- 
ed at West Barns in 1792 were not realized; and the cotton factory 
established at Belhaven in 1815 was also a failure. Both of these 
undertakings were productive of loss to the parties concerned, and 
introduced many paupers into the parish. Such factories can only 
exist advantageously where numbers of persons in manufacturing 
employments are congregated together, and such a population and 
that of a rich agricultural district have never been found to harmo- 
nize. — There are two founderies here, which manufacture machi- 
nery of various kinds. Mr Sked, the proprietor of one of them, is 
celebrated for his steam-engines. — Dunbar was of old famous for 
its malt. It is equally so at present for its ale. 

Navigation. — The same causes which have depressed shipping 
everywhere else, have affected that of Dunbar, — so that now it is 
not equal there to what it was in 1792, when there were sixteen 
vessels of 1505 tons burthen in all, besides two Greenland ships 
of 675 tons. At present there are eighteen small vessels, of only 
1233 tons burthen in all, three of which are chiefly employed in fo- 
reign, and the others in the coast trade. The subjoined state- 
ments may give an idea of the trade of the port.

bushels; malt, 359 bushels; wheat flour, 231 sacks. Whisky ex- 
ported, 91,900 gallons. 

Three distilleries, one of them in the parish, and the other two 
in Haddington, have done no work for the last two years. This must 
have greatly affected the grain market, and also the trade of the 
port. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion.—Ynx\\diV is inhabited chiefly by the merchants, 
shopkeepers, and artisans required in such a situation; and it is the 
only market-town in the district. It had formerly a sample mar- 
ket for grain every Thursday, which in 1832 was converted into a 
stock-market every Tuesday. 

Grain is brought to it from the surrounding country, but prin- 
cipally from the high-lands of Berwickshire, in the proportion, 
some days through the eastern toll, of ninety cart load from that 
quarter, to nine from the county of Haddington. The love of 
change led to the establishment lately of a stock-market at Tra- 
nent. This divided the Haddington market, which was decidedly 
the most important grain-market in Scotland ; lessened competi- 
tion, introduced inferior grain, and reduced the prices. The sel- 
lers are now at the mercy of the buyer; whatever portion of grain is 
presented, the result is the same. If there are no merchants, then. 



88 



HADDINGTONSIIIKE. 



there are no sales; and if only two or three appear, it is in their 
power to regulate the market. 

Villages.— T\\QYc are three villages, namely, East- Barns, West- 
Barns, and Belhaven. 

Means of Communication. — Seven miles, six furlongs, and ninety 
yards of the great road to London, pass through the parish ; and 
there are excellent conveyances, both east and west. There is a post- 
office in the town, where the royal mail arrives every day at forty-five 
minutes past ten o'clock in the forenoon from the north, and at 
twenty minutes past eleven o'clock forenoon from the south. Steele's 
coach, which is both speedy and comfortable, leaves Dunbar for 
Edinburgh every week-day at seven o'clock in the morning, and re- 
turns to it on the same day at the same hour in the evening. The 
Union and Berwick coaches pass and repass every week-day. 
There are carriers twice every week, and regular packets to Leith 
and London. 

Harbour. — The harbour is safe and commodious, has 9 feet 
of water at neap, and 14 at spring tides, and admits vessels of 
300 tons burthen ; but on account of rugged rocks at its entrance, 
skilful pilotage is required. The convention of Royal burghs in 
1785, voted L. 600 to improve it ; and Cromwell in his time grant- 
ed L. 300 to repair the east pier, which had been destroyed by a 
storm. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The worthy St Baldred, it is said, was the 
apostle of East Lothian. He fixed his cell at Tynninghame, and 
preached the Gospel through the district, sometime duringthe sixth 
century; and his successor was the pious St Cuthbert; but the sub- 
ject is involved in obscurity. The parish belonged originally to 
the bishopric of Lindisfarne ; and at the decHne of the Northum- 
brian kingdom, it was ceded in 1020, with the rest of Lothian to 
the Scottish King, and annexed to the bishopric of St Andrews. 
In addition to the present parish, it then contained the parochial 
districts of Whittingham, Stenton, and Spott, which were chapelries 
subordinate to the mother church. This very extensive parish 
had six chapels, namely, Pinkterton, Heatherwick, Whittingham, 
Penshiel, Stenton, and Spott. Dunbar with its chapel of Whit- 
tingham was valued in 1176 at 180 merks, which, says Chalmers, 
" is a greater valuation than any other church in Scotland could 
bear." The Earls of Dunbar were proprietors of the whole pa- 
rish, and patrons of the church and subordinate chapels. Patrick 
the tenth Earl, in 1342, converted this parochial into a collegiate 
church, which was the first establishment of the kind in Scotland.

It consisted of a Dean, an Arclipriest, and eighteen Canons ; and 
the revenues of the church of Dunbar, with the incomes of the 
chapels of Whittingham, Spott, Stenton, Penshiel, and Heather- 
.vick, were assigned for their support. The founder annexed to 
this coUeo-e the churches of Linton or Prestonkirk, Dunse, and 
Chirnside''; and he reserved the patronage of the whole to himself 
and his successors. Afterwards, the chapels were converted mto 
parish churches, but still dependent on the mother church as 
prebends of the college. When Heatherwick was made a distmct 
parish, it was a rectory called Belton, which was the name of the 
estate' and also of two villages. It remained a separate parish 
until the Reformation in 1560, when it was re-annexed to Dunbar, 
and then also Dunbar ceased to be collegiate. The patronage • 
of the church fell to the Crown with the forfeiture of the Earldom 
of Dunbar in 1434. The said earldom and patronage were enjoyed 
by the Duke of Albany, and at his forfeiture they again fell to the 
Crown, in 1483. The patronage of the church of Dunbar now 
belongs to the Dukedom of Roxburghe, and it is liferented by 
Mary Duchess Dowager of Roxburghe. 

It appears that the church was named St Bae's, after its founder, 
according to a traditionary rhyme regarding three female saints, who 
strove to build a church nearest to the sea. 

We find that in a charter by King James IV. it is called Ecclesia 
Collegiata Sancti Bae de Dunbar. The building must have been 
repeatedly renewed and altered. When last taken down, its style 
was a mixture of Gothic and Saxon ; and it was in the form of a 
cross. It was inconvenient, and not large enough for the popu- 
lation. The last time Divine service was performed in it was 
on Sunday, 7th March 1819. The foundation stone of a new 
church was laid on the site of the old one, 17th April 1819 ; and 
on the 20th April 1821, the new church was opened for the ordina- 
tion of the present incumbent. It is most conveniently situated 
for the whole parish. Almost the whole inhabitants are within 
three miles of it, and scarcely any of them beyond four. It contains 
1800 persons, and has 61 free sittings for the poor of the parish.f 
The manse was built in 1767. The glebe is four Scotch acres 
in extent; and there is no grass glebe. The stipend is twenty

f In 1822, a new method of h-tting church seats was adopted on the part of the 
burgh. A price was marked upon certain pews belonging to it, and the Provost nail- 
ed them up, that none might enter till they were let. The kirk-scssiou complauied

chalders. There are upwards of 1200 communicants in the parish 
. belonging to the Estabhshed Ch urch. 

In 1792, there was a Burgher meeting in Dunbar, and an Anti- 
burgher meeting at East- Barns. The latter was in 1820 transferred 
to Dunbar. One of them is now called the High Meeting, and the 
other the Low Meeting; and they both belong to the united Asso- 
ciate Synod. There was then also a small meeting of Wesleyan 
Methodists ; and what was said in the last Account respectino- these 
societies, is applicable to them still, " their congregations are made 
up of a collection of people from all the parishes in the neigh- 
bourhood." 

There are 815 families that adhere to the Established Church, 
and 294 famihes of Dissenters or Seceders of various denominations. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools, — the one at West- 
Barns having all tbe legal accommodations, with the maximum sa - 
lary, and the other, at East- Barns, having only one-half chalder, and 
the interest of L. 100 Sterling, bequeathed by William Hume, 
tenant at that place, and of L. 50 Sterling bequeathed by the 
Reverend George Bruce ; and both these sums are committed in 
trust to the Presbytery of Dunbar, for the benefit of the school. 
The burgh has an English and a grammar school, united at pre- 
sent under one master, and a mathematical school. The teacher 
of the former has a house and forty guineas of salary ; that of the 
latter a house and L. 20 Sterling. There are three unendowed 
schools. 

The rural inhabitants of the parish are very attentive to the edu- 
cation of their children. Education is also highly prized by the 
people of the burgh ; and if among the latter there are individuals 
who are inattentive to the instruction of their children, they should 
on no account be discharged from the task by their children being 

to the ShcrilF of this proceeding, who immediately ordered the pews to be opened, 
and having heard parties, found, " That although the heritors of the parish may 
be entitled to stipulate for, and receive rents from the parishioners for the seats in the 
parish church, yet, in default of obtaining tenants, they are not warranted in shutting 
them up in the manner here complained of, and therefore prohibits and interdicts the 
respondent, the chief Magistrate of Dunbar, from shutting up, in the manner com- 
plained of, the seats held by that burgh in the parish church, and finds him liable in 
the expense of this proceeding, reserving to him his relief against the magistrates and 
the community of said burgh, as accords." The Provost presented a petition against 
this interlocutor, alleging that the shutting up of the seats was the act of the magis- 
trates, and not his individually. The kirk-session answered, that they had no means 
of ascertaining by what authority he acted, but what they affirmed they offered to 
prove. The Sheriff then ordered the magistrates and council to be called, conjoined 
the two processes, interdicted them from shutting up the scats, found them liable in 
the expense, and reserved to them recourse against each other. Tiie magistrates next 
presented a bill of advocation to the Court of Session, which was repelled, and the case 
remitted simplicltcr to the SherifT. The magistrates acquiesced, and paid the whole 
expense of procedure.

educated at a free school, which corrupts the parent and degrades 
the child. They ought rather to be stirred up to a sense of then- 
duty, and prompted to place themselves and their children on an 
equality with their neighbours. The heritors and lurk-session pro- 
vide for the education of all orphan children. 

izWy.— There is a Subscription Library, contammg many 
hundred volumes ; and a reading-room. The mechanics also have 
a library of several hundred volumes. 

Bajiks.— In the town there is a branch of the British Lmen 
Company, and also one of the Commercial Bank of Scotland. 

Friendhj Societies.— U&amp;ny of these have, from time to time, ex- 
isted in Dunbar; but, being established on erroneous principles, 
most of .them were of short duration. The only one which has 
weathered the storm is the Sailors Society. It was established, 
beyond the memory of man, for the benefit of superannuated seamen 
and their widows. Its funds were originally derived from a duty 
of eight pennies on the pound Scots out of all wages paid to 
masters, mates, and sailors frequenting the port. This society 
must have been well managed, for now it has both lands and money. 

Poor and Parochial Fioids.—The management of the poor is 
committed to the kirk-session, who regularly account to the heri- 
tors. The number of the poor and their allowances are perpetual- 
ly changing. While, in other places, poor rates have increased, — 
here, by a stedfast adherence to the spirit of poor laws, they haVe 
been greatly diminished. The annual expenditure is at present 
about L.450 Sterling,— which sum is raised, 1. by the interest of 
Binning's mortmain of L. 75 Sterling, paid by the burgh ; 2. by 
incidents at marriages and funerals ; 3. by collections at the church 
door ; 4. by a regular assessment. 

A committee of three heritors and three magistrates, with the 
assistance of the kirk-session, appointed to investigate the subject, 
lately ascertained that the total number of paupers in the burgh, 
and the landward parts of the parish, was 103. Of these, 86 have a 
settlement in the burgh ; in the landward district, 17. It was fur- 
ther ascertained that, of these 103 paupers, 50 were born and 
brought up in the burgh; in the landward district, 10; emigrated 
from other parishes, 43. 

In 1724, it was agreed between the heritors and the town, that 
for the year ensuing allendrhj, the town should pay one-sixth of the 
money raised in the parish for the maintenance of the poor, — but 
with a special clause, that this should not become a precedent 
for the future. The other five-sixths were paid by the heri- 



92

tors and tenants of the landward district. This agreement was not 
renewed,— but different rules were adopted till the year 1774, for 
which and the subsequent years, the town of Dunbar has paid only 
one-sixth of the assessment. The attention of the heritors was at 
length directed to the subject by certain extraordinary claims which 
were made on the part of the burgh. The chief magistrate claim- 
ed a right ex officio to give orders upon the funds; and if two or 
more bailies attended the meetings, each claimed a right to vote. 

The heritors being thus called upon to look to their interest, 
were advised to institute an action of declarator, to have it found 
" that the management and maintenance of the poor of the land- 
ward district and of the burgh are separate and distinct, and that 
the pursuers, as heritors of the landward district, with their tenants 
and other inhabitants thereof, are not liable for the support of the 
poor of the burgh, but for that of the poor resident within the 
landward district allenarly, and the provost, magistrates, and coun- 
cil, as representing the community of the said burgh of Dunbar, 
ought and should be decerned and ordained, by decree foresaid, to 
sustain and manage the poor of the said burgh according to law : 
Or otherwise, in the event of the pursuers failing in the above con- 
clusion of their action, then and in that case it ought and should 
be found and declared, by decree foresaid, that the power of taking 
up the lists of the aggregate poor, determining the assessments, and 
managing the funds, belongs to the meeting of heritors, provost, 
minister, and elders, and that the assessment to be imposed for 
the support of the aggregate poor shall be laid on the whole in- 
habitants of the parish equally, whether in burgh or landward, ac- 
cording to the estimation of their substance, without exception of 
persons." The action came before their Lordships of the Second 
Division, who ordered the opinions of the other Judges to be taken 
thereon. Three of the Consulted Judges having returned opinions 
for a separation, and six of them against it, their Lordships of the

Sir, — I gave an order upon you yesterday, to pay a woman twenty shillings to ac- 
count of the maintenance of three poor children she has had the charge of, belonging 
to the parish, and which order 1 understand you have refused to pay, nor will you as- 
sign your reason in writing for your refusal, but have Jtint me a message that you 
have not time to write. I now again demand of you either to pay the order, or to 
state your reason why you withhold the money, as I consider a refusal a dereliction 
of your duty as clerk of the poors' funds, and 1 shall hold you personally resjionsiblc, 
and shall accordingly take the necessary steps to oblige you to account for yoin- con- 
duct; and in the meantime the town of Dunbar will withhold their share of the 
money they have been in the practice of paying towards the itinerant poors' allow- 
ance, as well as the cess allocated upon the town at the last meeting of heritors. — I 
am, Sir, your most obedient servant. 



DUNBAR.

Second Division, four in number, on 10th April 1833, resumed con- 
sideration of the case, with the returned opinions, and, unanimous- 
ly concurring with the minority of the Consulted Judges, decerned 
in terms of the first conclusion. 

The burgh appealed; Lord Brougham having offered, when 
he had ceased to be Chancellor, to hear Scotch cases, heard this 
one: and on his motion, the House of Lords, 10th April 1835, 
« Ordered and adjudged, that the interlocutor complained of in the 
said appeal be, and the same is hereby, reversed, and it is further 
ordered, that the cause be remitted back to the Second Division 
of the Court of Session, in order that the said Court may proceed 
further in the said cause, as shall be just and consistent with this 
judgment." 

The kirk-session were called as parties in this action, but did 
not appear. They are most anxious, however, for an equitable set- 
tlement of the question, and the minister hris never concealed his 
opinion, that the separation contended for would eventually benefit 
both parties. Since it has thus been found that there can only be 
one roll of poor in a parish, if it shall be further found that there 
must also be only one management and one assessment laid on the 
whole inhabitants according to the estimation of their substance, 
this judgment may prove most vexatious even to the burghs. It 
directly or indirectly affects every parish in Scotland. It leaves the 
burghs which have landward districts without a law ; it introduces 
confusion into the whole system, and, there is reason to believe, 
that it is neither supported by the facts of the case nor by the acts 
of Parliament. 

The case is one of very great importance : and those who take 
an interest in it may consult the process. Lanark is about to try 
the same question. 

Jaz7.— The jail is in a very bad condition, and has been legally 
condemned ; but fortunately it is seldom occupied. Two town-offi- 
cers and two Sheriff-officers are all the police required in this peace- 
ful district. 

Fairs. — There are two fairs in the year, where all the usual wares 
and cattle are exposed : — one of them at Whitsunday, and the 
other at Martinmas, old style, if these days shall fall on a Tuesday ; 
if not, on the first Tuesday thereafter. 

Fuel. — Coal is the only fuel used, which is imported from Wemyss, 
Charleston, Borrowstounness, and Sunderland. Scotch coal costs 
from 7s. to 9s. per boll of 12 cv. English coal from 10s. to 12s. 
according to quality. 



94 



IIADDINGTONSIIIRK. 



Inns. — There are two inns in Dunb.u-, witli excellent accommo- 
dation, and there are fifty-four persons residing within the parish 
licensed to sell beer and spirits, — a number by far too great. This is 
a sore evil, which has long been complained of, and it appears to be 
increasing. - " There are," says the judicious writer of the last ac- 
count, " no fewer than forty-six licensed alehouses where low-priced 
spirits are retailed, and where the execrable custom of dram-drink- 
ing is practised. This we may justly pronounce to be the bane of 
all good and the source of all evil, — the ruin of health and morals, — 
and of all domestic duty and comfort, — the reproach of man, and the 
disgrace of woman." 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

This parish is but of small extent, but it yields a large rental. 
An improved system of agriculture having been early introduced, its 
external surface has been but little changed since the last account ; 
but by a copious application of manure, and by excellent cultivation, 
the soil has been rendered mmch more productive. The education 
— the habits and comforts of the people — the revenue of the burgh, 
and the rental of the parish — have all been greatly improved. 

The plough now in use is not the best that might be devised to 
pulverize the soil, especially strong clays, so as to render them most 
productive. One with more coulters — to cut the furrows into small 
pieces, would permit the roots of plants to spread more freely — 
render the soil more capacious of moisture, and more susceptible 
of heat. 

The nearer that field cultivation is brought to that of garden, the 
greater the return ; and an implement to be drawn by a horse to 
Dutch-hoe the stubble, as soon as the crop is carried off, and some- 
time before the land is ploughed, would be the most effectual 
remedy against annual weeds. The trench plough, invented by 
Mr Smith of Deanston, might be introduced here with great ad- 
vantage. 

A railway has been projected from Cairnie, in the parish of In- 
veresk, to the town of Haddington, and port of Dunbar. A plan 
and estimate have been prepared by Robert Stevenson, Esq. civil- 
engineer. 

All the hinds receive the same amount of gain — whatever be 
their merits as servants or workmen. It is worthy of consideration 
whether it would not greatly promote the interest of the farmer, as 
well as ultimately that of the hind, to hold out to the latter, the 
prospect of a higher allowance to such as excel.

ame. Garvald-is said to be compounded of the two Gaelic 

words, Gar, signifying rough or rugged, and vald, a small water 
or burn. This etymology is exactly descriptive of the local situa- 
tion of Garvald ; for the village is situated upon a small water or 
burn, the bed of which abounds in stones. When this water is 
flooded, such is the force and rapidity of the stream, that it sweeps 
along and throws out upon the low grounds stones of great weight 
and size. 

Extent. — The united parishes of Garvald and Bara extend from 
east to west about 8 or 9 miles, and from north to south about 4 
or 5 miles. It is bounded by GifFord, Haddington, and Moreham 
on the west ; by Whittingham on the north and east ; and by 
Lauder on the south. 

Topographical Appearances, Sfc. — The figure of the parish is 
irregular, — it being intersected by several of the adjacent parishes. 
The grounds that lie in the south and north of these parishes ex- 
hibit in their appearance a striking contrast to each other. Those 
on the south are mostly covered with heath, of a mossy soil. The 
range of the Lammermoor hills, which in these parishes extend from 
east to west about 8 or 9 miles, is for the most part covered with 
heath, interspersed with large plots of grass. The grounds that lie in 
the north are of a deep rich clay soil, and produce excellent crops 
of wheat, barley, oats, &amp;c. Those towards the east are of a fine

till about the year 1743 or 1744, when the kirk of Bara fell into disrepair. It is now 
a complete ruin.

lightgravelly soil, exceedingly well adapted for the culture of turnips 
and potatoes; both of which are here raised to a great extent. A 
great part of the soil in these parishes is either of this description, 
or of a deep rich clay. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oioners. — The chief land-owners of the parish are, the 
Marquis of Tweeddale ; Robert Hay, Esq. of Linpburn ; Earl of 
Wemyss ; Miss Hay of Nunraw ; Mr Douglas of Garvald ; and 
Captain Hay of Hopes. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are regularly kept. 
The earliest date of the births and baptisms is 1694. The ses- 
sional records commence in 1721. 

Antiquities. — Adjoining the Lammermoor hills, are situated the 
ruins of Whitecastle, in the eastern boundary of the parish. In 
early times, this fortification was of considerable importance, as it 
guarded a pass from the Merse and from England. — About a mile 
to the north on the farm of Garvald, there is a large fortification 
or encampment, situated on a rising ground ; it is of a circular form, 
and is in circumference about 1500 feet in extent. — A little to the 
westward, on the farm of Carfrae, there was an encampment near- 
ly of the same form and dimensions. Several years ago, the stones 
of the encampment were dug up to enclose the farm. One of the 
workmen, in digging up these stones, found the brass handle of a 
sword, which probably had been concealed there for several cen- 
turies. — About two miles to the west, on the farm of Newlands, 
there are two large tumuli thrown up in the middle of a plain, 
called by the country people the Black castle and Green castle. 
The late Marquis of Tweeddale, many years ago, planted the 
spot on which they stood, with Scotch firs and some gray wood. 
To the west of these tumuli, there are two other encampments, 
— one on the farm of Park, and the other on the estate of Hopes. 

Mansion Houses. — There are only two mansion houses in the 
parish, Nunraw and Hopes. The house of Nunraw, some centu- 
ries ago, was a nunnery belonging to the priory of Haddington, 
and though modernized, still exhibits evident marks of great an- 
tiquity. An elegant house has lately been built at Hopes, by the 
present proprietor, and is pleasantly situated very near the bot- 
tom of a glen, and to the westward of one of the Lammermoor 
hills, on which there is an extensive and flourishing plantation of 
various sorts of trees. This plantation and several others upon 
the estate were raised by the late Charles Hay of Hopes, Esq.

In 1801, the population was - 749

It is remarkable that there has been such an increase of popu- 
lation, while many of the small farms have been united. 

Thefarmof Snowdon, consistingof about 1700 acres, and formerly 
covered with heath, is at present in a high state of cultivation, and 
produces excellent crops. The expense, however, at which it has 
been improved by Mr Bogue has been so great, that it may be 
doubted if he will receive any benefit from his judicious ameliora- 
tions of the soil, or even be reimbursed for his expenditure. His 
landlord, however, must afterwards reap great advantage from these 
improvements. It is on Snowdon where the population of the pa- 
rish has principally increased.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— AgricuUme is the prevailing occupation in these 
parishes,— the farmers who rent the Lammermoor hills renting, at 
the same time, the adjacent low grounds to a considerable extent. 
The lands which lie on the north of these hills are mostly enclos- 
ed, and their agriculture is in a state of very high improvement. 
Lime, brought from the distance of four or five miles, is extensively 
used. Bone and rape manure have been, of late years, also much em- 
ployed for raising turnips. Draining has also been carried on to a 
great extent. Excellent crops of all kinds of grain are raised, 
but the most prevaihng are those of oats and barley. 

Sheep, 8fc. — In winter, the number of sheep pastured in this pa- 
rish is about 7100 ; in summer, about the same at an average. The 
sheep usually preferred for the higher parts of the parish, or hilly 
pastures, are the Cheviot and black-faced. A cross between the 
Leicester and Cheviot is found to answer very well. Salving or 
smearing universally prevails here. About 300 black cattle have 
been annually fed on turnip, and sold to the butcher. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land per acre is 
L. 1 , 14s. on leases of nineteen years. The valued rent of the pa- 
rish is L. 4229, 4s. Scots. 

HADDINGTON. G

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Oats, 760 acres, 3 quarters 2 Ijushels, from J 8s. to 27s. 
Wheat, 350 do. 3i to 4 quarters 36s. to 44s. 
Barley, 450 do. 5 do. 23s. to 3.3s. 
Turnips, COO do. L. 3, to Ij. 0, per acre. 
Sown grass, 760 ditto. 

Al most all the sown grass in the parish is used as pasture. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages. — There were formerly two villages in these parishes, 
Garvald and Bara. The village of Garvald contains 273 inhabit- 
ants. All the houses except two or three are feus at the rate of 
L. 3 per acre, built by masons, wrights, weavers, &amp;c. In the vi- 
cinity of the village there is a freestone quarry of excellent quality. 

Inns. — There are three public-houses in the village of Garvald ; 
besides these, there is an inn at Danskine, on the great road from 
Haddington to Dunse. 

Means of Communication. — No public conveyances pass through 
the parish. Nor is there any post-office. There is a communica- 
tion by carriers from Dunse to Haddington one day in the week. 
The length of the turnpike road in the parish is six miles. The 
bye-roads, kept in good repair by the statute labour money, are 
about sixteen miles in length. The bridges and fences are kept 
in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated at the eastern ex- 
tremity of the parish, and very inconveniently placed for those who 
reside at the west end, — the distance being about six miles. It is 
old but in good repair. An addition was built to it in 1 829. The 
church now affords accommodation for 360 persons. The free sittings 
in the church are for 50 persons. The manse was built in 1820, and 
is in good repair. The glebe consists of 13 acres. The amount 
of stipend is 9 chalders, 4 bushels, and L. 30, 6s. in money. The 
number of communicants at present averages 254. Notwithstand- 
ing the distance of many of the parishioners from the church, it is 
remarkably well attended. 

Education. — There is but one parochial school. The school- 
house was repaired about two years ago, and is now in a very com- 
fortable state. The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum. The 
number of his scholars is from 50 to 60. He is not qualified to teach 
Latin. There is also an unendowed school in the village ; the num- 
ber attending it may be from 40 to 50 : and the fees are the same 



GARVALD AND BARA. 99 

as those taken at the parochial school. He also is unqualified to 
fe.ch Latin. Under fifteen years of age, there are very lew, if any, 
vio cannot read and write. Above fifteen years of age, there may 
be a few who cannot write, but none who cannot read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.-T\e number of poor upon the 
roll in this parish is 17; many of them live in their own houses, 
and generally receive from 12s. to L. 1 per quarter ; some receive 
less " This small allowance is granted only as an help to their in- 
dustrv, not as an encouragement to sloth and idleness. There is 
not one beggar within the limits of these parishes. Occasional sup- 
phes are besides, granted to other families, who by sickness and 
misfortunes are reduced to necessitous circumstances. The mo- 
ney annually expended on the poor of these parishes amounts to

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES MACFARLANE, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
]Jame. — This parish was formed soon after the Reformation 
by the junction of the parishes of Keith and Humbie. In the end 
of the seventeenth century, the parish of Keith was called Keith- 
Symmars ; and that of Humbie, Keith-Hundeley. The origin of 
the name Humbie, which they bear since their annexation, is un- 
known. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish is partly intersected, towards 
the S. W. extremity, by the parish of Fala. But supposing it con- 
tinuous, it is an oblong of 6 miles in length, from north to south, 
and 5 in breadth, — containing 19,200 imperial acres. It is bound- 
ed on the east by the parishes of Bolton and Salton ; on the north 
by Pencaitland ; on the N. W. by Ormiston and Cranston ; on 
the west and south-west by Crichton and Fala; and on the south by 
the range of the Lammermoor-hills. 

Topographical Appearances.— These hills vary in their form, 
soil, and elevation. Some of them are almost entirely covered with 
short heath ; others are green, but interspersed with mossy bogs,— 
some of which have been lately dried by open surface draining, 
to improve the sheep pasture. Lammerlaw, which is the highest 
peak of the whole ridge, may be reckoned 1200 feet above the le- 
vel of the sea. In other parts, the height of the summit above the 
level of the sea is from 800 to 1000 feet. The lower end of the 
parish is 350 feet above the sea level, and the base of the Lammer- 
moors 600, — thus producing an elevation of 250 feet across the 
arable ground of the parish. In the higher parts of the parish the 
air is sharp and cold ; but in the lower, it is more temperate. The 
chmate is peculiarly healthful. In the centre and northern parts 
of the parish, less rain falls than at Edinburgh,— the pluvial clouds

beino- attracted on the one side by the mountainous range of Lam- 
mermoor, and on the other by the Frith of Forth 

Hyclroc,raphy.-i:\eve are three brooks m the parish, each 
having a stone bridge of one arch. All of them issue from the 
hills above named, at a little distance from each other; aiid on 
reaching the valley, they take an easterly course,-when Kei h 
■xnd Humbie streams meet a little below the church : and nearly 
two miles below, they are joined by Birns-water, which from its 
source forms the eastern boundary of the parish. There is abun- 
dance of trout in these rivulets, some of which are of good flavour. 
The rivulets have a quantity and fall of water sufficient for ma- 
chinery. 

Mineralogy.— There seems to be abundance of iron ore m many 
places ; and there are also some appearances of coal, but none has 
yet been wrought,— as the contiguous parishes abound in good coal, 
and also in limestone. The former is got for 9d. the load, the lat- 
ter for Is. 8d. per boll. The soil is very various ; in some places, 
rich and loamy; in some, light and sandy; in others, clayey or 
mossy. Still, however, by skill and industry, it yields in general 
fair crops of turnip and every kind of grain. 

11. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men.— Of the proprietors of Whitburgh, by far the 
most ancient family now resident in the parish, several were dis- 
tinguished for personal strength and courage, as well as for their 
hberality of disposition. Sir Adam Hepburn, a Senator of the Col- 
lege of Justice, early in the seventeenth century, was highly esteem- 
ed for his patriotic spirit and generous beneficence to the parish. 
He built at his own expense the first bridge on Humbie-water, 
which still bears his name, and the date of 1645. He also gave 
in donation to the heritors to serve for a manse, — a house, which 
then stood close to the church, with about three Scotch acres of 
haugh and bank. Hugh Scott of Harden, a gentleman of extensive 
property and baronial hospitality, lately succeeded to the Hep- 
burns of Humbie. 

Land-oioners. — The chief land-owners are, the Earl of Hopetoun; 
Sir Neil Menzies, Bart.; Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden; and Andrew 
Fletcher, Esq. of Saltoun. 

Parochial Registers. — In former times, the parochial registers 
were very ill kept, — some of them having been entirely lost or de- 
stroyed ; they do not reach further back than 100 years.

Mans ion-Houses. — Of modern buildings, the mansion of Mr 
Anderson of Whitburgh is the best. It was built twenty-four 
years ago. Keith-house, one of the seats of the Earl Marshal, 
may be mentioned on account of what it once was, — having been a 
large and elegant building, according to the taste of the times, and 
suited to the splendour of a family then the most opulent and 
powerful in the kingdom. The timber with which it was built was 
a present from the King of Denmark, as a testimony of the high 
opinion which he had formed of the Earl when employed to treat 
concerning the marriage of the Princess Anne of Denmark with 
James VL 

The ruins of a Roman Catholic chapel still remain in front of Keith 
House, with a cemetery attached to it, v/hich is still used by some 
of the parishioners. Mr John Keynart, minister of Duffus, was vicar 
of Keith in the year 1595, when he sold the living, which afforded 
twelve chalders of victual, and three husbands of land, for a mere 
trifle, to the Earl Marshal. All succeeding proprietors have kept 
possession of the lands. 

III. — Population. 
The population of the parish must once have been greater than 
at present, as some vestiges of several small villages may still be 
traced.

The average number of births for the last seven years is 15, of 
deaths 9, of marriages 7. 

There are 10 landed proprietors in the parish; but only two of 
them are at present resident. Their yearly rentals vary from L. 300 
to L. 1500 Sterling respectively. 

There are 7 bachelors and 6 widowers, all upwards of fifty years 
of age ; and both taken together just equal the number of unmar- 
ried women above forty-five.

It is a melancholy fact, that there are 8 insane persons in one 
family, and one in each of two others ; but all of them are harm- 
less and inoffensive. The parents of these individuals are correct 
in their conduct and industrious, though they discover such a degree 
of mental imbecility as might indicate that the malady is hereditary.

IV — Industry. 
Acricultare —About 7000 acres are in a regular course of cul- 
tivation, and nearly 200 more might be cultivated along tlie face, 
and towards the base, of the Lammermoors ; but, owing both to the 
hio-h climate and the difficulty of getting manure, these lands are 
very seldom ploughed; and even when ploughed, it is chfly for 
the sake of renovating the grass. There are in the parish about 
2400 acres of hill and moor land. , t i 

Humbie wood consists of 400 imperial acres of oak and birch 
with some beech and firs; and being contiguous to Salton wood, 
it presents a range of beautiful and extensive scenery to the travel- 
lei from the top of Soultra-hill. Plantations, belts, and clumps on 
other estates extend to 100 acres more. 

Rent of Lancl—ThQ rent of arable land vanes from L. 2, 5s. 
to 14s. per acre, which may make the average L. 1, 5s. The rate 
of grazino- has greatly fallen of late years ; but hinds' cows are still 
rated at L. 5 for summer's grass and straw during winter. These 
are almost the only animals grazed at a fixed price per head, as 
farmers who have not sufficient pasture of their own take grass 
parks for the season. These are now let at from L. 2, 10s. to L. 3; 
some years ago they brought from L. 4 to L. 5 per acre. This 
may be the reason for valuing the grazing of cattle breeding to be 
fed off on turnip, according to their different ages and weight, at the 
low rate of from L. 2 to L. 3 per head. On clover or good old 
natural grass, the grazing of a sheep is worth from 12s. to 16s., 
estimating its size and quality. 

Live-stock.— Gved.i attention has been given to the rearing of 
sheep, and improving their breed ; and the success has been pro- 
portional. The black-faced seem to be in less repute, and the 
Cheviot, or a mixed breed between them and the Leicester, is pre- 
ferred. Much improvement has also been made in the breed of 
cattle as well as in feeding them for the market. 

Hushandnj.—kt present, rape-dust is much used for raising 
wheat, and bones for raising turnip, where there is a scarcity of 
dung. But perhaps the greatest and most efFectual improvement 
in husbandry has been the practice lately introduced of grazing the 
farm, in regular rotation, for two or three years. 

This county still retains its high reputation for agriculture ; but 
the farming capital is greatly diminished within the last ten years. 
Farm-houses and steadings are generally substantial and on a libe- 
ral scale. Great attention is bestowed on fences both by proprie-

tors and tenants. Hedges are raised at a great expense where the 
soil is unfavourable to them. 

Produce. — The following statement gives a fair average of the raw 
produce of the parish in ordinary years. The prices may be too 
high for the present year, but the unusually abundant crop will 
yield an equivalent. 



1850 quarters wheat at 54s. per quarter, - - L. 4590 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — The two greatest grain markets in Scotland, Had- 
dington and Dalkeith, are nearly equidistant, each being about nine 
miles from the centre of the parish. 

Means of communication. — The cross roads to the latter town 
are heavy, having several steep ascents and declivities, till they 
reach the great hue of road to England by Blackhills. These roads 
are kept in a tolerable state of repair, by statute labour ; but it is 
contemplated to put a toll-bar on the principal one, when it will 
be partly altered, and otherwise much improved. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is in the very centre of the pa- 
rish, exclusive of the intersected part : it is neat and substantial. It 
was built in 1800, and contains about 400 sittings, all of them free. 
The manse was built forty-seven years ago, and was then reckon- 
ed of the ordinary size; but in 1822 it received a considerable ad- 
dition. The glebe is small but of good soil. The stipend being 
all in grain varies from L. 250 to L. 300, according to the rate of 
the fiars. The church is well and regularly attended. The num- 
ber of communicants is from 280 to 300. There are two Episco- 
palian families in the parish ; and the number of Dissenting fami- 
lies is 15. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools in the parish, and 
both teachers are well qualified for their office. They have the 
legal salary and accommodations ; but the school fees are small, — 
those of the one teacher being about L. 10 a year, — of the other, 
about L. 12.

Except in the extremities of the parish, which are near some neigh- 
bourino- school, there are no individuals in the parish residing at an 
inconvenient distance from one or other of the above schools. In 
such circumstances, there is not one of the young capable of re- 
ceivino- instruction that cannot read ; and generally they are taught 
to write and count with a considerable degree of readiness and ac- 
curacy. Some are taught gratis, or paid for from the poor funds. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The poor funds arise from assess- 
ments, collections, and interest, &amp;c. The lying money amounts 
to L. 360 Sterhng. The yearly amount of church collections is 
small,— the non-residence of the heritors, and the practice of legal 
assessment being unfavourable to that kind of charity. The 
amount of assessment is from L. 60 to L. 100 per annum; but on 
any pressing occasions, it is considerably more. The present num- 
ber of paupers on the roll is 18, and the allowance given them va- 
ries from 6s. to 10s. each monthly,— besides occasional aid given 
to industrious families in distress. As might be expected from the 
rural simplicity and distance of the people from scenes of dissipa- 
tion, there being only one alehouse in the parish,— they are sober 
and industrious, but perhaps less provident than in former times, 
and therefore soon brought to poverty when age or distress comes 
upon them. When thus pressed, they shew little reluctance to 
apply for parochial relief. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Forty years ago, the real rental of the parish was L. 2700. It is 
now upwards of L. 6300. The increase of produce with that of 
prices, also, till of late years, has been nearly proportional. But this 
great increase of product is not owing so much to more land being in 
tillage as to the superior and more expensive mode of cultivation. 
Since the above period, the number of cattle and sheep fattened 
for the market has been more than doubled. These are not en- 
tirely fed on farm produce, but partly on draff, dreg, and oil-cake. 
But the present aspect of things is too likely to give a check to 
every expensive improvement.

Name. The origin of the name of this parish is somewhat 

doubtful, — though it has in general been ascribed to the fact of the 
ancient manor having been possessed during part of the thirteenth 
century, by Nicolas de Souhs or Soules, one of the competitors for 
the Scottish Crown in 1291, and grandfather of the celebrated 
Lord Soulis of border history, from whom it is supposed to have 
been originally termed Soulistown, by abbreviation Soultown, and 
subsequently, by corruption, Saltoun, or Salton. 

Extent, Boundaries, -c— The extreme length of the parish is 
3i miles ; in breadth, it varies from 2 to 3. The number of square 
miles of surface, however, does not probably exceed 8. It is bound- 
ed on the north by the parishes of Gladsmuir and Haddington ; 
on the east by that of Bolton ; and on the south and west by those 
of Humbie and Pencaitland, from both of which it is divided by 
the Salton and Tyne waters. In figure, it nearly resembles an 
oval, of which the greater diameter extends from north to south. 
The regularity of the form is, however, somewhat affected on the 
eastern side, by two extensive indentations formed by the parish of 
Bolton. 

Toporjraphical Appearances.— Yvom the western boundary, the 
land rises by a gradual ascent towards the south and east, until, at 
its highest point of elevation, called the Skimmer hills, it reaches 
the height of about 600 feet above the level of the sea. From this 
point, which is almost in the middle of the parish, the land again 
declines somewhat more abruptly towards the south, until it reaches 
the level of the Salton and Humbie waters. On the west and 
north the ground wears the aspect of rich cultivation; the thorn 
hedges, often interspersed with wild roses, are neatly and tasteful- 
ly kept; and the beauty of some of the roads is much nicreased by

their being bordered by different kinds of trees planted m the 
hedce-rows. On the southern slope of the above-mentioned 
heiit, a wood extends for upwards of a mile and a-half, skirting 
the'edge of the boundary stream on the south, and uniting wi h the 
equally extensive woods of Humbie. It consists chiefly of fir, birch, 
and oak. Towards the south-east, the aspect of the country is 
less fertile in vegetation, and inferior in natural beauty. The gene- 
ral appearance, however, of this part of East-Lothian is such as, 
from its agreeable diversity of hill and dale, does not render it un- 
worthy of the 'appellation of the " Northamptonshire of North 
Britain," by which the county has sometimes been characterized. 

Meteorology, 'c— The temperature of the atmosphere is equa- 
ble, and, in the higher parts of the parish especially, distmgmshed 
by its salubrity. Many instances of longevity at present exist, 
and in former times they appear to have been equally numerous. 
« A tradition is preserved," says the author of the last Statistical 
Account, " that, some centuries ago, when the plague visited, with 
dreadful ravages, this country, Salton was the only parish m the 
east of Scotland which escaped : an exception imputed to the pu- 
rity of the air, and the smoke of the limekilns, which, it seems, 
even then abounded in the parish." The salubrity of the chmate 
is probably chiefly owing to the deficiency of moisture in the soil, 
and this again may in great measure be ascribed to the fact, that 
the parish, occupying a moderately elevated situation between the 
hio-h range of the Lammermoors on the one hand, and the waters 
of'' the Frith of Forth on the other, is frequently exempted, by 
being thus placed between these two sources of nebular attraction, 
from the visitation of those heavy showers, to which the high up- 
lands .on the south, and the low districts on the north, are equally 
exposed. 

Hydrography.— The parish possesses many excellent springs of 
water, strongly impregnated with lime ; a circumstance which, it 
is believed, conduces essentially to the healthfulness of the inhabit- 
ants, and to the general salubrity of the district. The Tyne and 
Salton waters are the only streams of any importance connected 
with the parish. The latter, for nearly three miles, forms its south-

ern and western boundary, and is then united with the Tyne. At 
tlieir confluence, the Salton is decidedly the greater stream of the 
two, and ought with propriety to have imparted its designation to 
the future course of the river. In both of these streams there is 
abundance of excellent trout. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Strata of limestone rock pervade the 
whole parish in a direction nearly north-west. The degree of in- 
clination of the strata varies from 1 foot in 9, to 1 in 18. Petri- 
factions of the ordinary species of shell-fish are frequently found 
imbedded in the limestone ; and in some places the surface of the 
rock is covered with stones of a silicious quality, which, when quar- 
ried, are used, with advantage, as flags for pavement. In other 
places, the rock is found to be overlaid with bastard limestone, and, 
what is somewhat unusual, the strata of limestone are frequently 
divided from each other by conjoined strata of free and whinstone. 
Under the strata of limestone, there is every reason to believe, from 
some experiments which were formerly made, that a fine seam of 
coal would be found. The immediate vicinity, however, of many 
excellent collieries in the adjoining parishes has hitherto render- 
ed any attempt to work it unnecessary. 

The soil is various, consisting of loam, light sand, thin clay, and 
strong deep clay; but the clay soils prevail. On the west and 
north-west, and alongst the slope of the hill which terminates in 
the bed of the Tyne, the soil is peculiarly fertile and productive, 
being chiefly composed of the rich loam andclay. Towards the sum- 
mit of the central hill on which East Salton is situated, the soil is 
less favourable ; but towards the southern extremity of the parish, 
it again in some degree recovers its former richness. 

Botany. — There are various plantations in the parish, of the or- 
dinary species of trees found in such situations. The soil is deemed 
peculiarly congenial to the growth of fir and oak. Beech, elm, and 
larch are also found well suited to the soil and climate. In the 
grounds of Salton, which have many features of natural beauty, 
and are laid out with much taste, are some fine specimens of the 
thorn acacia, cedar of Lebanon, and hemlock spruce.

ent and powerful family of the De Morvilles, who were at this period 
the Constables of the kingdom. The lands of Herdmanston lay 
within this manor of Salton, and were granted about the year 1 190 
by Richard de Morville to Henry de St Clair, who then served 
the Morville family as their Sheriff  From him, the present noble 
proprietor of the estate of Herdmanston is descended, m the pos- 
session of whose family the property has thus been for upwards of six 
hundred years. On the accession of Robert de Bruce, the descen-- 
dants of the De Morvilles were forfeited, they having, with the Eng 
hsh monarch, espoused the interests of Balhol ; and the St Clairs 
from that period became tenants in chief. During the reign of 
Alexander HI. about 1260 the greater part of the manor of Sal- 
ton proper appears to have been possessed by William de Aber- 
nethy, son of Sir Patrick Abernethy of that ilk. His descendants 
acquired, in 1445 or 1455, the title of Lords of Salton, being then 
in possession of very extensive territorial grants.f In this family the 
manor of Salton continued till 1643,— a period of nearly four hun- 
dred years from the date of their first occupancy, when Sir An- 
drew Fletcher, better known as Lord Innerpeffer, purchased from 
Lord Abernethy of Salton, the present estate,— of which his lineal 
descendant, Andrew Fletcher, Esq. is now proprietor. 

Eminent Characters.— With, the parish of Salton many charac- 
ters of distinguished eminence have been connected. Of those 
to whom she had the honour of giving birth, Wilham Dunbar, 
the celebrated poet, was long supposed to have been one. This 
opinion, first maintained by Allan Ramsay, and subsequently 
by Lord Hailes, has been adopted by the author of the former 
Statistical Account, naturally misled by the error of such eminent 
authorities. Subsequent and more accurate investigation, how- 
ever, has proved the opinion to be erroneous. It appears to have 
originated with Ramsay in a misprint of the words " Saltone Mount" 
for " Falcone Mount," in the well known lines of the " Flyting of 
Dunbar and Kennedy," in which the residence of the former is sup- 
posed to be pointed at by his poetical adversary.:]: These words

have since been satisfactorily shown  to refer to Mountfaucon 
in Paris, where Dunbar resided at the period of the composition of 
the poem. Itis evident, however, from his own language "Flyting," 
line no, that he was a native of one of the Lothians, and as he 
is generally supposed to have been the immediate descendant of 
Sir Patrick Dunbar of Beill in East Lothian, there is every pre- 
sumption that some part of the county of Haddington was the 
scene of his birth ; but as to what particular locality is entitled to 
claim- this distinction there is no evidence whatever. 

Patrick Scougall, afterwards well known as Bishop of Aber- 
deen, was the incumbent of this parish for upwards of five years. 
He was translated from Leuchars, and inducted into the parochial 
charge of Salton, 29th January 1659. In April 1664, he was ele- 
vated to the bishopric, -j 

Henry Scougall, his son, the author of the much and justly esteem- 
ed work " The Life of God in the Soul of Man," was born at Sal- 
ton during his father's incumbency, some time in June 1660. Equal- 
ly distinguished by his superior talents, and his eminent piety, he 
attained at an early period of life to those honourable stations which 
are in general reserved for age and experience. At nineteen, he 
filled the chair of philosophy at Aberdeen; four years afterwards, 
he accepted the living of Auchterless, where he ably and zealously 
discharged the functions of the holy ministry and after an incum- 
bency of two years, being then only twenty-five, he was again re- 
called to his academical pursuits, and for the remainder of his life 
filled the office of Professor of Divinity in King's College, Aber- 
deen. His mortal career, however, though bright and useful, was

been unreservedly eulogised by almost every critic. It is to be regretted, however, 
that the meed of praise which has so lavishly been bestowed upon hnn has never been 
qualified by the consideration, that the tendency of many of liis compositions is im- 
moral and even profane ; and if it be doubtful whether he is entitled to be designated 
the Horace of his country, in point of poetical genius, there is unfortunately little 
doubt that, in point of licentiousness of sentiment, the appellation is too justly merited.

SALTON. Ill 

but brief: he died in 1678, having scarcely completed his twenty- 
eiohth year. To him Leighton might truly have applied his fa- 
vourite adage, " Diu vixit qui bene vixit." 

Superior, however, as a character of public emmence to either 
of the preceding, occupying a much more distinguished place in 
the history of the past, and still continuing to enjoy, by the la- 
bours of his genius and the recollection of his moral worth, a pro- 
minent station in the eye of mankind is the individual, who, as 
the immediate successor of Scougall, next filled the office of mi- 
nister of Salton. The name of Gilbert Burnett, Bishop of Salis- 
bury, is calculated to shed a lustre, not only on that humble spot 
which formed the Erst and early sphere of his ministerial labours, 
but on the country which gave him birth, and on the age in which 
he lived. Distinguished as he was by the remarkable vigour of his 
understanding, the unblemished integrity of his character, and the 
unequalled moderation of his pubhc conduct, he was eminently 
suited to the circumstances of the times in which his lot was cast, 
and peculiarly qualified to discharge those delicate and important 
duties, which, in after life, and in a more elevated station, frequent- 
ly devolved upon him.  

He was admitted minister of Salton, the 29th of January 1665, 
having been presented to the living by the Crown.f During his 
incumbency, he was most assiduous in the performance of his pas- 
toral duties. He preached twice every Sabbath, and once during 
the week. In the important duty of catechising and examining his 
flock from house to house, and of administering spiritual conso- 
lation to the sick, he was equally exemplary and assiduous. He 

• Wodrow, after having adverted to him as one of Bishop Leighton's « evange- 
lists," who were selected for their peculiar mission, on accomit of their " fame, learn- 
ing, and preaching gifts," speaks of him as " Mr Gilbert Bm-net, well known to the 
world since, first Professor of Divinity at Glasgow, and after that persecuted for his 
appearing against Popery, and for the cause of liberty ; and since the Revolution the 
learned and moderate Bishop of Sarum, one of the great eye-sores of the highfliers 
and Tories in England, and a very great ornament to his native country." — Church 
History, Book ii. chap. 5. 

The only circumstance which, on looking back calmly and dispassionately on 
the events of the past, tends in any degree to diminish our admiration of this eminent 
man is the fact — in his case, perhaps, the result rather of circumstances than of choice 
— of his having acted so conspicuous a part in the unjustifiable and impolitic attempt 
of the Episcopal party of the time to force upon the people of Scotland a mode of 
faith and worship, which the latter conscientiously deemed to be unscriptural, and 
which they too justly feared would lead to a spiritual usurpation of a still more un- 
hallowed character. 

t Sir Robert Fletcher, through whose influence the appointment was obtained, 
had wislicd him to accept of it nearly a year before, when it became vacant by 
Scougall's elevation to the Episcopate ; but Burnett declined the oiler, and going 
to Holland, spent the interval at Amsterdam in studying oriental literature and 
theology.

is stated generally to have preached extempore, having, by diligent 
practice, acquired the power of speaking with great fluency and 
correctness. Arguing, however, from the character of his written 
productions, which are in general rough and careless in point of 
composition, his style of speaking was probably never characte- 
rized by eloquence. He left Salton, as appears from the kirk-ses- 
sion records, on the 18th November 1669, having been called to 
fill the chair of Theology in the University of Glasgow, the duties 
of which he discharged with approved fidelity. 

When elevated to a more eminent station in the church, he was 
not unmindful of the interests of that parish which had witnessed 
his early labours. He bequeathed in trust to the Lairds of Salton and 
Herdmanston, and to the minister for the time, the sum of 20,000 
merks, to be applied in different sums as follows : for the educa- 
tion and clothing of thirty children " of the poorer sort;" for the 
erection of a new school-house, and affording a perpetual augmen- 
tation of the schoolmaster's salary ; for the increase of a library 
which had already begun to be formed " for the minister's house 
and use;" and the remainder for relieving the wants of the neces- 
sitous poor. The particulars connected with the present appli- 
cation of this fund are stated below, f By this generous bequest 

" The language in which, in the codicil containing this bequest, the bishop ex- 
presses himself, affords a pleasing evidence that the lofty elevation which he had then 
attained had not taught him to forget the humble scene of his " first love." — " This 
course," he adds, after having prescribed the particulars of the destination, " I order 
to be continued for ever, as an expression of my kind gratitude to that parish who 
had the first fruits of my labours, and among whom I had all possible kindness and 
encouragement." 

■f The present value of the bishop's bequest is L. 2000 Sterling, which being in- 
vested on heritable security at four per cent., yields annually the sum of L. 80. This 
sum the trustees allot as follows : 

For the clothing of the thirty children, about, - - - L. 35 0 0 
Allowed to the schoolmasters for their education, - - - 26 0 0 
Books, stationery, &amp;c. and other incidental expenses of education, - 4 0 0. 
For the necessitous ]50or according to the bequest, - - - 10 0 0 
For the increase of the manse library, - 500 

L. 80 0 0 

As the expense of clothing has been found in general to exceed the above amount, 
its issue has occasionally been suspended for a year, and the surplus, where any exist- 
ed, applied to the department of education ; and as it is believed, that the interest 
of the bequest will in future be required to be reduced to 3 per cent, thus mak- 
ing the annual proceeds only L. 70, the above arrangement will probably become 
permanent, and the children be clothed only every alternate year. In order to 
qualify for admission on the fund, the parents of the children who are applicants 
must have resided for not less than two years in the parish. According to the pro. 
visions of the will, the lairds of Salton and Herdmanston and the minister of the pa- 
rish for the time, nominate. Every child enjoys the benefits of the fund for four years. 
A list of their attendance at school and churcli is accurately kept, and if any great ir- 
regularity in these respects, without sufficient cause, has taken place, the detaulter is 
cither struck off the list, or, as a mitigated punishment, deprived of clothing in future.

the memory of the good bishop is still perpetuated in the pa- 
rish. The children on the fund are familiarly termed " bishops ; " 
and' the gallery in church appropriated for their use has receiv- 
ed, and is ever" likely to retain, the appellation of " the Bishop's 

laft." , , 

Burnett lived until 1715, having then filled the see of bahsbury 

for nearly twentv-six years. 

Salton was also the birth place and residence of another character 
of distinguished eminence. The celebrated Andrew Fletcher, the 
intrepid assertor of the civil and religious independence of his coun- 
try, was born here in 1653. His father, who died while his son was 
yet in early youth, committed him, on his deathbed, to the guar- 
dianship of Burnett, then minister of the parish, from whom it is 
supposed the young patriot first imbibed those liberal sentiments 
on government which he ever afterwards avowed. In them, how- 
ever, he seems subsequently to have outstripped his teacher. The 
character of this undoubtedly great man has been variously repre- 
sented : by some he has been described as a rank republican, whose 
projected limitations of the royal prerogative were only designed 
to lead to the erection of a Scottish commonwealth, and whose 
opposition to the union was prompted by selfish and interested 
motives. By others, he is represented as a man of pure and dis- 
interested patriotism, whose sole object was to maintain the liber- 
ties of his country on a constitutional basis. This is not the place 
to attempt to adjust the merits of the controversy. His sentiments 
unquestionably, verged towards repubHcanism, but to this extreme 
they were naturally led to tend, from the impression he entertain- 
ed, that the opposite and equally dangerous extreme was more like- 
ly to obtain the ascendant. The purity of his motives and the 
integrity of his conduct are unquestionable. His anticipations of 
evil as the result of the union, subsequent events have happily 
shewn to be fallacious.  He died at London in 1716, on his way 
from France to Scotland, whither he had fondly hoped to have ar- 

The children, however, are mostly exemplary in their attendance, and only one or two 
instances of tlic infliction even of the lesser penalty have occurred. There are at pre- 
sent on the fund sixteen male and eight female children, varying in age from seven 
to fourteen. 

 From an MS. in the library of the late Thomas Rawlinson, Esq., first published 
in the edition of Fletcher's Political Works, printed at Glasgow in 1749, we quote 
the following brief and somewhat quaint description of his personal appearance : "A 
low thin man, of a brown complexion, full of fire, with a stern sour look, and fifty 
years old."

rived before he breathed his last. His remains were subsequently 
brought to Scotland by his nephew Lord Milton. The ashes of 
the patriot now repose in the family vault below the aisle of Sal- 
ton Church. 

Andrew Fletcher, the nephew of the patriot, better known as 
Lord Milton, was also a native of Salton, being born there in 1692. 
He adopted the profession of the Bar, and rose rapidly through 
the inferior gradations of office to the elevated situation of Lord 
Justice- Clerk. This office he held during the troublous period of 
1745, and is admitted, on all hands, to have discharged its delicate 
and trying duties with singular lenity and forbearance.  He died 
in 1766 : and his remains are likewise deposited in the family vault. 

Chief Land-owners. — These are the following, Andrew Flet- 
cher, Esq. of Salton, who possesses nearly four-fifths of the land in 
the parish ; Lord Sinclair, proprietor of the estate of Herdmanston, 
and the farms of Greenlaw and Wester Blance ; the Earl of 
Haddington, proprietor of the farm of Samuelston Mains, a small 
part of the Samuelston estate, which lies chiefly in the adjoining pa- 
rish of Gladsmuir ; and the Earl of Dalhousie, proprietor of the 
lands of Easter Blance anciently Blanes which form part of the 
adjoining estate of Coalston. 

Parochial Registers. — The records of kirk-session consist of 
several volumes, commencing with the 27th April 1635, and con- 
tinuing to the present day, with the exception of a hiatus ex- 
tending from 1642 to June 1663, and another from 1748 to No- 
vember 1759. During the latter period, the deficiency is chiefly 
in the minutes of kirk-session proceedings; the register of baptisms, 
marriages, and burials being, with a few exceptions, regularly kept. 
In the earlier portion of the records, very minute details of paro- 
chial transactions are inserted. The texts of the ministers' ser- 
mons are noted down each Sabbath. If he were absent, the place 
where he was officiating is mentioned, as also the name of the 

♦ We quote from the last Statistical Account the following remarks on his cha- 
racter, which we believe to be just: "The conduct of almost the whole public affairs 
of Scotland fell upon him, and these he managed with such an uncommon degree of 
discretion, temper, and moderation, that the impetuosity of wanton punishment was 
restrained, and lenient measures adopted in favour of those, wiiom indiscretion or ig- 
norance had betrayed into hostility. He overlooked many of the informations which 
were brought to his office ; and it is stated here from the best authority, that, after 
his death, many scaled letters, containing such information, were found unopened 
among his other papers. With the same patriotic views, he engaged zealously in 
the abolition of heritable jurisdictions, which had long been inimical to order and to 
justice. With unremitting ardour he pursued every scheme tliat could promote the 
trade, manufactures, agriculture, and reforming of his country."

clero-yman who acted as his substitute at home. Many social of- 
fences, of a much less serious nature than those which now gene- 
rally form the subject of church discipline, appear to have been 
visited by the censure of the kirk-session ; and rebukes in the pre- 
sence of the congregation, even for such comparatively trivial de- 
linquencies, seem to have been universal. 

AntiquUies.— In the south-west part of the parish, and close to 
the brink of the stream, are the remains of an enclosure of an oval 
form, supposed to be a Pictish or Danish camp. It consists of 
two walls or dikes running parallel to each other, and having be- 
tween them a fosse, now almost filled up, of about 10 yards in 
width. The circumference of the inner inclosure may be about 
500 yards. No tradition exists by which any light is thrown on 
the history of this remnant of antiquity. 

In the park at Herdmanston, and close to the present mansion- 
house, are the remains of part of a chapel erected in the thirteenth 
century by John de St Clair. All that now exists of this ancient 
building is a portion, apparently of its western extremity, measur- 
ing within the walls, 30 feet in length, by 14 in breadth. A part 
of the eastern end appears to have been recently removed, and the 
gable rebuilt with fresh stone. It is now used as the burying 
vault of the Sinclair family. Within, are two flat tombstones co- 
vering the remains of William de St Clair, and Sibilla, his wife, 
bearing date 1598. A few yards to the north of this cemetery is 
an old arch, a fragment obviously, of the ancient castle of Herd- 
manston, having the date on the keystone. 

Herdmanston is now, and has for many years, been occupied by 
the Honourable Adam Gilhes, one of the Senators of the College 
of Justice, the noble proprietor himself residing almost entirely in 
England. 

There are no documents in the possession of resident individuals 
which are calculated to illustrate the antiquities of the parish it- 
self. There is, however, in the charter- chest of the Fletchers an 
interesting historical document, to which I cannot forbear advert- 
ing. It is the original letter written by the Marquis of Argyll to 
his son, on the morning of his execution. Its brevity, indepen- 
dently of its intrinsic interest, will justify me in inserting it at length 
below.

III. — Population. 

In 1735, the population amounted to . 761 

1791, .... 830 

1801, . . . . 7G8 

1811, . . . . 814

1831, males 386, females 398 784 

1835, . 390, . 400 790 

From the preceding statement, it appears that the population 
has been very fluctuating in point of numbers. The rapid dimi- 
nution of nearly eight per cent, between 1791 and 1801, is ac- 
counted for by the removal, during that period, of several public 
works, which employed a large number of operatives ; and also by 
the consolidation of some of the smaller farms into large ones. The 
large increase from 1801 to 1811 is explained by the fact of a 
different family, with a household of forty persons, then occupying 
the mansion-house of Salton. The decrease between 1821 and 
1831 is also explained by the circumstance of Mr Fletcher's house 
having been rebuilt during the former period, and a large number 
of artisans of different kinds having been then domiciled in the pa- 
rish.

Habits and Character of the People, Sc.— The general charac- 
ter of the people, in a religious and moral point of view, is on the 
whole exemplary, and may be considered as above mediocrity. 
Within the last few years, from the period of the incumbency of 
the present minister's predecessor, a very beneficial change is said 
to have taken place in the moral and religious habits of the lower 
orders. The young are in general well-grounded in the principles 
of religion ; docile in receiving instruction ; and civil and respect- 
ful in their manners. The inhabitants are in general attentive to 
the outward observances of religion, especially in their attendance 
on divine worship. Family worship is not, however, so much ob- 
served as it ought, and as we trust it may yet be. Intemperance 
is by no means frequent ; and for some time past the parishioners 
have, almost universally, abandoned the practice of using any spe- 
cies of liquor at funerals, — a resolution for which they deserve the 
greater commendation, as its adoption originated entirely with them - 
selves. No crimes of a public nature have for years been commit- 
ted ; nor has the parish for some time past been found to require 
any constable or police officer within its bounds. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — In an economic point of view 
the parish maybe regarded as exclusively agricultural; there being 
now no public works within its bounds, and the only kind of handi- 
craftsmen and artisans whom it supports being those whose la- 
bours are either indispensably required by the necessities of the 
population, or are directly subservient to the purposes of agricul- 
ture. 

The following statement of the agricultural economy of the pa- 
rish does not pretend to strict accuracy, but may be regarded as 
making a tolerable approximation to the truth.

There are twelve farms in the parish, varying in extent from 100 
to 500 Scottish acres. 

Rent of Land, Sj-c. — The rent of land ranges from L. 1 to L. 3 
per Scottish acre. The average rent of grazing is at the rate of 
L. 3 for an ox, and L. 5 for a cow. Twelve or fourteen score of 
sheep are generally kept at grazing for the market, or domestic 
use.

HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



Rate of Wages, 8fc. — The rate of labour for farm and other la- 
bourers is in summer Is. 8d. per day ; in winter Is. 6d. ; females 
employed in the field receive in general from 8d. to 9d. per day. 
The wages of shearers in time of harvest have, for the last ten 
years, varied from Is. to 2s. 6d. A large portion of the male in- 
habitants are employed as farm-servants, or, as they are provincial- 
ly termed, hinds. These hinds receive no stated daily wages. They 
are allowed from L. 8 to L. 10 per annum in money; a cow's keep, 
equal to L. 5 ; potato-ground, and a certain weekly allowance of 
oatmeal, barley, pease, and corn; in all, their yearly income, 
may, when reduced to money, amount to about L. 23. Twenty 
days' shearing is the amount of their house-rent. 

The wages of artisans, &amp;c. are as follows : carpenters per day, 
from 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; masons from 2s. to 3s. ; coopers, 14s. to 15s. per 
week; blacksmiths, 16s. ; bakers, 6s. with bed and board. The 
price of a full-mounted cart fit for use, L. 10 ; ploughs, L. 3, 3s. 
to L.3, 10s.; wooden harrows per pair, L. 1; do. iron per do. 
L.3. 

Husbandry.— The system of husbandry pursued in the parish js, 
in general, in accordance with the most approved principles adopt- 
ed in this highly agricultural county. The farming of the prin- 
cipal part of the arable land is conducted according to what is 
technically termed the four-course shift, viz. fallow, wheat, grass, 
and oats, in successive annual rotation. In some soils, what is 
termed the six-course shift is used, consisting of the following suc- 
cession; fallow, wheat, grass, oats, pease or beans, wheat or oats: 
and recently the five-course shift, consisting of fallow, wheat, two 
years grass, and oats, has been adopted apparently with much suc- 
cess. In these several rotations, the term fallow is used as includ- 
ing partial crops of turnip and potato. Turnip husbandry is not 
carried on to a very considerable extent,— the ground not being al- 
together suitable for their cultivation. At present, the quantity of 
land under this species of culture may amount to about 100 acres. 
A portion of the turnip crop is raised by the aid of bone-manure 
and rape-cake, which are now more universally employed than for- 
merly, and to a considerable extent supersede the use of lime. About 
one -half of the turnips are eaten off the ground by sheep; the remain- 
der are removed for the uses of the farm-yard. The ground was in 
former times generally drained according to the old system ; but 
furrow draining has been lately introduced, and is now universally 
adopted, apparently with the most beneficial results. For this pur-

nose tiles are chiefly employed, being supplied by a manufactory 
recentlv erected in the parish. In some places, however, owmg to 
the vicinity of excellent quarries, stones contmue still to be used 
for purposes of drainage. 

The o-eneral duration of leases is for nmeteen years. tarm 
buildino "are in general in an excellent condition. They are built 
of freestone, and chiefly tiled, as, indeed, are almost all the build- 
ings of this character in East Lothian, as well as the dwellings of 
the peasantry. The enclosures and fences are good and sufficient, 
and neatly kept, one-half of the expense being defrayed by the 
landlord, and the other half by the tenant. 

Quarries.— There are in the parish two limestone quarries, each 
yielding an excellent material, with lime-kilns at both, built on the 
most approved principle. There is also a freestone quarry for the 
use of the estate of Salton, which yields a good stone for building, 
though somewhat of a reddish tinge. All the quarries are wrought 
in the usual way. The average number of men employed in the 
hme-quarries and kilns is about twenty-five. 

Manufactures.— In former times, many public works were in ope- 
ration in the parish, which now no longer exist. In the beginning of 
the last century, the first mill for the manufacture of decorticated, 
or as it is famiharly termed, ;obarley, that was ever known in Scot- 
land was erected in this parish. About the same time also, the first 
manufactory for the weaving of Hollands in Britain was estabhshed 
here: and both these arts were long exclusively practised, to the great 
emolument of the inhabitants, who supphed the whole of Scotland 
with these important articles. The introducti on of these manufactures 
was owing to the ingenuity and zeal of the lady of Henry Fletcher 
of Salton, who, for the purpose of acquiring the secret of these 
arts, travelled in Holland with two expert mechanics in the dis- 
guise of servants, by whom models of the machinery were taken,, 
and afterwards applied to practical use. In the year 1750, also, the 
first bleachfield, belonging to the British Linen Comipany, wasform- 
edhere under the patronage of Lord Milton. " During his Lordship's 
hfe it was conducted with much spirit : no expense was spared in 
procuring from Ireland the most expert workmen, and it became 
at last so very flourishing as to aff'ord employment to upwards of 100 
persons." Subsequently to this, a paper-mill, and a starch-work 
were erected in the parish, each of which, at the period of the pub-

lication of the former Statistical Account 1792 employed eibt 
persons. All these manufactures have now ceased to exist. The 
celebrated barley-mill is devoted to other purposes ; and of the 
other structures not one stone now remains upon another. The 
only public work at present in operation in the parish is a brick and 
tile factory on the estate of Salton, originated and erected by the 
present proprietor, Mr Fletcher, in the year 1834. The kiln is 
21 feet in length, and 10 in breadth within the walls, and gives 
employment to seven workmen, including a manager. Draining 
tiles are at present the chief article of manufacture. Since the 
erection of the work in 1834, the amount of produce has been as 
follows: 500,000 draining tiles, 20,000 house do., and 12,000 
common brick. 

Produce. — The average gross annual amount and value of raw 
produce raised in the parish, may, on a rough calculation, be as 
follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man, 

or of the domestic animals, . . . L. 6000 0 0 

Of potatoes, turnips, cabbages, beet and other plants cultivated in the 

fields for food, . . . . . 700 0 0 

Of hay, whether meadow or cultivated, .. . . 150 0 0 

Of land in pasture, . . . , . 530 0 7 

Of the annual thinning and felling of plantations, &amp;c. . . 700 0 1 

Of juarries . . , . . . . 2000 0 0 

Of miscellaneous produce, not previously enumerated, . 200 0 0 

Total, L, 10,280 0 0 

Association for the Encouragement of Industry, §'c. — About the 
commencement of the present century, the late General John 
Fletcher originated a society in the parish for promoting the in- 
terests of agriculture, by the bestowal of annual premiums for the 
best breeds of stock, the best specimens of agricultural produce, 
the most ingenious implements of tillage, &amp;c. After being con- 
ducted with much success for about twenty years, the funds of the 
society, then amounting to L. 700, were, with the consent of the 
present proprietor, transferred to the " East Lothian United Agri- 
cultural Society," in which the original Salton Society is now en- 
tirely merged. Should the former, however, be dissolved, it is pro- 
vided that the above-mentioned funds return to the original object 
for which they were destined by General Fletcher. There is an 
annual meeting of the United Society held in the parish the last 
Thursday of May, when a pretty extensive cattle shew generally 
takes place.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets — The nearest market-towns are Haddington and 
Dalkeith, the former being five and a-half, and the latter about 
ten miles distant from the centre of the parish. It is chiefly to the 
former that the agricultural produce of the parish is conveyed. 

Villages— T\\exQ are two villages in the parish, East and West 
Salton, so called from their relative situation to each other. The 
former is almost exactly in the middle of the parish, and is situat- 
ed on the road which leads from Edinburgh, across the Lammer- 
moors, to Dunse. The latter is situate a mile to the west of East 
Salton, nearly on the verge of the parish, and within a few hundred 
yards of the Salton water. 

Means of Communication— The above-mentioned road from 
Edinburgh to Dunse traverses the parish for upwards of three miles. 
The whole extent of turnpike roads may be about seven miles. 
The only regular means of communication with the capital, from 
which Salton is fifteen miles distant, is by a carrier, who goes and 
returns once a-week. A carrier from Giff'ord to Edinburgh also 
passes once a-week through the parish. For some months during 
summer a one-horse coach runs every alternate day between Gif- 
ford and Tranent, passing through the village of East Salton, and con- 
veying passengers to the Haddington coaches. This means of con- 
veyance, however, does not meet with all the encouragement which 
it were desirable it should receive. There is a post-ofiice at West 
Salton, established in 1812, which maintains a daily communication 
with Haddington, the post-town. The range of its delivery ex- 
tends to the whole parish, and to different places in the adjoining 
parishes of Humbie, Ormiston, Bolton, and Pencaitland. One penny 
additional is charged on the postage to Haddington. The post- 
master's salary is L. 5, — a sum scarcely adequate as a remuneration 
for the duties performed. 

There are three stone bridges in the parish, or rather connect- 
ing it with those -adjoining, all of which are in good repair; be- 
sides these, there are two also of stone, and of tasteful architec- 
ture, within the park at Salton Hall. 

Ecclesiastical State, Sj-c. — Of the ancient ecclesiastical history of 
the parish little is known. Duringthe reign of David I. about 1 130 
Hugh de Morville, the then lord of the manor, granted the church 
of Salton, with a carrucate of land, and the tenth of a multure of 
the mill of Salton, to Dryburgh Abbey. About the close of

HADDINGTON S II IRE. 



the following century, John de St Clair, who was then posse.s.sor of 
the lands of Herdmanston, erected a chapel on his estate, with 
the permission of the canons of Dryburgh, to whom he granted 
two acres of land, with an indemnity " that his chapel should not in- 
jure the mother church of Salton."  The monks of Dryburgh con- 
tinued, until the Reformation, to enjoy these ecclesiastical posses- 
sions. During the agitations of that eventful period, when personal 
aggrandizement was so often sheltered under the pretence of pub- 
lic principle, the ecclesiastical revenues of Salton, there is reason to 
believe, fell a prey to the greed of some one or other of the local aris- 
tocracy ; and not until beyond the commencement of the seventeenth 
century, was even a scanty portion of them restored to their original 
sacred objects. In 1633, when, on the temporary establishment of 
Episcopacy, the Bishopric of Edinburgh was erected, we find that 
the church of Salton, with all its civil and ecclesiastical rights, was 
transferred to the metropolitan see. In 1643, when Sir Andrew 
Fletcher acquired the property, it is probable that the presentation 
to the hving was also conveyed. The right does not, however, ap- 
pear to have been exercised by any of his successors till 1760; 
since which period it has continued to be enjoyed by the family of 
Fletcher, f 

The situation of the present parish church is extremely advan- 
tageous, being in the very centre of the parish, and in the most 
populous village it contains. No individual is thus more distant 
than two miles from the place of public worship, while nearly four- 
fifths of the inhabitants are within a mile. The period of the ori- 
ginal erection of the church is unknown. In 1805, it underwent such 
extensive repairs that the present building may be considered as 
almost entirely new ; part of the interior only of the former walls 
remains, and has been newly faced with neatly wrought ruble stone. 
The figure of the church is that of the cathedral cross ; the tower 
and spire rising from the choir, and the pulpit, which is just in the 
centre of the cross, looking down the nave. The whole of the in- 
terior is painted, and has an air of great neatness and comfort. 
The style of architecture of the present building may be described 
as the mixed, or modern Gothic. At the period of the repair al- 
ready mentioned, the external aspect of the church was beautified

by the erection— at the entire expense of the late liberal patron, 
General Fletcher, -of a handsome spire, springing from a low battle- 
mented tower, and rising to the height from the level of the ground 
of 90 feet In its general appearance, our village sanctuary more 
nearly resembles the sacred structures which so frequently adorn 
the hamlets of England, than those less tasteful erections with 
which the parsimony of heritors has too often disfigured, and not 
embelhshed the parishes of Scotland. The number of sitters ac- 
commodated in the church is about 400 ; it is, therefore, amply 
sufficient for the present population. The manse was erected in 
1805, and is, on the whole, in good repair. The extent of the 
glebe is five acres Scottish, and is worth about L. 15 per annum. 
The amount of the stipend is, in Linlithgow measure, 16 bolls 
wheat, 120 do. vied, and 120 do. harleij, with L. 8, fe. 8d. for com- 
munion elements. For crop and year 1834, the only year of the 
present minister's incumbency, the value of the stipend was, ex- 
clusive of the sum allotted for communion elements, L246, 10s. 

• In 1665, the stipend was L. 33, 2s. 6d. Sterling, together with U bolls 2 pecks, 
2 lippies of ;heat : 11 bolls, 2 pecks, 2 lippies of bear = f f 2 b°lls 1 firiot 1 peck 
and 3 lippies of meal. In 1755, it amounted to L. 84, 10s. 6d., and m 1798, to 
L 153, 3s. 8d. Sterling. In the ancient Taxatio the church of Salton was rated at 

The Sowing is a list of the incumbents of the parish of Salton as far back as I 

have been able to trace them. n -r, i i, 

In 1488, when the church of Salton was attached to the Abbey of Dryburgh, the 
incumbent appears to have been a person of the name of Dewar, who also held the of- 
fice of dean, as he is termed, Pari. Records, 343-53 "Dene Dewar." Froui this 
period tiU the era of Presbytery, I have not been able to trace any of my clerical pre- 
decessors. After the Reformation no stated minister appears to have been appointed 
till about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Until that period, it would ap- 
pear, from some incidental notices in the records of Presbytery, that the minister ot 
the adioinino- parish of Pencaitland had some share in the pastoral superintendence 
of Salton. It is unquestionable that, in ICOl, Salton was still without a regular mi- 
nister, as in the instructions given by the presbytery to their commissioners to the 
Assembly for that year, there is one obviously referring to " unplanted kirks, in these 
words, " Saltoun kerk to be rememberit." It is probable that the first incumbent at- 
ter the Reformation commenced his ministry about 1605 or 1600. From that pe- 
riod the succession is regular, o T- 1 A

The whole adult population, with the exception of thirty per- 
sons, are members of the Estabhshed Church ; and of these thirty, 
five are Episcopalians, who regularly attend the parish church. 
Divine service is in general numerously attended ; and although, 
as mentioned above, the amount of church accommodation is more 
than what is legally required, yet, so exemplary are the parishioners 
in this outward observance of religious duty, that the church is not 
at present sufficient to accommodate all who are in the habit of at- 
tending. During about half of the year, there are two diets of pub- 
lic worship every Sunday ; during the remainder, there is one of 
somewhat longer duration. There are, besides, services on week- 
days, amounting, in the course of the year, to about thirty. 

The average number of communicants admitted at each of the 
three last half-yearly celebrations of the sacred ordinance is 7. 
The present gross amount is 306. The sacrament has, for the 
last four years, been dispensed twice a-year, on the first Sabbaths 
of February and July. 

The brief period of the incumbency of the present minister does 
not permit him to form any extensive average in regard to the 
amount of charitable collections. During the last sixteen months, 
there have been two congregational collections for religious and 
benevolent purposes, the average amount of each of which was 
L. 9, 7s. 

Religious Societies. — There are two societies in the parish for 
the promotion of religious objects. One, based on principles of a 
catholic nature, has for its object the dissemination of evangelical 
religion at home and abroad, irrespective of the interests of sect 
or party. It is yet in its infancy, having been instituted only du- 
ring the present year. Its annual income cannot, therefore, be 
estimated, but the number of its members is considerable, and 
daily increasing. The other is of longer standing, and has been 
more exclusively employed in promoting the interests of dissent ; 
it has latterly been on the decline, and has now few supporters in 
the parish. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish. Of these, the 
parochial school is situated in the village of East Salton, the cen- 
tral point of the parish. The branches of education taught in it are, 
English, English grammar, geography, history, arithmetic, writing, 
French, and Latin. All these departments of education are con- 
ducted by the parochial teacher with ability and efficiency. The

expense of education per quarter is, for English arid grammar, &amp;c. 
3s. with the addition of writing and arithmetic, Ss., and with 
that of Latin, 6s. The parochial schoolmaster's emoluments as 
teacher are, from Bishop Burnett's fund, L. 6 ; legal salary, 
L. 34, 4s. 5d. ; school fees, &amp;c. L. 20; three roods of ground, L. 2; 
total L. 62, 4s. 5d. 

The other school is situated in the village of West Salton. The 
branches of education taught in it are English, EngHsh grammar, 
arithmetic, writing, book-keeping, and the elements of land-survey- 
ing. These branches of instruction are likewise well taught. The 
expense of tuition is the same as in the parochial school. The 
teacher's emoluments are, from Bishop Burnett's fund, L. 20 ; 
school fees, L. 20 ; per centage as heritors' clerk, L. 8 ; one and 
a-half acre of land bestowed by the late General Fletcher, value 
L. 4, 10s ; total L. 52, 10s. 

The school-house at West Salton is a neat and spacious build- 
ing, erected by General Fletcher about thirty years ago. The 
parish school-house is not so large nor so commodious, and would 
require to be considerably increased in size. The parochial teach- 
er's house possesses the legal accommodation. 

In each of the schools, in addition to the above-mentioned 
branches of education, the Holy Scriptures are daily read, and the 
Shorter Catechism taught. The meetings are opened and closed 
with prayer. The following is the state of attendance.

I am not aware that there is any inhabitant in the parish up-

write. Between the ages of six and fifteen there is none of either 
sex who cannot read, and only a very few who have not yet begun 
to be taught to write.

Libraries,— hi Salton-Hall, there is a fine library of upwards of 
5000 volumes, consisting of works of generalhterature, but containing 
few of more recent date than the middle of the last century. Amongst 
its literary curiosities, may be mentioned a small folio copy, of the 
orio-inal edition of " Locke on Human Understanding," with the 
words " Andrew Fletcher, from the Author," written on the title- 
page, probably either by the philosopher or the patriot. Allu- 
sion has already been made to the library mentioned in Bishop 
Burnett's will " for the minister's house and use." It appears to 
have been originally commenced by a person of the name of Nor- 
man Leslie, probably about the year 1650. Who this person was, 
I have not been able satisfactorily to ascertain. A Norman Leslie, 
a preacher of the Gospel, is mentioned in the records of the pres- 
bytery of Haddington, in 1644, during a vacancy in the living of 
Salton, as the person whom, along with a Mr Mill, the congrega- 
tion wished to hear as candidate for the church ; but neither of 
these were permitted to preach. It is not improbable that this 
was the person in question, and as he appears from the presbytery 
records to have been well known to Sir Andrew Fletcher and the 
parishioners, we may suppose him to have been a resident in the 
parish or its neighbourhood,— who was interested in its welfare, and 
who, although not permitted to become its pastor, was generous 
enough to devote a part of his own Hterary possessions to the be- 
nefit of those who should in future enjoy that office. In all the 
oldest volumes in the library his name is written, and beneath it 
the words JJux /crptgoxgSo-s, «XX-« -Trgo./xcos- Is it too fanciful, from 
this to conjecture that, during the long vacancy in question, he 
might have voluntarily and gratuitously ministered to the spirit- 
ual necessities of the parish, and have thus recorded his disinte- 
rested labours But this is mere conjecture. At the time oi 
Bishop Burnett's induction, the library appears to have contained 
145 volumes. From him, it received considerable additions; and 
from the year 1760, when his bequest first became available, it 
has been augmented by each successive incumbent, though, m 
some instances, it must be confessed, not with all the judiciousness 
of choice which might have been expected. It now contains 862 vo- 
lumes, consisting chiefly of works on theology, with some ui clas- 
sics and history, and a few in polite literature. 



SALTON.

About a year ago, a library was begun to be formed for the use 
of the Sabbath scholars. It now consists of 130 volumes, chiefly 
of works of a religious character. They are eagerly read by the 
young people, and in many instances by their parents also. It is 
to be hoped that, under the Divine blessing, this may be found a 
means of advancing the moral and religious welfare of the young, 
who appear in general, from the commencement of this httle in- 
stitution, to have imbibed a greater desire for serious and profitable 
reading. A branch of the East Lothian Itinerating Libraries is also 
established in the parish. For the past year, the number of sub- 
scribers amounted to 22. 

Friendly Societies. — There are two societies of this kind in the 
parish. One, established upwards of thirty years ago, consists at 
present of 200 members, and has funds to the amount of L. 1000. 
Of this sum L. 700 are lent on private security at 4 per cent, and 
L. 300 are in a bank at 2. The annual subscription of each mem- 
ber is 6s. 6d. The present annual income of the society, there- 
fore, including interest and subscriptions, is L. 100, 10s. For the 
last year, its disbursements amounted to L.74, 18s. 3d. The ave- 
rage number of individuals receiving relief is 23. The following is 
the scale by which its disbursements are regulated : In the first 
three months of sickness, the member receives 5s. per week ; for the 
next three, should his illness continue, 4s.; for the three thereafter, 
3s.; and for the remaining three, 2s.; and should his indisposition 
be protracted beyond the year. Is. 6d. a-week thereafter. On the 
death of a member, L. 2, 10s. are given for funeral expenses, and 
10s. on the death of a child under twelve years of age. An allowance 
of 15s. per annum is bestowed on the widows of members as long as 
they continue unmarried. This society is in a very prosperous con- 
dition, and, as is evident from the number of members, has many 
contributors beyond the limits of the parish. 

The other society is formed on a somewhat different principle, 
but is not less popular than the former. It differs from the other 
in being a yearly and not a permanent association. Each mem- 
ber subscribes from Is. 2d. to 3s. 2d. weekly. The twopences 
form the fund whence the members in distress are relieved, and at 
the end of every year, a general distribution takes place, when each 
member receives back the amount he has subscribed in shillings, 
and a portion of the surplus, if there be any, of the weekly pence. 
The society thus combines, in some measure, the principle of the 
savings bank with that of the friendly association. Its scale of 



128 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



relief is nearly the same as that already mentioned. Since Janu- 
ary 1827, when this association was instituted, till the present year, 
the number of its members has increased from 45 to 146. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons at present 
receiving regulsiir parochial aid is 15, being at the rate of about 1 in 
53 of the whole population. The average weekly allowance to each 
of these paupers is Is. 9d. For some years past there has been a re- 
gular assessment, the amount of which at present is L. 60, exclusive 
of L. 20 for the guardianship and support of a lunatic. The amount 
of church door collections and mortcloth dues for the year end- 
ing April 1835, was L. 18, lis. lld., and when to this is added 
the sum of L. 10 from Bishop Burnett's bequest, the whole an- 
nual expenditure for parochial purposes will be L. 88, lis. 11-d. 
There does not appear to be, I regret to say, any reluctance or 
indisposition on the part of the poor to seek parochial aid. For- 
merly, I am informed, it was not so. At one time, it was difficult 
to get parents to solicit for their children the benefits of the Bur- 
nett fund, but now the number of applications in general exceeds 
that of vacancies ; and, with few exceptions, the same change has 
taken place in regard to the application for general parochial relief. 
The existence of a legally claimable provision will, it is to be fear- 
ed, tend everywhere more or less to produce its usual pernicious 
effects on the natural benevolence and moral independence of the 
people. 

Jnns. — There are three persons in the parish licensed to retail 
spirits ; but there are only two pubHc-houses, neither of which, I am 
happy to say, have for some time been much frequented. 

jPuel — The inhabitants are well supplied with this important 
necessary of life. Coals are cheap, and easily procured from the 
adjoining collieries, chiefly of Pencaitland. They cost, including 
carriage, 5s. 6d. per cart of 12 cwt. Wood is also not unfrequent- 
ly used for fuel. Mr Fletcher, with considerate kindness, per- 
mits the inhabitants of the parish who choose, — to gather fuel, at 
diff'erent times in the year, from the thinnings of the great Salton 
wood; a permission which often serves to cheer the poor man's 
hearth during the inclemency of winter. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The chief improvements in the agricultural condition of the pa- 
rish which have been effected since the date of last Statistical Ac- 
count 1792 are,— the introduction of the new manures, by which 
a much greater amount, as well as a superior quality, of produce 



SALTON. 



129 



is now raised ; the adoption of the improved system of tile-drain- 
ino- ; and the consohdation of the numerous small farms which pre- 
viously existed into a lesser number of larger ones. The fences and 
inclosures are also much better kept than formerly, and in no part 
of the country are they superior either in appearance or efficiency. 
The parish roads are likewise greatly improved, and at all times 
afford a safe and easy means of communication. 

The comforts of the people have here, as elsewhere, been in- 
creased by the increased cheapness of the commodities in general 
requisition. In a moral point of view, the removal of the public 
works already mentioned has had its effect in altering, and in some 
degree, it is believed, in improving, the character of the popula- 
tion. The chief, and almost only social vice which still exists is 
that of illicit connexion — a vice, it is to be feared, unhappily pre- 
valent in almost all the rural districts of Scotland. The secon- 
dary causes to which, it appears to the writer of these remarks, the 
prevalence of this vice in this part of the country is chiefly owing, 
are, in the rs place, the very inadequate accommodation afforded 
by the dwellings of the peasantry, few or none of which contain 
more than a single apartment, in which the whole members of the 
family, although of opposite sexes, are obliged habitually to reside ; 
a circumstance, it is obvious, which must naturally produce a dis- 
regard to the modesty of domestic intercourse, and consequently 
lead to a relaxation of social morals : and, in the second place, the 
too general practice of employing young females in out-field work, 
where they are associated with persons of the opposite sex, and 
where unsuitable intimacies are too frequently easily formed. Both 
of these causes it is in the power of individuals almost entirely to 
remove ; and to the means of doing so the attention of the pro- 
prietor and the agriculturist cannot be too seriously directed.

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, Extent— Tn parish of Ormiston is bounded by 
Pencaitland on the east ; Humbie on the south ; Cranston on the 
west ; and Tranent on the north. It is about 5 miles in length, 
and very irregular in breadth, varying from 1 to about  mile ; 
its narrowest part being on the eastern extremity ; and its broad- 
est at the centre. It contains an area of 5 square miles English, 
and has some resemblance to a horse-shoe winding about Pencait- 
land on the north, west, and south. 

Name. — It was originally possessed by a family of the name of 
Orme ; hence the name of the parish. In 1648 the barony of Peaston, 
or Paiston, as it is uniformly written in the old records, was dis- 
joined from Pencaitland and annexed to Ormiston. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general appearance of the 
parish is flat and low. The extensive woods about Ormiston Hall, 
blended with those of the adjoining estate of Fountainhall, the 
patches of wood in different places, and the hedge-row trees over its 
whole extent, give it a very rich and beautiful appearance. These 
circumstances, however, prevent that free circulation of air which 
is so favourable to the crops. 

Meteorology. — It appears, from observations regularly made by 
the gardener at Ormiston Hall in 1821-22, at 10 p. m. that the ther- 
mometer in December and January twice reached 31° each month, 
and was not lower in the course of the season. Its greatest height, 
that year, was in the beginning of June, when the thermometer stood 
for some days at 68" and 68°. It reached the same height about the 
end of July. Its range during the months of June and July, was 
from 49° to 68°. In 1822-23, the thermometer ranged for several 
days in the end of December from 24° to 29°, and from 12th to 
28th January, from 22° to 30°. In June and July that year it ranged 
from 44° to 63°. Its greatest elevation was on 12th August, when it rose

to 64°. In 1 827-28, the observations were made at nine o'clock a. m. 
and P. M. : hat season, the range of the thermometer during the 
monthsof December and January was from 28= to 51°. It was seldom 
lower than 32'. Its range in June and July was from 46° to 68°, 
which was the highest point that season. The range of the baro- 
meter that year was from 28.5 to 30. But it was chiefly from 29.1 
to 29.5. 

From a register of the winds kept at the same place it appears 
that, from 20th December 1822 to 29th January 1823, the wind 
was easterly, with the exception of six days. The most prevail- 
ing wind, however, was S. W. and W. In 1821 the wind was 
easterly in the months of April and May, but in the other months 
the south wind prevailed. In January and February 1828, there 
were three weeks of east wind, but in the course of the year the 
S. W. was by far the most prevaihng. From that quarter, too, the 
greatest rains usually proceeded. 

HydfTography. — The parish is every where well supplied with 
water, abounding in springs of different qualities. Some of them 
contain a considerable quantity of iron. Others, proceeding from 
lime rock and gravel, are of a softer quality. Both of these kinds 
are found sometimes within a few yards of each other. It is wor- 
thy of notice, that in the village of Ormiston, there is a spring, 
which has been long used as a draw-well, containing a consider- 
able portion of iron. Several old men who were accustomed to 
use the water of that spring have been afflicted with gravel com- 
plaints, while such complaints are rarely met with in other parts of 
the parish. Whether, and how far the water contributed to these 
complaints, is a matter that yet remains to be investigated. 

The only river in the parish is the Tyne, which runs through it 
in a north-easterly direction. It rises in Middleton moor, in the 
parish of Borthwick, about eight miles to the south-west. When 
it passes Ormiston, it is but a paltry stream, the greater part of it 
in summer being drawn oflf to supply the mill. It is occasionally 
swelled by westerly rains, so as to overflow its banks and cover the 
adjacent meadows. It is increased, in its progress, by the addition 
of several streams which fall into it from the south ; and, after a 
course of about twenty miles, flows into the sea a little below Tyn- 
ninghame, near Dunbar. The bed of the river where it passes Or- 
miston is upwards of 250 feet above the level of the sea. 

Geolofjy and Mmeralogy. — The parish abounds with coal and 
limestone. The coal has been wrought from a very early period,

chiefly in the neighbourhood of Ormiston Hall. This appears from 
the sinking of the surface in different places. The ground on which 
the house stands has all been excavated : and in 1812, the ser- 
vants were, one morning, surprised at seeing a large hole close by 
the kitchen, which opened into a waste that extended 16 feet 
below the ground floor of the kitchen. With the view of examin- 
ing and clearing out this waste, a mine was cut through from the 
face of the bank, in the ravine called the Haining, close by the 
house on the north. When this mine in the course of operation 
was carried near the waste, a great body of water suddenly burst 
out and forced the miner before it at the risk of his life. The 
waste was cleared out and solidly built up, a drain being left at 
the bottom of the different branches of it, to carry off" the water, — 
by which means the house and court were rendered quite secure. 
This operation required no less than 310 cart load of stones to com- 
plete it. 

On the south of the Tyne, there are three workable seams of 
coal, the uppermost of which is from 28 to 30 inches thick. It is 
not known at what time a large proportion of this coal had been 
wrought. The second seam is from 30 to 33 inches thick, and is 
of a good quality. Much of this seam is already wrought out, but 
there is still a portion remaining in the pleasure grounds, and the 
large wood to the south-east of the house. The third or under 
seam is from 33 to 43 inches thick, the working of which is at pre- 
sent going on under many disadvantages. The lower half of its 
roof is of weak tender blaes, which permit only very narrow rooms 
to be driven in the coal ; and one-half of the seam is fit only for 
lime coal. These seams have all along been wrought by means of 
a free level. The elevation of the coal seams is one in sixteen, 
towards the south-east. No pit has yet been sunk in the low 
ground near the river, although some of the best informed colliers 
are of opinion it might be wrought there to great advantage ; and 
were the projected line of road from Pencaitland to Whitehouse 
mill to be carried through, this change of the road would be at the 
same time beneficial to Ormiston, and profitable to the proprietor. 

On the north of the Tyne, within the parish, the seams of coal 
are all entire, except some cross workings of small extent, of which 
no record is to be found. In the year 1822, when a well was sunk 
in the south corner of a field occupied by the factor, close by the 
glebej a seam of coal 4 feet thick was met with, at only a few feet 
from the surface ; but no attempt has yet been made to trace it out.

Lime rocks abound towards the southern extremity of the pa- 
rish, running nearly from east to west, and dipping towards the 
north. At what time it began to be wrought I have not been able to 
ascertain. It appears, however, from an account of the parish m 
1627, that at that time it was not known that there was either lime 
or coal in the parish, or even in the neighbourhood. Lime is 
now, however, found in great abundance, all along the direction 
from Salton to the western extremity of Crichton parish. In the 
southern extremity of the parish of Ormiston, it has been wrought 
for a great number of years, and is generally found in eight beds 
in all about 15 feet thick. The bottom bed is usually found to 
be of an inferior quality. 

There is abundance of freestone in the parish. Several quarries 
of it had been wrought at different times. One was opened a great 
many years ago, on the north bank of the glen, to the north of the 
House of Ormiston Hall. The stone of this quarry was very 
coarse and friable. From it, the manse and several other buildings 
were supplied with stones. Another quarry of post-freestone, at 
the western extremity of the parish, was opened in 1808. The 
rock of this quarry, which is composed of several strata, is 13 
feet thick, and is harder, and of a finer quality than the other. 
From it, the proprietor is supplied with stones for carrying on his 
buildings, and in particular, a great proportion of the stones em- 
ployed in the addition lately made to the House of Ormiston Hall 
were procured from this quarry. 

If we may judge from the quality of the springs, ironstone may 
be found in different places ; but no attempt has ever been made 
to discover it.f 

Soil. — There is a considerable diversity of soils in the parish. 
A small breadth on either side of the Tyne consists of a light 
loam on a gravelly bottom. As you proceed from the river, it 
changes into a stiff clay upon a till bottom. Part towards both 
the northern and southern extreniities of the parish is of a bleak 
and obdurate quality, but is gradually improving by cultivation. 
About the village the soil is a light loam upon gravel. In the same 
tract, westward, boundedby the Tyne on the south, anda small stream 
on the north, the middle and greater part of it is of a stiff chiy,

and both sides of a light loam of a spungy quality. A similar va- 
riety of soils is to be found in the southern and higher part of the 
parish ; a great portion of which by good management has been 
brought from a barren moor to a state of high cultivation. Oh 
the western part of the parish, there is a portion of meadow land, 
about ten acres on both sides of the Tyne, producing very good 
natural grass, which is first cut and then pastured. It would ap- 
pear, that, in ancient times, the inhabitants of Ormiston were sup- 
plied with meadow hay from that quarter ; for it is stated in the old 
Account already referred to, that they pay " zeirlie for their wester 
meadow haye, 280 merkeis." The present tenant at West Byres 
lately made an embankment where the river runs along his farm, 
to prevent its overflowing, and has ploughed up and sown the 
meadow ground. The experiment has not yet had sufficient time 
to shew its effects. 

Botany. — The limits of this article will not admit of a particu- 
lar enumeration of the plants of the parish. A few, however, of 
the rarer kinds that are indigenous may be mentioned. These are 
Scolopendrium vulgare et officinale, Iris Pseud- Acorns et fuetidissi- 
ma, Cucuhidus Behen, Solanum nigrum et vulgatum, Cardamine 
amara et pratensis, Adoxa moschatellina, Anemone nemorosa, Pul- 
monaria officinalis, Viburnum Lantana, Sium angutifolium, Epilo- 
hium hirsutum, Chrysanthemum segetum. 

Ormiston abounds with excellent gardens, in which all the com- 
mon fruits are to be found. When the house of Ormiston Hall 
was enlarged and fitted up for the Dowager Lady Hopetoun, who 
now occupies it, the half of the garden was taken away and convert- 
ed into a flower garden ; which garden has been well laid out by 
the present gardener, and contains above 500 species of herbaceous 
plants, above 110 species of evergreen and deciduous shrubs, and 
270 sorts of roses, besides about 70 or 80 sorts of annual flower 
seeds, and a considerable quantity of Dutch flower roots. 

The garden at Ormiston Hall is chiefly taken up with fruit 

" Nothing is so hurtful to the crops in this parish as mildew. Wiole fields hist 
year were rendered almost useless, and not a season passes without more or less in- 
jury being done by it. It is confined to the lower district of the parish, and prevails 
chiefly in a range along the cast, north, and west of the village, beginning at the 
Tyne, and sweeping in a circuit of about a quarter of a mile broad, round the vil- 
lage to the Tyne again. The prevalence of this local disease about the village of 
Ormiston has been ascribed to barberry trees, inters]erscd in the hedge-rows, and also 
to the confined situation, which is flat and surrounded with numerous hedge-rows on 
all sides. In order to remedy this great evil, it would be necessu-y to thin the hedge- 
rows, and keep the ditches properly cleaned. The late Earl of Hopetoun was decid- 
edly of opinion that the disease originiitcd from the confined situation of the place.

trees; among which some fig trees upon a wall with a soutliern 
exposure have long been celebrated for their excellent fruit. The 
trees are supposed to have been planted by John Cockburn, the 
proprietor, about the beginning of the last century, and the figs 
are still reckoned superior to any that are produced in this country. 

There are two gardens in the village where vegetables and truits 
are reared for sale, a great part of which is carried to Edinburgh 
market. In the strawberry season, about 200 or 300 pints of 
strawberries are daily sent thither. 

In the flower garden at Ormiston Hall, there is a remarkable 
yew tree, which, before the garden was contracted, stood in the 
middle, but, being now left without the wall, is more exposed to 
view. This tree is without question the largest and finest of its 
kind in Scotland. Its circumference at the ground when accurate- 
ly measured in 1824, was found to be 12 feet 8 inches; at two 
feet above the ground, 11 feet 9 inches; at four feet, 13 feet 10 
inches : and at five feet above the ground, the circumference is 17 
feet. It spreads beautifully on all sides, the extremities of the 
lowest branches bending down and touching the ground. It is 29 
feet in height, and the surface of the ground covered by it is 59 
feet in diameter. The late Earl of Hopetoun was at considerable 
pains to prevent the rain from lodging among the branches, and 
corrupting it ; it is undoubtedly of very great age. f It is still in 
great vigour ; and comparing it, as it is at present, with what it 
was forty years ago, it seems to grow something less than an inch 
every year. 

II. — Civil History. 

There was lately found in the Register Office at Edinburgh, 
an account of the parish of Ormiston, dated 1627, containing some 
curious and interesting information.

signed under the yew tree. It was beautifully written on a piece ot parchment whicli

men who saw it, was 1474.

the Lindsays, and continued in the possession of that family till 1368. 
At that time, Sir Alexander Lindsay, who was called Lord, that is 
Laird of Ormiston, succeeded to the property. He was also proprie- 
tor of Paiston and Temple- Hall, and upon the marriage of his only 
daughter Joan to John, second son to Sir Alexander Cockburn of 
Cockburn, left to them and their heirs the land and house of Ormi- 
ston, the lands of Paiston, Muiihouse, and Temple-hall ; and this 
grant was confirmed by a charter of King David Bruce in 1368. 
This John and his son were constables of Haddington, which of- 
fice was for a long time hereditary in the family. 

In 1542, Patrick, a descendant of the family, distinguished him- 
self by a gallant defence of the Castle of Dalkeith, against James 
ninth Earl of Douglas, who had risen in rebellion, on account of 
the murder of his brother William, the eighth Earl. Cockburn, hav- 
ing obtained the command of the town, put himself at the head of 
the King's troops, defeated the rebels, though his army was infe- 
rior to theirs, and obliged them to retire. 

Alexander, son to Sir Alexander Cockburn, born in 1535, hav- 
ing travelled for some years both at home and abroad, for the im- 
provement of his mind, was cut off at the early age of twenty-eight. 
He was a young man of great promise, and was for sometime un- 
der the charge of John Knox, the Reformer, along with two sons of 
the Laird of Longniddry. Knox in his history speaks of him as 
possessed of great accomplishments, and he was much esteemed by 
Buchanan, who wrote two elegies upon his death. In the aisle 
which was attached to the old church at Ormiston Hall, there is a 
brazen tablet to his memory, with a Latin inscription in excellent 
preservation. 

About the end of the year 1545, George Wishart, the celebrat- 
ed reformer, after preaching at Haddington, came on foot with 
Cockburn of Ormiston, and two of his friends, to the house of 
Ormiston. In the course of the night, the house was beset by the 
Earl of Bothwell, who demanded Wishart to be given up to him. 
Cockburn and his friends, however, refused to comply, till Both- 
well gave the most solemn promises that he would keep him in 
safety, and not give him up to his enemies. Cardinal Beaton was 
at that time at Elphinston Castle, anxious to get Wishart into his 
power. Bothwell refused to comply with the Cardinal's demand, 
and stood to his promise. But he was soon prevailed upon to give 
him up to the Earl of Arran, at that time governor of Scotland.

Cardinal, who carried him to St Andrews in the end of January 
1546, where he was executed on the 1st March, in the view of 
the Cardinal and his friends, who beheld his death from a window 
of the castle. 

Faviihj of CocBurn.— The family of Cockburn, for a long tract 
of years, occasionally held the office of Lord Justice- Clerk. The 
first of the family who held it, was Sir John in 1547. He was after- 
wards appointed a Lord of Session in 1554. The same office was 
held by Adam in the middle of the seventeenth century. In his time 
1657, the lands of Paiston were sold to Robert, afterwards Sir 
Robert Hepburn of Keith. Adam was member for the county of 
Haddington, in the Scottish Parliament which sat at Edinburgh, 
28th July 1681, and also in that of 1688. He was likewise ap- 
pointed one of the Scottish commissioners to meet with the Eng- 
lish regarding the treaty of Union. He was a man of good under- 
standing, and of great application to business, but of a hot and 
overbearing temper. 

His son John, the celebrated agriculturist, was born about the 
year 1685. During the life of his father, he sat as a member of 
the Scottish Parhament, and took an active part in the proceed- 
ings connected with the Union of Scotland and England. He 
afterwards represented the county of Haddington in the British 
Parliament, and was continued in successive parliaments from 1707 
to 1741. But he was chiefly distinguished by his patriotic and be- 
nevolent exertions to promote the improvement of his native 
country. 

Scotland, though now equally, if not better, cultivated than Eng- 
land, was at that time far behind the sister kingdom. Mr Cock- 
burn, from his residence in England, was well acquainted with the 
agricultural improvements that were going on there. He was anx- 
ious to introduce them into Scotland, and spared no labour nor 
expense to accomplish an object so desirable. The method he 
employed was a remarkable one. Leases were seldom of longer du- 
ration than five years, and proprietors had great difficulty in get- 
ting proper tenants to cultivate their lands. Mr Coclj.burn, with a 
view to encourage his tenants to greater improvements, granted a 
lease of ihirty-eight ears duration, with a renewal of it for nine- 
teen years more at the expiry of that term, and so on from nine- 
teen to nineteen years in all time coming, upon their paying a certain 
sum as a rent or grassum at the end of every nineteen years. All 
the farms in the barony of Ormiston were let in the same manner 



138 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



with some slight modifications. Thus some are held upon a tenure 
of three lives ; in which case, when one dies, the tenant upon re- 
newing it is bound to pay his grassum. If he do not renew it, 
and one of the two remaining lives fall, he forfeits his lease. An 
attempt was made, at one time, to set aside those leases, but it did 
not succeed. Some of them, by agreement betwixt the tenants 
and landlord, or by neglect of the tenants to fulfil the terms, ran 
out and reverted to the proprietor. About two-thirds of the ba- 
rony of Ormiston, however, are still held upon those leases. 

At the time the leases were granted, they certainly held out 
great encouragement to the tenants to improve their lands to the 
utmost extent, of which they were capable ; but they were highly 
detrimental to the proprietor; and now prevent him from carrying 
on those improvements in the parish to which otherwise he might 
be disposed. In this plan Mr Cockburn seems to have sacrifi- 
ced a permanent to a temporary advantage, and discovered a want 
of foresight, which compelled his son to sell the property, and 
leave the seat of his ancestors. It is impossible, however, to say 
how much the stimulus thus given might contribute to the gene- 
ral improvement of the agriculture of Scotland at that time. 

In the year 1726, he erected a brewery and distillery at Ormis- 
ton. These works were carried on by Mr Wight, one of his te- 
nants, with whom he was in the regular practice of corresponding 
about country matters, and to whom he gave the most liberal en- 
couragement in conducting such an undertaking. With a view also 
to promote the growth of flax, he obtained premiums from the 
Board of Trustees for encouraging its culture, and an annual sa- 
lary for an estabhshed Hnt-dresser and heckler. He, at the same 
time, estabhshed a school for teaching young girls to spin linen 
yarn, under the direction of a mistress, who received a suitable sa- 
lary for her trouble in educating them. And to complete the pro- 
cess, he established a bleachfield, and prevailed upon a person in 
Ireland, well acquainted with that business, to settle in Ormiston. 
This was the first bleachfield in this part of the country, proba- 
bly the second in Scotland. For, before 1730, fine linens were sent 
to Harlem in Holland to be bleached and dressed. The Board 
of Trustees readily granted some pecuniary aid in support of this 
infant manufactory. 

To disseminate a spirit for agricultural improvement through 
the country, in 1736 he instituted a club or society composed of 
noblemen, gentlemen, and farmers, who met monthly for the pur- 



OllMISTON. 



139 



pose of discussing some appropriate question in rural or political 
Economy. It subsisted above ten years.  

About this time, 1732, he made great improvements in the vil- 
lage, and laid out the fields contiguous to it upon a plan furnished 
by Mr Lewis Gordon, a land-surveyor, whom he brought from 
England for that purpose. They were all divided into small por- 
tions and enclosed with thorn hedges and hedge-row trees. This 
plan was extended over the whole barony of Ormiston, by which 
it was and still is distinguished from all other parishes in the neigh- 
bourhood. 

Among his other improvements, Mr Cockburn did not overlook 
the public roads. By his exertions in making them and keeping 
them in a state of repair, he set an example which has contribut- 
ed as much as anything else to the prosperity of the country. 

About 1741, Mr Cockburn seems to have retired from public 
hfe, and to have employed himself in superintending and carrying 
on those improvements which he had so laudably begun. He died at 
his son's house at the Navy Office in the year 1747,, leaving behind 
him a name which will be handed down with respect in the pa- 
rish of Ormiston from father to son for many generations. 

His son George, who succeeded him, is no farther deserving of 
notice than as being the last of that distinguished family. He was 
appointed a captain of the navy in 1741, and one of the commis- 
sioners of the navy in 1756. He died at Brighton in 1770. 

Family of Hopetoim. — The family of Hopetoun succeeded the 
family of Cockburn, in the lands and house of Ormiston. John 
second Earl of Hopetoun having acquired possession of three 
farms north of the Tyne some years before, purchased the whole 
property in 1747. The barony of Paiston had already come into 
the possession of the family, having been purchased by the tutors 
of Charles first Earl of Hopetoun, from Robert Hepburn, after- 
wards Sir Robert Hepburn of Keith, in 1696 ; so that in 1747 
the Earl of Hopetoun became the sole proprietor of the parish. 

John second Earl of Hopetoun, who acquired the property of 
Ormiston, was one of the most eminent men of his time. A sound 
understanding and a benevolent disposition, united with a very 
ample fortune, rendered him, during the course of a long life an or- 
nament and a blessing to his country. Though qualified by his 
abilities and knowledge to fill the first offices of the State, he con-

stantly resisted every solicitation to take a part in the administra- 
tion, from a conviction that he could be of more real service to 
the nation by attending to the improvement of his extensive pos- 
sessions. The respect he paid to rehgion gave a peculiar dignity 
to his character, and secured him the approbation of good men. 
Being deeply convinced of the truths of the gospel, his piety was 
exemplary and sincere, and he was regular in his attendance upon 
public ordinances. His first employment every morning was to read 
a portion of Scripture, and recommend himself to the protection of 
the Almighty. 

To guard against the danger connected with an education at 
public seminaries, he had his sons brought up chiefly under his 
own immediate inspection. Though he was ever ready to relieve 
the distressed, he gave no countenance to those whose distresses 
were brought on by idleness, profligacy, and intemperance. The 
Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh owes much of its present greatness 
to his generosity, he having contributed no less than L. 400 a-year 
towards its support. Notwithstanding his residence during a great 
part of the year in a different part of the country, Ormiston flou- 
rished under his patronage and superintendence. He was accus- 
tomed to reside eight months of the year at Hopetoun House; 
the other four months were generally spent at Ormiston, and m 
excursions to the baths at Buxton. He watched over the interests 
of the parish, and has left an example worthy of the imitation of 
all in the higher ranks of society who take an interest in the wel- 
fare of their country. 

His sons who succeeded him, first James and then John, were 
distinguished for their talents and their virtues. James was in the 
practice of residing some months every year at Ormiston Hall ; and 
by the countenance he gave to religion, by his kindness and en- 
couragement to its ministers, and his benevolence and attention to 
the interests of the people placed under his influence,— he secured 
their gratitude and esteem. 

His brother John, the fourth Earl, upon his succeeding to the 
family titles and est-ates in 1816, brought along with him a high 
reputation as an officer in the army. He resided with his family 
a year and a-half at Ormiston Hall, while the splendid man- 
sion of Hopetoun House was undergoing some repairs : during 
which time, he was assiduously employed in superintending and 
improving his East Lothian possessions. He took a great interest 
in the public roads, and got the one leading through the parish 



ORMISTON.

very much improved under his own immediate inspection. He gave 
every encouragement to the tenantry on his estates, and they were 
not insensible tohis kindness. They erected a monument to his me- 
mory on Byreshill, which bears testimony to the estimation in which 
he was held by them. After leaving Ormiston in 1818, he never again 
resided there. He died at Paris in 1823, lamented not only by his 
family and the tenantry on his extensive estates, but by the nation 
at large as a public benefactor and a model of disinterestedness 
and integrity. ' His widow now occupies the house of Ormiston 
Hall. 

He was succeeded by his son the present Earl, who gives pro- 
mise of the same benevolent dispositions by which his family has 
been all along peculiarly distinguished. 

The Earl of Hopetoun, sole proprietor, has in his possession se- 
veral plans or surveys of the parish ; in particular, an old plan of 
Ormiston by Lewis Gordon in 1731 : a plan of the village of Or- 
miston, also by Lewis Gordon, — besides a large plan of the ba- 
rony of Ormiston, in 1742 by the same. There are a great many- 
letters in the possession of Mr Wight's family chiefly relating to 
the agricultural improvements carried on by John Cockburn. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are very imper- 
fect. Some of them, according to tradition, being in the posses- 
sion of one of the elders, who was tenant of East Mains, were con- 
sumed when the house of East Mains was burnt. The earliest date 
of those that remain is April 30, 1637. There is a blank from 
1689 to 1730, supposed to have been occasioned by the loss of 
those that were burnt. From 1730 to the present day, they are 
complete and regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — There is an old cross in the centre of the village. 
It seems to have been connected with a Roman Catholic chapel, 
which, about the beginning of the last century, stood where the 
cross now is, extending across the street from north-west to south- 
east. That chapel was then used as the school-house, and one of 
the oldest inhabitants, now dead, told me he was educated there. 
Several of the parish records are dated in that school-house. The 
cross is still in good preservation. About six years ago the stones 
at the base were much decayed, and it was in some danger of fal- 
ling; to prevent which, it was substantially repaired by means of 
a subscription, and is now in a state to stand for ages.  

At the southern extremity of the parish, about three miles from

the Tyne, are the remains of an old camp of a circular form, sup- 
posed to be Danish or British. Its form sufficiently indicates, it 
was not Roman. And as the Danes, according to Chalmers, Ca- 
ledonia, Vol. ii. p. 465, never penetrated into the county of East 
Lothian, it was probably British. Twenty years ago, before the 
field where it is situate was ploughed up, two trenches with which 
it was surrounded were very distinctly marked : for several years, 
however, the field has been under the plough, and they have al- 
miost disappeared. In a few years more, it is likely not a vestige 
will be seen. 

East and West Paiston are about half a mile distant from each 
other. The whole of the intervening space in ancient times seems 
to have been occupied with houses forming a considerable village. 
According to tradition, there were once seven farm-houses in that 
tract. A burying-ground was attached to it, situate betwixt Pais- 
ton and Templehall, in which a former tenant is said to have 
removed several large grave-stones. It has been planted, and the 
trees are now pretty well grown, and seem to be stronger upon 
the site of the church-yard than elsewhere. I have not been able 
to ascertain whether there was a church there. It is probable 
there was, and that Templehall was the house belonging to the 
church. 

Modern Bmldings.—T\\e chief modern building in the parish 
is Ormiston Hall. The old house in which the family resided, is 
about 200 yards to the west of the present, and forms part of a 
court of offices and servants' houses. A part of the principal stair- 
case still remains, leading into an apartment which has been con- 
verted into a carpenter's shop. The present mansion-house was 
built by Mr Cockburn in 1745. Three additions have since been 
made to it at different times,— the last of which was two years ago, 
when it was fitted up for the accommodation of the Dowager Coun- 
tess of Hopetoun, who now inhabits it as her jointure house. 

III. — Population. 
There are no data by which the ancient state of the population 
can be ascertained. About the middle of the last century, it was 

 In 1790, the population was 863 

1801, - - - 766 

1811, - - - 727 

1821, . - - 779 

\m, - - 838 

In an account of the parish given into the Presbytery m 1649 by 
Mr John Sinclair, minister, he states the number of communicants 



ORMISTON. 



143 



to be about. 550, which is nearly double the number at present. 
There seems to have been a gradual decrease in the population 
till 1811; and from that period, a gradual increase, arising from the 
progressive agricultural improvement of the parish. In 1831, the 
population of the village amounted to 335, and of the country to 
503, — indicating a decrease in the population of the village in the 
course of forty years, amounting to 250. 

The annual average of births for the last 7 years is 22 ; of deaths 
13 ; of marriages 3i. 

An accurate account is kept of the births ; but the deaths and 
marriages cannot be so accurately ascertained, no measures being 
yet adopted to secure an exact return. 

The number of unmarried men, bachelors and widowers above 50 years of age is 17 

women upwards of 45 years of age - - 49 

families in the parish - - 194 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 64 

in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 38 

The number of insane and fatuous persons is 4. Of these two 
are kept by their friends, and two are under the charge of the kirk- 
session. 

The great bulk of the people are contented and comfortable in 
their circumstances. They are, in general, cleanly in their habits, 
respectful in their manners, industrious, and attentive to the ordi- 
nances of religion, and the education of their children. There 
are some, however, particularly in the village, who, having acquir- 
ed habits of tippling, disturb, by their irregularities, the peace of 
a place, which, from its beautiful and retired situation, seems pe- 
culiarly fitted to be the abode of tranquillity and happiness. 

IV. — Industry. 
In consequence of the exertions of Mr Cockburn before noticed, 
about the beginning of last century, Ormiston was one of the ear- 
liest and best cultivated parishes in Scotland. Some of the per- 
petual leases which he granted have fallen into the hands of the 
proprietor, but the greater part of them still remain in the posses- 
sion of the tenants, and form a striking peculiarity in the parish of 
Ormiston. Of late, several of the farms have been let to subte- 
nants who reside upon the farms, and are acquainted with the most 
improved modes of husbandry. Only one family of the original te- 
nants now remains in the parish, and it has the perpetual lease of 
four farms. 

The lands that are not on perpetual leases, are let for nineteen years ; 
those connected with the village, for seven, or such a number of 



144 HADDINGTONSHIRE. 

years as may suit the proprietor. In general, the farms are well 
cultivated, and improvements carried on with spirit by the tenants. 
In some farms, draining has been practised to a considerable extent, 
and the operations are still going on. 

When the improvements were in their infancy, rape was grown 
in the parish, but it has long been discontinued. Of late, however, 
rape-cake or rape dust has come to be pretty much used as a ma- 
nure, particularly in the upper parts of the parish, and after seve- 
ral years trial, has been found to succeed. And it would appear 
from the increasing demand for it, that it is coming more and more 
into use. Lime has been much used for a great number of years. 
There is one kiln in the parish and several in the vicinity. Byre 
and stable dung is the only other manure employed. 

The number of imperial acres in the parish is 3245. Of these 
2938 are in cultivation, 132 in meadow and constant pasture, 5 
waste, and 170 underwood, of which 132 are in the barony of Or- 
miston, and 37 in the barony of Paiston. The trees are of various 
kinds, but a great proportion of them are oak. Of the land in cul- 
tivation the average number of acres in fallow is 320. 

Rent of Land.—T\\e average rent of arable land is very low. 
What is let on perpetual leases is about 6s. per acre. What has 
been let lately on common leases averages about L. 2, 5s. per 
acre. The average rate of grazing for the year is about L. 4 per 
ox or cow, and 18s. per ewe or full-grown sheep. 

Live-Stock. — There are few sheep reared in the parish. The far- 
mers buy in, occasionally, what quantity they need of the Cheviot 
breed crossed with the Leicester, and of the black-faced. Black- 
cattle are not reared, except milch cows, which are chiefly of a cross- 
ed breed of the Ayrshire and Angus. The Ayrshire are coming more 
into use, from their being of a small size, and giving a proportion- 
ally large quantity of milk and butter. But no attention is paid 
to the keeping up of any particular breed. When milch cows are 
wanted, they are selected wherever they can be found most suitable, 
without regard to the breed. 

Husbandr7/.—Ti\\ lately, most of the farms in the parish were in 
the possession of non-resident tenants, and there are still several of this 
description,— a circumstance by no means favourable to the prospe- 
rity and improvement of the parish. Some of the village lands 
even are in this situation. Within these few years, several of the 
farms of this description have been let to tenants who reside upon 
their farms, and for whose accommodation very commodious and 



ORMISTON. 



145 



even handsome houses have been built. But on some of the farms, 
Limey-lands, House of Muir, and East Paiston, the dwelling-houses 
have been allowed to fall into disrepair. The fences in some places 
are well kept, but in others they are very much neglected, — the 
hedges going fast into decay, and the ditches and water courses 
being completely choked up from want of cleaning. 

The parish roads have begun to be more attended to than they 
were ; and some of the tenants, by the improvements they have 
made in them, have done an essential service to the parish, and at 
the same time materially promoted their own interests. 

About twelve years ago, a thrashing-mill was erected by the te- 
nant of the mill lands, which has been let out to the villagers, and 
been of the greatest service to the place. Before that time, all the 
grain about the village was thrashed by the Jlail, whereas very little 
is now thrashed in that way. Several of the tenants have had thrash- 
ing-mills erected within these few years ; and there is now not a farm 
of any consequence without one. The tenant of the Murrays, six 
years ago, erected a steam engine upon that farm for thrashing his 
crop, which answers the purpose remarkably well. In consequence 
of these improvements, by which the operations of agriculture are 
so much abridged, a want of employment in the course of the win- 
ter is now beginning to be felt more severely by the labouring classes. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be conjectured, is as follows : 

White crops, 5730 imperial quarters, at L. 1, 10s. id. . L. 8702 8 0 

Beans and pease, 590 do. L. 1, 14s. 6d. . 1017 15 0 

Potatoes and turnips, 206 acres at L. 10 per acre, . . 2060 0 0 

Clover grass and hay, 241 do. 180 stones per acre, at 6d. per stone, 1084 10 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Village. — The village of Ormiston is the only one in the parish 
that deserves the name. It stands upon the north bank of the 
Tyne, at an elevation of 276 feet above the level of the sea. It 
consists chiefly of a broad street running east and west, with a row 
of houses on each side, several of them of two stories. Some of 
these houses are fitted for the accommodation of genteel families, 
and are occasionally let. The principal houses have all excellent 
gardens attached to them, several of which are surrounded with 
stone walls, and stocked with fruit trees and all sorts of vegetables. 
It contains a population of 335, whereas about forty years ago, 
when the last Statistical Account was published, the number of 

HADDINGTON. K 



14G 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



inhabitants was about 600. From that time the population has 
been constantly decreasing. This circumstance may be easily ac- 
counted for. About the middle of the last century, it had a 
bleach field, a starch -work, a brewery, and distillery ; now, there is 
no public work of any kind, and httle employment for either trades- 
men or labourers. It is very healthy, and indeed may be said to 
enjoy every natural advantage for domestic comfort. Though 
not a market-town, it is not inconveniently situated with regard to 
markets, having Haddington on the east, at the distance of about 
8 miles, Dalkeith on the west, at the distance of 6 miles, Edin- 
burgh, at the distance of 12 miles. Last winter a corn-market 
was established at Tranent, which may be of great advantage to 
the parish of Ormiston. By a late measurement, the distance from 
the cross to the post-road at Tranent was found to be exactly 2 
miles 2 furlongs and 152 feet. 

Although the village is well supplied with water, all the principal 
inhabitants having wells belonging to them, there is no good pub- 
lic well for the accommodation of the poorer clases. There was 
formerly an open public well in the wynd, which contained at all 
times an abundant supply of water ; but, to prevent the danger of 
children falling into it, it was covered up about ten years ago, and 
the water was conveyed by a pipe to the foot of the wynd. This 
alteration, in respect of the supply of water, has been prejudicial to 
the inhabitants. The cross stands in the centre, rising 15 feet 
above the level of the street. 

Means of Communication.— There is a post-office in the village, 
which is kept up entirely by the inhabitants, every family subscrib- 
ing a small sum annually, or paying something for every letter and 
newspaper. It communicates with the post-office at Tranent once 
a-day, and there receives the letters and newspapers from the Lon- 
don mail. 

The turnpike road runs through the parish from north to south 
for about five miles, and is twice intersected by the parish of Pen- 
caitland. About fifteen years ago, John Earl of Hopetoun, hav- 
ing procured a subscription, and added, himself, what was neces- 
sary to complete the work, got three small bridges erected upon 
the public road in the immediate vicinity of the village, one over 
a little stream to the north, called the Puddle-burn, where, in floods 
and meltings of the ice, the road was very much obstructed. The 
others were built immediately below the mill, about 20 yards dis- 
tant from each other, where the road was constantly covered by 



ORMISTON. 



147 



the water coming from the mill trough, and in frost and the melt- 
ing of snows was hardly passable even by horses and carriages. 
Foot-passengers used to go round close by the wall of the mill. 
The road between them and at both ends was raised to a level 
with the bridges. This formed one of the greatest improvements 
that had been made in Ormiston for many years. With the view of 
keeping the turnpike road in good repair, two additional tolls were 
erected, one at the church, the other about a mile south of Tranent. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated at the point 
where the roads from Ormiston and Paiston unite towards the 
west, about a mile and a-half south-west from the village, and also 
from the manse, which is in the village. It is within little more 
than a quarter of a~mile from the western extremity of the parish, 
three miles from the eastern, and two and a-half from the northern. 
The old church was more centrical. It was situate close by the 
house of Ormiston Hall to the west; and it and the church-yard 
were both within the orchard of the proprietor. And as Mr Sin- 
clair states, in the account given into the Presbytery, in 1649, the 
inhabitants had no other way of getting into the church-yard than 
by the Laird's garden door. The church-yard also was represented 
as too small for the parish. The aisle attached to it is still stand- 
ing in pretty good preservation. Were a new church to be built, 
an excellent situation for it would be found on a field of flat high 
land immediately to the west of the village. Its present situa- 
tion is very inconvenient for the minister and the greater part of 
the population, who are not nearer it than a mile and a-half. It 
was built in 1696, in a plain style, with a small belfry, and no 
ornaments. It is cold and damp, and very uncomfortable in winter ; 
but of late has been considerably improved. At first, it was only 
partially seated, families providing themselves with chairs and stools 
as they found it convenient. The area in the centre of the church 
was in that state twenty years ago, — about which time it was filled 
up with good substantial pews ; and it was not till last winter that 
the seating was complete. It affords accommodation for 300 per- 
sons. The seats are all free ; some of them are appropriated to 
particular families, but a considerable proportion are common. 

The church-yard is perhaps the smallest in the country, being 
only about 46 yards by 24, including the church and offering-house. 
An additional piece of ground was kept in reserve for it by the 
Earls of Hopctoun, but only a small part of it has been taken in. 
The soil is a retentive clay and very wet. Mort-safes are used for 



148 HADDINGTONIIIKE. 



the protection of the dead, and are reckoned of a very good con- 
struction. 

The manse is situate on the north side of the village, towards 
the east end. In 1779, during the incumbency of the late Mr Col- 
ville, the upper flat of the old manse was taken down, and two new 
flats were built upon it, with a projecting wing behind, of the same 
height with the rest of the building. 

The garden lies to the north and east of the manse, is inclosed 
with a stone wall, and stocked with fruit trees. There are two tall 
lime trees at the bottom, planted about the year 1680, by Mr Sin- 
clair, then minister of the parish, which are still in great vigour. 
The minister has the privilege of a road leading from the back- 
court, round the garden to the glebe. That road was attempted 
to be stopped by the neighbouring feuar, but it was secured two 
years ago by a process before the Sheriff". 

The glebe contains about 7 acres of pretty good land. Ori- 
ginally it lay all behind the garden, divided into three small fields. 
But about the middle of the last century, the remotest field, some 
of which was low and marshy, was excambed for another imme- 
diately to the east of the street of Ormiston, which is now the best 
part of the glebe. It is all inclosed, but the fences are getting old 
and insufficient. There is coal below it, at no great depth ; but for 
want of a level it cannot be wrought without an engine, and there- 
fore is not likely to be turned to any account. The stipend is ten 
chalders of grain, and L. 41, 13s. 4d. of money, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements. From a want of teinds, it would not 
have been what it now is, had not James Earl of Hopetoun, sole 
heritor, allowed it to be twice augmented during the incumbency 
of the late minister, that it might not fall below others m the 
neighbourhood. The last augmentation was given m 1808. 

There are no Dissenting meeting-houses in the parish. The 
number of families belonging to the Establishment is 168. There 
are 19 families belonging to the Secession, who frequent difi-erent 
meeting-houses, and a few are connected with no church. Some of 
the servants in famihes connected with the Establishment belong 
to Dissenting congregations, and vice versa. The average number 
of communicants for the last twelve years is 270. 

A parish Bible Society was instituted in 1817, the funds oi 
which for some years, upon an average, have amounted to L. 6 a- 
vear While the greater part of this sum has been generally sent 
to the East Lothian Bible Society, a small part has always been 



ORMISTON. 



149 



given to the Edinburgh Missionary Society. A part of the funds 
also is reserved for purchasing Bibles and Testaments to the poor 
of the parish who need them. 

The ordinary collections at church amount to about L. 12 a- 
year; besides which, collections are occasionally made for rehgious 
and charitable purposes, amounting to about L. 1 5 a-year. 

Education. — There are, at present, three schools in the parish. 

The parochial school in the village of Ormiston, the master 

of which has a salary amounting to L. 29, 18s. 9d. He has 
also L. 1, 7s. 9d. of mortified money, with a house and garden. 
The house has two flats. The school occupies the under : the 
upper, which is divided into several apartments, serves for the dwel- 
ling-house. The garden being smaller than the law requires, 
the schoolmaster receives an adequate compensation for the defi- 
ciency. At present, the fees received amount to only about 
L. 15 a-year. But they may easily amount to more than double that 
sum. 

There is another school at Paiston, three miles south from the 
parish school. It is of very long standing, being mentioned in the 
earliest records of the parish. The schoolmaster has L. 1, 5s. 
yearly of mortified money, a free house and school-house, and a 
small sum of money as a salary given gratuitously by the proprie- 
tor, — besides the school fees, which upon an average amount to 
betwixt L. 15 and L. 20 a-year. 

A school was instituted two years ago by the Dowager Coun- 
tess of Hopetoun, at House of Muir, a small village chiefly inha- 
bited by colliers. The schoolmaster has a free house, a small sa- 
lary from her Ladyship, and the school fees. It has succeeded re- 
markably well, and been of great benefit to the parish. 

From there being three schools in such a small parish, it is evi- 
dent the means of education must be accessible to all. None are 
precluded by distance from attending school, and if any parents are 
so poor as not to be able to pay for the education of their children, 
the school fees are paid for them. It is not wonderful, therefore, 
that there should be no children betwixt six and fifteen years of age 
who cannot read or write. Above that age, there are several who 
cannot write, but very few who cannot read. 

But though much has, of late, been done and written to promote 
education, it does not appear that the schools in this neighbour- 
hood at least are actually more thriving than they were a century 



150 



HADDINGTONSHIRE 



ago. From the parish record, it appears that the schools of Or- 
miston and Paiston were both in a flourishing state about the be- 
ginning of the last century; that great attention was paid to the in- 
5truction of the young; and great care taken that parents should 
have their children educated. From the record, it also appears that, 
in 1683, there was a library belonging to the parochial school, con- 
sisting of 60 books in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, as well as Eng- 
lish. It was then taught by Mr James Grierson, who was after- 
wards ejected from his office. About that time, Principal Carstairs 
received his education in the house of Mr Sinclair, then minister 
of the parish. 

Libraries. — 'For some years the parish has been supplied with 
itinerating libraries from Haddington. One is stationed at Ormis- 
ton, another at Paiston. They continue in their stations two years. 
They are then returned, and new ones are sent in their places. The 
great advantage of these libraries has hitherto been, that the books 
are lent out gratis, and the libraries are frequently shifted. A re- 
gulation, however, has just been miade, that, during the first year of 
their station, payment shall be taken for the reading of the books. 
This circumstance has produced a desire among some of the people 
to have a parochial subscription library, which, if once begun and 
well supported, may become in a few years a great acquisition to 
the place. 

There is a library belonging to the Friendly Association or Rogue 
Money Club, instituted for the protection of property, — which is kept 
in the school-house under the charge of the master. This society 
originated in 1784, with some respectable persons residing in Or- 
miston and the vicinity, who formed themselves into a society for 
the purpose of preventing depredations and disturbances, and pro- 
moting the police and good order of the place. The Earl and 
Countess- of Hopetoun were among the original subscribers. It 
has, however, very much degenerated from what it originally was, 
and is confined in its operations to the carrying on of prosecutions 
against those who have committed depredations upon the property 
of the members. A part of the funds has been laid out in the purchase 
of books, and in 1817 a portion of the subscription money was set 
apart for that purpose alone. The library now consists of about 
100 volumes, which are lent out to the subscribers. 

Savings Bank— An attempt was made eighteen years ago o 
establish a savings bank in the parish. Every thing was arranged 



OllMISTON. 



151 



upon the most favourable terms for receiving the httle sums which 
the poor were able to spare for it. But a prejudice was excited 
against it, and it did not succeed. ,i .  , 

Poor —The average number of persons upon the roll is 15, who 
receive upon an average about Is. 9d. a- week each. Some require 
to be supported entirely, others require only a small assistance. 
But besides those who are permanently upon the roll, aid is occa- 
sionally given to some who are not paupers, but from distress or mis- 
fortunes are reduced to temporary want. 

The fund for the support of the poor arises from collections at 
the church, mortcloths, assessments, and occasional donations. 
The annual collections at church amount to from L. 10 to L. 12 a 
year; the mortcloths to L. 3 ; the assessment is generally L. 60, and 
sometimes L. 80. The first assessment was laid on in 1757. For 
several years after, it was resorted to only occasionally. But since 
the beginning of the present century, it has been regularly im- 
posed every half year: and about 1810 it rose so high as L. 100 
a-year. Previous to 1813 there were funds belonging to the 
poor amounting to L. 180. This money was lodged with the 
Earl of Hopetoun upon two bonds, at an interest of L. 5 per 
cent. At that time, James Earl of Hopetoun, being in a very poor 
state of health, and the estate at his death going to thfi heir of en- 
tail, who was different from the heir of line,— his trustees refused to 
allow any more assessments till the poors' money in the Earl's 
hands was all exhausted. The kirk-session was thus obliged to 
expend the whole stock belonging to the poor, which amounted to 
L. 9 a year. There is also a house in Ormiston burdened with 
an annual feu-duty of L. 4, 9s. for the benefit of the poor. From 
these sources, arise the regular supplies for the support of the poor. 
But besides the regular supplies, there has been for several years 
an extraordinary collection in the course of the winter for supply- 
ing needy families with coals and meal and other necessaries. The 
poor also obtain every year from an institution at Haddington a 
supply of flannel clothing. The Earl and Countess of Hopetoun 
are subscribers to this institution, and have granted permission to 
the minister of Ormiston to draw from it upon their joint subscrip- 
tions such flannel clothing as shall be found needful for the poor 
in the course of the winter. In addition to all which, the Dowager 
Lady Hopetoun is in the constant practice of giving occasional 
chanty, and contributing whatever is necessary in cases of distress. 

The poor are not insensible to the benefactions they receive.

The allowance given them is indeed scanty, but they know it can- 
not be otherwise ; and when not treated with undue rigour they 
learn to submit to it without murmuring. The feeling of delicacy, 
however, in receiving parochial aid, that so long subsisted in this 
country, is now almost extinguished. The labouring classes are 
not unwilling to receive parochial aid whenever they can obtain it ; 
and it sometimes happens that even respectable tradesmen are not 
ashamed to have their aged parents put upon the poors' roll. They 
are in general careless in laying up for future want, and when dis- 
tress comes they naturally fall a burden upon the parish. 

The common practice among the labouring classes of living up 
to their incomes promotes pauperism. The evil in this country has 
already grown to a considerable magnitude ; and nothing but the 
strictest economy and care in the management of the funds can pre- 
vent it from increasing. In former times, the people were regular 
in contributing to the collections at church, and thus provid- 
ed a fund for the support of their indigent brethren. They never 
thought of attending divine service without carrying their offering 
along with them. And in many parts of the country this practice 
still exists, and no assessments are required. But in this district, 
a great part of the congregation give nothing, and the collections 
in general are miserably small. About a century back too there were 
fewer upon the poors' roll, and these were better supported than 
they are now. The industrious poor are better fed, and better 
clothed, and have better wages than formerly; but they are less 
economical and less provident, and consequently more frequently 
exposed to privations and want. 

Alehouses. — In this parish, small as it is, there are no less than 
seven houses which have obtained a license to sell ardent spirits. 
There is only one public-house where stabling can be obtained, 
and that of an inferior description. Were there one good inn with 
proper accommodation for horses, it might be of great benefit to 
the place. It might diminish the number of tippling-houses, and 
by its superior accommodation, contribute to the prosperity of the 
village. At present, the small public-houses are certainly unfavour- 
able to morals. But the evil of tippling does not proceed altoge- 
ther from licensed houses. In private ones, tippling is carried on 
to a great extent. The inmates go to the shop and bring in what- 
ever quantity of spirits is wanted, at the joint expense of those who 
are present ; and in this way disorders and abuses frequently take

place, of all which, females and young children are witnesses and 
partakers. 

Piiel — Coal is the only fuel made use of in the parish. The 
inhabitants in the neighbourhood of Ormiston Hall are supplied 
from a pit wrought by the proprietor. Those in the village and 
vicinity obtain their chief supply from pits about a mile and a-half 
to the north, in the parish of Tranent, The price of a cart of coals 
of 12 cwt. is from 4s. to 4s. 6d. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was published, the public road 
running through the parish, and also the private roads, have been 
very much improved. This circumstance, with a more liberal sup- 
ply of manure collected from different quarters, has produced a 
proportional improvement in the agriculture. At that time, the 
village was in a more thriving state on account of some public 
works carried on in the place. All these have been given up for 
a number of years, and there is a great want of employment for the 
labouring poor, especially in winter, when many are thrown com- 
pletely idle, and reduced to great straits. On such occasions, 
however, the family of Hopetoun has never been backward to ap- 
ply a remedy for an evil which, in the present state of society, can 
hardly be prevented.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN THOMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.—Tii ancient name of the parish was St Bothans or St 
Bathans, — the name of a saint who, if we may judge by the vestiges 
of him which still remain in various parts of the country, was 
once held in high and general estimation. The change of the 
name from St Bathans to Tester, seems to have been made soon 
after the Reformation, which, among many other good results, has 

" Abbt-y St Bathans, and several villages in Ireland.

destroyed the popular reverence for pseudo-saints. This change, 
however, as appears from the Presbytery records, was not general- 
ly adopted till about the year 1668. Yester is the ancient name 
of the Marquis of Tweeddale's estate, which hes chiefly within the 
parish. The name appears to be of Cambro-British origin. In 
that language, the word Ystrad or Yestred signifies a strath or 
vale. This name, afterwards corrupted to Yester, is very expres- 
sive of the local aspect of the parish, which forms a strath on the 
banks of a rivulet called Gifford-water, a tributary of the Tyne. 
The antiquity of the present name is shewn by the following cir- 
cumstance, that Hugh de Gifford to whom William the Lion 
granted the baronial domains of Yestred or Yester in the twelfth 
century " gave to the monks of Melros a toft in his village of 
Yestred." The parish is popularly called Giff'ord, from a village 

in it of that name. 

Extent and Boundaries.— T\\q parish is about 6 miles long from 
east to west, and about 5 in breadth, including an extent of 2 miles 
in the Lammermoors. It contains 7080 Scots acres, or nearly 14 
square miles. Its form is nearly that of an oblong square, bounded 
by the parishes of Garvald, Haddington, Bolton, Humbie, and 
Lauder. 

Topographical Appearances.— The Lammermoor hills run along 
the south side of the parish. They are covered with heath, and 
afford good pasture for sheep. The highest of these is Lammer- 
laio, which is situated in Yester parish. Its height above the le- 
vel of the sea is about 1700 feet. Near the summit of Lammer- 
law, is an excellent spring of water ; temperature in August 1834 
42° and scarcely at all different in winter. Various small streams 
descending from these hills, and uniting about a mile from then- 
base form the Gilford Water f which flows through the strath or 
Ystrad already mentioned. This strath is one of peculiar beauty. 
Although it is 400 feet above the level of the sea, it is highly cul- 
tivated and richly wooded. In the centre or lower part of it, stands 
the village of Gifford, around which extends a circular elevated 
rido-e of fertile land at the distance of about a mile and a-half, 
whtch slopes gently toward the lower part, and aff-ords agood shelter 
from the cold east winds.

Soil, -c. — The greater portion of the county abounds in hme- 
stone and marl. At Kidlaw, in the south-western corner of this 
parish, there is a lime quarry ; but, owing to its distance from 
coal, the working of it is rather expensive. There is no stone for 
building in the parish, no coal, nor gravel, except what is taken 
from the bed of the river. Formerly there were quarries of hard 
red freestone of excellent quality at Barra, which is two miles 
east from Gifford ; but they have not been wrought for many 
vears. The soil of this parish, in common with that of East Lo- 
thian generally, furnishes a striking instance of the great benefit 
which results from well directed industry. It is by no means so 
highly favoured by nature as many other districts which have been 
less- improved. It presents the aspect of an inclined plain, de- 
scending northward from Lammermoor towards the sea, and may 
therefore be considered as in some measure averted from the 
sun's rays, and exposed to the chilling northern blasts. The 
soil, too, is generally of that kind in which clay greatly predo- 
minates, although in several parishes on the sea coast, and in 
some of the higher parts of this parish at Long Yester and Long 
Newton a light loam is sometimes met with. A clay bottom, how- 
ever, forms the principal characteristic of the soil, which is about 
four-fifths clay, and one-fifth light and gravelly; but a skilful 
agriculture has in a great measure overcome these disadvantages, 
and rendered the soil very productive. It ought to be remarked, 
however, that, notwithstanding the northerly exposure of this pa- 
rish, the climate is on the whole favourable to the growth of corn ; 
and it has been very much improved of late by draining. 

Climate. — As might be expected from our proximity to the Lam- 
mermoors, a greater quantity of rain probably falls in this parish 
than in almost any other in the county. But the heavy falls of rain 
brought from the Atlantic Ocean by the westerly winds, and which 
so frequently deluge the West of Scotland, are little known here. 
The greater part of the clouds brought from the west are attracted 
and broken by the high grounds between Clydesdale and West Lo- 
thian. The few that escape this attraction are broken and divided 
by the Pentland hills. One part of these proceeds northward by 
Arthur's Seat, and is wasted in the Frith of Forth ; and another 
is attracted by the Moorfoot hills, and proceeds along that range 
by Soutra hill and Lammermoor. Some of these clouds, however, 
from their height, occasionally escape both attractions, and travel 
eastward by Dalkeith towards the vale of Tyne and the higher 



15G 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



districts of this parish. But from this course they are generally 
diverted by the Garleton-hills and Traprene Law ; and then they 
take either a southerly direction towards the hills of Lammermoor, 
or a northerly direction by North Berwick Law to the Frith of 
Forth. Such is the general course of the western clouds about 
the beginning of spring ; and as the season advances, the quantity 
of rain from the west is gradually lessened ; so that, during the 
summer and autumn, a west wind is a tolerable security for dry 
weather. An instance of this occurs at the moment of writing this 
account. In the forenoon and afternoon of this day, an unusually 
large quantity of rain fell, the wind blowing with great violence 
from the south and south-east; but towards evening, the wind has 
veered round to the west; and at present, the sky, which but 
lately was darkened with clouds and mist, is clear and serene. 

During winter, the wind in every point from the west round by 
the north to the east occasionally brings snow or rain ; but snow 
seldom remains long on the ground. - For some years back, little 
snow has fallen in this district ; and it very seldom happens that 
we have more than a week of what is called close weather. 

The spring in this part of the country is generally dry and cold, 
especially when the wind blows from the east. The cold, how- 
ever, is by no means so intense as in many parishes in the immediate 
neighbourhood of this, — which isowinginagreat measure to the cir- 
cular elevated ridge that surrounds the strath of Yester. Occasionally 
in spring, there are heavy showers of hail or rain from the north- 
east. During the whole of May, the winds generally blow from some 
point to the north, with a bright sun, and a dry keen penetrating 
air, which renders it a trying period to invalids. Notwithstanding 
this, however, the situation of the parish is remarkably healthy, the 
air pure and invigorating, the climate generally mild, and " no par- 
ticular distemper is prevalent." At this period, the husbandman 
endeavours to have his fallow, especially on strong land, lying un- 
der a cross furrow and in large clods, which are dried so thorough- 
ly by the east winds, that most of the rooted weeds enclosed in 
them are withered and destroyed. 

The weather seldom sets in steadily mild before the end of June. 
It is a proverbial expression, that the crops upon the clay and the 
strong land do not often begin to "mend until the nights are turn- 
ed," that is, till the summer heats commence. 

In summer and the beginning of autumn, the only rainy points 
are the south and east. Generally the wind sets in from these 



YESTER. 



157 



points at the change and full moon ; and as in the case above- 
mentioned brings from ten to eighteen hours of contmued ram. 
The latitude being so high as 56° renders the climate, as might 
be expected, very changeable. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Notices.— The names of places, rivers, and habitations 
in this parish and the neighbourhood, show that it was inhabited in 
ancient times by the great tribe of British Ottadini. Thus Gar- 
vald or Garw-ald signifies, in the Cambro-British language, the 
rough rivulet ; Barra from Bar, a height, Ra' a fortlet Tester or 
Ystrad, a strath. No traces of the Romans now exist in this pa- 
rish, although it is well known that they subdued the Celtic in- 
habitants of the district. This appears from the remains of Ro- 
man encampments discovered in the neighbourhood. Many ves- 
tio-es of the Anglo-Saxons remain in the names of places, such as 
Lea, Laio, Hope, Lammermoor, &amp;c. This district was for a con- 
siderable period under the dominion of the English; and in 1020 
it was ceded by them to the Scottish king.  

In the reign of David I., Hugh de GifFord, an English gentle- 
man, settled in East Lothian, and obtained extensive estates there. 
He was succeeded by a son of the same name, who rose to emi- 
nence under William the Lion, and obtained from that monarch 
the additional territory of Yester. The celebrated castle of Yes- 

ter, celebrated on account of the Hobgoblin Hall,\ — was at that 

time, and long afterwards, the family residence. Hugh de Gif- 
ford was of sufficient importance to have his own sheriff, according 
to the practice of feudal times. One of his descendants, John 
de Gifford, who lived in the time of Robert Bruce, obtained by 
marriage the lands of Morham. In 1418, the male heirs of this 
ancient family having failed, the extensive domains of the Giffords 
were inherited by four daughters,— the eldest of whom, Johanna, 
having obtained the estate of Yester, transferred it to her hus- 
band. Sir William Hay of Locherwart. Thus arose the family of 
Yester and Locherwart, who obtained the title of Lord Hay of 
Yester in 1488, that of Earl of Tweeddale in 1646, and that of 
Marquis of Tweeddale in 1694. In allusion to the circumstance 
above-mentioned, that a great part of the fortune of this family

sions of the colonizing |eople."

was acquired by marriage, a son of the first Marquis, Lord Charles, 
made the following verses : — 

Aulam alii jactent, felix Domus Yestria nube, 
Nam quJE sors aliis, dat Venus alma tibi. 

Various accounts have been given of the origin of this ancient 
family. Buchanan  says that the Hays are descended from the 
hero of the battle of Loncarty, whose story is well known. The 
Scots, having been put to flight by the Danes, were met by Hay 
and his sons, who were ploughing in an adjoining field. Armed 
with ploughshares, they forced their panic-stricken countrymen to 
turn back on their invaders. The consequence was that the Danes 
experienced a signal defeat ; and soon afterwards. Hay, for his bravery 
and patriotism, was raised to the rank of nobility, and obtained a 
large estate in the Carse of Gowry, " quem Buchanan adds ad- 
huc eorum posteri tenent." This Hay, it is universally acknowled- 
ged, was the ancestor of the families of Errol and Kinnoul ; and 
many hold also that he was the ancestor of the family of Tweed- 
dale. Others again affirm that the ancestry of this family was of 
Norman descent, and settled in Scotland about the year 1200, 
having previously come from Normandy with William the Con- 
queror. Let antiquarians decide the question as they best can. 

Eminent Men. — John Knox, the Father of the Scottish Refor- 
mation, was born in the village of jifford, in the year 1505. The 
place of his nativity, indeed, has been questioned ; some maintain- 
ing that he was born at Giff"ord-gate, one of the suburbs of Had- 
dington. But it is easy to show that this opinion is not well found- 
ed. -|- 

" Rerum Scoticarum Historia, in vita Kennethi Tertii, anno 980. 

■- We shall shortly state the evidence in favour of both opinions, that the reader 
may decide for himself : That Knox was born at the village of Gifford, in this pa- 
rish, is proved not only by the circumstance that this has long been the prevailing 
opinion, but also by the testimony of Bczii, his contemporary and friend. He calls hiin 
" Joannes Cnoxus, Scotus, Glffvrdiensis," Imagines illustriura virorum, Ee. iij. 
an. 1580, evidently meaning that he was a native of Giftbrd. If he had been a na- 
tive of one of the suburbs of Haddington, would not Beza have called him Haddht- 
toniensis « Spotswood llistory,p. 265, edit. 1677, says, that "he was born in Gifford, 
within Lothian," which statement is confirmed by David Buchanan, Crawfurd, and 
Wodrow, Buchanan's Memoir of Knox, prefixed to the edition of his liistory, pub- 
lished 1644; Crawfurd's Life of Knox; Wodrow's MS. Collections respecting the 
Scottish Reformers, in Bibl. Coll. Glas. On the other hand, Archibald Hamilton 
De Confusione Calvinianae Sectae apud Scotos Dialogus, fol. 64, a. Par. 1577. 
says that he was born in Haddington, — and another writer, that he was lorn piope 
Haddintonam." Lainga;us De vita, et moribus, &amp;c. fol. J13, b. I'ar. I.i81, 
Hamilton's testimony possesses little weight. M'Cric observes of liim, that " he has 
retailed a number of gross falsehoods in his work," and thougli it may be said, that 
he was under no temptation to tell a lie in a matter of lact, yet it is not likely that 
a man of his character would either give himself much trouble to ascertain the truth 
inthis case, or be very scrupulous in adhering to it. The other writer, who says that

The Rev. John Witherspoon, D. D., LL. D., President of the 
College of New Jersey, in America, was born in the manse of Yes- 
ter on the 5th of February 1723. The following notice, though 
rather lengthened, of this distinguished man, it is hoped, may 
not be unacceptable. He was lineally descended from J ohn Knox, 
and was connected with a family of property in the east of Scot- 
land. His father, who was ordained minister of Yester in March 
17-20, was eminent for his piety, learning, and fidelity as a mi- 
nister of the gospel. Young Witherspoon was sent at a very early 
age to the public school at Haddington, where he distinguished 
himself by his assiduity and proficiency. He was sent, at the age 
of fourteen, to the University of Edinburgh, where he attracted the 
particular notice of the professors by his talents and acquirements. 
At the age of twenty-one he was licensed to preach the gospel ; 
and soon after he was invited to become assistant and successor to 
his father in the parish of Yester ;— but he chose rather to accept 
a call from the parish of Beith, where he was ordained with the 
universal consent of the people. A short time afterwards, he 
was called to Paisley, where he laboured in the work of the Lord 
with universal acceptance and great success. During his resi- 
dence in Paisley he was invited to remove to Dublin, to Rotter- 
dam, and Dundee ; but he refused. He was also requested by the 
Trustees of the College of New Jersey to accept the office of Pre- 
sident. He at first declined the offer; but on a second applica- 
tion he complied with it. The finances of the college which was 
founded and chiefly supported by private liberahty, were in alow 
and declining condition when Dr Witherspoon arrived in Ame- 
rica ; but by his talents, reputation, and exertions, the college was 
soon raised to a state of great prosperity. Formerly the acade- 
mical course had been too superficial, and too much tinctured with 
the dry and unedifying forms of the schoolmen ; but Dr Wither- 
spoon introduced all the modern improvements of Europe, and in- 
corporated with the course of instruction a sound and rational me- 
taphysics, equally removed from the doctrines of fatality and con- 

Knox was born near Haddington, is called by M'Crie in the first edition of his 
work, " another of the same kidney" with Hamilton, and therefore entitled to no cre- 
dit. Few persons, therefore, will be disposed to differ from the late distinguished 
biographer of Knox, when he says, " I am inclined to prefer the opinion of the 
oldest and most credible writers, that he was born in the village of Gifford." —

tingency. Under his auspices, most of the American clergy were 
educated ; and the United States owe to him many of their most 
distinguished patriots and legislators, — above thirty of his pupils 
having become members of Congress. In this situation Dr Wi- 
therspoon continued with increasing success till the beginning of 
the American war, — an event which suspended his functions, and 
dispersed the college. He then appeared in a new character. 
The citizens of New Jersey elected him as one of the most suit- 
able delegates whom they could send to that convention which 
formed their republican constitution; where he distinguished him- 
self as much in the capacity of a civilian as he had already done 
in those of a divine and philosopher. In 1776, he was sent as re- 
presentative of New Jersey to the Congress of the United States. 
He continued a member of that body seven years, and distinguished 
himself by his firmness, enlarged views, and profound wisdom. Nor 
did he forget, amid the bustle of political life, his ministerial cha- 
racter. After peace was restored, the college was reassembled, and 
continued to flourish under the immediate care of a vice-president; 
but Dr Witherspoon did not neglect to use every means for its im- 
provement. Dr Witherspoon was well prepared for the part he per- 
iformed in the civil and ecclesiastical assemblies of America, by the 
experience he had acquired before leaving Scotland, as leader of the 
Orthodox party in the church, chiefly upon the great question of 
patronage, which was then the subject of discussion. For more 
than two years previous to his death, he was deprived of sight ; but 
he bore this and all his sufferings with exemplary resignation and 
cheerfulness. During his blindness, he was frequently in the pul- 
pit, and spoke with his usual accuracy and power. He died on the 
15th of November 1794, after a hfe of great activity, of true piety, 
and of eminent usefulness. His writings are well known. They 
display extensive learning, a profound knowledge of Scripture, and 
an intimate acquaintance with the human heart. 

This parish gave birth also to Dr Charles Nisbet, President of 
the College of Carlisle in America. He was born in March 1728 
at Long Yester, where his father held the office of schoolmaster. 
After receiving hcense, he was ordained minister of Montrose ; 
from which place he was induced to remove by the off"er of a Pre- 
sidency in America. Though a man of distinguished attainments, 
he seems to have enjoyed little comfort, and less worldly prosperity 
in 'Hheland of liberty." Although the names « College" and «Pre-

sideiit" sounded well, yet he found that his situation was neither 
moi-e profitable nor more respectable than that which his worthy 
father had held before him. On one occasion, he wrote to his 
friends, that " America was certainly a ' land of promise ;' for it 
was all promise and no performance." 

We cannot refrain from mentioning another eminent man who 
was long minister of this parish — the Rev. James Innes, whose me- 
mory is still respectfully and affectionately cherished. He was or- 
dained in the year 1760, and died in 1821; having been minister 
of Yester during the long period of sixty-one years. As he left no 
writings behind him, we cannot now form a sufficiently correct 
estimate of his powers. Although his talents were not of the 
highest order, yet he was remarkably distinguished by his powerful 
appeals to the conscience, his unbending integrity, and his unwea- 
ried diligence in his Master's work. 

This parish claims a remote connection with Sir Isaac Newton, 
who is said to have been a branch of the family of Newton of New - 
tonhall in this parish.

III. — Population. 
In the last Statistical Account of the parish, we are inform- 
ed that the population was much greater about a hundred years 
before than at that time. The decrease is attributed " to the 
demolition of cottages, and the union of several small farms into 
one." 

In 1755, the population was 1091

1831, - 1019 viz. 494 males, and 523 females. 



The population at present 1835 is about 1050. The number 
of the population may perhaps have been considerably affected by 
the improvements in manufactures. Formerly, there were about 
twenty weavers in the village of Giflford ; but owing to the improve- 
ments in machinery, there are at present not more than two or three; 
and even these have not constant employment in this branch of

Generally speaking, the people are cleanly in their habits, in- 
dustrious, frugal, contented, and intelligent. Many of them are 
engaged in out-of-door work, of which they have usually enough 
to keep them well employed, as the proprietors and tenants wisely 
give a preference in this respect to natives of the parish, and ma- 
nifest a becoming anxiety to discourage the entrance of vagrants 
from other parts of the country. 

IV. — Industry. 
The parish contains 8928 acres standard imperial measure. 
The number of acres which have been cultivated is 5400. The 
number in hill pasture is '2522 ; of which 300 might be reclaimed— 
a considerable proportion having been under the plough in the reign 
of Queen Anne. The number of acres in a state of undivided com- 
mon is 60 ; and there are 946 acres in plantation. The trees are 
of various sorts ; beech, oak, ash, elm, lime, &amp;c. They are well 
managed. Those on the grounds of Yester are remarkably fine 
trees. The following names of places in this parish shew that 
there were formerly large forests here: — Woodhead, Droadioood- 
side, Echjside the Oak-wood-side, Pi/otshaw,f &amp;c. 

Rent of Land. — Rent varies from 10s. to L. 2, 10s. per acre. 
The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 10s. per acre. Summer 
and winter-keep per ox or cow, L. 6, turnips or hay included ; ditto 

 The following are the heritors of the parish :— The Marquis of Twceddale, Ri- 
fh-ird Hav Newton, Esq. of Newtonhall, Jolm Hay Mackenzie, Esq. of Newhall, 
and Thomas Crighton, Esq. of Skedsbush. The Marquis of Twccddale is the prm- 
cipal heritor and patron of the church.

two-year old, L. 4, 10s. ditto ; ditto one-year old, L. 3, ditto. For a 
full-oTown sheep in field pasture, L. 1, including turnips ; ditto on 
hill pasture, 6s. per annum. These of course vary considerably 
with the price of stock and wool. 

This parish is rated in the county cess-books as follows : The 
estate of Yester, L. 2911, lis. 8d.; Newtonhall, L. 1141, 2s. 4d. ; 
Newhall, L. 468; Skedsbush, L. Ill, 9s. 4d.; total L.4632, 3s. 4d. 
The real rental of the parish at the time of drawing up the last 
Statistical Account was L. 2000 Sterling. At present it is L. 8000 
per annum, having increased about L. 2000 within the last twenty 
years. This increase, however, is in a great measure to be attri- 
buted to the death of many of the old liferenters during that period, 
who held their farms at a very low rent. 

Live stock. — The common breeds of sheep in this parish are 
the Leicester and Cheviot; and also a hardy thriving breed be- 
tween a Leicester tup and a Cheviot ewe. The total number of 
sheep is 4000 ; and 900 lambs are bred annually. Great atten- 
tion has been paid to their improvement, especially by the Mar- 
quis of Tweeddale. The cattle are of various sorts, from the fine 
short-horned English breed down to the native of the Highlands 
and the Shetland islands. The total number of cattle in the pa- 
rish is 360 ; and 80 calves are bred annually. 

Husbandry. — The state of husbandry has been much improved 
in this parish within the last ten years. At present, it is perhaps as 
perfect here as in any part of the country. Little wheat is grown 
in this parish, although it is of good quality. Barley, oats, and tur- 
nips are the principal crops. John Marquis of Tweeddale and Sir 
George Suttie, were the earliest and most successful in practising 
the turnip husbandry. This was about a hundred years ago. Bone 
dust has of late been very generally used instead of manure, for 
raising turnips, and its effects have been astonishing. Draining also 
has been carried on generally and successfully throughout the pa- 
rish. Lately, the Marquis of Tweeddale has erected a mill for 
working the clay, and has invented a very ingenious machine for 
forming the tiles, which will greatly facilitate the operation of tile- 
draining. A considerable quantity of waste land has lately been 
reclaimed at the foot of the Lammermoors, on the farms especially 
of Long Yester and Long Newton ; and the crops raised will soon 
repay the expense of cultivation. The general duration of leases 
in this parish is nineteen years. The state of l"arm-buildings and en-

closures is good. Many of the farm-houses are new, and as com- 
modious as the mansion-houses of many Highland lairds. As far 
as I am aware, every encouragement is given to improvement by 
the proprietors. 

Produce. — The gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish, 
as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, 8,644 bolls of six imperial bushels, 
Potatoes, . 1,800 bolls at 6s. per boll of 40 stones, 
Turnips, . 10,000 tons at 4s. per ton. 
Clover-hay, 40,000 stones at 7d. per stone, 
Meadow -hay, 3,000 stones at 4d. 
Pasture for" . 360 cows at L. 5, 
Pasture for . 3,000 sheep at 6s. for 1000 at 18s. 
Young cattle, liorses, and lambs bred, wool, &amp;c. say 

Total amount of raw produce, L. 18,814 li 4 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets. — There are no wegkly markets held in the parish ; but 
there are three trysts or fairs held annually, which will be after- 
v/ards mentioned. The distance from Gilford to Haddington, 
where a market is held every Friday, is four miles. This town, it 
is well known, affords to the surrounding country a good market for 
all kinds of agricultural produce. The Haddington corn-market 
is the greatest in Scotland, owing probably in some measure to its 
being entirely a ready money market. 

Means of Communication. — The road to Haddington, though 
not very level, is kept, as all the other roads are, in good re- 
pair. It might, however, be much improved at little expense by 
cuttino- and raising. In this parish there are about three miles of 
turnpike roads and thirteen of parish roads. The road from Gif- 
ford to Edinburgh, which is distant about nineteen miles, is in a 
good state of repair. Since the year 1750, when an act of Parlia- 
ment empowered commissioners to repair the post-road from Dun- 
rlas Bridge to Ravenshaugh Bridge, the cross roads of this parish 
and county have been greatly improved. Beford that time the 
roads were nearly impassable. At present, a one-horse coach tra- 
vels three times a-week between Edinburgh and Gifford ; leaving 
Gifford on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 7 a. m., and 
returning on the other days. It passes through Saltoun and Tra- 
nent. It leaves No. 2, Princes Street, Edinburgh, at a quarter to 
four afternoon, and performs the journey in about two hours and 
a-half. There is a penny post-office in the village of Gilford. Till

of late, the post -man travelled between Gifford and Haddington 
which is the post-town twice a-day; — bringing letters from the 
north mail in the morning, and from the south mail in the after- 
noon. But, this summer, he has travelled only once a-day ; the 
reason of which probably is, that this is an " age of economy and 
retrenchment." Possibly, however, if the sixpence a-day which 
w as lately taken off his small wages were restored, he might be able 
once more to afford the Gifford people the benefit of a double 
journey jyer diem. There are two carriers, each of whom travels 
between Gifford and Edinburgh every week ; leaving Gifford on 
Tuesdays and Fridays, and Edinburgh on Wednesdays and Satur- 
days. The bridges and fences throughout this parish are kept 
generally in the best condition. 

Villages. — There are three villages in the parish, viz. Gifford, 
Long Yester, and Long Newton. The last two, which are situ- 
ated at the foot of the Lammermoors, are inconsiderable. The 
village of Gifford is generally admired for the beauty of its situa - 
tion, and the regularity of its buildings. It is situated on the east 
bank of Gifford-water. Nearly all the houses in the two princi- 
pal streets are of two stories, and possess an air of great comfort. 
One of these streets runs along part of the avenue leading to Yes- 
ter House : and at the northern extremity stands the school and 
dwelling-house, surmounted by a small spire. The church is si- 
tuated at the extremity of the other street. About a third part of 
the houses in Gifford is the Marquis of Tweeddale's property, — the 
rest are held of him in feu or fief. The amount of feu-duty paid an- 
nually to the Marquis by the feuars of whom there are about forty 
is L. 13, 17s. lid. It may be interesting to mention the tenure 
by which these feus are held. The conditions are, that each feuar 
should " attend the Marquis of Tweeddale the space of two days 
yearly, sufficiently mounted icith horse and arms, upon his own pro- 
per charges and expenses, when he shall be desired to do the sa- 
men :" — also that he should " attend other two days at the Mar- 
quis' expense ;"— should " ride at two fairs yearly in Gifford," and 
" perform a darg or day's work yearly for winning of hay in the 
parks of Yester." The feuars were exempted by the Marquis 
" from all cess, taxations, ministers' stipends, and other public bur- 
thens." They obtained from the superior, long ago, a grant of a 
piece of land near Gifford, called the Common, consisting of 60 
acres, and worth at least L. 100 per annum; 14 acres are at pre-

sent in cultivation, and yield a rent of L. 46. This sum has of 
late been judiciously applied to the purpose of making local im- 
provements, — especially to form a pavement along the streets of 
the village, which will be a great benefit to the place. The rest 
of the Common is in pasture. Each feuar who pays 10s. a year of 
feu-duty has a right to a cow's grass, and all the feuars are allow- 
ed to " cast faill and divot on the common, for upholding and re- 
pairing their houses, in quantities proportionable to their respec- 
tive feu-duties." The feuars' meet every two years to choose two 
baihes and a committee of five, by whom the affairs of the village 
are managed. In ancient times, the Marquis of Tweeddale's factor, 
who held the office of baron bailie and the two baiUes chosen 
by the feuars, met three times a-year at the Cross to settle disputes 
and try delinquents. The existence of this court which was cal- 
led the Birla or Boorlaio Court, and which was discontinued only 
within the last forty years, accounts for the following characteris- 
tic passage in the former Statistical Account : " There is not one 
lawyer or attorney in the whole parish ; and the people make it 
their study to keep their affairs as much out of the hands of such 
men as possible." The Boorlaw Court had a constable to en- 
force their orders, and this functionary still remains in office. 
The punishment usually inflicted by the court for misdemeanours 
was a night's confinement in the Black Hole or the Jougs at the 
Tron. 

Ecclesiastical State. — It has been mentioned that the parish 
church is situated in the village of Gifford, on the north side of 
the parish. This situation, though distant from some famihes, is 
perhaps the most convenient that could have been chosen. About 
one-half of the parishioners those in Gifford are thus in the im- 
mediate neighbourhood of the church ; and of the other half the 
great majority are within two miles, although a few families are 
three miles distant. The church was built in the year 1708. It 
was re-seated and thoroughly repaired about five years ago, which 
has rendered it very comfortable. It affords sufficient accommo- 
dation for the parishioners, having been seated for 560 ; although 
it may accommodate without inconvenience about 600. The sit- 
tings as they ought to be in an Established Church are all free. 

• The jougs jugum, a yoke were pieces of wood fastened round the neck of the 
culprit, and attached to an upright post, whicli still stands in the centre of the vil- 
lii"e, and is used for weighing goods at the fairs. Here the culprit stood ui a sort of

They are allocated by the sheriff to the various heritors accord- 
ing- to their valued rents, by whom they are allotted to their tenants 
and dependents; whilst the session of course possess the right of 
allotting the communion table seats. 

The present manse was built in 1824. It is commodious and 
well finished ; and is one of the best in the country. The glebe 
contains about 10 acres; and is let for L. 25 a year. The stipend 
amounts on an average to about L. 200, besides the allowance 
for communion elements. 

There are no Dissenting or Seceding chapels in the parish. 
The great body of the people have long been firmly attached to 
the Established Church ; and their love has not waxed cold. There 
are about six Seceders and two or three Episcopalians in the pa- 
rish ; but many of the former, being advanced in years, and there- 
fore unable to travel to Haddington, generally attend the parish 
church. The younger branches of their families, having been 
trained under the faithful ministrations of former ministers, have 
in most cases joined the church. The Episcopalians attend the 
Established Church regularly. The average attendance is nearly 
600, which is more than half of the population; but this is explain- 
ed by the fact, that several families in neighbouring parishes are 
nearer, by several miles, the church of Yester than their own parish 
churches. The number of communicants at the summer sacra- 
ment is on an average about 430; at the winter sacrament, 400. 
The number of male heads of families in communion with the 
church is 135. 

An Auxiliary Bible Society existed and flourished in the parish 
for many years. It consisted exclusively of members of the church, 
although Dissenters were not prohibited from giving their contri- 
butions. The Society sent about L.25 annually to the East Lo- 
thian Bible Society; but this was discontinued, and the money di- 
rected to other religious purposes, four years ago ; — about the time 
when our Seceding brethren made the discovery that the Church 
of Scotland is the " Mother of abominations," and raised the war- 
cry of extermination against the " paid servants of the devil." 
This questionable discovery has certainly had no good influence 
on the operations of religious societies. A collection, amount- 
nig to L. 62, was made last spring, for the church extension fund. 
On the first Sabbath of the year, a collection is made to supply 
the poor with coals. On an average it amounts to L. 7 ; and the

Icnantry and others kindly undertake to drive the coals, free of 
expense. 

In former times, the parish of Yester was not so extensive as it 
now is. It was increased in 1702, by the annexation of part of the 
parishes of Barra and Bolton ; the other part of the parish of Barra 
was annexed to Garvald. The old church of St Bathans stands 
near Yester House, about a mile from the present church. It is 
now used as a burying-place for the family of Yester and their 
connections. It is a small but very handsome building, of red 
sandstone, and has evidently been renewed at different periods. 
The nave bears the date of 1635 ; but the transept is more an- 
cient, probably by 200 years. The pulpit, which is made of beau- 
tifully carved oak, and said to be 400 years old, was removed from 
the former to the present church, where it still is. 

From the ancient Taxatio, it appears that the church of St Bo- 
thans was not of great value : being rated only at thirty merks. 
In 1421, Sir William Hay of Yester, converted this church into 
a collegiate form — consisting of a provost, six prebendaries, and 
two singing boys, who enjoyed the lands, tithes, and other eccle- 
siastical revenues of the parish, down to the period of the Refor- 
mation. Alicia Hay, daughter of Sir Thomas Hay of Errol, and 
second wife of Sir William Hay of Yester, granted for the support 
of a chaplain in the collegiate church of Bothans, the lands of 
Blanes within the constabulary of Haddington, — also various rents 
of houses in the town of Haddington, amounting to L. 4, 2s. 6d. 
Sir David Hay, son of Sir William, gave also some additional 
lands for the support of the chaplain; and in 1539, Robert Wa- 
therstone provost of Bothans gave for the same purpose, two 
houses in Haddington, the rents of which amounted to L. 3, 10s. 
8d. ; also two acres of land on the north side of the town. In Ba- 
gimont's Roll, the church of St Bothans is rated at L. 40. After 
the Reformation, the revenue was given in at L. 100 Scots. It 
has been doubted whether the collegiate church of Bothans and 
Yester be the same ; but their identity appears certain.f At 
Duncanlaw, on the east side of Yester parish, there was formerly 

 In the Roll of St Andrcnv's, 1547, tlie PracposUnra di: Boihans is mentioned as 
being situated in the deanery of Dunbar. Ileliq. Divi Andruae. Deiniister informs

-|- The village near the old church was sometimes called Boihans. In 1320, Sir

village of Oothan.

Education. — The means of instruction in this parish are fur- 
nished in sufficient abundance. There are five schools ; three of 
which are parochial and endowed. Of these, one is in the village 
of Gifford ; another in that of Long Yester, and the third in that 
of Long Newton. The two unendowed schools are in the village 
of GifFord : one of these is under the care of a female, who teaches 
sewing. In the schools at Long Yester and Long Newton, as 

 Robert III. gave to the chapel of St Nicholas at Duncanlaw, some lands which 
had belonged to John Straton. Roberts. Index, 145. 

I have not been able to discover the names of the ministers who had the spiritual 
oversight of this parish from the Reformation till the year 1653. On the subject of 
their deeds and virtues, history is silent. A short account of those ministers 
whose names are known may not be uninteresting, as it tends to throw some light 
on the state of the church at different periods. In October 1653, Laurence Charte- 
ris was chosen minister of Bothans ty the session. He seems to have been a man 
of some eminence in his day. It appears from the Presbytery Records, that he was 
Moderator of the Presbytery of Haddington fi-om 1671 till 1676; a circumstance 
which shews, not only that he was held in respect by his brethren, but also that the 
presbytery were beginning at that time to adopt Episcopalian views and practices. 
Accordingly, Mr Charteris was appointed by the BisJtojj of Ediiibnrgh, in January 
1676, to be Professor of Theology in the University, in which situation, however, he 
does not seem to have continued many years. After the Revolution, he was remov- 
ed to be minister of Dirleton, where he died. In August 1681, George Stephen was 
ordained minister of Yester, in consequence of an edict from the Bishop of Edin- 
burgh. He appears, however, to have been a staunch Presbyterian. The following 
reason, highly honourable to his principles and character, is assigned for his removal, 
in the session records: — " January 7, 1682. No sermon, Mr George Stephen, our 
minister having left his charge, heeavsc he woiild not take the test imposed by autho- 
rity, as he was required on Thursday last past." In December 1682, Robert Mel- 
drum, minister of Garvald, was appointed by the Bishop of Edinburgh to be minister 
of Yester. In this situation he remained till December 1699, notwithstanding the 
political and ecclesiastical changes which during his incumbency had taken place in 
the nation. The change from Prelacy to Presbytery at the Revolution does not 
seem to have changed his determination to continue minister of Yester ; and though 
this circumstance might make some regard him as a second " Vicar of Bray," yet he 
appears to have been a faithful minister. The following entry in reference to him is 
made in the session records : — " December 17 1699. No sermon, our minister 
being dead, having faithfuUie in the office of the ministery, served at this church ex- 
actly seventeen years, from the serving of his edict here to the next day after his bu- 
rial." On the 9th of January 1700, the heritors and householders met at the church 
" for the election ofne-o elders ;" — and t\\Qheritors, elders, and householders were ordei- 
cd by the Presbytery to be present on the 3 1st, " for signing a call to a minister to 
this parish." The call was given to a Mr Alexander Anderson : but he does not ap- 
pear to have been ordained, having probably accepted a call to another parish. In 
January 1701, another call was signed to Mr James Craig, who was ordained in 
April, and remained till October 1718; when he was translated to Dunbar. In No- 
vember 1719, " the heritors, elders, and others concerned met to elect one to be their 
minister, and unanimously made choice of Mr James Witherspoon." He was or- 
dained in March 1720, and fulfilled his office with exemplary fidelity. He died in 
August 1759. Mr Javica Imies was ordained minister of this parish in March 1 760, 
and died in February 1821, He was succeeded in December the same year by Da- 
niel Wilkie, now in the New Grayfriars' Edinburgh. Robert Smith now at Old 
Machar's Aberdeen was inducted minister of tliis parish in October 1829. David 
Home now at Corstorihine was ordained in May ISSl ; John Tliomson in April

well as in the unendowed schools, the common branches of read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, and English grammar are taught. In 
addition to these, Latin, Greek, French, geography, and ma- 
thematics are taught in the parish school at Giffbrd. Two or 
three boarders usually reside in the Gifford schoolmaster's house ; 
and he is well qualified to instruct them in the various bran- 
ches of classical education. The fees of one of the unendowed 
schools may amount to L.24 per annum, and of the other to about 
L. 14. 

The following is a statement of the income of the parochial 
schoolmasters: at Gifford, salary, L. 34, 4s. 4d., school-fees, L.40, 
other emoluments, L. 1. 7s. lOd., total income, L. 75, 12s. 2d.; 
— Long Yester, salary, L. 8, lis. Id., school-fees, L. 18, total in- 
come, L. 26, ] Is. Id. ;f — and Long Newton, salary, L. 8, lis. Id., 
school-fees, L. 14, total income, L. 22, lis. Id. The schools and 
dwelling-houses are in good repair, and the teachers have the le- 
gal accommodations. The general expense of education is as fol- 
lows : For teaching to read, 3s. per quarter ; to read and write, 3s. 
6d., and in the parish school, 4s. ; for reading, writing, and arith- 
metic, 4s. 6d., and in the parish school, 5s. ; for teaching these 
branches, together with geography or grammar, 6s. ; and for teach- 
ing the classics, 7s. 6d. 

The schools are conveniently situated for the accommodation 
of the children. None are so distant from school as to be de- 
prived of the means of instruction. The schools are in general 
well attended. The average attendance of children in this parish 
at all the schools is about 220, which is more than one-fifth of the 
population. All the children in the parish above six years of age 
are able to read, and most of them can write. It is to be regret- 
ted, however, that in many cases the children are taken from school 
too soon, in order to assist their parents in their work. Yet the 
people in general seem to be alive to the benefits of education ; 
and it would be reckoned a great reproach to any parent if he ne- 
glected to send his children to school at the proper age. About 
twenty years ago, the sum of L. 100 was mortified by William

Begbie, Esq. of Gifford Vale, to educate poor children. The 
interest, amounting to L. 4, 10s., is appropriated to this pur- 
pose by the kirk-session. The session also, when necessary, 
pay for the education of poor children ; and several members of 
the family of Yester bear the expense of educating between ten 
and twenty children. There are two Sabbath schools in the 
parish. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are at present eighteen regular 
paupers, each of whom receives on an average L. 3 per annum. Be- 
sides these, about eight or ten receive occasional assistance. The 
whole yearly expenditure of the kirk-session is about L. 120. In 
1722, the average of the Sabbath collections was L.2 Scots money 
each day. In 1751, it amounted to 4s. Sterling; in 1792, to 8s. ; 
at present the average collection on Sabbath is L. 1, 3s. ; and the 
annual amount is about L. 60. In 1710, the session received from 
the Laird of Newtonhall the sum of L. 1519, 3s. Scots, which was 
expended in purchasing from the Marquis of Tweeddale thir- 
teen acres of land, subject to a feu-duty of Is. per acre. The rent 
of this tract, which is called the 'precious land," amounts at pre- 
sent to L. 29 ; which sum is also appropriated to the maintenance 
of the poor. In 1798, the Rev. Mr Innes, and his brother, Dr 
Robert Innes, mortified to the kirk-session the sum of L. 200, the 
interest of which is applied to assist the poor in paying their house 
rents. This sum is placed in the hands of Lord Tweeddale, who 
still allov/s L. 10 of interest. It has been mentioned, that on the 
first Sabbath of the year, a collection is made to supply the poor 
with coals, amounting usually to L. 7. All these sums, together 
with what is derived from the use of the mortcloths, &amp;c. may 
amount to about L. 1 10, which is nearly adequate to the supply of 
the poor, and happily renders assessments unnecessary. About 
twenty years ago, during a period of great scarcity, an assessment 
was made to supply the labouring poor. Although necessary at 
the time, it had by no means. a good effect on that feeling of honest 
pride which is characteristic of Scotchmen. At present, however, 
there is no undue anxiety to obtain parochial relief. Many would 
rather submit to the severest hardships than live on the parish. 
The poor are all supported in their own houses, and are supplied 
with medicines from a dispensary /ratis. Many of the poor are 
supplied with soup three times a -week from the Marquis of Tweed- 
dale's kitchen, and with wood for fuel in winter from the grounds 
of Yester.

Fairs. — There are three fairs or trysts held annually in the vil- 
lage of Gilford ; viz. on the last Tuesday of March, the third Tuesday 
of June, and the first Tuesday of October. At these fairs, about 
500 cattle, as many horses, and between 3000 and 4000 sheep are 
usually oflPered for sale. Many purchasers come from a considerable 
distance ; and generally a good deal of business is done. At the 
last-mentioned fair, the Agricultural Society of East Lothian meet 
at Gifford to award premiums for the best pens of sheep of diffe- 
rent kinds. About twenty years ago, leave was obtained to hold a 
tryst on the Monday mornings during harvest for hiring shearers. 
This has of late been a great nuisance to the parish ; as the shearers, 
to the number often of 500, flock to Gifford on Sabbath; and not 
only wait to be hired, but profane the Lord's day by drunken and 
disorderly conduct. A bill, like that of Sir Andrew Agnew, would 
be no small blessing. 

Inns, Alehouses, Sc. — Of these there are seven in the parish. 

Fuel. — All our coal is brought from the parishes of Salton and 
Pencaitland, — a distance of six miles. The price of a cart-load is 
7s. 6d., viz. 4s. for 12 cwt. of coal, and 3s. 6d. for carriage.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN RAMSAY, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural. History. 

Name, Sc. — The parish of Gladsmuir was erected, in 1692, 
by annexations from the contiguous parishes of Haddington, 
Tranent, and Aberlady, and took its name from the place where 
the church is situate. That place was called Gladsmuir, long 
before the parish was formed. In 1650, those portions of the 
parish of Gladsmuir which were taken from Haddington and Aber- 
lady, were set apart with the view of forming a new parish. A 
chapel was built, where divine service was performed; and the 
place where it stood still goes by the name of the Old Kirk. A 

manse was also built, a little to the east of Pension, which still 

bears the name of the Old Manse. But it was not till 1692, that 
the portion of the parish which was taken from Tranent was added 
to the other two portions formerly designed, and the whole erect- 
ed into a separate parish. At that time, Gladsmuir was a rugged 
uncultivated tract of land, lying on both sides of the great London 
road, and probably was so named from its being frequented by 
kites or gleds, as they were commonly called. 

Extent—Boundaries.— The parish extends from the Frith of 
Forth on the north, to the Tyne on the south, a distance of fully 5 
miles; and from Merryhatton on the east to Whinbush on the 
west, a distance of 4 miles. It is bounded on the east, by the 
parish of Haddington; on the west, by the parishes of Tranent 
and Pencaitland; on the south, by the Tyne and Pencaitland; and 
on the north, by the Frith of Forth and the parish of Aberlady. 
On the east, it is intersected by a neck of land belonging to Had- 
dington, separating the barony of Samuelston from the barony of 
Trabroun, and running west nearly as far as Gladsmuir. Other- 
wise,' It is very compact, but of an irregular figure. It contains 
about 10 square miles.

HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



Topographical Appearances.— Yvoxn the Frith on the one side, 
and the Tyne on the other, the land rises gently to a ridge, along 
which the great London road passes ; and on the highest point of 
that ridge, the church is situate. 

The prevailing winds in this parish are west, north and south- 
west. Our heavy rains are from the west. The rains from the 
west, when not very abundant, being carried along the Pentlands, 
are often afterwards attracted by the Lammermuirs on the one 
hand, and the sea on the other ; and thus the district between 
Musselburgh and Dunbar receives perhaps less rain than any 
other district of Scotland. There is sometimes a good deal of rain 
at Edinburgh and westward, when there is none in that tract. 
The climate is naturally good, and it has been much improved by 
the high state of cultivation to which the county has been brought. 

Hydrography.— Frith of Forth bounds the parish, on the 
north, only to the extent of about a mile, the rest of the parish to the 
north being cut off from the sea by intersections of the parishes of 
Aberlady and Tranent. The shore is rocky, containing detached 
masses of rock interspersed by the terminations of strata appearing 
above the bed of the sea at low water. The Tyne, which forms 
the southern boundary of the parish to the extent of about a 
mile and a-half, is here but a small stream, the water of which 
is frequently carried off to supply the mills in its course. There 
is abundance of excellent spring water, at the northern and south- 
ern extremities of the parish ; but in the middle tract, where the 
land is high, and coal has been wrought, it is not so plentiful, and 
some of the wells are very deep. In the midst of the coal-field, 
however, a little to the north of the village of Penston, in a hne 
from east to west, three springs rise to the surface in great abun- 
dance, probably occasioned by a dike running through the coal- 
field in that direction. At Chesterhall, on the property of St Ger- 
mains, about half a century ago, there was a considerable marsh, 
covering sixteen or seventeen acres ; but, by ditching and drain- 
ing it is now completely dried, and converted into excellent land. 
There is not now a marsh in the parish,— though, a century ago, 
there appears to have been several. There are no streams or 
runs of water, except such as are produced and fed by drains from 

the adiacent fields. , . , i 

Geolonyand Mineralogy parish abounds with coal par- 

ticularly the barony of Penston. In the neighbourhood of that 
vl it was wrcight so fir back as the fourteenth century.

and has long furnished the chief supply to the eastern parts of the 
county. It was wrought when Oliver Cromwell was in this coun- 
try, about the middle of the seventeenth century, and drew then 
a rent of L. 400. In 1834, it was found that the field lying to 
the south of the village, of Penston had been very much wrought 
out ; and a new tenant having succeeded to the lease of the farm, 
and also of the coal, a new pit was opened a little to the north of 
the Henmuir, and the coal has been wrought there ever since. But 
as most of the coal has been already wrought in that part of the 
property, borings were made in different places to the north of the 
village of Penston, and a pit was sunk in that quarter about a gun- 
shot to the south of the great road. The operations there were, for 
some time, very much retarded by an influx of water ; but a steam- 
engine was erected, and the water having been carried off, the work 
is now going on briskly, and a great quantity of coal is brought out 
and disposed of. The coal is of an excellent quality. The seam 
is about thirty-two inches thick, while the Pawnwood coal is from 
four to five feet thick. There are now two engines at work, and 
that part of the field is yet unbroken. At the same time, the work 
at the Henmuir is still going on. The coal-grieve at Penston has 
been so good as furnish me with an account of the different stra- 
tifications that were met with in the boring for coal, in August 1834.

upon the side of the road leading from Penston to the London road ; 
but it is not yet finished. We find that in 1812, coal was wrought 
upon the property of Hodges. There was also a brick-work upon 
that property, about fifty years ago ; but the working, both of the 
coal and the brick, has been discontinued. A proposal was made 
lately to set a-going a brick-work there for brick and tile ; but it 
was given up. Coal was wrought about thirty years ago at M' Mer- 
ry, and also at the western extremity of the parish ; but the pit was 
removed a little to the west in the parish of Tranent, where it 
now is. It belongs to Anderson of St Germains. 
. In 1835, at M' Merry, when the blacksmith was sinking a well 
a little behind his house, on the St Germains property, he acci- 
dentally came upon some parrot coal. The tenant of" the coal- 
work upon that property, upon hearing of this, examined it, and 
found a seam of parrot coal, which he has been working ever since, 
and which, having supplied the new gas-work at Haddington, pro- 
mises to turn to good account. The tenant of the Penston coal 
also attempted to find it on the opposite side of the road, but did 
not succeed. The same year, borings were made in different parts 
of the Elvingston property, with a view to find coal, but without 
. success. The magistrates of Haddington, some time ago, set on 
foot a colliery on their property betwixt Gladsmuir and Sarauel- 
ston ; but after going on for some time, they were obliged to give 
up the work, having lost about L. 2000 in the experiment. 

From all which, it appears that the coal strata crop out on the 
east, about the kirk of Gladsmuir. 

Lime has been found in different parts of the parish. At pre- 
sent, there is only one kiln in operation, at Hairlaw, a little to the 
east of Longniddry, on the property of the Earl of Wemyss. 
About a mile to the south, on the property of Ainshe of Redcoll, 
there is a kiln in pretty good preservation, where limestone had 
been burnt, but the working has been discontinued for some time. 
I do not know that lime has been wrought, on the south side of the 
great road; but as there is a kiln in active operation on the eastern 
extremity of the Pencaitland estate, and upon the borders of the 
barony of Samuelston, it is highly probable that lime may be found 
on the contiguous lands of Samuelston or of Hodges. It is found, 
in the same line, all the way west to the kirk of Crichton, and on 
the north of the road so far east as the farm of Hoprig. 

Iron ore has been found on the eastern extremity of the farm of 
Setonhill, a little below Cotyburn, in the hollow called the Dean.

It was wrought for some time, but afterwards the working was given 
up, for what cause I have not been able to learn. But now that 
there is so great a demand for iron, it is in contemplation again to 
begin the work. The property belongs to the Earl of Wemyss, 
who, in all probability, will not lose sight of a mineral of so much 
importance at the present time. 

Freestone rock for building is found, every where in the parish. 
An old quarry on the road from Gladsmuir to Penston, from which 
stones were procured for building the church and school-house, is 
still open, but filled with water to a considerable depth. A quarry 
was also opened last year at Westbank, for supplying stones for the 
buildings. upon the estate. Quarries of a similar kind are to be 
met with in different parts of the parish. 

There is a remarkable dike of whinstone running through the 
parish, from east to west. It passes betwixt the house of Redcoll 
and Longniddry, and being quarried in different places, has fur- 
nished an abundant supply of excellent stones for making and re- 
pairing the roads. It has been traced through East Lothian all the 
way to Borrowstownness. 

In the fields about Greendykes, Southfield, and Adniston, great 
quantities of boulders and detached pieces of rock have been found 
and removed. They were struck by the plough, and the cultiva- 
tion of the fields could not be effected till they were raised and car- 
ried off. 

The soil in the middle tract, upon the western extremity, and 
all upon the south of the great road, is clayey, with the exception of 
a small tract upon the banks of the Tyne, which is loamy ; near the 
Frith, on the north, it is sandy, and as you advance southward towards 
Longniddry, it becomes a rich loam. There is a field lying to the 
south-west of Chesterhall, which is mossy. That field, forty years 
ago, was a bog, out of which the old people remember peats being 
dug. All vestiges of what it once was are now done away, and it 
is in a state of high cultivation. 

Plantations. — Belts of wood are to be found in different parts of 
the parish, composed of oak, beech, lime, birch, elm, ash, chestnut, 
hazel, and some others. The plantations of Penston, Hodges, 
and Samuelston, being contiguous to each other, form a tract of 
wood betwixt 100 and 200 acres, lying on the south of the great 
road, and are composed of the different kinds of fir, but chiefly the 
Scotch. The Penston wood, consisting of 30 acres, was planted 
about forty years ago by Lady Ross Baillie. The wood at Hodges

IS old, and in some places has been so much thinned, that it might 
be cleared and made arable at very little expense. Nowhere in 
the county are ditches and drains more necessary than on the pro- 
perty of Hodges. 

II. — Civil History, f 

Ancient families — BaillieofHoprig and Pension. — By far the most 
ancient family connected with this parish, is that of Baillie of Hop- 
rig and Penston. That, indeed, is one of the most ancient families 
in Scotland, having been in possession of those lands for the long 
period of 540 years. John Bahol, Lord of Barnard Castle, was the 
founder of Baliol College, Oxford, and father of John Baliol, King 
of- Scotland. He had a brother, Alexander Baliol or de. Balliolo, 
High Chamberlain of Scotland, whose second son, William de Bal- 
liolo, swore fealty to King Edward I. in 1296, as appears from the 
Ragman Roll. He was proprietor of Hoprig and Penston, and ac- 
quired Lamington, in Lanarkshire, by marriage with a daughter, it is 
said, of William Wallace, Governor of Scotland. The family took 
the designation of Lamington, altering their name to Baillie. 

Sir William Baillie of Lamington, Hoprig, and Penston, dying 
without legitimate male issue about 1580, was succeeded by his 
eldest daughter Margaret, who married Edward Maxwell of the 
Nithsdale family. He took the name of Baillie, and from them 
descended William Baillie of Lamington, Hoprig, and Penston, 
whose only son, William, dying unmarried, his estates devolved on 
his daughter, Margaret, married to Sir James Carmichael of Bonny- 
toun, in Lanarkshire, of the Hyndford family. Their son, Sir James, 
died without issue, and was succeeded by his sister, Henrietta Bail- 
lie of Lamington, Hoprig, and Penston, also Bonnytoun, and mar- 
ried the gallant Admiral Sir John Lockhart Ross of Balnagowan, 

 It may be noticed here, that a very large geen tree stood at the west end of the 
manse, planted by Principal Robertson, when minister of the parish. Towards the 
bottom, it was about 3 feet in diameter, of a great height, and spread its branches 
over some of the buildings in its neighbourhood. The trunk, when the present in- 
cumbent came to the parish in 1833, was quite hollow and rotten in the middle, and 
the whole weight was supported by an outer rim of 2 or 3 inches thick, with an 
opening on one side. Had it been overturned by the wind, it might have done very 
great injury both to the manse and offices. To prevent which, it was cut down last 
year, and the fragments of it," laid up beside the house, bear witness of what it once 
was. 

f There are no accounts of the parish, as far as I know, either written or printed. 
Some years ago, Mr M' Donald, of the Register- Office, found an account in MSS. of 
several of the parishes of East Lothian drawn up in 1'27, which he lias lately got 
printed, and has generously sent a copy of the book to the library of the General As- 
sembly, to be ireserved for the use of the church. The parish of Gladsmuir having 
been creeled long after that period, of course cannot be amongst them. But the por- 
tion taken from Tranent is to be found under the head of tbul parish.

B-i.-t Her eldest son, Sir Charles Ross of Balnagowan, prede- 
ceased her, leaving by his first wife, Maria Teresa, daughter ot 
James Lockhart of Lee and Carnwath, Count of the Holy Roman 
Empire, a daughter, Matilda, and by his second wife, Lady Mary 
Fitzgerald, daughter of William Robert, second Duke of Lemster, 
"a son. Sir Charles Ross of Balnagowan, and five daughters. Ma- 
tilda, the only child of the first marriage, succeeded to Lammgton, 
Hoprio-, and Penston, married Sir Thomas John Cochran, Captam 
R. N.'and died 1819. The eldest son, Alexander Dundas Ross 
Cochran Wishart Baillie, who is yet a minor, is the present pro- 
prietor of Lamington, Hoprig, and Penston, and is lineally descend- 
ed from William de Balliolo in 1296. 

To this family, the parish of Gladsmuir in a great measure owes 
its existence ; for William Baillie of Lamington was most active 
in procuring its disjunction from the neighbouring parishes, and 
its erection and endowment as a separate parish. 

Douglas of Longniddrjj.— Another ancient family connected 
with this parish was Douglas of Longniddry. This family was a 
cadet of the Douglases of Dalkeith, Earls of Morton, and was 
distinguished for steady attachment to the doctrines of the Re- 
formation, which, about the middle of the sixteenth century, were 
spreading rapidly through this country. 

Li the Duke of Somerset's expedition to Scotland in 1547, it is 
mentioned " 7th September, marched that day nine miles, and 
camped at night by a toun standing upon the Frith called Long- 
niddrie. There was found a gentlewoman, the wife of one Hugh 
Douglas. She was great with child, whose estate the council un- 
derstanding, my Lord's Grace, and my Lord Lieutenant took or- 
der, that all night, without danger or damage, she was well preser- 
ved." The Douglases had the east part of Longniddry, where the 
vaulted ground floor of the castle still remains. At that time, the 
estate belonging to the Douglases comprehended a considerable 
part of Hairlaw, Redcoll, and Setonhill, which have since been tak- 

• When John Knox was obliged to leave St Andrews, on account of the troubles 
to which the Protestants were then subjected, he was invited to Longniddry by Mr 
Douglas. There he was employed in conducting the education of Mr Douglas' two 
sons, Francis and George, and also Alexander Cockburn, the eldest son of the laird 
of Oriniston. This Alexander Cockburn was ayoung man of great promise, but died 
at the early age of twenty-eight. A brazen tablet was erected to his memory in the 
aisle of the old church at Ormiston, which is still in existence. While residing at 
Longniddry, Knox was in the practice of expounding the Scriptures, and preaching 
tile doctrines of tlic Reformation in a chapel, about half a-mile to the west ot which he 
tlicn U ved, close by the present mansion-lioiise of Longniddry, which, from his preach- 
ing in it, still goes by the name of Knox's Kirk.

en away from the estate of Longniddry, and fallen into the pos- 
session of different proprietors. The history of the House of Se- 
ton mentions that George Earl of Winton, who died 1650, " did 
conquest two considerable feu lands in Longniddrie, hereditarilly; 
the one from Sir George Douglas in the east, and the other from 
the laird of Corstorphine Forrester of Costorphine." As also 
" he bought hereditarilly the teynds of Longniddrie from the then 
Bothwell, Lord Holyroodhouse." The estates of the Earl of 
Winton were forfeited in the rebellion 1715, and sold to the York 
Buildings Company; — from whom Longniddry was purchased in 
1779 by John Glassel, Esq. who was a native of Dumfries, and set- 
tled sometime as a merchant in Virginia. Athis death, his only child, 
Joan, succeeded to the property, and married Lord John Douglas 
Henry Campbell, brother, and presumptive heir of William 
Duke of Argyle. Her eldest son, John Henry Glassel Campbell, 
is the present proprietor of Longniddry. The farm of Southfield, 
which formed a part of Longniddry, was sold by Mr Glassel, and 
is now the property of Lord Wemyss. 

Lands of Hodges. — The lands of Hodges in this parish, lying 
betwixt the baronies of Penston and Samuelston, took their 
name from Robert Hodge, a man of some eminence in his day 
as a lawyer. That property originally belonged to the town of 
Haddington, and formed a part of the extensive common attached 
to the burgh. The town having engaged in a law-suit, employed 
Mr Hodge, who resided in the neighbourhood, to conduct it. 
After being carried to the House of Lords, it was decided in favour 
of Haddington ; and the magistrates gave Mr Hodge those lands 
as a compensation for his services in bringing the process to a 
successful issue. 

In 1650, a decreet was obtained from the Commission for the 
Plantation of Kirks, to disjoin the lands of Samuelston, Penston, 
Elvingston, and others, from the parishes of Haddington and 
Aberlady, to erect them into a separate parish, and to build a kirk 
■ at a place called Thrieplaw, on the west side of the Cittle knowe, 
being the east part of Mr Hodge's property. That erection did 
not take place ; but a church was built which served as a place of 
worship for the western parts of the parish of Haddington. Mr 
Hodge took an active part, and had the principal charge in the 
building of this church. He was a man of exemplary conduct, 
was referred to in almost all cases of dispute, and was most active 
in maintaining the observances of religion, and peace and good or-

der in the neighbourhood. At his death, he was buried within the 
walls of the church, and was regarded as the founder of that esta- 
blishment. 

When a minister was appointed, a manse was built for him at 
the east end of the village of Penston, which manse is still stand- 
ing, and is at present occupied by a corn-dealer in the parish. It 
continued to be the dwelling of the minister till the present manse 
was built, and still goes by the name of the old manse. Princi- 
pal Robertson is said to have composed in it the greater part of the 
History of Scotland. The kirk at Thrieplaw continued as a place 
of worship till the erection of the present church in 1695, when it 
was allowed to go into decay. And, when a coUiery was afterwards 
set agoing close by, the walls of it were made to form a part of 
some coUiers' houses. Not a vestige of it is now to be seen, the 
working of coals in that place has long been discontinued, and four 
poor solitary cot-houses, situated in the most dreary and inacces- 
sible spot that could be found in the whole parish, still retain the 
name, and keep up the remembrance of the Old Kirk. And yet, 
before the addition to the parish of what was taken from Tranent, 
it was perhaps the most centrical situation that could be found. 
It is now surrounded and shut up with large woods on all sides ; 
but while it continued to be a place of worship, not a tree was to 
be seen about the place, and the boundaries of the different pro- 
perties were marked by little hillocks raised for the purpose. 

Land-oioners. — There are 10 heritors or proprietors of land in 
the parish. The Earl of Hopetoun, vice-patron, along with the 
Crown, possesses the lands of Coates, and is but a small proprietor. 
The Earl of Wemyss has the highest valuation, and possesses the 
lands of Hairlaw, Redhouse, Setonhill, and Southfield. Baillie of 
Lamington possesses Penston, Westbank, Gladsmuir, Hoprig, 
Hoprigmains, and Wheatrig ; he is yet a minor. The Earl of Had- 
dington possesses the lands of Samuelston, at present occupied by 
four tenants. Anderson of St Germains possesses Chesterhall, 

• Farm of Wheatrig The farm of Wheatrig, whjch belongs to Baillie of La- 
mington, consisting of sixty eight Scotch acres, is detached from the rest of the 
proierty, and was acquired in a peculiar manner. According to tradition, the Earl 
of Winton was invited to dine witli Baillie of Lamington. Baillie took care that 
there should le no wheat bread at table, and when asked the reason, said, that none 
of iiis lands were fit for raising wheat. The Earl, with great good humour, made 
him a [jresunt of a ploughgate of land capable of raising wheat, telling him he had 
done so, that he might never afterwards be able to say that he could not treat his 
guests with wheaten iread, because he had no lands it for growing wheat. I'roin 
that circumstance the farm got the name of Wheatrig It was taken from the pro- 
perty of Redhouse, now in the possession of the Earl of Wemyss.

Grcendykes, East and West Adniston. The Honourable Jolin 
Henry Glassel Campbell possesses the lands of Longniddry, con- 
sisting of one large farm and several smaller pieces let to the in- 
habitants of the village ; he is a minor. Robert Ainslie of Red- 
coll having lately purchased Elvingston and Trabroun, now posses- 
ses those lands, together mth what he formerly possessed. The 
Honourable Miss Murray possesses Laverocklaw. John Ainslie, 
younger brother of Robert, has the lands of Merryhatton, which 
are part of the estate of Huntington. Lord Ruthven, in right of his 
Lady, possesses the lands of Hodges, and is by far the smallest 
proprietor in the parish. Only one heritor is resident in the pa- 
rish, — AinsHe of Redcoll. 

Eminent Men.— In the former Statistical Account of Glads- 
muir, it is stated that George Heriot, founder of the hospital in 
Edinburgh which bears his name, was a native of this parish. It 
appears, however, from an account of his life published in the 
Scots Magazine in 1802, and from an account afterwards publish- 
ed in 1822, that his father, who was a goldsmith of great respec- 
tability, was born at Trabroun, in the parish of Gladsmuir, but 
that George was born in Edinburgh, June 1563, brought up to 
the same trade with his father, and held the lucrative appointment 
of jeweller to the King and Queen. On the accession of James 
to the English throne in 1603, he went to London and continued 
there till his death, February 1624. The Heriots of Trabroun 
were a family of some antiquity in East Lothian. 

Dr Robertson, Principal of the University of Edinburgh, began 
his ministry in this parish. He succeeded his uncle, Andrew Ro- 
bertson, and was ordained 17th April 1744, before it is said a 
very numerous congregation. He was presented by the Earl of 
Hopetoun, who singled him out as a young man of great promise. 
He lived for some years in the old manse, where he composed the 
greater part of the History of Scotland. He afterwards came to 
the present manse, where he continued till his removal to Edin- 
burgh. At Gladsmuir, in the retirement of the country, he laid 
the foundation of that high eminence which he afterwards attained 
as an historian, as well as in conducting the affairs of the church, 
being for many years looked up to as the leader in the General 
Assembly. From Gladsmuir he was translated to Edinburgh, as 
colleague to Dr Erskine, in the church of the Old Grayfriars, 
with whom he continued to live in habits of the most friendly in- 
tercourse till his death.

William Baillie of Lamington deserves to be noticed here, not 
only on account of his private worth, but also on account of his mu- 
nificent liberality to the parish. He was very active in procuring 
the erection of the new parish. He made a present to the parish 
of land for the church and churchyard, and for the school, school- 
master's house, and garden, and built the church at his own ex- 
pense, and in addition to all this, he allowed the minister, from 
his colliery at Penston, free coals for the use of his family. Bail- 
he's descendants continued to the ministers of Gladsmuir the pri- 
vilege which their worthy ancestor had so generously granted, till 
it was withdrawn by those who had the management of the pro- 
perty, at a period when the succession was doubtful. It is to be 
hoped this privilege will be again restored. But whether it be or 
not, William Bailhe of Lamington will be remembered as a man 
deeply impressed with the importance of religion to the welfare of 
the country, as a benefactor to the church, and an active promot- 
er of her true interests, as long as the parish of Gladsmuir shall 
exist. 

Parochial Registers. — The records go back to the erection of 
the parish. The first minute is dated at Gladsmuir meeting- 
house, 26th April 1692. The records are very defective. After 
the first volume, which ends in 1707, there are no minutes for thirty 
years following. There is also a blank from 1804 till 1833, wheri 
the present incumbent came to the parish. In the register of bap- 
tisms, there is a gap from 1734 to 1760. The list of marriages 
is also wanting from 1737 to 1766. But besides those defects, 
the registers of baptisms and marriages do not appear to have been 
accurately kept. 

Antiquities. — There were lately to be found in the parish, the 
remains of several old mansion-houses ; but the tide of time is 
sweeping them fast away, and levelling with the ground the most 
stately monuments of former greatness. The mansion of the Dou- 
glases of Longniddry, distinguished for their zeal for the Refor- 

■ That minute mentions, that the United Presbytery of Haddington and Dunbar 
had appointed Mr MoncriefF, minister of Saltpreston, now Prestonpans, to be modera- 
tor of the Session, for the purpose of uniting with the heritors, in the choice of a mi- 
nister to the new parish. The heritors were called at the door of the church, inti- 
mation of the meeting having been formerly given to them. Whereupon, thoy and 
the elders unanimously made choice of Mr Mungo Watson, then minister of the cha- 
pel, to be minister of Gladsmuir. He, of course, was the first minister of the parish. 
It is worthy of notice, that, some time after, ii-s apjiears from the minutes of presljy- 
tery, he f;ot a call to Uie parish of Linlithgow ; but the peoilc of Gladsmuir being 
attached to him, and having petitioned against his removal, the presbytery refused ta 
loose him from his charge, and he continued minister of Gladsmuir till his death.

mation, is now known only by a circular mound, rising a few feet 
above the ground, containing the subterraneous vaults which were 
connected with the building. The wall running along the pubhc 
road is still called the Laird's Byke ; and a part of the field, a lit- 
tle to the north, the Laird's Garden. 

The two mansion-houses of east and west Adniston, which an- 
ciently belonged to different proprietors, have been so completely 
demolished, that not a vestige of them is now to be seen. The 
old house of west Adniston was situate close by the present farm- 
house, and was last occupied by two ladies, one of whom was mar- 
ried to the Earl of Winton, the father of the last Earl. It was 
taken down about twenty 'years ago, and the materials used in 
buildmg the present farm-offices. The mansion-house upon the 
farm of east Adniston was about a quarter of a mile distant from 
the other, and formerly occupied by the proprietor, Mr Adniston. 
It was taken down in 1832, to assist in building the present 
magnificent set of offices at the farm of Greendykes. 

At Penston, there was an old mansion-house occupied by the 
proprietor when he resided in this part of the country, but no re- 
mains of it are now to be seen. It was strongly built, with a very 
thick wall, and the apartments had arched roofs, as was common in 
ancient times. It stood on the south of the road running through 
the village, opposite to the barn which has just been built. The 
garden attached to it still remains. Contiguous to the old mansion- 
house, was a pretty large store-house or granary, which was built 
in 1670, as appears from a date on one of the lintels of the door, 
for the purpose of receiving the rents of the tenantry, which at 
that time were paid in kind. An old man above eighty remem- 
bers, when Dundas of Arniston had the charge of the property, 
that the farmers used to carry the corn in sacks, upon horses' 
backs from Penston to Arniston, there being at that time no car- 
riage roads across the country. 

Betwixt Penston and Henmuir, are to be seen the ruins of an 
old windmill, which was employed to draw up the water from the 
coal. When there was wind, it answered the purpose extremely 
well ; but in calm weather it could not act,— the water got the bet- 
ter of the workmen, and they were thrown idle. This inconveni- 
ence is now completely remedied by the use of steam-engines, of 
which there are two upon the coal-work. 

At Seatonhill, about two years ago, when the servants were 
ploughing in the field contiguous to the farm-house upon the south, 



GLADSMUIR. 



185 

« 



the ploughs struck upon some large stones, which, when dug up, 
were found to be coffins composed of flag-stones of a peculiar qua- 
lity, probably a kind of puddingstone, others of a kind of red flag- 
stone, common ift the neighbourhood. The coffins were about 5 feet 
long by 2 broad, all of them containing bones. More have since 
been dug out : and it is probable there are many still remaining 
in the ground beyond the reach of the plough. Specimens of the 
stones are preserved by the tenant, and are also in my possession. 
On the eastern part of the same farm, not far from the coffins, an 
urn was found full of bones. It was broken in the taking up, but 
the fragments are in possession of Mr Black. 

On the farm of Southfield, about a mile to the south of Long- 
niddry, while the labourers were employed in making drains, they 
found a variety of small silver coins of different dates and sizes, 
chiefly British. They were given to the tenant, with whom they 
are to be found. Similar coins were found in the neighbouring 
farm of Greendykes, some of which are in the possession of the 
proprietor. It is probable the place had been some military sta- 
tion, where they had been deposited. 

Modern Buildinc/s.— There are hardly any modern buildings of 
consequence in the parish. The House of Redcoll, built about 
twelve years ago, and inhabited by the proprietor, is a neat substantial 
building, with a garden and set of good offices. It has a porter's 
lodge, and an approach from the road of about 300 yards, with a 
belt of trees on each side. 

The house at Southfield was built, about thirty years ago, by the 
proprietor Mr Gray, and inhabited by him. But when the farm 
came into the possession of the Earl of Wemyss, it was given to 
the tenant as a dwelling-house, and has since been occupied by 
him. It is a small but handsome house with a considerable num- 
ber of trees scattered about it. It is open to the north, but quite 
shut up in the view to the south. 

The farm-houses are in general good. A new one was built 
last year upon the farm of Hoprig Mains. Some have undergone 
repairs and got additions. Those at Pension and Westbank have 
got a substantial set of new offices with slated roofs. But, among 
all the farm-offices in the parish, and I may say in the county, 
none are to be compared to those of Greendykes. They were 
built by the proprietor a few years ago, and are more like the 
offices you might expect to find connected with a Ducal palace, 
than the house of a tenant.

III. — Population. 

From the appearance of ruined houses on both sides of the pa- 
rish, an opinion has prevailed that the inhabitants were once more 
numerous than they are now. But by a numeration which was 
made at the first seating of the church in 1697, it appears that 
the number of inhabitants then must have been under 1350. 
When the census was taken by Dr Webster in 1755, the numbers 
were 1415, and at the time when the last Statistical Account was 
drawn up the population was 1380. By the census in 1821 it 
was found to be 1623, and in 1831 it amounted to 1658. Since 
that time, it has varied very little. Of these, 822 are males, and 
836 are females. 

From the above tatement, it appears that the population in the 
course of less than a century has increased more than 200. This 
increase has arisen, not from the introduction of manufactories or 
public works, there are none such ; and a brewery, which was for- 
merly carried on at Trabroun, has for many years been given up, 
but from the general improvement of the parish. The whole pa- 
rish, many parts of which about a century ago were bleak and 
barren, covered with broom, and furze, and brambles, has been 
gradually brought into a state of high cultivation, and made ca- 
pable of producing all kinds of crops. In consequence of which, 
a stimulus has been given to improvement, which, notwithstanding 
the great depression in the prices of grain, is still going on, and 
gives employment to a far greater number of families than former- 
ly. Besides, the greater demand for coals, occasioned by the in- 
creased consumption from steam engines, must have given employ- 
ment to an additional number of families. The population resid- 
ing in the villages of Samuelston, Penston, and Longniddry, 
amounts to 684; in the country, 974. In that part of the parish 
inhabited by colliers, the population is constantly shifting, and in 
the course of two or three weeks may vary from 20 to 50. This 
shifting has prevailed very much, of late, in consequence of a change 
of tenants. 

The average number of births, for the last five years, was 51, the 
number varying from 40 to 59. The average number of marriages 
for the same time was 16, varying from 10 to 24. No account of 
deaths being kept, the average number cannot be ascertained. There 
are several persons in the parish above eighty, chiefly men, two of 
whom have now reached their ninetieth year. The number of fa- 
milies is 358. The number of inhabited houses is 343. In the agri- 



I 



GLADSMUIR. 



187 



cultural part of the parish, five houses are uninhabited. A conside- 
rable number of houses allotted for colliers were empty some time 
ago, but are now mostly occupied. No houses are at present 
buildino-. There are three fatuous persons connected with the 
parishj'two men, both above middle age, and one woman. There  
is also a little girl deaf. 

Character and Habits of the People.— The people in general are 
cleanly and attentive to their dress. Their xnanners have acquir- 
ed a considerable degree of polish, arising in some measure from 
their vicinity to the capital, and from the great intercourse that is 
now maintained all over the country. That rusticity of manners 
and dress, and outlandish appearance which some time ago cha- 
racterized our rural population, are fast wearing away, and the 
manners and dress of the people are rapidly improving. The la- 
bouring classes here are in no want of employment, enjoying many 
of the comforts of hfe, and in general seem to be contented with 
their condition. And at no former time, perhaps, was their con- 
dition more favourable, — for while the necessaries of life, both with 
respect to food and clothing, are low in price, their wages are 
nearly the same as when things were double their present value. 
Their food is plain but substantial ; they are in the midst of coal ; 
and they want only comfortable houses to make their situation 
what it should be. 

• The lands of Samuelston were so much infested by witches in 1661, that John 
Earl of Haddington, to appease his tenants, was under the necessity of presenting a 
petition to his Majesty's commissioner, for the purpose of getting them tried by a 
court of judicature. The following extract from this commission shews that the arts of 
darkness continued to be practised by numerous bodies, to the no small terror of the 
lieges.

During the last three years, there were 9 illegitimate births in 
the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
The two great divisions of labour carried on in the parish are 
agriculture and mining, or the working of coak. Agriculture is 
the principal employment of the people. There are 22 farmers 
in the parish, occupying land from above 50 to 500 acres each ; 
9 smaller farmers, occupying from 10 to 40 acres each ; and 5 sub- 
tenants, occupying under 40 acres each. Some of those farmers 
retain upon their farms, including hinds and their families, and la- 
bourers, from 50 to 76 individuals. On the farm of Coates, there 
is a resident population of 76 ; on that of Hairlaw, 67, besides 
others who do not reside upon the farm. The inhabitants of Pen- 
ston, Henmuir, North mains of Penston, and M' Merry contain- 
ing a population of betwixt 400 and 500, are chiefly employed in 
the working of coal. The great London road running through 
the parish about two miles and a-half, the pubhc road running 
through Longniddry about two miles, and the North Berwick road

1 he Lord Commissioner and Lords of the Articles, after hearing the iietition 
granted a commission for putting to death such of the above persons as were found 
guilty of witchcraft by confession, and for trying the others, which, if weanay credit 
tradition, was put into execution. The field in Samuelston where they were burnt 
was called the Birlie Knowe, and was situated on the south side of the villa-e, be- 
tween the Tyne and the raiU-dam, where, within these few years, it beiire now 
ploughed up kimmers bleached their linens clean, and found it a very useful spot, 
unhallowed as it was. ■ i y 

About this time, a warlock drove a lucrative trade, called Sandie Hunter 
ahas Hamilton, whom it is said the devil nick-named Hattaraiek. He was orio-i'. 
nally a nolt-herd in East Lothian, and was famous for curing diseases both in man 
and in beast, by words and charms. W herever Hattaraiek went, none durst refuse 
hun an alms. One day be went to the gate of Samuelston, when some friends after 
dinner were taking to horse, a young gentleman, brother to the lady, switched him 
about the ears, saying, " You warlock carle, what have you to do here "— whereupon 
the fellow went away grumbling, and was heard to say, " You dear buy this ere it be 
long." After supper the gentleman took horse and departed, and crossing Tyne wa- 
ter to go home, he passed through a shady piece of a haugh called the Allers. W'hat 
he saw there, he would never reveal, but next day he was in a high state of delirium, 
and had to be bound. The Lady Samuelston hearing of this said, " Surely the knave 
Hattaraiek is the cause of this trouble ; caUfor him in all haste." When the warlock 
Ciime, " Sandie," says she, " wliat is this you have done to my brother William "— 
" I told him," replied he, " I should make him repent his striking of me at the yait 
lately." She giving the rogue fiiir words, and promising him his sack full of meal, 
with beef and cheese, persuaded the fellow to cure him, which was speedily effected. 
When Hattaraiek came to receive his wages, he told the lady her brother would 
shortly leave the country, never to return ; upon which, she caused him to make a de- 
position of his property to the defrauding of his brother George. After tlie warlock 
had pursued his lucrative calling for some time, he was npirelicnded at Dunbar, taken 
to Edinburgh and burnt on the Castleliiil Satan's Invisible World. 

Sinclair, from whom the substance of the above is copied, says, that he had the in- 
formation from the gentleman's brother. — St Baldred of the Bass, p. 276-8.

upon tho coast, with the cross and parish roads, employ in winter 
30, and in siuraner about 20 men. These men and day-labourers 
receive from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. per day. There are 7 carpenters 
who employ, upon an average, 10 men as journeymen or appren- 
tices ; last year their wages were 2s. 6d. per day. There are 2 
masons, wages 3s. per day ; 9 blacksmiths, wages from 2s. 6d. to 
3s. per day ; 2 bakers, wages from Is. to Is. 6d. per day, with vic- 
tuals ; 4 tailors, who are generally paid by the piece, and whose wa- 
ges have not risen lately, in proportion to the rise in some other 
professions ; 2 weavers, one of whom is an old man, and able to do 
very little work. 

There are employed at the Penston coal-works 50 colliers, 
30 women putters, and 26 boys ; and at the St Germains col- 
liery, residing in this parish, 12 colliers, besides women putters 
and children. A collier and his putter throw out, at an ave- 
rage, fifteen load of coals per day, which is equal to 4s. 4d. But 
as there are frequent interruptions, their income can hardly be 
rated so high for any length of time. The general income of 
a man and his putter may be stated at from L. 1, Is. to L. 1, 5s. 
per week ; a load of coal weighs 200 pounds, for which they re-, 
ceive 3d. Men-servants living in the house have from L. 4 to 
L. 6 half yearly ; women-servants from L. 2, 10s. to L. 3. 

Agriculture. — The parish of , Gladsmuir contains very nearly 
5080 Scotch, or 6386 imperial acres, arable. Some parts of it, 
particularly the lands upon the north, to the extent of about one 
mile and a-half from the coast, and running east towards the Byres 
hills, were ver.y early cultivated, and about the beginning of the se- 
venteenth century bore a very high valuation ; as may be seen from 
an account of some of the parishes of East Lothian, lately printed 
by Mr M'Donaldof the Register- Office. Other parts, particular- 
ly the lands in the centre, intersected by the great London road, 
are of recent cultivation, and of an inferior soil. Here, however, 
improvements are rapidly going on ; lands that long lay waste 
have been reclaimed, and are now under the most improved sys- 
tem of husbandry. And notwithstanding the very low prices of 
grain, and the many discouragements from that circumstance, in 
the way of both landlords and tenants, the spirit of improvement 
seems to surmount every obstacle. As a proof of this, steam en- 
gines for thrashing the crops have been erected on many of the 
farms, and there are at present in the parish no less than ten em- 
ployed for that purpose. It is in contemplation to erect more.

In cropping, rotations of five, six, seven, and eight years are fol- 
lowed. The most common are five and seven years. The five years 
rotation consists of, 1. fallow ; 2. wheat, barley, and oats ; 3. and 
4. pasture ; 5. oats. The seven years rotation is, 1. turnips and po- 
tatoes ; 2. barley and wheat ; 3. and 4. grass ; 5. oats ; 6. beans ; 
7. wheat. The eight years rotation is, 1. fallow ; 2. wheat ; 3. bar- 
ley ; 4. and 5. grass ; 6. oats ; 7. beans ; 8. wheat. 

The kinds of manure employed are byre and stable dung ; lime 
and earth collected from cleaning ditches, roads, &amp;c. mixed with 
lime, forming compost ; rape, and bone dust. The rape dust is 
very generally used. Iron ploughs and harrows are almost uni- 
versally employed. Machines for sowing grain are getting more 
and more into use. Turnips are eaten upon the ground with 
sheep, or brought home to feed cattle bought in about the end of 
harvest, to be fattened for the butcher, while the straw is convert- 
ed into manure by cattle kept in the close. 

Livestock. — The number of sheep kept in the parish has of late 
been upon the increase, and is now betwixt 2000 and 3000. They 
are bought in as they are required, and are black-faced, but chiefly 
Cheviot, and a cross breed of Cheviot and Leicester. The milk cows 
are not of any particular breed. There are a considerable number of 
the Ayrshire. They are reared or bought as occasion requires, 
and not more than two or three are kept by each farmer to supply 
his family with milk and butter. Black-cattle are bought in at the 
end of harvest, and fed oflf on turnips for the market. The num- 
ber of these may amount to about 500. There are 78 plough- 
gates requiring 172 horses. Twenty-six are kept for riding and 
occasional work, and 20 for driving carriages, making in all 218 
horses, besides young ones. 

The duration of leases is nineteen years. I beHeve there are 
no exceptions to this rule. Such a length of time affords the far- 
mer sufficient opportunity to remunerate himself for the expense 
laid out in the cultivation of his farm. The farms are all enclos- 
ed, mostly with thorn hedges and ditches ; and the hedges and 
ditches are well kept. The farm buildings have been much im- 
proved-in the course of the last year, and repairs and improve- 
ments are still going on. It is to be hoped, as soon as the project- 
ed improvements have been made upon the farm-houses and of- 
fices, the attention of the proprietors will be directed to the cot- 
houses, most of which have great need of improvement. 

There are 240 Scotch or 302 imperial acres under wood, includ- 

3 



GLADSMUIR. 



191 



ing belts for shelter, shrubberies, and ornamental planting; 34 impe- 
rial occupied with houses, offices, gardens, and common patches 
in villages ; and 7 with roads, making in all 5353 Scotch or 6751 
imperial acres in the parish. 

Rent of Land, and Wages. — The rent of land varies from L. 5 
an acre to less than L. 1. The average of the whole, this present 
year, the price of wheat being very low, will be nearly L. 1, 12s. 
per Scots acre. Farm-servants are hired by the year, and paid 
partly in money and partly in kind, as follows : Q\ bolls of meal, 
4 bolls potatoes, 2 bolls barley, \ boll pease, 2 stones pork, when 
pigs are not kept, a cow's grass, and L. 8, 10s. money, with a 
house, for which the servant furnishes a shearer in harvest for 
twenty days. When a cow's grass is not given, L. 5 money addi- 
tional is allowed. In some farms, there is a little difference in the 
articles which make up the wages ; but the amount is nearly the 
same all over the parish, being equal to from J v. 21 to L. 24 money, 
this present year. In some instances, they are paid in money, and 
receive 9s. per week. The farm-servants are generally bound to 
keep bondagers, as they are called, that is, persons to work in the 
barn and fields when required. They are females or boys, and if 
the hinds have none of this description in their own families, they 
must hire them. It was long the practice to hire farm-servants at 
Christmas or the end of the year, but a resolution was entered 
into by the tenantry lately, not to hire them till the beginning 
of February. The average rent of grazing, as near as can be 
computed, is L. 3 per ox or cow, and 15s. per ewe or full-grown 
sheep, pastured for the year. 

Draining, — Draining is carried on not only in the parish, 
but in the neighbourhood, to a very great extent. There is little 
under water, and therefore the object of the farmer is to prevent 
water from lodging on the surface and injuring the crops. Tiles 
are chiefly employed, and the drains are frequently made in every 
alternate furrow, and sometimes even in every furrow. They vary 
in depth from eighteen to twenty-four inches, and the expense of 
making the drains and furnishing the tiles is from lOd. to Is. the rood. 
Sometimes, the proprietor furnishes the tiles as an encouragement 
to the tenant to use them in draining his fields. At other times, the 
whole expense is borne by the tenant himself. The universal opi- 
nion among farmers seems to be, that the increase of the crop soon 
repays all the expense of the drains. Stones also are used, but 
rarely since tiles have been introduced, they having been found to 



192 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



answer the purpose. Sometimes stones are employed along with 
the tiles. This is undoubtedly the most effectual mode ; but the 
objection to it is, that it is both tedious and expensive, — whereas the 
advantage of tiles, is, that the work is performed with great ex- 
pedition, and with little expense of carriage. 

In some parts of the parish where the soil is deep, particularly 
at Southfield, trenching has been practised to a considerable ex- 
tent. Upon this subject there is a diversity of opinion, — some main- 
tain that the new earth brought to the surface requires a conside- 
rable number of years before it get into a proper bearing state. 
This opinion, however, is far from being general; and many hold 
that the new soil brought to the surface, after a long period of rest, 
becomes far more productive, the old having been exhausted by 
continual cropping. The expense of the process must be a great 
obstacle in the way of its being carried on. 

Amount of raw Produce. — In the present circumstances of the 
parish, the amount of raw produce cannot be very accurately as- 
certained. Several of the tenants entered upon their farms only 
last year, and hence their farms were not cropped, either as they 
had been before, or as they will afterwards be. The farmers, in 
general, have made the returns required with the greatest readi- 
ness. According to the statements received, the amount for 1835 
was nearly as follows : 

White crop, including wheat, barley, and oats, . . 2060 acres. 

Green crop, including beans and pease, potatoes, turnips, cabbage, and 

mangel wurzel, ...... 848 

Hay, . . , . . , . . 298 

Pasture, including links, . . . • . 1160 

Bare fallow, . . . . . .714 

The value of all which, estimated according to last year's markets, 
will be about L. 30,000. 

The gardens in the parish are not deserving of particular no- 
tice. The three mansion-houses, Elvingston, Redcoll, and South- 
field, which last belongs to Lord Wemyss, and is occupied by the 
tenant, have each of them gardens inclosed with a good wall, where 
all kinds of vegetables are raised, and which are well stocked with 
fruit trees. Several of the farm-houses have also gardens attach- 
ed to them surrounded with a wall, in which all kinds of vegetables 
and fruits are reared. The tenant at Redhouse, on the northern 
extremity of the parish, has a large mail-garden, the produce of 
which is disposed of chiefly in the Edinburgh market ; but, as most 
©f the garden lies in the parish of Aberlady, it does not fall to be 



GLADSMUIR. 



193 



taken notice of here. The gross produce of all the gardens may 
amount to about L. 200. 

The two coal-pits now wrought on the Penston property pro- 
duce from 1-2,000 to 15,000 tons a-year. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Haddington, which is about four 
miles distant from the church. It was long the principal grain 
market in Scotland ; but most of the farmers in the western parts 
of the county carry the greater part of their grain to Dalkeith and 
Edinburgh, to both of which places Haddington is now inferior as 
a grain market. 

Villages. — There are three villages in the parish, — Samuelston, 
Longniddry, and Penston. Of these, Samuelston contains a po- 
pulation of 187. It is an irregular scattered village, situate on 
the north bank of the Tyne, running north-east by south-west. In 
former times, it carried on a considerable trade in meal, but though 
there are still two corn mills, the trade has very much dwindled 
away. There is also a saw-mill attached to one of the corn-mills, 
which is of great use in cutting out paling and pieces of wood, for 
various purposes. There are three farms connected with it. East- 
mains, Backbrae, and Templehouse, besides two smaller pieces of 
land given to the villagers for their accommodation. 

Longniddry is situated about half a mile from the Frith, and is 
also an irregular straggling village. It is completely changed from 
what it once was. In former times, four tenants lived in it, — one in 
Cooper's Close, one in Burnfoot Close, and one on each side of the 
road, about the middle of the village, — who had each a considera- 
ble farm. The property has been very much diminished, and the 
whole has been thrown into one farm, with the exception of a few 
fields rented by some labourers in the village, who employ horses 
for carrying on their business. The present farm-house, which is 
commodious and of good appearance, stands about 200 yards to 
the south of the road, running through the village. Betwixt that 
house and the road, there were formerly a considerable number of 
cot-houses, not a vestige of which now remains, and the place 
where they stood is under crop, and very productive. The pre- 
sent mansion-house, which is let, stands about a gun-shot to the 
west of Cooper's Close. The garden is immediately in front, the 

" Hcsides Templehouse in Samuelston, there was in former times in the parish 
another place of this name, situate in a field betwixt Iloprig Mains and the public 
road. Some of tbo old people remember having seen the house. 



194 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



offices on the west, with a small court, having altogether a deso- 
late appearance. On the east, are the ruins of the old chapel, cal- 
led John Knox's Kirk, and an old barn and stack-yard, occupied 
by one of the inhabitants, who has a small piece of land from the 
proprietor. Adjoining the offices to the west, some of the inhabi- 
tants remember several rows of houses, forming a little village of 
themselves, all of which have been swept away, without a stone re- 
maining to mark the place where they once stood. One old man 
remembers seventy houses being taken down. At that time, the 
farm of Southfield formed a part of the Longniddry estate. The 
present population of the village is 195. 

The village of Penston is chiefly inhabited by colliers. The 
farm-house is at the west end of it, and is commodious and in good 
repair. A handsome set of offices, with a steam-engine, has just 
been erected, and also a saw-mill. The houses in the village are 
in a state of bad repair ; the place is altogether dirty, and, though 
situated in the heart of one of the finest agricultural districts of 
Scotland, has a very uncomfortable and unhealthy appearance. 
It stands upon an eminence, about half a mile to the south of the 
great English road, and a mile west from Gladsmuir kirk. The 
inhabitants are supplied with water from three open wells, one at 
Northmains, another behind the old manse to the east, and an- 
other to the west of the farm-house, all on a line running from east 
to west. Were a proper drain to be formed on each side of the 
road, with a declivity from the houses, it would contribute much 
to the cleanliness and health of the place. The present popula- 
tion is 302. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parish are very abundant. The great London road 
runs about two miles and a half through the centre of the parish. 
Along that road, six stage-coaches pass and repass evei-y day, at 
different hom's, besides the mail-coach. On the coast road, the 
North Berwick coach passes and repasses every day, besides car- 
riers to Aberlady, Dirleton, and North Berwick, on different days 
of the week. There is also the road running from Coates, past 
Setonhill and Hairlaw, through Longniddry to the west. These 
roads are intersected by others running north and south, the whole 
breadth of the parish. They are all kept in good repair, by which 
means the facilities of intercourse are very great. The bridges in 
the parish are merely little arches, suited to the paltry streams of 
water that flow through them.

Ecclesiastical State— The church is situate nearly in the centre 
of the parish, and is accessible to all the inhabitants. None are 
farther distant from it than two and a half or three miles ; 
and they do not seem to think the distance of much consequence, 
for the most distant are as regular in their attendance as those 
who are nearest. It stands upon the highest point of the ridge be- 
twixt Tranent and Haddington, about 350 feet above the level of 
the sea, and 240 to the north of the great road. The situation is 
one of the finest in Scotland. On the north, it commands an ex- 
tensive view of the Frith of Forth, with the county of Fife stretch- 
ing beyond : to the east, all those objects that are most picturesque, 
the Byres hills, North Berwick Law, with the rich country around, 
the Bass and Traprane Law. On the south, the vale of the Tyne, 
with the Lammermuirs in the back ground, and to the west the 
Ochils, and some of the distant hills of Dumbarton and Perthshire, 
with Leith, Edinburgh, the Pentlands, and the rich country inter- 
vening. But, though beautiful in point of situation, its appearance 
is mean and ruinous. It is small, cold, damp, and in bad repair. 
The churchyard is sufficiently large for the parish, but it is very 
wet. The greater part of it is surrounded by a wall, which is much 
broken down; the remaining part is protected by an hedge, which 
also is in a state of great decay. The church aff"ords accommo- 
dation for 535 sitters, being at least 200 less than would be re- 
quired for the accommodation of the parish. The heritors grant- 
ed to the kirk- session sixty- two sittings, chiefly those set apart 
for the communion tables, to be let for a small price to the peo- 
ple when required. These seats are let at Is. each, and when not 
let, are occupied by those who cannot be accommodated other- 
wise. The rest of the sittings as usual are allotted to the heritors, 
according to their respective properties in the parish. The church 
was built by Baillie of Lamington in 1695. 

The present manse was built in 1725, previous to which the mi- 
nisters lived in what is still called the old manse, about a mile to the 
south-west of the church. The late incumbent finding the manse 
too small for his family, got a considerable addition made to it in 
1803, consisting of a large room below, and two smaller rooms above. 
When the present incumbent came to the parish in 1833, consi- 
derable improvements were made upon the offices, and they are 
now in a state of pretty good repair. About twenty years ago, the 
garden was inclosed with a good stone wall, which was built by the 
heritors, the tenants having agreed to drive the carriages. But, 



196 



HADDINGTON SHIRE. 



besides what is enclosed, there is at least a rood outside the walls 
all around where all kinds of crops are raised. 

The glebe is small, consisting only of about 5 acres, including 
garden, barn-yard, &amp;c. The soil is loamy, upon a clayey bottom. 
Most of it has been drained with tile and stones within these two 
years. This year, the field immediately behind the manse, which 
was wet, uneven, and full of weeds, has been drained and trenched, 
with the view of its being laid down in grass, in a more favourable 
state. The annual value of the glebe, estimating it according to 
the lands in the neighbourhood, is about L. 8. The stipend con - 
sistsof about34 bollsof wheat, 137 bolls of barley, 24 bolls of oats, 
95 bolls of meal, with L. 10 for communion elements, the amount 
of which varies according to the fiars of the county. 

There are no chapels nor dissenting meeting-houses in the pa- 
rish. The number of persons of all ages attending the Establish- 
ed Church varies from 400 to 500. Those who are in the prac- 
tice of attending are never all present at the same time. From the 
uncomfortable state of the church, many are prevented from at- 
tending who otherwise would do it; and a considerable number are 
very irregular in their attendance. The average number of com- 
municants is 500. It is not easy to ascertain how many attend dis- 
senting places of worship. The number, however, may be stated 
to be betwixt 40 and 50. All this leaves a very considerable pro- 
portion of the examinable persons of the parish who are not pre- 
sent at any place of public worship on the Lord's dav. 

A society for religious purposes was instituted, in the beginning 
of last year. The design of it was to promote the progress of reli- 
gion in the parish, and to contribute to the objects recommended 
by the General Assembly. Its~ contributions during the first year 
of its existence amounted to L.6; and they are now upon the in- 
crease. The average annual amount of church collections for reli- 
gious and charitable purposes, for the last five years, is about 
L. 20. 

Educatio7i.— Besides the parochial, there are four private schools 
in the parish. The parochial school is situate at Gladsmuir, close 
by the church and manse, and is very much shut up by the school- 
master's garden. The number attending the school is, upon an

average, betwixt 80 and 100. The branches taught are such as 
are usual in parish schools, including Latin, Greek, French, and 
the practical parts of mathematics. The salary is the maximum, 
L. 34, 4s. 4d. ; and the school fees amount to L. 40. The hours 
of attendance are, in winter, from nine to half-past three, with half 
an hour of interval ; and in summer, from nine to four, with an 
hour of interval. The school-house is too small ; but in other 
respects, it is comfortable enough. The schoolmaster's house 
is large and commodious, consisting of two apartments below and 
three above, with closets. It is damp, however. The apartments 
are very low in the roof, and have much need of repairs. The 
schoolmaster holds also the offices of session-clerk and heritors' 
clerk, the fees of which amount to about L. 30 a-year. 

There has been a school in the village of Samuelston, from time 
immemorial. In former times, the master was allowed L. 2 a-year 
from the heritors ; but that has been discontinued for a consider- 
able time. Some years ago, when the schoolmasters' salaries were 
augmented, an attempt was made to get a chalder of victual to be 
divided betwixt the schoolmasters of Samuelston and Longniddry ; 
but it could not be obtained. The schoolmaster of Samuelston 
has a free house and school-house ; and he got lately from the pro- 
prietor a small piece of ground, as garden ground. That, with 
the school fees, is all he has to live upon. The school fees are 
small, and the number of scholars upon an average is about 30, af- 
fording the schoolmaster an annual income of about L. 15, a mi- 
serable pittance for the support of a man who holds the office of 
a schoolmaster. Were the schoolmaster of Gladsmuir to depend 
entirely upon voluntary support, his income could hardly be ex- 
pected to be much better. To what a lamentable state would edu- 
cation in the country be then reduced  

There is also a school at Longniddry of long standing. Here, 
too, the schoolmaster is furnished with a free house and school- 
house. Two years ago, when a new schoolmaster was appointed, 
the people, very much to their credit, got the school-house repair- 
ed and fitted up in a handsome manner. And last year, the 
dwelling-house having only one apartment, had another added to 
it, which makes the house pretty commodious. This is the more 
praiseworthy, as the people are all of the labouring class. The 
average number of scholars there, last season, was 60. An evening 
school is also kept for the benefit of those who are at work, through 
the day. Besides the school fees, the teacher at Longniddry has 



198 



HADDINGTONSHIllE. 



two guineas a-year granted him by the proprietor, and the same 
sum by the Earl of Wemyss, which, though small, is a consider- 
able addition to his income, and is creditable to the Noble proprie- 
tors, who thus contribute to the education of the labouring poor, 
and m this way essentially promote the improvement of the com- 
munity. The annual income of the teacher here may amount to 
about L. 25. 

A school is also taught at the village of Penston, about a mile 
to the south-west of Gladsmuir, and consequently within reach of 
the parish school. This village being chiefly inhabited by colliers, 
the children are sent early to work ; and, after labouring one part 
of the day, they are sent to school, another part of the day, when 
there is a school at hand ; but were the distance considerable, 
this object could not be accomplished. It was with a view to such 
accommodation, that a school was erected and is still kept up at 
Penston. The teacher has to find a house for himself; and the 
sciiooi-house, through neglect, is in a wretched condition. The 
number of scholars is small,— last year not exceeding 25. The in- 
habitants are constantly shifting; and lately the teacher was at the 
point of giving up the school for want of support. He is an old 
man, and his whole income last year did not amount to L. 10. 

Besides these schools, there is one at Cotyburn, a solitary place 
at the north-eastern extremity of the parish. This school is taught 
by a man who was in the army,- and has a small weekly pension 
from Government. He has a dwelling-house and school-house at- 
tached to it ; for both of which he pays rent. The average num- 
ber of his scholars is 24, thus affording him an income of about 
-L. 10, which, with his pension from Government, affords him a 
scanty subsistence. 

The price of education per week is from 3d. to 6d., or from 
7s. 6d. to 13s. 6d. a-year, calculating the year at three quarters; 
for, in country schools, the vacations are long, and seldom more than 
three quarters are paid for. And as Is. is paid for coals during 
the winter, the annual expense of education for the common 
branches amounts to from 8s. 6d.to 14s. 6d.,— besides the expense 
of books, which is small considered by itself, but great to those 
labourers who have three or four children at school, and who have 
themselves an income not exceeding L. 25 a-year. 

Sunday Schools. — There are 3 Sunday schools in the parish, — 
one at Penston, the number of scholars attending which has, for 
some years, been very fluctuating. This arises, partly from the 



GLADSMUIR. 



199 



difficulty of obtaining teachers properly qualified, and partly from 
the changes that are constantly taking place in the population. 
There is'another at Longniddry. It began about two years ago. 
It is well taught and well attended, and has already been produc- 
tive of much good in the neighbourhood. The third is at Tra- 
broun, superintended by the Misses Law. But as that property 
has just been sold, it is doubtful whether this school will be con- 
tinued. 

Parents send their children to school at different ages. Some 
are sent when. only four years old;: others not till they are seven 
or eight. But care is taken that sooner or later all be taught to 
read." When the .{arents cannot afford to pay for them, they are 
paid for from the poors' fund, or by charitable intiividuals who take 
an interest in them. In this parish, the schools are so situated 
that they are accessible to all the inhabitants. There are none, 
as far as' I know, above fifteen years of age who cannot read ; but 
there are many who cannot write. And there are some who have 
been very imperfectly educated themselves, and, having felt the 
evils of a neglected education, are anxious to have their children 
properly instructed. 

Libraries. — There are no parochial libraries in the parish. This 
want is supplied by three itinerating ones, which are stationed in 
each of the three villages of the parish. These libraries, after re- 
maining two years in their stations, are returned, and new ones 
sent in their place. In this way, the attention of the people is kept 
up by a regular succession of new books, which are well selected 
and arranged under the superintendence of Mr Samuel Brown at 
Haddington. 

Societies. — There are 2 friendly societies in the parish, — one at 
Longniddry of old standing, and another at Penston, instituted in 
1823, both of which are in a thriving state. At Penston, a Mort- 
cloth Society was set on foot more than fifty years ago, by Lady 
Ross Baillie of Lamington, for the benefit of her colliers there. 
None but colliers connected with the coal-work have a right to be- 
come members. Lady Ross presented the society with three mort- 
cloths, and that number has been kept up ever since for the use of 
the members, who have now acquired a prescriptive right to em- 
ploy their own mortcloths, when they bury their dead in the church- 
yard of Gladsmuir. At Penston, there is also a Coflin Society, the 
object of which is to discontinue the use of mortcloths altogether. 
The members are furnished by the society with coffins, decently 



200 



HADDINGTONSHIRE . 



covered with black cloth, and no niortcloths are used. Those who 
are not members may also obtain a coffin from the society, at a cheap 
rate, by paying for it. This Society was instituted about two years 
ago. Besides these, there is a yearly Society at Penston, the mem- 
bers of which draw sick money in case of illness, and receive a sum 
of money for the burial of their dead. Connected with the parish is 
a Frame Society for the protection of the dead, to which the greater 
part of the parish belong. The safes are of malleable iron, and 
of a construction such as is usually employed. When used, they 
are generally sunk about two or three feet below the surface of the 
ground. A Savings' Bank was instituted some years ago, but it gra- 
dually died away, and now no longer exists. A Curling Society was 
begun in December last, but there having been very little frost, the 
ice was never in a condition to be played upon, and the members 
of course were deprived of an opportunity of displaying their skill. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
upon the poors' roll is 41 ; and the average sum allowed to each per 
week is 1 s. 3d. The sum allowed varies according to circumstances. 
Some get Is., some 2s., some 3s., and one family gets 4s. per week. 
In addition to which, most of them get a cart of coals, in the course 
of the winter. A collection is made at the church for this purpose, 
which comes far short of what is laid out for coals. Whatever is 
deficient is taken from the poors' fund. Besides those who receive 
a regular allowance, there are always some who receive occasional 
aid, in cases of distress or unexpected misfortunes. Five, in addi- 
tion to their weekly allowance, get their house rents paid. 

The average amount of annual contributions for their relief for 
five years is L. 200, 9s. 3d. of which L. 167, 17s. arises from an 
assessment which is laid on once a-year, at a meeting of heritors 
called for the purpose. The collections at the church amount to 
L. 16, 6s. 5d. ; mortcloths L. 4, 18s. 2d.; putting in stones for 
marking burial ground 17s. 5d.; seat rents, lis. 7d. ; marriages, 
&amp;c. L. 1, 8s. 8d.; interest of a bill for L. 170, L. 8, 10s. The 
poor, with a very few exceptions, are all paid in money, and, there- 
fore, in the present depressed state of the grain market, their allow- 
ance is much greater than when provisions are dearer. The poor 
in general have little reluctance to apply for parochial aid, when- 
ever they think it can be obtained. Children also who are living 
in comfortable circumstances, are very much disposed to leave their 
aged parents to shift for themselves, or to get relief for them from 
the parish. I'he collections at the church arc very small, chiefly

from an idea, which very generally prevails among the labouring 
classes, that there is no occasion for them to give any thing to the 
poor, because what they give is just so much saved to the proprie- 
tors, who are bound by law to support them. In this way the di- 
vine law of charity, in these times of innovatioUj is too generally 
evaded. 

/e/iozs.— There are, at present, in the parish, ten public houses, 
or houses licensed for retailing spirits. It cannot be doubted that 
so many of them, when they are not needed, have a very pernicious 
influence upon the morals of the people. When there are so many 
persons anxious to get customers to their houses, they cannot be 
expected to be very careful to prevent that excess in drinking 
which prevails among us to such an extent. The act permit- 
ting publicans to keep their houses open on Sundays ought im- 
mediately to be abolished, as one of the most ill-advised that 
was ever sanctioned by a British Parliament. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the former Statistical Account was drawn up, a striking im- 
provement has taken place in the roads, in the cultivation, drain- 
ing and fencing of the fields. Different kinds of manure have also 
been employed with success. The farm-houses and offices have 
undergone a proportional improvement. In consequence of the de- 
pressed state of the markets, some of the tenants are beginning to 
throw more of their fields into pasture, which promises not only to 
make them a suitable return, but which will prevent them from be- 
ing exhausted by overcropping. It also appears from the former 
Statistical Account, that 134 black-cattle were kept ; now they 
amount to 500. Then the number of sheep was 100 ; now they 
amount to betwixt 2000 and 3000. Then rape-cake and bone 
dust were never thought of as a manure ; now they are very much 
employed. All this shews the great attention that is paid to the 
enriching and improving of the soil. The wages of labourers and 
tradesmen also have risen almost an half, while the price of provi- 
sions and clothes has been as low as at that period. 

Gladsmuir kirk has often been remarked as liable to be struck 
by lightning. A remarkable instance of this happened 21st July 
1789. It is thus described in the former Statistical Account : — 
" A thunder-storm began in the north, and came gradually 
nearer, having circled round by the west. The school, where 
above seventy children were then assembled, unfortunately stood in 
Us way. The thunder burst upon the house, and seemed at first to

have levelled it with the ground. The walls were rent, the windows 
shattered, and the roof demolished. A thick darkness, caused by 
the smoke and dust, for a while concealed the extent of the mis- 
chief. When it subsided, the neighbours who first entered, anxious 
for the fate of their children, had reason to fear the worst ; for few 
signs of life appeared. The whole crowd of little ones, either stun- 
ned or terrified, lay stretched upon the ground beneath the tables 
or benches where they sat. Many were quite senseless, but after- 
wards recovered. Two boys were killed outright, and the master 
with many others much injured. The effect of such a scene is not 
soon worn off" from the minds of children. A black cloud still ter- 
rifies the whole school, and a clap of thunder more than ordinarily 
loud, scatters the whole little troop in an instant." Another instance 
afterwards occurred. While a storm of thunder and lightning was 
passing over the place, the family at the manse were alarmed, and 
darkened the windows. The females crowded together in the 
middle of the dining-room for shelter. One of the maids who had 
occasion to go up stairs, had no sooner got to the bottom of the 
stair, than the lightning struck the house and killed her in an in- 
stant. To prevent such fatal accidents in future, conductors were 
placed upon the manse, and are still there.

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The parish of Dirleton lies in the county of Hadding- 
ton. The etymology of the name is very doubtful, some deriving 
it from the Scottish " dirl," which signifies a tremulous motion ; 
others from Derili, who was King of the Picts about the end of the 
seventh century, and is believed to have been the friend and coad- 
jutor of Baldred, who first built Christian churches in East Lo-

The village of Gulane, two miles to the west of Dirleton, for- 
merly gave its name to the parish. Its old name was Golyn, so 
called from an adjoining piece of water, now drained ; Golyn in the 
British signifying a little lake. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish forms the most northern 
part of the county. From east to west it is 5 miles in length; 
its greatest breadth from north to south is 4 miles. It is bound- 
ed on the north by the Frith of Forth ; on the south by the Pef- 
fer, a rivulet which separates it from the parish of Athelstane- 
ford ; on the east by the parish of North Berwick ; and on the west 
by that of Aberlady. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its shape is compact, nearly re- 
sembling a tortoise with its head to the west. It is composed of 
two parallel ridges, of gentle elevation, which run from east to 
west, and trisect the arable land into nearly equal parts. Its ge- 
neral appearance is flat, and rather uninteresting, — richness of soil 
much more than picturesqueness of scenery being its characteristic 
feature. So far back as the year 1627, we have in a Statistical 
Account of the parish at that period,-f- the following testimony to 
its fertility : " There is no occasion of lyming within the Lord- 
schippof Diriltoune, siclyke ther growes noe quheate in all the toun 
of Gulane, Elbottle, and most pairt of the Colledge steid." But 
though the general aspect of the parish be tame, it is greatly re- 
lieved to the north by the Frith of Forth, with its many interesting 
islands, and also by the village of Dirleton, which, for locality and

to the different Presbyteries of Scotland, forty-eight only of wliich are preserved in 
the Register- Office. The Account of this parish was kindly communicated to me by 
A. M'Donald, Esq. Register- Office. Its commencement runs thus: " Estate of the 
kirk and paroche of Dirletoun answerable untQ the articles conteaned in the ordi- 
nance of his Majesty's Commissioners, quhilk estate is given up by Maister Andre 
Makgliie Minr. &amp;c." Its information is. however, confined to a statement of the rent 
and teind of the land, or, in its own words, " for tryall of the worth and rent of evcrie 
roume of the parochina in stocke and teind, we declnir as foUowis."

external decorations, forms a marked contrast to the rest of the 
parish. It is dehghtfully situated on a rising ground about a mile 
and a half from the sea, a view of which it commands; to the east, 
North Berwick Law, the Bass, and the Island of May, add great- 
ly to the beauty and interest of the scene ; while the venerable 
castle, on a rock of considerable elevation, at the eastern extremi- 
ty of the village, overhanging with its " ivy-mantled towers" a 
beautiful flower garden, and some of the finest evergreens in Scot- 
land, together with the fine open green in the centre of the village, 
which is composed of neat, and in some cases, singularly tasteful 
cottages, ornamented with shrubs and flower plats, all combine to 
form one of the loveliest villages in the country. The coast, about 
eight miles in extent, is, towards the east, flat and sandy ; advan- 
cing westwards it becomes rocky, and, in some places, almost bold ; 
further west, where it joins Aberlady parish, we have again a fine 
sandy beach, beneath which is a strong clay. Some parts of these 
sands are unsafe, from which serious accidents have resulted. 
Half way between Gulane and Dirleton, the links assume a pecu- 
liar and interesting aspect, starting off from almost a dead level 
into a singularly irregular form, presenting quite the appearance 
of a mountainous district in miniature. I do not know whether 
this be owing wholly to the drifting of the sand, or in some measure 
to the form of the subjacent rocks. There are three islands be- 
longing to the parish ; Fidrey or Fetheray, Ibris or Eyebrochy, 
and the Lamb. The first of these is situated directly opposite the 
village of Dirleton, about a mile from the shore. Its appearance 
is highly picturesque, the western part is of considerable elevation, 
and is united by an isthmus to the eastern part, which rises in a 
castellated form, and is called the Castle of Tarbet. Formerly it 
was tenanted by rabbits, which have been supplanted by a colony 
of rats, brought thither by a vessel that was wrecked on the island. 

Climate.— The climate is found to be peculiarly trying for those 
affected with pulmonary complaints. Agues and nervous diseases, 
according to the last Statistical Report of 1792, were common at 
that time. The former are now unknown, which is to be ascribed to 
the draining of the land. . 

Hydrography.— T\\e Frith of Forth, as already stated, is the 
northern boundary of the parish. There are, besides two small 
sluffffish streams differing little from large drains, the Mdlburn and 
the Pefl-er, which is believed to signify " the slow runnmg river. 
The latter is tlie southern boundary of the parish ; it rises at Cong-

alton, at the south-east corner of the parish, and hnmediately di- 
vides into two streams, one running east, and falUng into the sea 
near Tynningham, the other west, which, after a course of eight 
miles, falls into the sea at Aberlady. 

Geolopj.— The formations here are of the secondary class, the 
sandstone or great coal formation, with their accompanying rocks 
of igneous origin. It is to these we owe any slight elevations that 
arelo be met with in the parish. The sandstone throughout seems 
to be buried beneath these— appearing only occasionally here and 
there, having been forced to the surface by the rise of the igneous 
rocks. Gulane Hill, however, of considerable height, is of sand- 
stone, part of which is regularly quarried, and produces excellent 
freestone ; ironstone is also to be found there in considerable quan- 
tity, and was at one time wrought. The igneous rocks present the 
different varieties of whinstone or secondary trap. In the middle of 
the parish, and also on the coast, we have basalt, and at one place 
its characteristic features are beautifully developed. Some time ago 
upwards of thirty pentagonal pillars were laid bare in the farm of 
West Fenton. The parish, as already observed, is composed of 
two parallel ridges, running east and west. The centre of the 
southern ridge, from Fenton Tower on the east,, to the village of 
Fenton on the west, rests on whinstone, which crops to the surface 
occasionally through its course. At the latter place, basalt makes 
its appearance, and continues the ridge for about a mile further to 
the westward. Limestone is found within the tract of the basalt, 
possibly raised by it to the surface, but it dips so rapidly to the south, 
as to have been considered unworthy of being wrought. It is also 
to be met with at the bottom of the whinstone quarry at Burnside, 
near the east side of the parish : but from the depth of the covering, 
and from the declination of the strata, dipping to the south at an 
angle of upwards of 30°, it has never been wrought. In the north- 
ern ridge, the whinstone appears again at Dirleton, with the bare face 
of the rock to the west, and its tail of water-worn stones and till, 
covered with more recent soil, stretching eastward. This rock is of 
felspar porphyry, in which occur frequent veins of a dark-red jasper. 
The western end of this ridge rests on freestone and ironstone, 
near Gulane, the surface being poor, barren sand. Coal has been 
found on the north-east side of the parish ; but as it rises nearly to 
the surface of comparatively high ground, within a few hundred 
yards of the sea, and dips rapidly beneath the low flat ground along 

HADDINGTON. O

the shore, there is no probabiUty of its ever being wrought with ad- 
vantage. 

In the southern part of the parish, the whinstone rock is found 
overlaid with clay of different colours, mixed with rounded water- 
worn stones, to the depth of 10, 14, and 30 feet. In one part, 
viz. the site of Fenton Barns, the whinstone forms a basin of 300 
yards in diameter, and is filled to the level with the above de- 
posit. In deepening the Peffer, in 1829, the workm.en found 
a deer's horn, imbedded in the hard till, 7 feet below the sur- 
face, in a mixture of clay and minute gravel. About a mile fur- 
ther east, on the banks of the same stream, in a soft clay, there 
have been found a considerable number of oak trees from 5 to 10 
feet below the surface ; nuts also and millet-seed in considerable 
quantity were discovered, — their position seeming to indicate the ac- 
tion of water. They grew readily when put into the ground. 
Boulders from 1 to 3 feet long, occur imbedded in the soil, a mile 
to the east of the basalt rock, which forms the western extremity 
of the southern ridge of the parish ; none, however, have been 
found to the west of that rock. The coast is composed of beauti- 
fully rich sand, and of the whinstone and basalt, already spoken of, 
interspersed with sandstone ; in several places, it is evidently mak- 
ing advances upon the sea. The islands also are of the trap formation. 

,Soi7.— About 300 acres along the southern side of the parish 
are soft moorish soil, naturally wet, on a very retentive subsoil ; 
furze and heather seem to have been their natural productions. On 
the northern side of the parish, above 400 acres are dry, sandy, 
or gravelly rich loam ; the remainder of the arable land is general- 
ly hazel loam on till, or a clayey bottom. From Gulane, east- 
ward, there are about 100 acres covered with sand, which seems 
to have been transported by the wind from the hill that stands 
to the west of that village. Tradition, fifty years ago, used to 
assign its commencement to the time when the gap, still so ob- 
vious, was made in the hill; and in the Statistical Report of 1627, 
the precise period of its commencement seems obviously to be 
pointed at, for it is said, " the gleib is so overblown with sand, as, 
the largest aiker thereof has not been manured these five yeiris 
by-gone ;" and elsewhere, after enumerating the different lands m 
Gulane, it thus concludes : " As for the rest of the few aikers of 
Gulane, they are all lying waste, and unlaboured, and never lickhe 
to be laboured. Besides the rent of the rest of the land of Gu- 
lane quhilk we have given up, cannot be counted constant rent, m 
respect the'sarnyn is licklie to be overblown more with sand;" and 



DIRLETON. 



207 



in further corroboration of this opinion, there is to be found be- 
neath the sand, a clay soil, in which old ridges are to be dis- 
tinctly traced. 

In Aberlady parish, to the west of this, a similar catastrophe has 
taken place ; a few years ago, whole fields were laid bare of the 
sand, beneath which were discovered crooked old-fashioned ridges 
in a fine clayey loam. But at whatever period the blowing of the 
sand commenced, and the probability is that it was about the 
beginning of the seventeenth century, it must have originated in 
the removal of the brushwood, and binding plants which covered 
the hill. The mischief is still increasing, and instead of any mea- 
sures being taken to prevent it, a portion of the hill is annually 
ploughed. 

Botany. — From the highly cultivated state of the parish, the 
situation is not favourable for the botanist. It is only on the sandy 
common on the coast, that a few of the rarer plants have been 
found. In the cultivated fields, there are found abundantly, the 
Silene nocti/lora, Sherardia arvensis, Centaurea Scahiosa, and oc- 
casionally Alopecurus agrestis, Silene conica, S. Anglica, Saxifraga 
tridactylites, and Fedia dentata. Campanula liyhrida has also been 
discovered this- summer 1836, in the neighbourhood of the vil- 
lage. In the summer of 1835, a continental species of Alyssum 
was discovered in an uncultivated field a mile and a half from the 
sea. The species is the calycinum of Linnaius. This, it is beheved, 
is the first British station in which the plant has been found. 
Gulane links, in this parish, are well known to botanists as the sta- 
tion for Utricularia vulgaris, Inula dysenterica, Samolus vale- 
randi, and Limosella aquatica. The other veigetable productions 
are those found on light sandy shores. 

II. — Civil History. 
Ancient Family of Vaux, 8fc. — The Anglo-Norman family of 
Vaux or De Vallibus obtained in the twelfth century a part of 
the manor of Golyn and Dirleton, with part of the lands of Fen- 
ton. The daughter and heiress of William De Vallibus, Lord 
of Dirleton, brought these estates to her husband. Sir John Haly 
burton, about 1340. Their grandson. Sir Walter Halybiu-ton 
of Dirleton, High- Treasurer of Scotland, or his son. Sir John 
Halyburton, was created a peer before 2d January 1 447-8. Pa- 
trick, sixth Lord Halyburton of Du'leton, died 1506, being suc- 
ceeded in his title and estate by his eldest daughter Janet, mar- 
ried to William second Lord Ruthven. Their son, Patrick Lord 
Ruthven and Dirleton, was grandfather of John Earl of Gow-

HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



rie, whose attempt upon King James VI., 5th August 1600, 
terminated in his death and forfeiture. It appears that Dirleton 
was the bribe which he held out to the cupidity of Logan of Restal- 
rig to engage his assistance in that affair. Logan in one of his let- 
ters says, " I care not for all the other land I have in the kingdom, 
if I may grip of Dirleton, for I esteem it the pleasantcst dwelling 
in Scotland." On the forfeiture of Gowrie, Dirleton was grant- 
ed to Sir Thomas Erskine, one of the first who came to the assist- 
ance of the King, and who killed with his own hand Alexander 
Ruthven while struggling with James. He was created Lord Dirle- 
ton in 1603, and Viscount Fenton on the 18th March 1606, from 
a property in this parish, — this being the first instance of that title in 
Scotland. He was in 1619 created Earl of Kellie. These titles 
are now held by the present Earl of Marr. Dirleton pppears to 
have passed by purchase from that family to Sir John Maxwell of 
Innerwick, who is known to have had a royal charter of Dirleton, 
Fenton, &amp;c. in June 1631. In 1646 he was created Earl of Dirle- 
ton and Lord Elbottle, both titles being taken from this parish. 
These became extinct on his death before 1653, as he left no male 
issue. His two daughters were, Elizabeth Duchess of Hamilton, and 
Diana Viscountess Cranburn, mother of the third Earl of Salisbury. 

Family of Nisbet of Dirleton. — Dirleton was purchased in 
1663, by Sir John Nisbet, then the most eminent lawyer at the 
Scottish Bar, afterwards Lord of Session and King's Advocate. 
He was second son of Sir Patrick Nisbet of East Bank, Lord of 
Session, was born in 1610, and died in 1688. His only surviving 
child, Joanna Nisbet, was married first to Sir William Scott of 
Harden, Knight; and second to Sir William Scott of Thirlestane, 
Bart. Having no issue he settled his great estates on his nephew, 
William Nisbet of Craigintinny, Member for the county of Had- 
dington in the last Parliament of Scotland, and in the first of 
Great Britain. From him descended the late William Hamilton 
Nisbet, Esq. of Beil and Dirleton, also Member for the same 
county, whose daughter and heiress is married to Robert Fer- 
guson, Esq. of Raith, the present Member for Haddingtonshire 
for which he was returned in 1835. 

The castle of Dirleton, which as a ruin is still in good preser- 
vation, was built by the family of Vaux or De Vallibus, about the 
twelfth century, and from its present appearance must have been 
a large and strong place. In June 1298, when Edward I. invad- 
ed Scotland by the eastern border, no place resisted him except 
the castle of Dirleton. During the siege, about the beginning of 



DIRLETON.

July, the English soldiers, reduced to great scarcity of provisions, 
subsisted on the pease and beans which they picked up in the fields, 
presenting a favourable view of the state of agriculture in East 
Lothian so far back as the thirteenth century. 

After a resolute defence, the castle surrendered to Anthony 
Beck, Bishop of Durham. It was still in the possession of the 
English in 1306, as appears from the Wardrobe accounts of Ed- 
ward I., containing entries of provisions and ammunition for the 
castle of Dirleton. When Cromwell invaded Scotland in 1650, 
thfe castle was, after a gallant defence, taken by Lambert, and by 
him dismantled and reduced to its present ruinous state. 

Ancient Family of Livington. — Saltcoats in this parish, now a 
ruin, belonged to an ancient family of the name of Livington. 
Nisbet in his Heraldry notices a seal inscribed Sig. Patricie 
Livingtoun de Saltcoat, 1593. The first of the family is said to 
have received a grant of land extending from Gulane point to 
North Berwick Law, for having destroyed a boar which infested 
the neighbourhood. This tradition is somewhat confirmed by the 
fact, that the estate of Saltcoats extends from Gulane point almost 
to North Berwick Law, though many other properties intervene. 
The glove by which Livington is said to have protected his arm 
during the combat was sold about fifty years ago, and his helmet 
hung in the family aisle in the church, till very recently, when 
it disappeared. A good painting of the fight was some years since 
in possession of an old servant of the family. There is a small 
stream at the north of the Peffer, called Livington's ford, where 
the boar is said to have been slain. Another account gives to 
Prora a farm in Athelstaneford parish the honour of this exploit; 
one of the fields there being called the ''Bloody Lands," in which 
there is a large stone, evidently raised at considerable expense, the 
name of which is the " Boar stone." This estate of Saltcoats 
came by an heir female to the Hamiltons of Pencaitland, from whom 
it descended to the present proprietor. Lady Ruthven. 

Fentonharns. — Fentonbarns, in this parish, belonged to John 
Preston, Lord of Session from 1596-1609, and Lord President of 
that court, from 1609 to his death in 1616. He settled Fenton- 
barns on his second son. Sir Michael Preston of Fenton, who, 10th 
February 1631, in a quarrel with two brothers of the name of 
Smith, in the neishbourinof village of Drem, killed one, and se- 
verely wounded the other. He was immediately apprehended, tried 
before the Justiciary court, 15tli February, convicted and beheaded 
at the Cross of Edinlnirgh, the same or the next day.

Congalton. — The barony of Congalton in this parish, gave name 
to a very ancient family, that subsisted here for twenty generations 
In the male line. The first on record is Robert de Congaltoun, who 
witnessed a charter of Richard de Mereville, Constable of Scotland, 
without date, but granted about 1162, engraved in Anderson's 
Diplomata. The elder branch of the family succeeding through heir- 
esses to the estates of Hepburn of Keith, in East Lothian, and 
Rickart of Rickartoun, in the county of Kincardine, assumed the 
names of Rickart Hepburn. 

Robert Hepburn Congalton, of Keith and Congalton, — the. 
eighteenth generation of the family, sold Congalton to his brother 
Charles, whose son, William Congalton of Congalton, married 
Mary, daughter of David Bethune, of Balfour in Fife. His son, 
Charles Congalton of Congalton, succeeding to the estate of that 
ancient and distinguished family, of whom was Cardinal Bethune, 
took the name and arms of Bethune of Balfour, and sold Con- 
galton, which was afterwards purchased by the heir-male. Colonel 
Robert Rickart Hepburn, of Keith and Rickartoun, Member of 
Parliament for the county of Kincardine, who, dying in 1804, was 
buried with his ancestors in the church of Golyn. Congalton was 
sold to William Grant, Esq., in whose family it remains. 

«' On 8th May 1509, a Royal Charter was granted by King James 
IV. to Henry Congalton, of Congalton, of the King's Island and 
lands of Fetheray, along with the hill of the castle Monte Cas- 
tri of the same called Tarbet ; also all and whole the King's Is- 
land and lands of Craigleith, with the pertinents of the same, lying 
within the Frith of Forth, county of Edinburgh, and constabulary 
of Haddington, creating, uniting, annexing, and incorporating all 
these islands, lands, and hill of the castle aforesaid, with the per- 
tinents of the same, in one whole and free barony, to be called the 
barony of Tarbet, to be held of the King, paying one penny of 
Scots money, at the said hill of the Castle of Tarbet, in nam.e of 
blench farm if required, along with the marriage of the said heirs 
of Henry Congalton, when it shall happen." Great Seal Regis- 
ter, Book 15, No. 115. 

Ancient Chapels, Spc. — In Golyn parish there were three chapels, 
subordinates to the church. 1 . As early as the reign of William I. 
there was a chapel dedicated to St Nicolas, on the Island of Fidrey, 
the ruins of which still remain. 2. In the twelfth century, Congal- 
ton of Congalton founded a chapel for the use of his family and 
people near Congalton ; the place where it stood is still called 
Chapel. Disputes arose with the Rector of Golyn, but were settled

in ]'224, to the satisfaction of both parties, by the Bishop of St 
Andrews, the diocesan. 3. Daring the reign of Alexander III. 
Alexander de Vallibus founded a chapel at Dirleton, in honour ot 
All Saints, engaging that this chapel should not derogate from the 
Mother Church of Golyn.— At Dirleton, there was founded a col- 
legiate church, with a small establishment, by Sir Walter Haly- 
burton ; its endowment seems to have been inconsiderable, amount- 
ing at the time of the Reformation to L. 20 only.— At Elbottle, 
a name now given to a plantation north of Archerfield, and which 
is an abbreviation of the Saxon word Eldbotel, signifying the old 
dwelling, there was a convent of Cistertian nuns, a cell of the 
great establishment of those nuns, founded by David I. at Ber- 
wick-upon-Tweed.— There was, it is said, another cell of the same 
establishment at Golyn, near the church, probably, however, iden- 
tical with Elbottle. These nuns appear to have acquired a right to 
some of the tithes, and other ecclesiastical dues of the parish of Golyn. 

The ruins of the old parish church of Golyn are still in good 
preservation. A view of these is given in Grose's Antiquities, 
where it is stated that the last Vicar of Golyn is said to have been 
deposed by James VI. for the high crime of smoking tobacco, a 
weed which his Majesty deemed fit only for diabolical fumigations. 
No authority, however, is given for this assertion. Near the 
Chapel's Waas, at the cross roads between Dirleton and Drem, on 
the south, and between Fenton and Kingston on the east, nume- 
rous tumuli have been found ; these were generally formed of two 
pieces of pavement, one on each side ; the same number above and 
beneath, with one at each end. Bones imbedded in black earth 
were frequently found in these graves, which were almost all of short 
dimensions, being about three feet long. The stone of which they 
were formed is not to be found in the parish, unless it be within 
the sea shore, near the Island Eyebrochy. A stone-hammer, 
thought to be of great antiquity, was lately turned up in a field ; it 
is about 8 inches long, and 3 broad at the eye. In draining a 
pond near West Fenton, a piece of pipe about a foot long, insert- 
ed in a stone, was found : no account could be given of it. Not 
very far from the same place, at the junction of the Mill-burn and 
the PefFer, in a field called the Fisher's Nooks, the foundations of a 
good many houses have been laid bare, from which, and from the 
name of the field, it is conjectured that the sea may in former times 
have reached this point. It is now several miles distant from the 
coast.

HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



I am not aware of the existence of any old ballads referring 
to this parish. There is a single couplet preserved, date un- 
known, which has handed down the memory of a man, proba- 
bly the then possessor of a property, now belonging to the Elibank 
family. He is not, however, much indebted to fame. It runs 
thus : 

" For a' that fell at Flodden Field, 
Rouiiy Hood o' the Hvd cam hame." 

Eminent Persons. — Sir John Nisbet of Dirleton, styled by Bi- 
shop Burnet, " one of the worthiest and learnedest men of the age, 
a person of great integrity, and who always stood firm to the law,"- 
was second son of Sir Patrick Nisbet of East Bank, Lord of Ses- 
sion. He was born 1610, admitted Advocate 1633, and rose to the 
head of his profession, in which he was eminently successful, real- 
izing a most ample fortune. He was Lord of Session and King's 
Advocate from 1664 to 1677, being the last person who held these 
two offices together. He died in 1688. His " Doubts and Ques- 
tions in the Law, especially of Scotland," were published in 1698. 
They are esteemed so highly, that Chancellor Hardwicke says of 
them, " Dirleton's doubts are better than most people's certainties." 

In the old pulpit Bible, printed at Amsterdam 1642, there is 
the following inscription: " This book was given to Sir John Nis- 
bet of Dii-letoune, Knight, his Majesty's Advocat, for the church 
of Dirletoune, 12th May 1670." 

Land-oioners. — Mrs Hamilton Nisbet Ferguson is the princi- 
pal proprietor of the parish, and patron of the church. About 
two-thirds of the lands belong to her, and she is the superior of 
nearly the whole. Her kindness and liberality to her tenantry 
are too well known to require any notice, and the estimation in 
which she is held by them all, is the best proof of the interest 
which she ever takes in their welfare. She is the constant friend 
of the poor ; and to her taste, no less than to her liberality, is 
the village of Dirleton indebted for the many marked improve- 
ments which, of late years, it has undergone. 

Mansion-Houses. — The mansion-house of Archerfield, belong- 
ing to Mrs H. N. Ferguson, is the only one in the parish deserving 
notice. It is a plain commodious building, situated in a level park, 
skirted with plantations, and commanding to the east a fine open 
extensive view of the Frith. The other proprietors of any extent 
are. Lady Ruthven, Countess of Dalhousie ; Miss Grant ; Mrs 
J. Bruce ; and James Cochrane, Esq. of Muirfield. The latter 
alone is resident.

Farochml Registers.— The date of the earliest entry in these is 
1656. They consist of three volumes, in very good order, which 
is due to the care of Mr Henderson, the present parochial teacher, 
who found them in great confusion. They have been regularly 
kept, with the exception of a blank of above thirty years, from 
1681 to 1713. 

III. — Population. 

In the old document already referred to, the number of com - 
municants above sixteen years of age, is said to be " never below 
800, never above 900." This is nearly the double of the presentnum- 
ber, and seems to intimate a very great diminution of the popula- 
tion since that period. What that diminution, however, is, it is 
impossible to ascertain, as the number of communicants is mate- 
rially affected by the religious state of the people, and by other 
circumstances besides the amount of the population. 

In the year 1 755, according to Dr Webster, the population of 
this parish was 1700. In this, however, there is obviously some 
mistake, for in the Statistical Account of 1792, it is stated, that 
no great alteration had taken place in the number of inhabi- 
tants for fifty years previous to that date, at which time the popu- 
lation was only 1200. Since that period, however, it has material- 
ly increased ; for according to the census of this year, made by 
myself in visiting the parish, it is 1431. As there has been no 
introduction of manufactures or public works to account for this 
difference, it must be ascribed to the improvements in agriculture, 
requiring a corresponding increase of labourers. The population 
resides principally in four villages. The average number of mar- 
riages is 12 ; births, 32. Of the deaths no account of sufficient ac- 
curacy is kept, to warrant a statement of them. The number of 
proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards 
is 13. 

Character of the People. — The peasantry are in general indus- 
trious, moral, and exemplary in their attendance on religious ordi- 
nances. In dress, there has been of late years a marked advance. 
Their cottages also have been materially improved in comfort and 
cleanliness. The pigstye and dunghill form no longer the fore- 
ground decorations, and in many places, especially in the village of 

• That it lias, however, decreased, the above proves beyond doubt, and 'this is 
coiilirmed by the Act of Parli.iiiient of Kil'i, for transhitiiig'the kirk from Gidane to 
Dirleton, in which tiiu following is given as one of the reasons for the removal : 
" Considering likcwayes that Uie town of Dirlctouiie is aiie flourishing tounc," a de- 
scription scarcely applicable to the present " tonne of IJirlctoun."

Dirleton, have been supplanted by roses and evergreens. In some 
of the lately built cottages, there are two rooms,— an example well 
worthy of imitation, as eminently conducive to the morality, no 
less than to the comfort and health, of the people. 

With a few exceptions, they are all in tolerably comfortable cir- 
cumstances, possessing enough, by prudent and careful manage- 
mentj to support, and clothe, and educate their families. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — This parish contains 7500 Scotch acres, of which 
5325 are arable, 300 under plantation, and the remainder is com- 
posed of links and bent hills. 

With a very small exception, the whole is let on lease for either 
nineteen or twenty-one years; a period considered advantageous 
alike for proprietor and tenant. There are 10 farms above 300 
acres in extent; 5 above 200; two between 70 and 80 ; and two 
between 20 and 30. These are all inclosed chiefly with thorn 
hedges and ditches, where the subsoil is of a retentive character. 
The general size of the inclosures is about 20 acres ; the fences 
and farm roads are thought to occupy nearly 1- per cent, of the 
entire surface. By a recent county regulation, sanctioned by Par- 
liament, every 60 acres of arable land is deemed a ploughgate, 
for which the tenant pays annually L. 1, 16s. as road -money. 

Some of the smaller properties are understood to be let at a 
money rent of from L. 2 to L. 5 per Scotch acre ; the rest of the 
parish, at a grain rent of from 5 to 12 bushels per acre, payable 
by the second fiars, or general average of the county. Gulane 
common forms nearly one-half of the links, but pays rent only for 
the rabbits which it supports ; the other links are stocked with cat- 
tle, and a few sheep occasionally, and yield about L. 400 a-year, 
besides the value of the rabbits, which fluctuates considerably; 
it amounts in some years, for the whole parish, to upwards of L. 800. 

At Gulane there are two establishments for training race-horses, 
the ground in that neighbourhood being favourable for this. The 
average number kept during the summer is about thirty. Whatever 
advantages these estabhshments may confer on the parish in other 
respects, it is to be feared that they do serious injury to the 
morals of the neighbourhood. 

The plantations are chiefly on weak sandy soil ; the thinnings 
produce a small sum annually, but are probably of more value to 
the neighbouring farmers, to be converted into palings, than of di- 
rect profit to the proprietor.

Produce, c— The crops raised are,— Turnips about 200 acres, 
one-third white, the remainder Swedish. Barley about 200 acres, 
the greater part Chevalier; 3 bushels per acre are generally allowed 
for seed. Wheat about 1300 acres,— Hunter's generallylpreferred, 
but the woolly-eared, Belton red, and some other kinds, are sown 
to a limited extent ; from 9 to 14 pecks per acre allowed for seed. 
Oats about 700 acres, two-thirds Angus, the rest chiefly"the po- 
tato sort ; 4 bushels per acre for seed. Beans and peas, and tares ; 
about 600 acres of these are generally grown ; 4 bushels per acre 
allowed for seed. Of potatoes, 100 acres are annually raised, 
about 20 acres are yams; the rest the common varieties, — 10 or 
12 cwt. per acre are allowed for seed. Carrots, lucerne, and 
mangel-wurzel have been cultivated to a very small extent. Clo- 
ver and rye-grass, about 700 acres are annually sown ; two-fifths 
of these are cut for hay, and green food, the rest is pastured. 4 lbs. 
of white, and 8 or ten lbs. of red clover, with occasionally a pound 
or two of yellow, and 2 pecks of rye-grass, is the quantity of seed 
allowed per acre. The rotation of crops is on the fine dry soil, the 
four-course shift, viz. turnips, barley, grass and oats ; on all the 
other kinds of soil, the six course shift is followed, viz. fallow, 
wheat, grass, oats, beans or peas, and wheat. There is occasionally 
a partial deviation from these. Bones are used but to a small extent 
for manure. About 100 tons of rape cake were used last year. 
A very considerable supply of sea-ware also is got after a storm 
from the east. The last Statistical Account states, that at that 
time this was burnt, and yielded about 12 tons of kelpyearly. 
This manufacture has been discontinued since that period. 

Draining. — The draining of the parish is in course of being made 
very complete. Springs have long since been laid dry, and tiles 
are now extensively employed for carrying off the surface water. 
On the soft moorish land, a drain is made in every second farrow, 
or36 feet asunder. The result has been most satisfactory. Twoindi- 
viduals last year made, each, drains to the extent of about 12 miles. 

Live Stock, ic. — The stock consists of cattle and sheep ; of the 
former there are about 468 fed in the parish annually, besides 114 
milch cows ; of the latter, about 100 scores of the Cheviot, Lei- 
cester, and black faced breed. There are about 300 pigs annually 
fed, the most of which are used by the farm-servants. Of horses, 
there are 204 draught horses, and 18 for the gig and saddle : 
about 22 are bred annually. 

The steam-engine for thrashing is coming into general \ise, there 
being now nine in the parish. 



riADDINGTONSIUUE. 



Average produce per Scottish acre: Wheat 36 bushels; bar- 
ley 42 do. ; oats 60 do. ; beans and pease 28 do. ; potatoes 9 tons ; 
Uirnips 24 do. ; hay 180 stones; cow's grass L. 5 ; ewe and lamb 
from 15s. to L. 1. 

Wages. — The population, as already noticed, is almost entirely 
agricultural. The hinds' wages are paid in kind. They receive 72 
bushels oats, 18 do. barley, 18 do. pease, with about 90 yards of an 
18 feet ridge, planted with potatoes; the same extentsown v;ith lint, 
together with their food in harvest. Each hind has also a cow, ge- 
nerally kept on the farm, the keep of which is worth L. 6, which, 
with his potatoes, enables him to keep a pig. Labourers have 9s. 
a-week through the year; young men and boys from L. 1, 10s. 
to L. 5, half-yearly, with their food in their master's house ; and 
women and girls for field or farm labour 6d. to 9d. a day. Black- 
smiths receive from the farmer L. 2, 10s, for a pair of horses. The 
cast metal for the plough, and the new rings for the cart wheels, 
are not included in this. Wrights generally furnish the timber 
for their work ; 2s. 6d. a day is their common allowance. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages, 8fc. — The nearest market- town where the farm pro- 
duce is sold is Haddington, distant seven miles. A very" consider- 
able quantity of the grain, however, is driven to Edinburgh, a dis- 
tance of twenty miles. There are four villages in the parish ; 
Dirleton, with a population of 92 families; Gulane, 59; Fenton, 
40 ; Kingston, 22. 

Means of Communication. — Daily communication is kept up with 
Edinburgh by the North-Berwick coach, which passes through 
the parish, and also by carriers almost every day. There is a daily 
post from Haddington, and two post-offices in the parish. 

The roads are good, though foot-paths are still much needed. 
The turnpike road divides the parish from east to west. The 
fences are also good, and carefully kept, consisting chiefly of hedges 
and ditches. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The original name of the parish, as al- 
ready stated, was Golyn, from the village of that name. The ruins 
of the old church there are still in good preservation. It was de- 
dicated to St Andrew as early as the twelfth century, and was li- 
berally endowed, particularly by the families of Vaux or De Valli- 
bus of Dirleton, and Congalton of Congalton ; in the ancient taxa- 
tion it is rated at the large sum of 80 merks. The church was 
granted by William de Vaux, in the reign of King William I., to 
the monks of Dryburgh, along with its tithes and other pertinents, 



DIRLETON. 



217 



reserving- to his son William the rectory of Golyn during his life. 
This grant included the patronage of the church ; and on the 
death of William de Vaux the rector, a vicar was appointed by 
the monks of Dryburgh to serve the cure. With them the pa- 
tronage continued till the Reformation. On the dissolution of re- 
ligious houses, the lands and patronages belonging to them were 
disposed of by the king. The patronage of Golyn went to the Er- 
skines, Earl of Marr, and Lords Cardross, who got the Abbacy of 
Dryburgh. In an act of Parliament in favour of James Maxwell, 
quoted afterwards, it is ordered that " a charter be expede under 
the Great Seal, granting him and his heirs in the barony of Fen- 
toun, the right of patronage of Dirletoun, parsonage and vicarage 
thereof." Such charter was accordingly expede '25th July 1636. 
The position of the church being at the western extremity of the 
parish, was found very inconvenient, and by the subjoined act of 
Parliament, of date 23d October 1612, it was ordered to be remov- 
ed to Dirleton. It appears, however, that the church only had 
been then removed, the manse and glebe still continuing at Gu- 
lane ; for Mr M'Ghiein his Statistical report of 1627 thus speaks: 
" Siclyke he hath ane manse and ane gleib in Gulane, a long myle 
from the kirk of Dirletoun." Six years after this, these also 
seem to have been transferred to Dirletoun. An act of Parliament 
was passed 29th June 1633, in favour of James Maxwell of Inner- 

• 23d October 1612. Act for translating the kirk of Gulane to Dirleton. 

" Our Soverane Lord and Thri Estaittes of this present Parliament, understanding 
and being crediblie informit that the kirk of Gulane is situat at the outsyde of the 
haill parochin thairof, quilk is ane great parochin, and is sa incommodiouslie situat 
besyde the sea sand, tliat the same, with the kirk yard thairof, is continewallie over 
blawin with sand ; that nather the kirk serves commodiouslie for convening of the pa- 
rochiners, nor yet the kirk yard for thair burial, besydis mony utheris inconvenientis 
staying the saidis parochiners in time of storme and unseasonable weather to convene 
at the said kirk, and considering lykwayis that the towne of Dirletoun is ane floris- 
ing towne, and lyis within the said parochin of Gullane, within the middle thairof, 
and it is the will and intention of the haill parochiners of the said kirk of Gulane 
that the same kirk be transportit fra the said towne of Gulane to the said towne of 
Dirleton, as weill for the ease and commoditie of the arochiners as of the ministers

wick afterwards Earl of Dirleton, who, it will be remembered 
purchased this property shortly before this period narrating that 
" the situation and name of the parish kirk of Gulane are both 
changed, and that the kirk thereof is now situat besyde the toune 
of Diriltoun, and called the kirk of Dirleton, that the minister's 
manse of the said kirk of Gulane is ruinous and the gleib over- 
blown with sand, and that the said James Maxwell of his own free 
good will, and for the zeal he has to God's glory, is content to 
provide another manse and glebe to the minister of the said kirk 
and his successors, therefore ratifying the said alteration of the 
place and name of said kirk of Gulane, and ordaining the same to 
remain in all time coming where the same is presently situat, and 
to be called the kirk of Dirltoun." This account is fully corrobo- 
rated by Mr M'Ghie himself, who gives the following doleful 
statement of his own condition. " The glebe is so overblown 
with sand as the largest aiker thereof has not been manured these 
fyve yeires bygone ; the rest doth scarslie yeild the own seed, as 
is notourlie knowen. And this his stipend is not sufficient, pairtlie 
in respect of the great defect of his gleib, pairtlie in respect of his 
onerous charge of the congregation, and pairtlie in respect of 
his numerous familie, having a wiffe and seven children to sus- 
tane." The present church, situated immediately to the north of 
the village of Dirleton, is in the most eligible situation that could 
have been chosen. It has been repaired lately, and is now capa- 
ble of containing 600 people. The attendance at church is re- 
gularly good : the number of communicants is about 480. There 
are eighty-seven individuals, including children, dissenters in the 
parish. The nearest dissenting chapel is in North Berwick, distant 
two miles and a-half. The manse, situated close by the church, 
was built in 1825; by the liberality of the heritors, it is one of the 
best in the country. The glebe is very nearly 1 1 acres in ex- 
tent, of excellent land, and is at present let for 2 bolls of wheat 
per acre. The stipend is 17 chalders, two of these being wheat, 
71 barley, and 7 meal, besides L. 8, 6s. 8d. in money. 

Benefactions. — The accumulated stock, arising from mortifica- 
tions and other sources, amounts to L. 880, which is lent on bond 
to Mrs H. N. Ferguson, who liberally gives 5 per cent.j paid half- 
yearly. The following bequests are included in the above sum. 
George Livington of Saltcoats, left to the poor 400 merks. He 
died October 23d 1704, aged 41 years. William Nisbet, of Dir- 
leton, left to the poor of Dirleton L. 1000 Scots. He died Oc- 



DIRLETON.

tober 20tli 1724, aged 58 years. John Heriot, former in Castle- 
mains, left to the poor of Dirleton L. 100 Scots. He died March 
19th 1725, aged 60 years. William Nisbet of Dirleton, left to 
the poor of Dirleton, "l. 1000 Scots. He died May 19th 1733, 
aged 35 years. Mrs Carmichael of Saltcoats, with consent of her 
husband, the Honourable Mr William Carmichael of Skirling, 
Advocate, assigned to this session, July 1755, ajaond for L. 100 
Sterling, with interest from Martinmas 1753. Mrs Carmichael 
gave also to this session L. 50 Sterling, for educating poor chil- 
dren in this parish January 1761. At her death in 1776 she left 
L. 20 more, to purchase books for poor scholars at Dirleton school. 
Mrs Hamilton of Belhaven, who died in 1797, bequeathed a le- 
gacy of L. 50 Sterling to the parish of Dirleton, " the interest of 
which to be divided yearly at Christmas, amongst the three oldest 
poor people on the roll, in any way that is most to their comfort, 
over and above what they should have as parish pensioners." 

The weekly amount of church collections averages L. J, 5s., the 
explanation of which will be given under the head Poor Funds. 

Education. — In the Statistical Report of 1627, it is said " we 
have neyther provision, nor foundation for a schoole in all the pa- 
roche, bot a great necessitie thairof, especiallie in the townof Dir- 
iltown, if it could be had." There are now three schools in the 
parish, — the parochial school in Dirleton, and two private schools, 
one in Gulane, the other at Kingston. The average number of 
scholars is as follows : Dirleton 80, Gulane 50, Kingston 80. 
To the last of these a considerable number of the children come 
from the two adjoining parishes. The branches of education taught 
are reading, writing, and arithmetic, and at the parish school, in 
addition to this, Greek, Latin, French, mensuration in all its 
branches, together with geography and book-keeping. The pa- 
rochial teacher has the maximum salary, L. 34, 4s. lOd. The 
school fees amount to about L. 30. The teacher at Gulane is 
generously allowed by Mrs Ferguson, L. 5 per annum, a free 
school-house and garden. The school at Kingston has been 
lately much enlarged and improved, by the liberality of John Dixon, 
Esq. residing there. There are thus ample means provided for 
the education of the whole parish. That this is fully taken advan- 
tage of, I fear cannot be said : nay, I should be inclined to suspect, 
that the anxiety of parents for the education of their children is 
ratlicr declining. This may be ascribed in some measure to the 
depressed state of agricidture for some lime. I am not aware,

however, of any of the rising generation, who are not now in the 
course of receiving the common branches of education ; the heri- 
tors having generously provided means for educating the child- 
ren of the poor. 

Library. — There are three libraries in the village of Dirleton, 
the first the parish library, purchased by collections at the church, 
consisting of 161 volumes, chiefly religious. The second, the sub- 
scription library, of 121 volumes, miscellaneous. The third, of 
130 volumes for the school. There is also occasionally an itine- 
rating library from Mr Brown of Haddington. It is to be feared, 
that they are not so much valued as they ought to be. 

Societies. — In the year 1763, a friendly society for the parish 
was established, " for the support of its members under affliction, 
and for the decent interment of themselves and wives." This so- 
ciety continues still to prosper, having at present 140 members, 
and is in possession of L. 250 of stock. It is open for tradesmen, 
servants, and others, betwixt the ages of sixteen and twenty. It 
has been attended with decidedly beneficial effects ; and it were 
to be desired that it should receive more encouragement from the 
wealthier classes in the parish. 

Savings Bank.— Th&amp;ve is also a savings bank in the parish, in- 
stitutedin the year 1819. The present deposits amount to L. 290; 
the number of depositors is 36 : and perhaps it may be of some 
importance to remark, that the class chiefly benefited by it are the 
female house-servants. 

Poor Funds.— vey\ou to the year 1823, the poor of this pa- 
rish were provided for by assessment. At that time the late Rev. 
Mr Stark, the excellent and able minister of the parish, set him- 
self to the task of eff'ecting an entire change in the administration 
of the poor funds, by substituting voluntary contributions in room 
of the assessment.  That system has been followed ever since, 
with considerable success ; in proof of which the following state- 
ment of the funds, and number of the poor on the roll is given.

From this it is evident, that there has been a considerable re- 
duction in the number of paupers ; but in addition to this, and what 
is of infinitely more importance than the amoint of money saved, 
it is believed that it is promoting in some measure the revival of 
that wholesome spirit of independence which an assessment never 
fails to destroy, and strengthening the power of the relative ties, 
which it so fearfully impairs. It is but fair, however, to add, that 
it is not in the full sense of the word voluntary, as there exists an 
understanding among the proprietors and tenantry that they shall 
contribute a certain sum weekly at the chiu'ch door. This, however, 
is not enforced, and of course the burden of the support falls upon 
the more generous, and on those who are most regular in their at- 
tendance at church. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

We have already stated our belief, that, since the time of the 
Statistical Report of 1627, the population of the parish must have 
diminished very considerably, though to what extent, or from what 
precise cause, it is impossible to ascertain. Since the period of 
the last Statistical Account 1792, in consequence of the improve- 
ments in agriculture, it has materially increased, the number be- 
ing then 1200, and now 1431. It is somewhat singular, however, 
that the average number of births and marriages, so far as can be 
ascertained, of that and the present period, is very nearly the same ; 
while it is beUeved that, in the present, there is a considerable di- 
minution in the deaths. 

The real rental of the parish was, in the year 1790, L. 6000, 
and is now supposed to be about L. 10,227, or nearly the same as 
the valued rental in Scots money. No account is given in the re- 
port of 1627 of the gross rental, but the rent per acre seems to 
have varied from one to two bolls, for we have many such state- 
ments as the following : " George Home has 6 aikers worth in 
yearlie rent to him 6 holies. Patrick Lindsay has eleven aikers 
worth 20 bolls." The crops cultivated by the last report were,

Of potatoes it is said, in the former Report, " they now consti- 
tute a great part of the living of the common people, and are much 
cultivated." At present there are 100 acres grown. The land under 
cnltivation was then 4020 acres ; at present, 5325. Mr Nisbet of 
Dirleton was beginning then to plant trees. Now there are 300 acres 
under wood. " The people were then beginning to enclose their 
fields now there is hardly one open field in the parish — and the 
contrast between the present and past state of the roads will be 
sufficiently understood, when it is stated that, fifty years ago, one- 
half of the road between Dirleton and North Berwik was repaired 
every spring by the very primitive method of ploughing, rolling, 
and harrowing. 

There seems to have been no assessment at that time, and the 
number on the poor roll was 40 ; atpresent,with our increased popu- 
lation, we have only 25. In the dress of the peasantry there is a 
marked improvement; the homely articles of domestic manufacture 
being now entirely supplanted by others of a finer and more elegant 
texture. 

The wages of male house-servants have risen considerably. They 
were then from L. 6 to L. 7, now from L. 8 to L. 12 ; female house- 
servants then had from L. 2, 10s. to L. 3, now from L. 4 to L. 9. 
The condition of the hinds also is improved. They now receive 
24 bushels of oats annually more than at that period, and as more 
valuable varieties of oats and barley are now cultivated, the addi- 
tional advantage to them from that source is equal to a stone at 
least of meal on every quarter of grain which they receive. The 
keep of the cow is also superior to what it was then. In regard 
to education, it is not easy to form any comparative estimate. 
There is little reason, however, to believe that any great progress 
has been made ; the education of the old people appearing to be 
of very much the same character, and equally widely diffused 
as among the rising generation. In respect of morals, there is 
the same difficulty in coming to an accurate opinion. The 
general impression, however, of those who have lived longest in 
the parish, is decidedly favourable to the present time. We 
know not whether the following extract from the kirk-session re- 



DIRLETON. 



223 



cords of 3d December 1671 will warrant an inference in favour 
of the improved state of the parish. It is curious, however, and as 
such we give it. " Given to ye sklatter, Patrick Thomson, 
for sklatting a part, and pointing another part of the church, 4 
hb.; to his servant for drink money 3 B, 4d. And spent with him 
in drink 6 B. 8d. ; for nails 15 B. ; sum of all the particular pro- 
ceedings 5 lib. 5 B." 

In the absence of authentic sources of information, we cannot 
speak decidedly , yet we think it may be confidently presumed 
that a progressive improvement in the moral and religious charac- 
ter of the people must have accompanied the faithful and devoted 
exertions of their late pastor, who, for so many years, ministered 
among them. To testify their sense of his worth, and their value 
of his services, an elegant obelisk, with a just tribute to his me- 
mory inscribed, has been erected by the parishioners of Dirle- 
ton.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

REV. ROBERT BURNS THOMSON, MINISTER, f 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish seems always to have been 
the same, with a shght difference in the orthography, being some- 
times written Spott, and sometimes Spot. It is a name which ap- 
pears not inappropriately to have been given to it, on account of 
its retired sheltered situation. 

Extent and Boundaries.' — The parish is ten miles long, and five 
broad. - It is intersected by an extensive tract of land, which till 
lately was in a state of common, and known by the name of Dun- 
bar common, and considered to belong to the parish of Dun- 
bar. It is now divided; and whether the portions of it contiguous 
to other parishes are now to be regarded as forming part of these 
parishes, has not been determined. Were it not for the interpo- 
sition of this common, the parish of Spott would be of an irre- 
gular oblong figure. It is bounded on the north by Dunbar ; on the 
east by Dunbar and Innerwick ; on the south by Cranshaws ; and 
on the west by Stenton and Dunbar. 

Topographical Appearances. — The whole parish is an alterna- 
tion of hill and dale, the hills gradually increasing in height 
till we reach the highest ridge of this part of Lammermuir, 
700 feet above the level of the sea. Doon hill, which is situated 

• This includes the occasional poor, and also four lunatics. 

+ This Account was furnished, while the ]arish was vacant, at the request of the 
Superintending Committee, by the Rev. .lohn Thomson, Prestonkirk. 



SPOTT. 



225 



about a quarter of a mile south west of the village, is upwards of 
550 feet above the level of the sea. 

Hydrography. — There is nothing deserving the name of a river 
in the parish. The largest rivulet is Spott water, which runs 
through the valley in which the church and village are situated. 
It is joined, a little farther down, by a smaller brook, which runs 
close by the mansion-house of Spott, and it falls into the sea at 
Broxmouth, where it takes the name of Broxburn, There is an- 
other on the south side of the parish called Bothwell water, which 
falls into the Whitadder near Cranshaws. Springs are nume- 
rous on the banks of the rivulets. The town of Dunbar is sup- 
plied with water from St John's well, in the neighbourhood of the 
village. Kisthill well, near Bothwell, was once held in repute for 
the cure of scorbutic complaints. 

Geology. — The geology of the Lammermuir hills is too well 
known to require any lengthened description. They are com 
posed almost entirely of grauwacke, distinctly stratified, through 
which trap rocks are to be seen protruded in various, places. 
There is also a considerable extent of old red sandstone, filling up to 
a certain level most of the valleys, especially along the courses of 
the different rivulets. There occurs also a considerable portion 
of conglomerate, which is composed of fragments of all the rocks 
which are to be found in the district. The irregular range of hills 
which are to be seen along the northern base of Lammermuir, in 
this parish, and the neighbouring parish of Innerwick, where we 
first meet with cultivated ground, is chiefly composed of this con- 
glomerate, at least so far as the writer of this has been able to dis- 
cover. Doon hill seems also to be formed of this. On the south, it 
is cultivated to the summit, and on the north side, which is very pre- 
cipitous, much resembling some of the trap rock hills which fre- 
quently occur farther to the north and west in the county, it is 
covered entirely with wood. The ridge of rising ground, which 
is lower down on the opposite side, of Spott water, is composed of 
a red-coloured sandstone, which occurs throughout the whole of 
the ridge, stretching eastward to the sea coast at Broxmouth, and 
westward as far as the parish of Yester, It is quarried in the pa- 
rishes of Dunbar, Spott, Stenton, Whittingham, and Bara. It 
varies a little in colour at different places. Whether it be the 
same formation, which occurs at these several places, the writer 
IS not prepared to say : so far as he has seen, it is nowhere inter- 
rupted by trap rocks.

Soil. — The soil is in general light and sandy, well adapted for 
the cultivation of turnips. But there is a considerable extent alsa 
of clay-soil, about a fourth perhaps of the parish. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Events. — The principal historical event connected 
with this parish, is the battle of Dunbar or Doonhill, fought be- 
tween Cromwell and General Leslie, on the 3d of September, in 
the year 1650. The latter had pitched his camp on the summit 
of Doonhill, where he might have held at defiance the army of 
the Commonwealth, had he not, contrary to his own better judg- 
ment, been forced by the indiscretion of the clergy, who accom- 
panied his army, " to descend into the plain, with a view of at- 
tacking the English in their retreat. Cromwell, looking through 
a glass, saw the enemy's camp in motion, upon which he exclaim- 
ed,  The Lord hath delivered them into my hand,' and gave 
orders immediately for an attack. The Scots, though double in 
number to the English, were soon put to flight, and pursued with 
great slaughter." The remains of the encampment are still dis- 
tinctly to be traced on the top of the hill.f 

Land-Owners. — The chief land-owners in the parish are : James 
Sprot, Esq. of Spott, patron of the parish ; Colonel Carfrae of 
Bowerhouses, both of whom have residences in the parish. ; the 
Duchess Dowager of Roxburghe ; the Earl of Haddington ; Sir 
George Grant Suttie of Balgone ; and Mrs Hamilton Nisbet 
Ferguson of Biel. 

" Hume's History. 

f A minister of Spott, named John Kello, was executed in 1570, for the murder 
of his wife, Margaret Thomson. As the case is altogether a singular one, the cir- 
cumstances connected with it may be here briefly detailed. The murder was com. 
mitted on a Sabbath. Having before divine worship suspended his wife behind a 
door in the manse, he repaired to the church where, in the course of the service, he 
was remarked to have delivered a more than usually eloquent sermon. The services 
being over, and the congregation dismissed, he went to the residence of a neighbour, 
stating to the lady of the house, that his wife Mrs Kello had for some time been 
rather in a depressed state of mind, and that he had called to request that she would 
kindly come over and join them in their family dinner, and endeavour to cheer her 
up. The request was at once complied with. On arriving at the manse, to the 
seeming amazement of both, the doors and windows of the manse were found barricad- 
ed. After some little time, Mr Kello contrived to elFectan entrance : A few moments 
after, he came running to a window, exclaiming to the lady who accompanied him, 
" My wife, my wife, my beloved wife, is gone." Kello being a man who had credit 
for real piety, was never for a moment susjiected of having periJct rated the murder. 
Such crimes, however, seldom escape the Divine vengeance, even in t/iis world. Some- 
time after, being confined by indisposition, he was visited by Mr Simpson, then 
minister of Dunbar, to whom he related that on the jircceding night he had dreamt 
a distressing dream regarding his wife. This Mr S., probably from some suspicions 
in his own mind, at once applied to the dreamer, saying in the words of the Prophet 
Nathan to Davidi " Tho7t art the man." Conscience stricken, he made a full confes- 
sion of his crime, and was executed at Edinburgh shortly afterwards.

Parochial Registers.— The earliest date of the parochial regis- 
ters is, of births 1748, of marriages 1789. There is no register 
of deaths. The above appear to have been regularly kept. 

Jntiquities.— Besides the remains of General Leslie's camp on 
Doonhill, there are still visible the remains of another camp on a. 
hill to the south-west of the village, supposed to be of Roman, or 
perhaps Danish origin. Part of an ancient spear was lately found 
near this camp, and is now in possession of the proprietor of Spott. 

The parish and village of Spott was of old renowned as the 
habitation of witches. In the kirk-session records, dated 1698, 
we find the following statement: " The session, after a long ex- 
amination of witnesses, refer the case of Marion Lillie, for impre- 
cations and witchcraft, to the presbytery, who refer her for trial to 
the civil magistrate ; the said Marion generally called the Rig- 
xooodij witch :" and in October 1705, " many witches burnt on the 
top of Spot Loan." It is generally believed, that the last witch 
who was executed in Scotland was burnt at Spott ; a stone com- 
memorative of the event, and marking the place of execution, is to 
be seen a little way to the east of the manse. 

Modern Buildings. — Of these, the principal are the mansion- 
houses of Spott and Bowerhouses, The former is delightfully 
situated at the foot of Doon hill, on the side of a ravine formed 
by the rivulet mentioned above, and commanding a beautiful and 
extensive view of the flat country about Dunbar — the Bass Rock, 
Isle of May, and south-east coast of Fife. The latter, though 
situated considerably lower down, near the northern boundary of 
the parish, commands the same extensive view. Spott House has 
undergone considerable repairs since it came into the possession 
of the present proprietor. The mansion house of Bowerhouses is 
entirely new, and not yet fit, indeed, for habitation. The parish 
church is very old, and cannot boast of any beauty, either in point 
of architecture or situation. Part of it is said to be Saxon. The 
parish school-room, and schoolmaster's house, have been lately re- 
built, and are both elegant and convenient. There are two oat- 
meal mills in the parish.

228 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



• The population seems to have decreased materially between 
1755 and 1801, probably owing to the farms having been redu- 
ced in number, and increased in size ; the number of farmers in 
1730 having been 21 ; in 1791, 7 ; now in 1836, there are 6 resi- 
dent and 2 non-resident.

The whole number of proprietors of land of the yearly value 
of L. 50 and upwards, is 6. 

Popular Customs. — These are the same here as in other parts of 
East Lothian. The custom of going about as guyzards, on the 
evening before new-year's-day, once universal and not confined to 
the lower orders, is now gradually falHng into disuse. Old Handsel 
Monday is strictly observed as a holiday, in every part of this 
county ; on that day, all the younger branches of a family as- 
semble together, and spend the day in the house of their parents, 
and all work is most scrupulously abstained from. 

Character of the People. — The farm-servants in East Lothian 
enjoy the comforts of society, according to their rank in life, to a 
greater degree than the working-classes in most other parts of the 
country ; and though the gains of the hinds or married plough- 
men have from the low price of grain, in which their wages are 
paid, been for some years past considerably diminished, they are 
in general well contented with their condition, industrious, and 
devoted to the interest of their masters. Their ordinary food con- 
sists of wheat or barley bread, mostly baked by themselves, pork 
and salt herrings, potatoes and oatmeal porridge. Tea is very gene- 
rally used by the females; and in the Lammermuirs oatmeal cakes 

" There is no register of deaths, but the above is the number given in he former 
Statistical Account, whicli cannot be far from the truth as to the iresent jieriod, the 
number of births and marriages, and the amount of the whole population liavinn- been 
almost the same then as now. Births were 1 I if, marriages 4 J, whole population 6iy.

are used, but they are wholly unknown among the peasantry in the 
low part of the county. The people, as is generally observed in all 
agricultural districts, are remarkable for honest industry: and 
in so for as their external moral conduct is concerned, they are un- 
doubtedly superior to those of the manufacturing districts. Smug- 
gling has long been unknown on this coast. Poaching in game is 
perhaps more or less practised. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— T\ie number of imperial acres which have been 
cultivated is, as nearly as could be ascertained, 2800 ; the num- 
ber which have never been cultivated, in the part of the parish 
to the north of Dunbar common, is 980. The extent of the farm 
of Bothwell, which lies to the south of Dunbar common, detached 
from the rest of the parish, and of which very little is fit for cul- 
tivation, the writer of this Account has been unable to ascertain. 
There may be about 100 acres of wood in the parish, mostly 
natural, on the steep sides of conglomerate hills ; except what is 
found surrounding the mansion-houses of Spott and Bowerhouses. 

Bent. — The valued rent of the parish, as stated in Sir J. Sin- 
clair's Statistical Account, is L. 4355, 3s. 3d. Scotch. The mo- 
dern rent is exceedingly variable. The land in the low part of the 
parish lets as high as the average of good turnip land in other parts 
of East Lothian. The rent is paid according to the middle fiars 
prices of wheat, and varies every year. Some of the muir farms 
are rated so low as 3s. 4d per acre. 

Rate of Labour. — The rate of farm-work, when paid by the week, 
is from 9s. to 10s. in summer, and 8s. in winter. Married farm ser- 
vants, hired by the year, receive in grain, potatoes, cow's grass, and 
other perquisites, what has been computed, according to the low price 
of grain for the last two years, not to exceed 8s. per week, which 
is lower than the wages of an ordinary.day-labourer — only it must 
be taken into consideration, that the pay of the latter ceases when 
he is unable to work from sickness, which is not the case with the 
former. Young unmarried men, when hired as ploughmen, re- 
ceive from L. 4 to L. 7, per half-year, with bed and board. Ma- 
sons' and carpenters' wages are generally 3s. per day in summer, 
and 2s. 3d. in winter. These rates of labour are not given as what 
are pecuhar to this parish, but what are common in the district. 

Live-Stock. — Grazing being practised to a considerable extent 
by the principal ftirmers, a corresponding attention is paid to the 
breeds of cattle and sheep. All the improved breeds introduced 



230 



HADDINGTONSMIllE. 



into the county by John Rennie, Esq. of Phantassie and others, 
are grazed on the various farms ; and great numbers of sheep of 
the Leicester, Cheviot, and black-faced breeds, and of black and 
short-horned cattle are annually fattened on turnips. 

Hushandry. — It is needless to say, that the general character 
of husbandry pursued is of the most improved kind. This parish 
can boast of some farmers as much distinguished for zeal, and en- 
terprise, and success, in their profession, as any in East Lothian. 
Turnips are cultivated to a great extent, and on some farms the 
land is grazed always for Uio, and occasionally for four or five 
years. There are various rotations followed, according to the va- 
rious soils. On what is considered a heavier soil, the ordinary 
rotation is, 1. turnips; 2. barley or wheat; 3. two years grass ; 4. 
oats. On the lightest soils, the following is the rotation : L tur- 
nips; 2. barley, or wheat; 3. grass for three years, and occasion- 
ally for four or five years ; 4. oats. On a strong clay soil the ro- 
tation is either, L fallow; 2. wheat; 3. one year grass; 4. oats; 
or, 1. fallow; 2. wheat; 3 grass; 4. oats; 5. beans and pease; 
6. wheat. A considerable extent of waste meadow or muirland has 
been reclaimed, and brought under the plough, on the north base 
of the Lammermuirs. Bones, rape-dust, and other manures, not 
the produce of the farm-yard, are more or less used by every far- 
mer. The general duration of leases, and that which is found to be 
most advantageous, for both landlord and tenant, is nineteen years. 
The state of farm-buildings and enclosures, is in general good. 
It would be an improvement, were slates used instead of tiles. 
The roads, in this parish, with the exception of that between Spott 
village and Dunbar, are not in very good repair. 

Produce. — The annual average gross amount of raw produce, 
raised in the parish, is, as nearly as can be ascertained, as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, L. 11836 0 0 

turnips and potatoes, 4043 0 0 

Yearly value of laud in grass, 2544 0 0 

Total, L. 17425 0 0 

Manvfactures. — The only thing of this sort carried on in the 
parish, is a manufactory of potato-starch, or flour, on the farm 
of Easter Broomhouse. It employs six women for six months 
in the year. The flour is principally used by manufacturers of 
cloth ; and sometimes by bakers and confectioners in large towns. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market- toums. — The nearest market-town is Dunbar; Iut the 



SPOTT. 



231 



greater part of the grain raised in the parish is sold at Hadding- 
ton. Dunbar is the market from which the common necessaries 
of life are procured by the inhabitants of the north part of the pa- 
rish. Those in the west part of it may sometimes resort to the 
village of East Linton, in the parish of Prestonkirk, or to the vil- 
lage of Stenton; while those in the extreme south most frequent- 
ly resort to Dunse. The only village within the parish, is the vil- 
lage of Spott. 

Means of Communication.— Bunhar is the post-town. The vil- 
lage, being situated about two miles from Dunbar, and several 
parts of the parish being still nearer it, the inhabitants enjoy abun- 
dant and easy means of communication with other parts of the 
country, by the stage coaches which pass and repass through that 
town, every lawful day. And travelling will be still more facilitat- 
ed in this county, if the railway, which is now in contemplation 
between Dunbar and Edinburgh, be proceeded with. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated close by the 
village, and in so far as the population may be supposed to be 
denser there than in any other part of the parish, though it does 
not contain above a fourth of the inhabitants of the whole pa- 
rish, it may be said to be in as convenient a situation as could 
well have been chosen. It is at a great distance from the Lam- 
mermuir part of the parish, the farm of Bothwell being fully eight 
miles from it. But, with this exception, there is no place much 
farther off than four miles. The inhabitants of Bothwell are not 
numerous, and generally attend Divine ordinances in the church 
at Cranshaws, which is much nearer to them. The church at Spott 
is very old. The precise date of the building of it is not known. 
It was repaired in 1790, and though in a quite sufficient state, can- 
not be said to be very comfortable. It is seated for 350. The 
whole of the sittings are free. The manse was built in 1806 ; and, 
though comparatively new, has already undergone repeated repairs. 
The extent of the glebe is 6 Scotch acres, worth about L. 3 per acre. 
The stipend is 16 chalders, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. The number of male heads of families on the roll of com- 
municants is 71. The number of dissenting families is 16. Pub- 
lic worship is regularly and respectably attended. 

Education, — Besides the parochial, there has been for a long 
time a subscription school, which, however, is at present without a 

 The stipendin 1753 was L. 63, 17s. 2d. ; in 1759, it was augmented to L. 1000

teacher. In both schools, all the ordinary branches are taught. The 
parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary or what is equivalent, 
and all the legal accommodations. The expense of education is in the 
parochial school, 2s. 6d. per quarter for English reading ; 4s. for 
writing ; and 5s. for arithmetic. It is not supposed that there is any 
one in the parish of a proper age who cannot read. All the young 
people learn to write ; nor, is it supposed that there are many, if 
there be any at all, of the older inhabitants, who cannot write. Of 
this a pleasing proof was afforded a few days ago, at the modera- 
tion in a Call to the gentleman who has been recently presented 
to the vacant charge of this parish, on which occasion upwards of 
50 persons, male heads of families, in the rank of ordinary plough- 
men, signed the call, in presence of the Presbytery, in a legible 
and respectable hand. 

Libraries, — The only library in the parish is a branch of the 
East Lothian Itinerating Libraries. 

Friendly Societies. — The only society of this nature is one to 
which there are several similar in the county, — the object of 
which is to assist a hind in replacing his cow, when she unfortu- 
nately dies. The members pay 8s. or lOs. annually. No member is 
permitted to kill his cow, even when rendered useless by accident- 
al injury. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons who re- 
ceive parochial aid, is from 12 to 16. The average allowance to 
each in ordinary circnmstances, such as widows, and aged infirm 
persons, is 6s. per month. The poors' funds are from weekly col- 
lections at the church door, which amount to the average sum of 
L. 6, 6s. per annum ; from an assessment which averages L. 50 per 
annum ; and from the interest of L. 200 Sterling, and 400 merks 
Scotch, or L. 222 Sterling, originally mortified by Lord Alexander 
Hay of Spott, for behoof of the poor of the parish, which at pre- 
sent amounts only to L. 5 per annum. 

Ale-houses. — There is but one ale-house now, and there was 
but one at the period of the last Statistical Account ; nor does it 
appear that they have ever been more numerous. 

Fuel. — The fuel used in the lower district of the parish is coal, 
procured at Dunbar, to which place it is brought by sea from Eng- 
land and Fife, or at the coal-pits in the western part of the coun- 
ty. The former costs in general, from 7d. to Is. per cwt,, but 
it varies in price ; the latter costs just now at the pit 5d. per cwt.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNBAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. ADAM FORMAN, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Nme. — The name Innerwick otherwise Ennerwick, seems to 
be compounded of two Saxon words, denoting an inner hamlet — 
a description which exactly corresponds to the actual locality of 
the village of Innerwick. That village is situated somewhat inland, 
and at the distance of about a mile and a half from Thorntonloch, 
a hamlet in the same parish. These two villages, as lying, the one 
farther from the sea, and the other nearer to it, may be accurately 
characterized by the comparatives, inner and outer. Innerwick 
too, may be called inner, or farther from the sea, in reference either 
to a hamlet, now very inconsiderable, at the Skateraw shore, in 
the same parish, or to the neighbouring village of East Barns, in 
the parish of Dunbar. There is no need, therefore, of resorting to 
that mode of explaining the name, according to which it denotes 
a place at the mouth of a river or stream, a description which is 
strictly applicable neither to the castle, nor to the village of In- 
nerwick, inasmuch as both are at some distance from the point 
where any stream that passes them joins the sea. To this deriva- 
tion it might also be objected, that it seems somewhat unnatural 
for a village or castle to be named from its specific relation to a 
stream so small ; and also, that J;he theory implies that the name 
Innerwick — as being formed of the Celtic word Inver in combi- 
nation with the German word Wic — is heterogeneous in its com- 
position. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish is about ten miles in length, 
and from two to three in breadth. It is bounded on the north-

east by the German Ocean ; on the east, by the parish of Oldham- 
stocks ; on the south, by those of Cranshaws and Longtbrmacus ; 
and on the west and north-west, by those of Spott and Dunbar. 

Topographical Appearances. — The coast, which is about 2 miles 
in length, is rock, but somewhat tame, being characterized neither 
by those rugged precipices which occur in the adjoining parish of 
Dunbar, nor by those still more elevated crags which, farther to 
the east, in the parishes of Cockburnspath and Coldingham, form 
such noble barriers to the sea. From the shore the land slopes 
gradually upwards towards the Lamnermoors. The part of the 
parish which lies between that hilly boundary and the sea pre- 
sents a scene of fertile and cultivated fields, but might be improv- 
ed, in respect of picturesque beauty, by an addition of wood skil- 
fully disposed over the now bare surface that intervenes between 
Thurston and Branxton, and stretches from the village of Inner- 
wick downwards to the shore. The very want of objects to inter- 
' cept the eye, however, contributes to give a peculiarly free and 
lively character to the view which that village commands of the 
neighbouring sea, while of this lower district, considered as a whole, 
the otherwise monotonous character is somewhat diversified and 
relieved by the plantations of Thurston and Branxton. Along 
the line where the northern and more fertile district of the pa- 
rish passes into that hilly tract which constitutes its southern di- 
vision, a good deal of picturesque scenery occurs. There may be 
little in that locality to satisfy the taste for nature in her more 
graceful or majestic forms — but the lover of simple and seclud- 
ed beauty may there find wherewithal to be gratified, in the ra- 
vine with its wild and wooded sides, that stretch precipitously 
down to the rocky bed of its gurgling stream — the dell with its 
blooming banks — and the outstretching valley, from whose verdant 
slope the shepherd's hut looks peacefully down upon the travel- 
ler beneath. That part of the parish which, commencing at this 
hilly boundary, stretches southwards for about seven miles towards 
Berwickshire, is bleak and desolate — besprinkled, however, with 
cottages and farm-steadings ; affording both pasture for cattle, and, 
here and there, a soil capable of producing crops, and now under 
cultivation ; and occasionally enlivened by the verdure of the val- 
ley, and the freshness of the stream. 

Hydrography. — The inhabitants of this parish are copiously 
supplied with water, and much of what is used for domestic pur- 
poses is remarkable for its excellence. There is no large river 

3 



INNKKWICK. 



235 



In the parish, but the two following streams may be noticed : — the 
Monynut, which, rising at the centre of the parish, proceeds 
southwards along the hilly ridge called Monynut Edge, and at 
length diverging towards the east, proceeds in a south-east course 
to Berwickshire, where it joins the Whitadder at Abbey St Ba- 
than's ; and the Thornton water, which, rising almost at the same 
point as the Monynut, flows through the parish from south to north  
and, after being applied to the use of a grinding-mill about half 
a mile from its mouth, enters the sea beside the village of Thorn- 
tonloch. 

Geology. — The geological structure of the parish of Innerwick 
appears on the whole to be simple, yet by no means destitute of 
interest ; especially on the sea coast, and in several situations in 
the higher part of the district. The parish may be divided general- 
ly into two great portions, the high and the low: the one being com- 
posed almost entirely of a coarse conglomerate, which appears to 
belong to the old red sandstone formation, the latter constituting a 
portion of the coal formation. The first mentioned rock, viz. the 
conglomerate, forms, as we would perhaps expect, the most elevated 
portions of the parish, presenting in almost all of them the same 
general appearances, being composed almost entirely of fragments 
of greywacke and grey wacke slate coarsely cemented together, and 
constituting in many places large and elevated mountain-masses. 
Frequently standing out from this conglomerate, we meet with 
thick strata of a coarse sandstone, and frequently also the conglo- 
merate is traversed by projecting dikes or veins of trap. The part 
of the parish where these are most numerous, is in the neighbour- 
.hood of the farms of Aikengalls and Elmscleuch, where the 
geological appearances present themselves in a shape so curious 
and fantastic, as to have given rise to the popular idea, that the 
fairies once upon a time had here their dwelling-place ; for the ap- 
pearances now alluded to are generally known in the neighbourhood 
by the name of the « Fairies Castles." The scenery may be 
thus described. The country is hilly, with many deep intersect- 
mg valleys, through each of which flows a stream scarcely per- 
ceptible in summer, but in winter forming a very considerable tor- 
rent. The beds of these little streams are wide, and formed of an 
immense and very deep deposit of channel, the debris of the moun- 
tain-tract through which they flow. In these valleys the old red 
sandstone, or rather the sandstone conglomerate before alluded to, 
IS the prevailing rock. Jutting across these valleys, however, we oc- 



236

casionally meet with thin and sometimes pretty lofty masses of 
trap-rock generally a sort of claystone porphyry;  and so simi- 
lar are the appearances to a regularly built wall with a quantity 
of coarsely cemented building on either side of it, that the term 
" castle" has been not unnaturally applied to them. This conglo- 
merate may be traced in many other parts of the parish, occur- 
ring in great abundance on the farm of Woodhall. We have not 
been able to discover with any exactness where the old red sand- 
stone ceases, and the rocks of the coal formation begin. It seems 
to be, however, a little north of the village of Innerwick, in a direc- 
tion from east to west — the change of formation being probably 
a very gradual one ; that is, the one set of rocks probably passes 
into the other, without any visible junction or marked difference 
of external characters. Atthelittle hamlet of Thornton, and at In- 
nerwick Castle, the rocks appear to be those of the coal formation, 
and from this latter place, they seem to continue in a straight line 
westward to the several farms named Pinkerton, in the parish of 
Dunbar. The lower portion of the parish, viz. the district between 
the localities last mentioned, Thornton, Innerwick, &amp;c., and the 
sea, being covered with a deep and fertile soil, we have scarcely 
any opportunity of observing in it either the characters of the fun- 
damental rocks, or the order and manner in which the different 
strata present themselves. These can be observed only on the sea- 
coast with anything like regularity or satisfaction, and our remain- 
ing observations, therefore, shall be restricted to a very general de- 
scription and examination of it. The sea-coast of this parish com- 
mences a little eastward from Thorntonloch, where a little stream, 
which flows into the sea, separates it from the adjoining parish of 
Oldhamstocks. The shores of this latter parish are a continua- 
tion of those of Cockburnspath— the exact designation and era 
of the rocks composing which have been much disputed by geo- 
logists. Latterly, however, it seems to be agreed that they are 
to be considered a very old portion of the coal formation — an 
opinion which, as we travel westward to the shores of Innerwick, 
gradually receives stronger confirmation, that is to say, while, 
in the parish of Cockburnspath, we have only sandstone, indura- 
ted marl, and a coarse kind of slate clay or shale, we find, as we 
advance westward, the other and undoubted members of the coal 
formation gradually displaying themselves. U'hese additional rocks 
are limestone, clay, ironstone, bituminous shale, and, occasionally 
cropping out about high-water mark, thin seems of the coal itself,

the characterizing- rock of the formation. The organic remains 
also, especially the vegetable impressions in the sandstone, are ex- 
actly those which occur in undoubted districts, in other parts of 
the country, composed of the coal formation. Such then, are the 
rocks at Thorntonloch — there, indeed, only partially visible, owing 
to the sands which cover them, but again emerging to view a little 
farther westward, where, at a slight angle towards west north-west, 
they pass under the magnesian limestone, which here is not in any 
great abundance, and which in its turn is covered a few yards west- 
ward by pretty thick beds of the encrinite, or mountain limestone 
of English geologists. At the point where this change takes place, 
the strata of the sandstone, shale, &amp;c. are a good deal jumbled and 
confused, and the dip or inclination of the limestone strata becomes 
suddenly much greater. The magnesian limestone in the si- 
tuation now described has the usual characters of that rock in 
other situations ; but the first, or rather uppermost bed of the 
mountain limestone which rests upon it, presents a more interest- 
ing appearance, viz. a pretty thick stratum or reef, if we may so 
call it, of extinct corals. The particular species we have not been 
able exactly to ascertain. The genus, however, is clearly Caryo- 
phyllea. The original forms are preserved with much freshness 
and accuracy, and afford a subject of inquiry and speculation deep- 
ly interesting and curious. Other organic remains and impressions 
might be noticed as occurring in this mountain limestone ; but it 
is time that these observations were brought to a close. Continu- 
ing, therefore, our observations still westward from the situation 
now described, the mountain limestone, in numerous and succes- 
sive strata, may be said to form the rest of the shore of this parish, 
being burned to a very considerable extent in the farm of Skateraw ; 
from which place a large portion of the agricultural district ad- 
joining both in Berwickshire and East Lothian, is supplied with it. 
Attempts have been made on the property of Mr Hay at East 
Barns, on the confines of this parish, to discover coal. The par- 
ties interested were sanguine in their expectations, but they have 
lately, and probably wisely, abandoned their exertions. 

Botany. — The botany of this parish may be considered as a 
good deal similar to that of Cockburnspath, which has been pretty 
fully described in the account of that parish. There are some strik- 
ing plants, and here and there rather an interesting botanic sta- 
tion. But we have observed no plants which are not enumerated 
in the account of the above parish.

Trees. — The planting of wood has been carried on to a consi- 
derable extent on the estate of Thurston, by the present proprie- 
tor, and also by his father. The grounds immediately around the 
mansion-house comprehend a variety of the hard woods. Some of 
the trees are upwards of a hundred years old. In the year 1783, 
a part, amounting to 160 imperial acres, of what formerly consti- 
tuted Innerwick common, was planted with fir by the late Mr 
Hunter of Thurston. The wood thus planted has made very dif- 
ferent degrees of progress, and some of it, so lately as last year 
1835, appeared, though still alive, not to have advanced at all. 
On the whole, however, this somewhat bold effort of planting has 
succeeded, and Thurston High Wood, as this piece of scenery is 
called, forms a fine variety among the neighbouring hills. On 
farms belonging to the estate of Thurston, a few small plantations 
have been formed. At a place, in the western part of the parish, 
called by the various names, or varieties of the same name. Wood- 
ley, Woodyley, Waldalee, and Weatherly, the banks of a ravine 
are clothed with what appears to be natural wood, the wild beauty 
of which breaks finely in on the surrounding scenery. Much of 
the wood is oak, and the whole covers seventy acres. At the op- 
posite extremity of the parish, the property of Branxton, which is 
planted to the extent of thirty-six acres, exhibits trees of consi- 
derable age and growth ; and wood, but in small quantity, forms 
one of the objects in that scene of simple beauty where the Castle 
of Innerwick mingles its grey ruins with the fresher elements of 
nature. The names Braidwood, Woodhall, Woodley, and perhaps 
also, Aikenyall, Elmscleuchj Birkiemuir, and Monynut, afford rea- 
son for supposing that the places in the parish which they respec- 
tively denote were formerly wooded, as, indeed, Woodley still is. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — Under this head, a few details may be given re- 
specting the state of property in the parish in ancient times. From 
David I. Walter Stewart received the manor of Innerwick. The 
grant was confirmed in 1157 by Malcolm IV. ; and the superiority 
of the Stewarts over Innerwick continued till the time of Charles 
II. Ranulph de Kent, one of Walter's vassals, obtained from 
him a right to a merk of silver annually from his mill of Innerwick ; 
and in the thirteenth century, a family called Glay — also, it is 
probable, attached to the Stewarts by the law of vassalage,— held 
part of the estate. In the time of David II., Isabel, daughter of 
Roger de Glay, by her marriage with John de Hambleton, second 



INNERWICK. 



239 



son of Sir Walter Hambleton of that Ilk, introduced the inheri- 
tance into a family from whom, by this connection, sprang the 
Hamiltons of Innerwick, ancestors of the Earl of Haddington. In 
the thirteenth centm-y, by a grant from Stewart, a person of the 
name of Lindsay became possessed of Thurston. Walter de Lind- 
say of Thurstoun was appointed a nominee by Robert Bruce, on 
occasion of the competition for the crown ; and next year, his manor 
• was visited by Edward I. — in the words of Rymer, " Capellamanerii 
domini Walteri de Lindsay, in quo tunc dictus dominus, rex hospita- 
batur." At the accession of Robert II., John de Lindsay gave 
the lands of Thurston to John Wallays; but whether the locality now 
called Wallace-mill derives its name from this family, from the re- 
nowned Sir William Wallace, or from neither of these sources, is 
uncertain. In the time of Regent Morton, Thurston belonged to 
a person called in Godscroft's History of the Houses of Angus and 
Douglas Ci'aigiewallace, a descendant, perhaps of the John Wal- 
lace now mentioned. In that work, too, the following story relative 
to Thurston is related : George Hume of Spott, displeased with 
Alexander Hume of Manderston, to whose son he had promised 
to give a daughter of his own in marriage, disposed of her and also 
of bis estate to a son of the Regent. The lands of Thurston lay 
near to those of Spott. The former, although the property of 
Craigiewallace, were possessed by George Hume of Wedderburn, 
whose predecessors have been supposed to have held them for eight 
or nine generations, the tenure being lease and good-will. Wed- 
derburn, giving possession to Craigiewallace of the lands of Dun- 
donald, himself retained those of Thurston. But the latter, hav- 
ing got the Dundonald property confirmed to him as his own by 
the King's agents on royal lands, sought to dispossess him. Wed- 
derburn, however, still kept possession. The Regent, hearing of 
the circumstances, and influenced by the vicinity of Thurston to 
Spott, offered to buy from Craigiewallace his right to the former. 
He also inquired of Wedderburn, however, what he would have 
for his right to the disputed estate. Wedderburn replied, that he 
desired nothing but his own, and that only that could satisfy him. 
The Regent intimated that he had bought the estate. " No one 
but yourself," said Wedderburn, " would have done so, nor would 
you had you not been Regent." A decreet of removal was ob- 
tained against him, and he, on his part, set about building on the

lish King.

lands, to show that he was not about to remove. At length mat- 
ters were arranged by the mediation of William Douglas of Loch- 
leven. Wedderburn got half of the lands, including the manor- 
house, with full right of property ; to the other half he resigned his 
claim. Without tracing the changes in the possession of Thur- 
ston and the other properties of the parish downwards to the pre- 
sent day, we may mention that the name of Wedderburo, so pro- 
minent in this little scrap of local history, subsequently became ♦ 
connected with the baronies of Thornton and Innerwick. In 1 670 
or 1671, Sir Peter Wedderburn of Gosford obtained a grant of the 
former, and about the same time he came- into possession of the 
latter. 

Heritors. — The present heritors of the parish are, Mrs Ferguson 
of Dirleton and Biel ; Mr Hunter of Thurston ; Mr Balfour of 
Whittingham ; the Marquis of Tweeddale ; Sir George Suttie of 
Balgone ; Sir John Hall of Dunglass ; and Mr Allan of Bushelhill. 

Parochial Registers. — These commence with 1608, and consist of 
several volumes. They seem to have been generally kept with care 
and precision. Of ecclesiastical disciphne and superintendence in 
the seventeenth and earlier part of the succeeding century, the re- 
cord is copious and minute. The following circumstances amidst a 
multitude of others are recorded : — That in September 1659, a Sun- 
day-fast was appointed by the session, in reference to the anticipat- 
ed destruction of the corn-crops by incessant rain, and an apparent 
want of piety among the people; that in May 1661, a day of 
thanksgiving was appointed for the King's return, the minister, how- 
ever, cautioning the congregation against observing it as a sacred 
festival or anniversary holyday, and, in that respect, on a level with 
the Sabbath; that in October 1662, the minister, not conforming 
to Episcopacy, took leave of his people, the two parting from each 
other as the record expresses it, like mother and child, when the 
latter is snatched from her breast ; and that in the seventeenth 
century, church collections were made at Innerwick for a harbour 
at North Berwick, bridges at Linton and Whitekirk, and persons 
taken prisoners by the Turks. 

Antiquities.— \nx\exW\ck Castle, of which there are still consi- 
derable remains, was probably built in feudal times, as a security 
to the Scottish border. It was an inheritance of the Stewarts 
who, for so long a period, held a superiority over the neighbouring 
lands, but at length became a baronial stronghold of the Hamil-- 
tons of Innerwick. In 1403, in which year the Earl of Dunbar 

4 



INNEKVVICK; 



241 



led the Northumbrians as far as Innerwick, the castle, in which 
Chalmers conjectures that an English garrison was left on the 
occasion, was taken and laid prostrate by the Regent Albany. 
Along with Thornton Castle, a house of Lord Home's, which stood 
on the opposite bank of a little glen, Innerwick Castle W'as at- 
tacked by Protector Somerset, when he invaded Scotland.  Of 
these two fortresses, the former has almost entirely disappeared ; 
of the latter there are still some remains. They stand at the 
distance of about half a mile from the village of Innerwick, a 
little to the north of the road between it and Oldhamstocks. 
" Decay's effacing fingers," however, have been at work on the ve- 
nerable pile, and, in the course of the last few years, its ruins have 
become still more ruinous. A view of Innerwick Castle is given 
in Grose's Antiquities. It has also afforded a subject to the pen- 
cil of Mr Thomson of Duddingston. 

On Blackcastle-hill, the name of which indicates it to have 
been the site of a structure that has now passed away, there are 
some remains of an old encampment. 

" Of this attack the following account is given by Patten, who accurately describes 
the two fortalices as " set both on a craggy founilacion, and devided a stone's cast 
asunder by a depe gut, wherein ran a little ryver :" — " Thornton belonged to the 
Lord Hume, and was kepte then by one Tom Trotter ; whereunto my Lorde's grace 
over night for summons, sente Somerset, his heraulde, towards whome I III. or V. 
of this capitaynes prikkers, with their gaddes ready charged, did right hastely direct 
their course ; but Trotter both honestly defended the heraulde, and sharply rebuked 
hys men, and said, for the summons he would come speake with my lorde's grace 
himself, — notwithstanding he came not, but straight lockt up sixteen poor soules, like 
the souldiers of Dunglas fast within the house, toke the keys with him, and com- 
manding them they should defend the house, and tarry within as they coulde not 
get out till his returne, whiche should be on the morrow, with much municion and 
relief, he with his prikkers prikt quite his ways. Anderwyke perteined to the 
Lorde of Hambledon, and was kept by hys Sonne and heyre, whom of custume they 
call the master of Hambledon and an VIII. more with hym, gentlemen for the moste 
part as we harde say. My Lorde's grace at his comming nye, sent unto both these 
piles, whiche upon summons refusing to surrender, were straight assayled, Thorn- 
ton by batrie of I III. of our great peces of ordinaunce, and certain of Syr Peter Mew- 
tus hakbutters to watch tlie loopholes and wyndows on all sydes, and Anderwyke by 
a sorte of the same hakbutters alorie, who soo well besturd them, yt whear these kepers 
had ramed up their outer dores, cloyd and stopt up their stayres within, and kept 
themselfes aloft for defence of their house, above the battilmentes, the hakbutters gat 
in and fyred them underneth ; whereby beying greatly trobled with smoke and 
smoother, and brought in desperation of defence, they called pitifully over their 
walls to my Lorde's grace for mercy, who notwithstandinge their great obstinacie, 
and the xsamplc other of ye enemies mought have had by their punishment, of his 
noble generositie, and by these wordes making half xcuse for them. Men may some 
tymc do yt hastely in a gere, whereof afterwards they niai soon repent them, did take 
them to grace, and thearfore sent one straight to them. Buterethc messenger came, 
the hakbutters had gooten up to them, and killed VIII. of them aloft ; one lept over 
the wallcs, and running more than a furlong, after was slain witiiont in a water." 
Similar were the proceedings at the neighbouring Clastic of Thornton. Of that for- 
tiilicea great part was demolished on the occasion. ' I'he rest," adds Patten, " stood 
all to be shaken with rifles and chykkes." Of that stronghold, accordingly, the very 
nuns have now almost utterly disapiieared.

A little to the south of Innerwick Castle, on the right of the Old- 
hamstocks road, slight remains are still visible of a structure, re- 
moved some years ago, called Edinkens Bridge — a name which 
has been traced, by conjecture or tradition, to Edwin, King 
of Northumbria. In a mortification, issued at the beginning 
of the eighteenth century, by William Nisbet of Dirleton, as 
recorded in the kirk-session books, this edifice is called the 
Bridge of Edincain — a name which almost exactly coincides with 
the present one of Edinkens Bridge. In the course of the suc- 
ceeding century, however, it is called, in the parochial registers. 
King Edioard's Bridge ; and in the former Statistical Report of 
the parish, it bears the name of Edirkens, which is there traced 
to that, not of Edioin, but of Edward. Near this bridge there 
stood, some years ago, four large stones, such as might be sup- 
posed to indicate the burial-place of some distinguished person. 
These were removed a considerable time ago ; but last year  1835 
the place where they stood was identified, and a subterranean exa- 
mination instituted at the spot. Besides a few small stones, which 
were found at the depth of four feet — not enclosed, however, in 
any kind of coffin — a large urn was discovered, surrounded with 
black ashes, and containing a quantity of bones very white, and 
apparently burned. Among these was a small under~jaw, as if of 
a female, or young person. The urn, when found, was inverted, 
and its situation was quite , shallow. From these details it might 
be rash to deduce any decided historical results. But if some dis- 
tinguished individual named Edwin was here interred, it is proba- 
ble either that the conjecture of a gentleman who took an active 
part in the investigation is true, that the person in question was a 
Northumbrian prince, who was slain in the eleventh century, when 
flying from William the Conqueror to the residence of Malcolm 
IV., and not the King from whom the city of Edinburgh de- 
rives its name, who is recorded to have died at an entirely different 
place, or that the name of Edinkens originated in the indivi- 
dual from whom Edinshold, on the hill of Cockburnlaw, among 
the neighbouring Lammermoors, is called — supposing that indivi- 
dual, who is represented with something of the character of a 
freebooter, to have been identical with neither of the Northum- 
brian princes already mentioned. 

Chalmers speaks of two beautiful tumuli, apparently sepulchres, 
as existing in the parish of Innerwick ; but what mounds he means, 
by the description, is uncertain. The failure to discover to what 



INNERWICK. 

the learned author refers, may be accounted for by the effect of 
agriculture in levelling the soil. Several stone coffins have been 
met with in the parish. Two of these, inclosing a ring and part 
of a sword, were found, some years ago, on the farm of Skateraw. 
There has been preserved apretty little vase,foundon another of the 
farms. Some of the sepulchral relics, which have been found in such 
abundance in the parish of Innerwick are probably the remains 
of bloody warfare. A field near the village of Innerwick, known 
by the name of the Corsikill Park, is pointed out as the scene of 
an encounter between Cospatrick and Sir William Wallace. 

There stood, at one time, on the Skateraw shore a chapel, de- 
dicated to St Dennys. Remains of such an edifice were visible 
some years ago, but have now yielded to the sea. Bones, found 
in the vicinity of the spot, give reason for supposing that a bury- 
ing-ground was connected with the chapel. An old and time-worn 
parish church was taken down about fifty years ago. 

HI. — Population. 

The records of baptism seem to indicate that, in the 17th and 
earlier part of the 18th century, the parish of Innerwick was some- 
what more populous than it is at present. The following is a list 
of the population, at several successive periods, as given in the 
Government census, and other authoritative documents : — 



Population in 1755, . 941 

1.791, . 960 

1801 . 846 

1821, . 924 

1831, . 987 



At present the population may be reckoned somewhat fewer than 
the last of these numbers.

The parishioners of Innerwick are chiefly engaged in agricul- 
ture. They, in general, possess a considerable share of the com - 
forts and conveniences of life. They are, on the whole, industrious 
in their habits, and decent in their outward conduct. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The lower part of the parish, consisting of be- 
tween 3000 and 4000 imperial acres, is laid out in corn, pasture, 
and wood ; and although in the hill-lands, which consist of about 
two-thirds of the parish, stock-farming is chiefly practised, even 
there several hundred acres are under cultivation. The followino- 
may be taken as a pretty accurate view of the distribution of the 
land : — 

Number of Scots acres in the parish, . 9300 
under tillage, . 4000 
in natural pasture, £000 
under wood, . 800 

There are fifteen farms in the parish, which differ widely in ex- 
tent and value. 

Rent of Land. — Towards the end of the eighteenth century, 
the rental of this parish was L. 4000. It rose to L. 15, 000, but 
is now reduced to about L. 9500. The rent of land varies greatly, 
according to its quality. Here, as elsewhere, farms have now be- 
gun to be let by the fiars. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of wages for day-labourers is, for 
men, Is. 6d., for women, lOd., a-day. The provision afford- 
ed to hinds consists of barley, oats, peas, cow's grass, potatoes, 
coals, and lint-money, and amounts in value to about L. 25 per 
annum. Eighteen or twenty days' shearing serves as their house 
rent. 

Live Stock. — About 5000 sheep are kept on the hill-district of 
the parish. These are Cheviots, black-faced, and a breed be- 
tween the two. Those pastured in the lower district are chiefly 
of the Leicester breed; and, after being bought in in autumn, 
are kept for a year, and then sold off". Some, however, are fed for 
a shorter time, at the charge of so much per head. Few black- 
cattle are now bred in the parish. Some, however, are bought 
in and fattened on turnips, and then sold off". 

Husbandry. — The arable soil of this parish is partly light and 
partly a heavy clay. To the latter, a six-shift rotation of crops 
is applied; to the former, a five-shift course. The six-shift is the 
following: 1. fallow, with manure — in some cases, turnip; 2. 



INNERWICK. 



245 



wheat; 3. grass; next, oats; then, beans; and lastly, wheat. 
The five-shift is as follows: — 1. turnip; 2. spring-wheat, or 
barley ; 3. grass, for two successive years ; and, finally, oats. 
Turnips are pretty extensively grown. These are consumed partly 
in the fields by sheep, and partly in the farm-yard by larger 
cattle. Messrs J. T. and W. Lee, late tenants in this parish, 
were three of the first farmers in the county by whom turnips were 
grown to any considerable extent. Drilhng is generally practised, 
nor is it confined to wheat and turnip crops. Farms adjoining the 
sea have the benefit of sea-ware, which is to be found on the shore 
in great abundance. Lime and bone-dust are also used in this 
parish as manure. Wheat is sown from October to March ; bar- 
ley from March to May ; oats in March ; and turnip at the end 
of May. Thirlage is in use to some extent. 

Most of the farm-houses in the lower part of the parish are 
excellent. Stone fences, as well as hedges, are usual. The for- 
mer are preferred by the tenant, and are increasing. There is a 
steam thrashing-mill on the farm of Thurston ; on that of Craw- 
hill considerable labour and expense were devoted, some years ago, 
to the erection of a water-mill. The stream from which the water 
is supplied, flows, through a little valley, considerably below the 
level of the steading. A mine was forced through the solid rock 
to the extent of thirty-six yards, and a pit sunk at the end of it to 
the depth of forty feet. In this the wheel was placed. A dam- 
head was erected among the rocks of the valley. The expense 
incurred was about L. 800. There is one flour and meal mill in 
the parish. 

The duration of farm leases is generally either nineteen or twen- 
ty-one years. 

Quarries. — There are indications of coal having been formerly 
wrought in this parish, but that branch of labour is not now in use. 
At the Skateraw shore limestone is regularly wrought and burned. 
Much of the stone, however, that might otherwise be turned to 
good account is rendered difficult to work by the depth of the in- 
cumbent soil. The lime prepared here is of excellent quality. In 
the time of war, limestone in considerable quantity was sent from 
Skateraw to the Devon iron-works. Now, however, it is ahiiost 
always burned before the material is dispatched. A large portion 
of the Hme goes to Berwickshire. Freestone is wrought in the pa- 
rish, when needed for local purposes. 

Fishery.— Tvio boats belonging to this parish arc eniphyod in

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets. — The market-towns resorted to are chiefly Dunbar, 
Haddington, and Dunse. From the village of lunerwick, the first 
of these is four miles distant ; the others are more than thrice as 
far. 

Villages. — The villages of the parish are Innerwick and Thorn- 
tonloch. The former is situated at the distance of about a mile 
from the London road. It lies at the foot of a steep but cultivat- 
ed hill. It is tolerably neat and clean, but in its appearance some- 
what straggling and irregular. Thorntonloch lies on the coast, 
almost close to the London road. It is occupied to a considerable 
extent, though not exclusively, by the servants of the adjoining 
farm. Many of its cottages are very bad. 

Means of Communication. — About two miles of the great road 
between Edinburgh and London are in this parish. The Mail, 
the Union, and a Berwick coach, which all run daily on that road, 
afford expeditious and convenient means of travelling. The other 
roads in the lower district of the parish are kept in good repair, 
and afford great facilities for the conveyance of produce to market. 
There is no post-ofiice in the parish, but by letter-carriers and 
other means of communication a tolerably regular conveyance of 
letters is secured from the post-town of Dunbar. A carrier pas- 
ses through the parish, by the London road, once a week on his 
way to Edinburgh, and once a week on his return. A small har- 
bour at the Skateraw shore, erected some years ago by the late 
Messrs Brodie of Thorntonloch, and Lee of Skateraw, is used for 
the exportation of lime, and the importation of coal. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Walter Stewart, to whom, as has been al- 
ready stated, was granted by David I, the manor of Innerwick, 



INNERWICK. 



247 



presented the church, with certain pertinents, to the monks of Pais- 
ley. This grant was confirmed by Malcolm IV. and, in the twelfth 
century, the Episcopal authority of St Andrews declared in fa- 
vour of the monks holding possession of the church, and assigned 
to the vicar a garden near the burying-ground, and some other 
land. The monks retained the church of Innerwick until the Re- 
formation. In 1670, Sir Peter Wedderburn obtained a grant of 
the rectory and vicarage tithes. The present patron is Mrs Fer- 
guson of Dirleton. 

The church, which was built in 1784, is a very plain structure. 
It stands on an elevation in the village of Innerwick, and is con- 
veniently situated for the lower part of the parish ; but most of the 
families who reside in the hill-district are at a distance of from five 
to eight miles from their parish-church. To the greater part of 
these, however, the church of Cranshaws, or that of Abbey St Ba- 
than's, is much nearer. In the church of Innerwick, as in those of 
other country parishes, the seats are distributed among the farms. 
A few sittings, however, have been let at a small specified sum. 
The attendance, as compared with that of many parishes, is good, 
but even in this respect there is room for improvement. By far 
the greater number of families in the parish belong to the Esta- 
blished Church. About 120 persons, however, including children, 
are Dissenters, chiefly of the United Secession. Five elders are 
associated with the minister in the care of the parish. 

In an ancient Taxatio the church of Innerwick is valued so 
low as thirty merks. The present stipend is 16 chalders, half 
barley, and half oats ; exclusive of L. 10 for communion elements. 
The last augmentation occurred about twelve years ago. The 
teinds are not by any means exhausted. The manse was enlarg- 
ed and repaired a few years ago, and is now a handsome and com- 
modious house. The glebe consists of five acres of arable laud, 
and is let at L. 3 per acre. There is no grass glebe. 

Education. — There are two week-day schools in the parish, 
both of which are in the village of Innerwick, viz. the parish 
school, and a private school for girls under the charge of a fe- 
male teacher. The attendance at these varies according to the 
season of the year. In winter there are, at the two together, 
about 120 scholars. Some children belonging to the parish go 
elsewhere to school. The fees in both schools are moderate. 
There is a pervading disposition among parents to give their chil- 
dren a common education, and most of them are in circumstances 



248 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



which enable them to do so. Destitute children are kept at school 
by the heritors aud kirk-session. There are two Sabbath schools 
in the parish, which are taught, the one by the minister, and the 
other by two of the elders. A mortification by Hector Foord of 
Branxton provides for six college bursaries — a preference to be 
given, failing his own relations and persons of his own name, to in- 
dividuals born or educated in the parishes of Innerwick or Dunbar. 

Libraries. — A parish library has existed here for several years. 
There are also two small itinerating libraries, — the one stationed at 
Innerwick, the other at Thorntonloch. Those who avail them- 
selves of these means of improvement are fewer than might be 
wished. 

Poor. — At present 18 persons derive regular assistance from 
the poor funds. Occasional aid is also granted. These sup- 
plies are given from the interest of L. 1000 laid out on security, 
together with the church collections. As to the source from which 
the principal sum was obtained there is' some uncertainty. It ap- 
pears, however, from the session books, that, according to an Act 
of the reign of James VIL, the stipend of crops 1698 and 1699 
was mortified by William Nisbet of Dirleton for the repair of the 
bridge of Edencain, and the assistance of the poor of Innerwick — 
the annualrent of the balance, laid out on security, to be devoted 
to the latter object. 

Fuel. — Peat and coal are both used as fuel. Coals are brought 
from Fife and Bo-ness to the harbour of Skateraw. A few months 
ago a ton cost about 12s. There has lately been a considerable 
advance of price. 

Alehouses. — Of these there are 2 in this parish ; the one in 
the village of Innerwick — the other at Thorntonloch bridge, on the 
London road.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN SMITH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
JsJame. — It can hardly be doubted, that the parish of Aberlady 
takes its name from the village. The word, however, is of un- 
certain etymology. From the well understood meaning of the 
prefix Aber, it has been conjectured that the stream now called 
the Peffer was in ancient times styled the Leddie, and that Aber- 
lady is the village which stands at the mouth of the Leddie or 
Peffer, or its influx into the Frith of Forth. Such at all events is 
its situation. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is about 3 miles long by 
about 2| broad, with an irregular boundary-line. It contains an 
area of between 6 and 7;gquare miles, or about 4000 imperial acres, 
almost the whole of which are arable, and have been cultivated. 
It is bounded on the north and north-west by the sea ; on the 
north-east by the parish of Dirleton ; on the south and south-east 
by that of Haddington ; and on the south-west by that of Glads- 
muir. 

Topographical Appearances. — The greater portion of the parish 
is flat, rising very slowly from the level of the sea, and no part of 
it reaches any considerable elevation. But though without variety 
of hill and dale, it has a pleasing aspect, and the views from almost 
every part of it towards the north and west are singularly beautiful. 
It is not easy, indeed, to imagine a prospect more splendid and 
varied than that which comprehends the Frith of Forth in its 
widest expansion, and ever enlivened with sails, the Pentland 
hills, Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh with its spires, monuments and 
castle, Inchkeith, the Lomond hills, and the peaks of the Gram- 
pian mountains towering in the distance. These and many other 
mteresting objects, all happily combined, present a picture to the 
eye universally and justly admired. 

Hydrography . — There is very little running water within the 



250 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



parish, and the inhabitants are supphed chiefly from wells. The 
supply thence derived, however, is abundant, and the quality 
wholesome. A brook or burn, indeed, rises in the higher grounds, 
and running in a north-west direction, nearly through the centre 
of the parish, falls into Gosford bay, but it is at no time consider- 
able, and is dry, or nearly so, every summer. Another small stream 
forms the south-west boundary of the parish, and pureues a similar 
course, but its channel is also empty during[the summer's drought. 
The principal stream, though still very inconsiderable, connected 
with the parish is the PefFer, which after a sluggish course of about 
five miles over a bed of clay, enters Aberlady bay from the east, 
at Luffness point. It is distinguishable, however, at low water 
about a mile further west, and near this point is the harbour or 
rather anchorage ground of Aberlady. At spring-tides vessels of 
sixty or seventy tons burden can ascend the bed of the PefFer 
thus far, and lie tolerably secure ; but they cannot easily get out 
to sea again when the wind is westerly. This harbour or anchor- 
age ground is, in virtue of a royal grant, confirmed by the Scottish 
Parliament in 1633, the Port of Haddington ; but the grant is 
unproductive, as the trade is trifling. Throughout the whole of 
this parish, the coast is low, and the tide retires from it in some 
points to a great distance. Still, howeve, the water seems to be 
gaining, though very slowly, on the land, partly, perhaps, from the 
operation of general causes, and partly from the habit of quarrying 
and carting away the natural bulwarks against the encroachments 
of the sea. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — It is not supposed that, with the ex- 
ception of some rocks a little to the west of the anchorage-ground 
already spoken of, any part of this parish has attracted much at- 
tention from the geological inquirer, nor is it believed that it will 
yield on the whole any considerable harvest to the cultivators of 
that important and interesting science. Everywhere along the 
shore, there are manifest proofs that the sea stood at a higher level 
at some remote era than it does now, or has done within the 
period of historical record ; and it is not to be questioned that much 
of that which is now well cultivated and productive land was once 
swampy and worthless. The soil of the parish is of various quality. 
Near the sea it is light and sandy ; the sand having been evi- 
dently blown from the beach, and in some places covering, to the 
depth of a foot or more, land bearing indubitable traces of former 

cultivation. A little further inland, there is a considerable breadth 

4

of clay soil, not naturally fertile ; and it is only when the land begins 
to rise with a gentle elevation to the south that the soil is generally 
good. Here, however, it is of excellent quality ; and, being well 
suited to the production of every kind of crop, amply repays the 
labour of the farmer. There is neither freestone nor limestone 
quarry in the parish. Lime rock, however, exists in abundance, 
but as lime may be had more conveniently in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood, it is not burnt. It is not doubted that some seams of 
coal, in connection with the great coal-field of Mid-Lothian, run 
through the parish, but no attempt has ever been made to work 
them, nor is it believed that any such attempt could be made with 
advantage, A good deal of whinstone is quarried along the shore 
for the use of the roads in the neighbourhood, and it is reckoned 
very well suited to the purpose. 

Botany. — It is not believed that any plants deserving the ap- 
pellation of rare are now to be found in the parish. Those which 
are not frequently observed in other districts are still common in 
the neighbourhood. There are no woods of natural growth in the 
parish ; and though extensive plantations have been made within 
the last fifty years, for ornament and shelter, there is in this re- 
spect still room for improvement. Near the sea, trees seldom grow 
luxuriantly, partly, it is probable, from the sandy nature of the soil 
in which they have been planted, partly from the force of the 
winds, to which they are in a peculiar degree exposed, and 
partly from the saline particles with which these winds are impreg- 
nated. A very little way inland, however, trees of every species 
commonly planted, seem to thrive at least moderately well, and 
there are many trees and shrubs in the parish of much luxuriance 
and beauty. 

Zoology. — There are no wild animals peculiar to the parish, and 
it is not remarkable for " breeding any species of cattle of distin- 
guished quality, f;ize, or value." It abounds in hares, pheasants, 
and partridges ; and rabbits and wood-pigeons are so numerous 
as to be in no small degree injurious. Lapwings and curlews visit 
us in considerable numbers in autumn ; and during the winter 
months, the bay is frequented by large flocks of wild geese, by dif- 
ferent sorts of plovers, and by many varieties of the duck tribe. It 
abounds also in cockles, mussels, and in some of the smaller sorts 
of shell-fish ; but, in an economical point of view, they are of little 
value, and mussels, at least, are much less plentiful than formerly. 
Climate. — The climate of this parish is dry and salubrious. The 



252 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



winters are singularly mild, and, in sheltered situations, many of the 
tenderer shrubs succeed remarkably well. The east wind in spring is 
keen and piercing, but less so than in some of the neighbouring pa- 
rishes; the weather in autumn is generally clear and bracing ; and, 
on the whole, the climate may be considered as more than com- 
monly conducive to health and enjoyment. Ague, which was for- 
merly prevalent, is now unknown ; and the inhabitants seem to be 
altogether exempted from peculiar disease. 

II. — Civil History. 

Aberlady does not appear to have been ever the scene of any 
very memorable event, nor is it famous in history as the birth-place, 
or place of residence, of any very eminent man. After passing 
under different arrangements, through the hands of various fami- 
lies, more or less distinguished, it is now divided into three estates, 
the proprietors of which, in the order of their valued rent, are, 
Lord Elibank ; the Earl of Wemyss and March ; and the Ho- 
nourable Sir Alexander Hope. They have all seats in the parish ; 
but the two last named only reside in them. 

Ballencrieff, the seat of Lord Elibank, occupies a fine and com- 
manding situation, is surrounded by some stately trees, and enjoys 
a most extensive prospect. — Gosford, the seat of the Earl of Wemyss 
and March, has had vast sums expended on it, since it came into 
the possession of that noble and very ancient family, and from the 
amenity of the situation, and beauty of the grounds, may justly 
be considered as a very pleasing residence. The house is distin- 
guished amongst the mansions of the Scottish nobility, by a very 
large collection of pictures ; most of them by the ancient masters, 
and many of them of the highest merit. — Lnffness, the seat of Sir 
Alexander Hope, has been much improved and adorned, by the 
taste of the present proprietor, and has an air of antiquity about 
it, from which it derives no small degree of interest. 

Antiquities. — There are few remains of antiquity in the parish. 
The fortalice of Kilspind/, which stood between the village and 
the shore, and which at the date of the former Statistical Account, 
was in no very ruinous state, has been swept entirely away. It 
was built in 1585, by Patrick Douglas, grandson of Sir Archibald 
Douglas of Kilspindy, a man of no small note in his time. He was 
Treasurer of Scotland in the minority of James V., and much con- 
fided in by his nephew, the Earl of Angus, substantially Regent of 
the kingdom. Subsequently, however, he shared in the forfeiture 
of the " Douglases," and died in exile. — Eedhoitse, or Redhouse 
Castle stands on the margin of the small stream which separates 



ABEltl.ADY. 



263 



the parish from Gladsmuir, and, though now utterly m ruins, seems 
to have been a mansion of considerable extent. The date of its 
erection is not exactly known, but it was probably built towards the 
close of the sixteenth century, or perhaps at a still earlier period. 
The situation is imposing ; and it has attached to it an extensive 
garden with an excellent exposure, and well stocked with fruit 
trees, still productive. The lands of Redhouse were held in the 
fifteenth century by the " Laings," one of which family was Trea- 
surer of Scotland in 1465, Bishop of Glasgow in 1473, and High 
Chancellor in 1483. From this family, the estate came by mar- 
riage into the hands of Sir Andrew Hamilton, brother of the 
first Earl of Haddington, and with that gentleman's heirs, it con- 
tinued till the last of them lost both lands and life, for having en- 
gaged in the Rebellion of 1745. The house of Luffness is part- 
ly of very ancient date. It stands within a small fortification, con- 
structed by the Fi-ench General " De Thermes," in 1549, in order 
to straiten the English garrison in Haddington, by preventing it 
from receiving supplies by sea ; and the ditch and rampart are still 
most distinctly visible. It appears to have answered its intended 
purpose, as the garrison in question, being reduced to great extre- 
mity for want of provisions, was soOn after withdrawn. In 1551, this 
fort was ordered to be destroyed ; but the house was allowed to 
remain as private property. A few hundred yards west of Luff- 
ness may be observed the remains of a small religious edifice, said 
to have been a convent of Carmelites or White Friars, to whom 
David II. granted a charter of confirmation as a mark of his fa- 
vour ; and near it, there are evident traces of fish-ponds, which 
a little trouble would restore. An hospital is said to have been 
founded at Ballencrieff, in the twelfth century, and dedicated to 
St Cuthberti and there was another at Gosford Spital in con- 
nection with the collegiate church of Dunglas, but at neither place 
are there now any remains of ancient buildings. Along the coast, 
westward towards Longniddry, stone coffins and human bones 
have been very frequently dug up, and there seems to be little 
doubt, that, at some very remote period, this has been the scene 
of fierce and bloody contention. 

Parochial Registers, — The records of this parish go back twc 
hundred years, but,as happens very commonly throughout Scot- 
land, they do not appear to have been at any time very exactly 
kept ; nor would it be safe to build on them any conclusions in 
statistic science.

From the above statement, it appears that the population of the 
parish has not been subject for a long period to any remarkable 
fluctuations; and that it is considerably larger now than it was 
eighty years ago. It is doubted, however, whether the increase 
stated in the returns be not rather seeming than real, and whether 
' the apparent addition to the population in this and in many other 
rural parishes be not mainly owing to the greater accuracy with 
which the late enumerations have been made. This accuracy, it 
is natural to suppose, has gone on increasing ; and it is conceived 
that, from negligence and other causes, the early accounts of the 
population of many parishes are much beneath the real amount. 
At one period, it is well known, the people had in general no small 
dislike to be nutnbered; at another, from the operation of the 
miUtia laws, they thought they had an interest in concealing the 
number of their families ; and it is only of late years that there are 
few or no hinderances in the way of a correct enumeration. It is 
not, accordingly, considered as at all certain that the population of 
this parish is greater now than it was a century ago. The village 
of Aberlady has doubtless increased in size and in the number of 
its inhabitants, but in the country part of the parish the popula- 
tion has as certainly diminished ; and this state of matters, it is 
believed, is very general throughout Scotland. A great increase 
there i&amp;, without question, on the whole ; but it has taken place 
chiefly, if not entirely, in the villages and towns. 

Character and Condition of the People.— The character of tie 
people in this, as in the neighbouring parishes, is, on the whole, 
estimable. Intemperance is not frequent amongst them. Those 
who have children are exceedingly anxious to have them properly 
educated ; they are civil in their manners, industrious in their ha- 
bits and by no means inattentive, in general, to religious observ- 
ances In the midst, often, of difficulties and hardships, they are 
not discontented with their lot ; and it is matter of no small praise 
to them, that, with very narrow means, there is so much decency m 
their apparel, and seeming comfort in their dwellings. Intelligence 



ABERLADY. 



255 



is more generally diffused amongst them than the inhabitants of 
towns are willing to imagine ; and there seems to be no good 
ground for believing, that they have fallen in any degree from the 
respectability of their fathers. Wages in this parish and district 
have been for several years past on a very low scale, — partly from 
the influx of Irish labourers in summer and harvest, — and partly 
from the depressed condition of agricultural affairs ; and it is much 
to be wished, that labour ere long may receive a more abundant 
reward. The houses, too, allotted to the farm-servants, are fre-- 
quently not so good as might be reasonably expected ; and hither- 
to there has in this respect been little of that improvement which 
unquestionably, on the whole, characterizes the present age. There 
is at this date some tendency towards a better state of things ; and 
ground is given to hope, that the cottages on every farm will, 
a:t no very distant period, have two apartments instead of one, — that 
they will be better lighted, — better protected against cold and 
damp than, generally speaking, they now are, and on the whole, 
built with more regard to conveniency and comfort. By such al- 
terations, it cannot be doubted, that the health and the habits of 
the labourer and his family would be improved ; and it seems to be 
equally certain, that the additional expense to the landlord and far- 
mer would be amply repaid by an increased quantity of labour wil-» 
lingly given, or at least, by the more cheerful performance of the 
customary task ; setting aside the delight which must spring up in 
every well-constituted mind on beholding the diffusion of satisfac- 
tion and enjoyment. 

During the last three years there were 3 illegitimate births in 
the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
The parish may be considered as purely agricultural. Its in- 
habitants have no connection with navigation. There are no fisht. 
eries carried on from the coast ; and, with the exception of a brick 
and tile-work, chiefly employed in making tiles for drains, there is 
nothing which can be called a manufactory. The few tradesmen 
in the parish, that is, masons, carpenters, shoemakers, blacksmiths, 
bakers, tailors, are employed solely in supplying the wants of their 
immediate neighbours, and there is not a single weaver amonggf; 
them. Not more than sixty years ago, there were twenty looms in 
the village, regularly employed, and a considerable home manu- 
facture of linen cloth ; but from the progress of the cotton manu- 
facture, and the application of machinery to the spinning of flax, 



250 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



looms and lint, and their necessary concomitant, the domestic 
wheel, have totally disappeared. In all this there may be good, 
on the whole, but partial inconvenience is the result, as much want 
of female employment is experienced during the winter months. 
Within the same period, too, three corn-mills were at work in the 
parish, but the progress of improvement has swept them, in like 
manner, away ; and the oatmeal now used is ground at a distance. 

Husbandry. — The husbandry of the parish is that improved sys- 
tem of agriculture which prevails in the district and county, and 
which is too well known to require to be again described. It seems 
to be enough to say, that the farmers here are as skilful as their 
neighbours, and the system of management quite as good ; that 
much attention is paid to draining ; that the light manures are 
largely and successfully applied ; that vast quantities of turnips are 
raised, and fed off partly with sheep ; and that, though naked fal- 
lows are still resorted to on the heavier soils, the breadth is becom- 
ing gradually less from the effect of superior culture. Carrots and 
turnip seed have been raised of late years, to a greater extent than 
is common in the neighbourhood, but with what advantage remams 
to be proved. The light soil along the coast is favourable to the 
production of the former crop, which, in a propitious season, is of 
very considerable value ; the excellence of our climate, to that of 
the latter ; but the cultivation of both seems to be attended with 
more than usual risk. 

Live-stock has hitherto, in this parish and district, been less at- 
tended to than in some other parts of the kingdom ; but the eyes 
of the farmer appear to be now fully open to, the growing import- 
ance of this branch of his profession, and the next few years will 
probably witness in this respect no small improvement. 

Produce.— \i is in the last degree difficult to attain anything like 
an accurate acquaintance with the " average gross amount of raw 
produce" raised in this parish, and rather than deal in loose con- 
jectures, it seems to be better not to conjecture at all. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town.— HMmgion is the nearest market-town, and 
distant from the centre of the parish about four miles. Much of 
the grain raised here, however, is taken to Dalkeith and Edinburgh, 
where a price is generally obtained more than sufficient to compen- 
sate for the extra carriage. In the village of Aberlady, however, 
m.st of I he articles more immediately connected with comfort and 



ABRRLADY. 



257 



conveniency may be readily obtained ; and some of them are 
usually considered as remarkably good in quahty. 

Means of Communication. — Aberlady has the benefit of a daily 
post; and no parish enjoys more fully the means of communica- 
tion with other districts. A well-regulated coach passes through 
the village on its way from North-Berwick to Edinburgh every 
lawful morning, and returns the same evening; and every day in 
the week, Sunday excepted, a carrier starts from Aberlady, or pas- 
ses through it on his way to the capital. The roads in every di- 
rection are very good, and their present smoothness presents a 
striking contrast to the rough and uncomfortable state they were 
kept in, forty years ago. Thus all sorts of produce are carried 
easily to market, and more cheaply, too, than in former times; in- 
dustry is stimulated by the facility with which its products are ex- 
changed ; and capital is increased by the rapidity with which its 
returns are made. 

Ecclesiastical ,Sae— Aberlady appears to have been a parish at 
an early period. It is supposed that, in very ancient times, the 
Culdees had an establishment near the village ; and that to this 
circumstance is to be traced the name " Kilspindy,"— signifying, in 
the British speech, the " cell of the black-heads, or hoods." This 
cell was probably connected with the Culdee monastery at Dun- 
keld, and, at all events, when the bishoprick of Dunkeld was es- 
tablished by David I., he conferred on the bishop of that diocese 
Kilspindy and Aberlady, with their lands adjacent, the advowson 
of the church, its tithes, and other rights. This constituted the 
ecclesiastical barony of Aberlady, over which a " regality" was 
subsequently obtained, and the whole parish, notwithstanding its 
local situation, was included in the bishoprick of Dunkeld. Aber- 
lady continued a mensal church of the Bishop of Dunkeld till the 
Reformation,— the spiritual duties being performed by a vicar • 
and from this ancient connection, the parish was afterwards includ- 
ed withm the commissariat of Dunkeld. Gawin Douolas, the 
celebrated Bishop of Dunkeld, who died in 1522, « deepty regret- 
ted by all good men," granted the lands of Aberlady and Kilspin- 
dy to his half-brother, Sir Archibald Douglas, previously mention- 
ed ; and, m 1589, the then Bishop of Dunkeld resigned into the 
hands of the Kmg the church of Aberlady with its teinds and per- 
tments, that it might be converted into a' rectory, and the advow- 
son given to Patrick Douglas, Sir Archibald's grandson, as an in- 
dependency of the diocese of Dunkeld. James VI. accordinoly 



258 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



erected the whole into a free barony, by the name of Aberlady. 
From the " Douglases" this barony, with the patronage of the 
church, passed to the " Fletchers;" from them to the noble fa- 
mily of " Portmore ;" and, about forty years ago, into the hands of 
the Earl of Wemyss, in whose family they remain. The church 
of Aberlady was built in 1773. It is conveniently situated for the 
parish, and is on the whole as comfortable as any in the county. 
It is seated for 525, considerably more than half the population. 
The number of communicants is about 400, and that of the 
dissenting famihes does not exceed 12. The manse was built 
probably about 150 years ago, and seems for that period to have 
been a remarkably good one, perhaps the best in the district. It 
cannot be called so now. The glebe extends to about 8 acres 
Scotch measure; and the stipend consists of 16 chalders of vic- 
tual, with the usual allowance for communion elements 

Education.— i:\eve are two schools in the parish, one of them 
parochial with the maximum salary. The school fees amount 
to about L 20 a-year. The people are fully alive to the be- 
nefits of education, and send their children to school, genera - 
ly, at a very early age. The number of scholars at both schools 
in winter is about 150; but in spring and summer, for obvious 
reasons, the attendance is less numerous. In both schools, too, 
during the winter months, there are evening classes for instruction 
in writing and arithmetic ; and throughout the year, two respecta- 
ble females occupy a portion of their time in giving lessons m nee- 
• die-work. There are also two Sunday schools. About a sixth 
part of the population is thus receiving the benefit of instruction, 
and laying, it is to be hoped, a good foundation for future useful- 
ness and respectability. , . . . . 

Friendly Societies.-TYvexe are two such institutions m the pa- 
rish, one of which has existed upwards of seventy years -the other 
more than forty. They have between them more than L. 400 ot 
capital; and, though not in so flourishing a condition as is to be 
desired, have been unquestionably in a high degree beneficial, and 
promise to be useful for many years to come. Friendly societies 
may be considered as perhaps the best contrivances which have yet 
been fallen upon for supporting the independence, and promotmg 
the comfort of the working-classes ; and they seem to be deserving 
of more countenance and support from the higher and the m.ddle 
ranks, than on the whole they have hitherto received Compared 
with " saving banks," their superiority can hardly fail to be ad-

mitted ; but both are worthy of all commendation and encourage- 
ment. A parish library was established a few years ago, but as 
yet the funds are small, and the books not numerous. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor on the roll 
in this parish is generally from 20 to 25, and, together with the 
occasional poor, they receive assistance partly from the collections 
at the church doors, and mortcloth dues, partly from the interest 
of 1600 merks Scots, mortified for their use, by Sir Peter Wed- 
derburn of Gosford, one of which family, also, presented to the 
parish four handsome silver cups for the communion service, and 
partly from the produce of a regular assessment. The collections 
and mortcloth dues amount annually to about L. 25 ; the interest 
of the Gosford mortification is L. 4, 8s. lOd. ; and the assess- 
ment has yielded annually, for many years past, between L. 60 
and L. 70. From the amount of these sums, the usual small sar 
laries are, of course, paid. In addition to the above sources of 
supply, the poor are in the habit of receiving, from the liberality 
of two of the heritors, the sum of L» 15 yearly, at Christmas, for 
the purchase of coals ; and throughout the year, private charity 
is believed to be extensive. On the whole, therefore, it is hoped 
that the claims of the poor are duly attended to. Assessments 
have existed in the parish more than fifty years, and, as seems to 
be their nature, have, in the course of that long period, increased 
considerably. The amount is not very large at present, but it can 
scarcely be doubted that it will continue to advance ; and by such 
increase, it does not follow in the least that the wants of the poor 
will be better supplied. What is given in one form is apt to be 
withheld in another; — more reliance is placed on a visible fund 
than turns out to be safe ; and the condition of the poor, and of the 
labouring classes generally, is seldom improved on the whole. 
ITie law which provides for compulsory aid to the necessitous is not 
to be found fault with ; on the contrary, it is entitled to all praise ; 
but it is matter of much regret that it should be so often resort- 
ed to, at least in small country parishes, where a little considera- 
tion on the part of those who are liable to pay would seem to be 
all that is needful to make provision for the poor, in a way more 
beneficial to them, more pleasant to all. Till such harmonious 
arrangements, however, are entered into, it is not to be wondered 
at that the amount of assessments should increase, and still, that 
little kindly feeling should exist between those who receive assist- 
ance, and those from whom it appears to be wrung. At all 



260 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



events, it may be considered as unfortunate that llie ministers and 
elders of tliis church should ever have had anything whatever to 
do with the distribution of other than purely voluntary funds, as 
in this way they have been placed in a position most unfavourable 
to their own comfort, and not at all conducive to the true interest 
of the people committed to their charge. 

Ivns and Alehouses. — There are 5 houses in the parish, all of 
them in the village, licensed to sell ale and spirituous liquors. The 
number is obviously greater than can be looked upon as advanta-- 
geous. 

Fuel — The only fuel used in the parish is coal, and that is 
brought almost entirely from the collieries in the western district of 
the county. It has risen in price within the last twelve months 40 or 
50 per cent, and is at this moment almost beyond the reach of the 
labouring classes. The quality is but indifferent, not comparable 
to that of some of the coal brought occasionally from the coast of 
Fife, or from Mid- Lothian. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It cannot be doubted that, since the date of the former Statrsti- 
cal Account of this parish, its condition has improved. The soil 
IS more effectually drained; green crops are more extensively raised; 
live-stock is more carefully attended to ; many of the fields are bet- 
ter sheltered ; the general system of management is less slovenly, 
and, compared with the amount of produce, less expensive. Steam 
power in farm operations was then unknown ; it is now employed 
extensively, year after year more extensively, in thrashing out the 
grain,, and, aa is universally allowed, with much advantage. The 
spirit of enterprise is more active amongst the farmers ; the la- 
bourers are more alert and skilful in their several departments ; 
and all the implements of husbandry are in a state of greater effi- 
ciency. Within the last few years even, the science and practice 
of agriculture have made considerable advances ; and there is at 
present an evident tendency towards still farther improvement.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEE DD ALE. 

THE REV. JAMES FORSYTH, MINISTER. 



L_ToPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HlSTORY. 

Name.—Tn name is variously written, Morham, Moreham, 
Morhame, Morehame. Of these, the first form is the oldest and 
most correct ; although the second is now the most common. The 
origin of the name is differently given. But if Lord Hailes's prin- 
ciple be well founded, " that the names of the most ancient villages 
and hamlets in East Lothian are Saxon," the most probable ori- 
gin of it will be Moor-ham, the village on, or bordering upon, 
the moor. No village, indeed, now exists in the parish. But 
several circumstances lead to the belief of the former existence of 
one, probably of considerable extent, and clustered, as was usual, 
around the stronghold of the Lord of the Manor; in particular, 
the existence of such a village will help to account for the high- 
er rate of the ancient taxatio of the parish, than was otherwise to 
be expected from its extent.  And immediately west of the 
locality usually assigned to the extinct village lies a district of the 
parish still called Morham Moor. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The extent of the parish is fully 3 
miles in length from east to west, and varying from 1 to  mile 
in breadth. It is bounded on the east by Whittinghame parish ; 
on the west and north by Haddington ; and on the south by Gar- 
vald. It contains 1458 Scots acres, divided into nine farms of 
different size, the largest consisting of 315 acres, and the small- 
est of 27. 

Topographical Character. — The parish lies on the acclivity of 
the land towards the Lammermoor, nearly midway betwixt these 
Highlands of East Lothian and the sea, and exemplifies at once 
the gradual nature of that acclivity, and the undulating line of its

rise. In aspect, it is bare, tame, and unpicturesque, forming in 
these respects a complete contrast to the districts of Whittinghame 
and Gilford to the east and west of it : although, towards the 
western extremity, it assimilates more to the richly wooded cha- 
racter of these districts. It has neither lake, mountain, nor stream 
excepting the small burn of Morham within its boundaries. It 
possesses not a morsel of what may be called fine scenery, with 
the single exception of the pretty little glen which forms the mi- 
nister's pasture glebe. The inhabitants, however, find a com- 
pensation for the bareness and tameness of their residence in 
the greater degree of salubrity, which the total absence of swamps, 
the open sky overhead, and the free circulation of the air impart 
to it. Frequently, on a spring or autumn morning, they are 
enjoying a bright and pure sunshine, while Haddington and the 
vale of the Tyne lie beneath their eye buried in dense fog. At 
the time when other districts of the country were suffering se- 
verely under the visitation of the Asiatic cholera, not a single case 
of it occurred here ; and ague, and other diseases incident to thickly 
wooded, flat and marshy countries, are here unknown. 

The highest elevation above the level of the sea may be stated 
at 300 feet. 

Geology. — Nothing very remarkable occurs under this head. 
Coal was wrought in former times in the western part of the 
parish, but it seems to have been of very inferior quality, and 
has not been wrought now for upwards of forty years. It is 
thought, however, that seams of a better quaUty still remain un- 
touched in the same neighbourhood. And perhaps it were worth 
while to ascertain the fact, when the value of a good coal pit in 
this district of the county is considered.— There is a freestone 
quarry in the Haggs moor, but the stone is coarse and soft The 
rock elsewhere is generally of the trap formation, often highly por- 
phyritic and cellular, and strongly coloured with iron. 

Botany. — In the Minister's Glen grow in great profusion Dian- 
thus deltoides, Saxifraga granulata, Campanula rotuiidifuiia, Viola 
tricolor and canina, Sedum acre, Thymus serpyllum, Galium veru77i, 
Veronica officinalis, 8fc. so as, in summer, to cover the banks with a 
-beautifully mottled carpet, of which the predominating colour va- 
ries with the successive months. In the burn and along its edges 
occur Epilohium hirsutum great hairy willow-herb, abundantly ; 
Mentha liirsuta hairy mint ; Alisma plantago great water plan-

tain ; Spircea nlmaria meadow-sweet; Geumrivale water avens; 
Veronica beccabunga brooklime ; Nasturtium officinale, common 
water-cress in great plenty; Caltha palustris marsh mangold, 
&amp;c. In the moor, not yet quite extirpated, and ever ready to 
spring up abundantly, occur in patches, Calluna vulgaris, Erica 
tetralix, and E. cinerea, common, cross-leaved, and fine-leaved 
heath ; and bushes of juniper {Juniperus communis are here 
and there to be met with. In the pasture fields, the scarlet pim- 
pernel {Anagallis arvensis, whose petals close at the approach of 
rain, and indicate fair weather by their opening in the morning, is 
occasionally to be found. And among the plants to be met with 
elsewhere may be mentioned the following -.—Antirrliinum lina- 
ria yellow toad-flax ; Achillea ptarmica sneezewort ; Artemisia 
absynthium common wormwood; Convolvulus arvensis small 
bindweed ; Atropa belladonna deadly nightshade ; Echium vul- 
gare viper's bugloss ; Geranium pratense meadow crane's-bill ; 
Hypericum perforatum perforated St John's wort; Lychnis dioi- 
ca, red and white campion ; Malva sylvestris common mallow ; 
Orchis maculata spotted orchis; Potentilla anserma silver-weed; 
Reseda lutea, wild mignonette. It is remarkable that the prim- 
rose does not occur. 

11. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — There are few of these connected with the 
parish. In former times a castle, of which not a vestige now re- 
mains, stood on a point of land near the church, and overlooking 
the glen below, which no doubt was the residence and stronghold 
of the Lord of the Manor. Who the Lord of the Manor was pre- 
vious to the twelfth century cannot be ascertained ; but it would 
appear that then the manor of Morham was possessed by a fami- 
ly bearing the name of Malherb, who assumed from the property 
the name of Morham or de Morham, after the fashion of the time 
of taking the surname from the family possession. In this family 
it came down to Sir Thomas de Morham, who was of some dis- 
tinction in the time of Robert Bruce. In him the title became 
extinct. And his daughter and heiress, Euphemia, marrying Sir 
John de Gifford, of Yester, transferred to him the manor of Mor- 
ham, along with other estates, — from whom it passed, by another 
female transmission, to the Hays of Locherwart, the ancestors of 
the Marquis of Tweeddale. 

• Tlic fluid on the opposite side of the glen to whero the castle stood is still cal- 
led ilic Cuitlc Shot.

The manor of Morliam included, as far as we can ascertain- 
nearly the whole of that division of the parish which lies west of 
the church, and which now -forms several distinct properties. The 
eastern division would appear to have once formed part of the ex- 
tensive possessions of the Earls of Bothwell, who, first as the 
Hebburns of Hales, retainers of the powerful Earls of Dunbar, 
subsequently as Barons or Lords of Hales, and finally as Earls of 
Bothwell, have been much mixed up with the history of the coun- 
ty and of Scotland. The extract given below mentions Mains- 
hill as belonging to James Earl of Bothwell, who finished his in- 
famous career as Duke of Orkney, and husband of our unfortu- 
nate Mary. And " the barony of Morham" is specified among 
the estates restored, together with the forfeited titles of the fami- 
ly, to Francis Earl of Bothwell, nephew of the former Earl, by 
James VI. By this Earl Francis the barony was finally forfeited 
in 1593. 

This eastern division of the parish now belongs wholly to Earl 
Wemyss. The western division, forming the old manor of Morham, 
ultimately became the property of Sir David Dalrymple, Queen's 
Advocate in the reign of Queen Anne, who also bought the es- 
tate of Hailes. While in the possession of the Dalrymples, por- 
tions of it were sold from time to time, — until in 1830 the present 
representative of that junior branch of the Noble family of Stair 
finally denuded herself of the manor of Morham. 

Tradition points to the Glen of Morham as a place where the 
people, in far remote days, were wont to assemble to hear the gos- 
pel preached. And no scene, certainly, could be better adapted 
for the purpose than the particular spot which is thus hallowed. 
It is perfectly secluded, and in no degree indicated on the face of 
the country. The position ascribed to the preacher is a small 
rocky table, elevated a little above the margin of the burn, which 
runs murmuring in front; — while the hrae opposite, where the con- 

" 1559 October. The Earl of Bothwell attacked Cockburn of Ormistoii, who 
had reccivi'd 'lOllO crowns from Sir Ralph Sadler, for the use of the Congregation, 
and, wounding him, carried off the money. Sadler mentions that Arran and Moray 
immediately went with 200 horsemen, and 100 footmen, and two pieces of artillery, 
to Bothwell's house, in Haddington, where he occasionally resided, liut wore a qnar- 
ter of an hour too late. Having got notice that the troopers were entering the \Vcst 
Port in pursuit of him, Bothwell fled down the Gowl Close to the Tyne, andkoeping 
along the bed of the river, stole into the house of Cockburn of Sandy Bed, by a 
back-door, and changing clothgs with the turnspit, performed her duty for some 
days, till he found an o]]ortunity to escape. In return for this linieous sliclter, 
Bothwell gave Cockburn and lii.s heirs a perpetual groimd annual of 4 bolls if wheal, 
4 bolls of barley, and 4 iwlls of oats, out of his lands of Rlainshill, in Uic county of 
Haddington, ]arish of Morham.

ureo-ation are said to have sat, is of a semicircular form, rising 
witb a gentle slope to the level of the country above. The tra- 
dition may be without foundation, as no historical record spe- 
cially sanctions it:— it may refer, indeed, to a time as to which 
all is dark and uncertain, the era, namely, of the first introduc- 
tion of Christianity to East Lothian. But it is pleasing to cherish 
the belief of it— to fancy that here St Baldred himself preached, 
as it gives the additional charm of a sacred interest, to a spot of 
much natural sweetness in itself. 

Proprietors.— rhe Cess-Book of 1667, gives the following pro- 
prietors of the parish at that date, — Lady Bearford, Viscount of 
Kingston, Laird of Beanston, Mr James Cockburn. 

The present proprietors are. Lord Wemyss, to whom belong 
Standingstones, Northrigg, and Mainshill ; Robert Ainslie, Esq, 
of Redcoll, proprietor of Morham Mains, and Morham Kirkhall ; 
James Aitchison, Esq. of West Morham ; George Carstairs, Esq. ' 
of Morham Bank ; Kenneth Mackenzie, Esq. of Rentonhall ; and 
Captain Cameron, of Beech-hill. 

Eminent Men. — An aisle behind the church contains the bury- 
ing vault of the Dalrymples of Hailes. And here are deposited 
the remains of the first Baronet, Sir David, already mentioned ; of 
his son Sir James, who was Auditor of the Exchequer, and con- 
nected by marriage with the Earls of Haddington ; and of Lord 
Hailes, who died in 1792. 

Parochial Records. — The earliest date in these records is Fe- 
bruary 22, 1712. Mention is subsequently made of" old session 
minutes," which must have been of a date prior to 1712; but these 
are irrecoverably lost. From that date, they appear to have been 
accurately kept, and contain in the earlier portion, a most par- 
ticular notice of parish occurrences and transactions, — births 
and marriages, intermixed with accounts of the sessional income 
and expenditure, who preached on the Sabbath, or if there was no 
sermon, whether the minister preached or lectured, &amp;c. &amp;c. The 
following rather remarkable notices occur : —

IIL — Population. 

The return to Dr Webster in 1755 is said in the former Statis- 
tical Account to have stated the population at 345 souls. If the 
number be rightly given, a decrease has since that time taken 
place, which it is difficult to account for either by the junction of 
farms, the larger use of machinery and consequent reduction of 
hands employed in agriculture, or any other change to which a 
small agricultural parish like this can have been subject. For in 
1791 the population had sunk so low as 190, and at no time sub- 
sequent has it exceeded 265. It is conceived that some material 
error found its way into the return of 1755. And indeed another 
authority takes off just 100 from that return. 

The four last Returns to Government exhibit the following par

Only one small proprietor is resident in the parish. The peo- 
ple are in general sober, industrious, frugal, and contented. No- 
thing has occurred among them for many years requiring the in- 
tervention of the civil magistrate. And only two cases, and these 
by no means of an aggravated character, have called for the exer- 
cise of sessional discipline since the present incumbency. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish is wholly agricultural. Of those not 
actually employed in the labours of the field, there are 2 black- . 
smiths and 1 wright, a millwright. The parish is also honoured 
by the residence of a tailor. 

Husbandry— Soil. — The lands are all well enclosed, mostly with 
stone dikes, in many cases with hedges, which, however, receive 
but very little attention from the farmer ; a neglect too common in 
East Lothian. The soil in general inclines to clay, and in the 
eastern and middle portions of the parish, particularly around the 
church, is of very excellent quality. Towards the west end, it 
becomes much inferior, although even there, by a liberal and ju- 
dicious treatment, it is made to yield wheat of a superior descrip- 
tion. All the land capable of tillage is under cultivation, except- 
ing about 40 acres of thriving plantation, chiefly on Rentonhall, 
and West Morham. The system of husbandry practised is of the 
most improved kind, the rotation of crop being adapted to the bet- 
ter or worse quality of the land. A considerable breadth of turnip 
is annually grown to be eaten on the ground. And the improvement 
of laying the land down in grass for two or more years is ge- 
nerally adopted. Draining, both tile and wedge, has, of late more 
especially, been carried to a great extent here, as well as general' 
ly throughout the county, and much is about to be done in that 
way on one of the principal farms recently leased anew. The ave- 
rage produce per acre may be stated to be, of wheat 8 bolls j of 
oats 8; of barley 8. Very little hay is grown. No sheep are 
bred in the parish. About 40 score are annually pastured. 
Renty Leases. — The gross rentof theparish is stated in the former 



9 



2G8 



HADDINGTONSHIUK. 



Account to have been about L. 800. In 1816, when the average 
rent of the land per acre was so high as L. 2, the gross rental was 
more than triple that sum, viz. L.'2916, And taking the present 
average of rent per acre at L. 1, 8s., the gross rental amounts to 
L. 2041, 4s. Sterhng. There must therefore have been some 
eo-regious error in the former statement.- The valued rent is 
L. 1614, 9s. 7d. The sum assessed for the parish roads is 
L. 46, 10s., the product of 23 ploughgates at L. 2 each. 

The leases are all of nineteen years duration. In one recent in- 
stance, the choice of a money or grain rent, to be made and become 
final at the end of the first year, was given. In another instance, 
the rent is wholly grain, viz. a boll of wheat. In a third instance 
the rent is one-half money, and one-half corn of the three sorts. 
The rents are understood to be in general advantageous to the 
farmer. 

Wages.— The rate of labourers' wages has for some years been 
stationary at Is. 6d. per day summer and winter. Females receive 
lOd. per day. Hynds, who are generally married, are paid m 
greater part in kind, and receive 12 bolls of oats, 3 bolls of bar- 
ley, 8 bushels of peas, L. 1 in lieu of lint, a cow's grass and win- 
ter keep, 800 or 1000 yards of ground for potatoes, or m some 
cases 4bolls of potatoes instead, five weeks' meatduring harvest, and 
their coals driven free. Those who can stack and sow receive half 
a boll of wheat additional. They pay the rent of their house and 
garden by reaping during harvest, which is usually done by the 
wife or some other member of the family, and, fading this, by a 
hired reaper. In some instances they are obliged to keep a worker 
for field-work, called a bondager a vexatious appellation, now very 
properly passing out of use, all the year.-Cottars have their 
house and garden from the farmer, on the conditions of working 
during harvest, and keeping always a bondager,-who receives lOd. 
a-day when employed, and mu st be at call. Providing a bondager, 
they are not themselves astricted to labour on the farm, aiidwhen 
employed, receive the current daily wages of labourers. They are 
allowed 800 yards of ground for potatoes, and have their coals 

driven free. , , , 

The houses both of hynds and cottars are here, as elsewhere, 
miserably deficient in accommodation. They have usually only 
Zl apartment, and that but small. And in that one room, often 
m-ai'ed, worse lighted, and damp, are to be found crowded together 
sometimes a family of eight or ten persons. The extreme tnconven,.

ence of this is most severely felt in cases of sickness. And at all 
times, it must be of most injurious tendency to the modesty and de- 
cency of domestic intercourse. Houses of a superior and more 
commodious description for the farm-servants, containing each two 
apartments, are now erecting on the farm of Morham Mains, — 
an example which, for the sake of the health, comfort, and good 
morals of an important and valuable class of our rustic population, 
it were much to be desired, should be generally followed. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market. — The market-town is Haddington, from which the dis- 
tance is three miles, and where an excellent market is found 
equally for the sale of the various produce of the parish, and for 
the purchase of such articles as the inhabitants may require. 

Means of Cummunication. — The parish labours under great dis- 
advantages on this head. No public conveyance of any kind passes 
through it, or comes nearer than Haddington. The inhabitants 
have to send to Haddington for their letters, or depend on chance 
opportunities of having them brought up. Not even a carrier be- 
longs to the parish, and it only gets a share of the accommodation 
of the Garvald and Stenton carriers, as they pass through the east 
and west extremities onward. The main roads are now tolerably 
well kept, but very circuitous, and the comfort and ease of the in- 
ter-communication of the parish are much impeded by the deplor- 
able state of the branch road, if road it may be called, leading 
through a large division of it westward. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is pleasantly situated at the 
entrance of the httle glen before-mentioned, and nearly in the 
centre of the parish. No record exists when it was first built, but 
it was taken down and rebuilt in its former situation in 1724. It 
has since been occasionally repaired, and is at present in tolerably 
good condition. It contains sufficient accommodation for the pre- 
sent wants of the parish, and may be enlarged at a small expense 
if necessary. — The manse till recently stood down close by the 
church ; but having become ruinous beyond all repair, and the 
minister having frequently been incommoded to a very great de- 
gree by the flooding of the burn which flowed round it, it was 
pulled down in 1827, the site of it thrown into the garden, and 
a new and handsomely finished manse built in a situation as much

exposed as the old situation was snug and sheltered, at a cost of 
L. 900 Sterling. The offices remain where they were. —The glebe 
consists of 4 acres of good land, together with the said glen, com- 
monly called Morham Braes, as a grass glebe, the extent of which 
may be about 2 acres of excellent early pasture. — The stipend 
is augmented by the Government Bounty frgm L. 109, '2s. Sterling. 

The patronage seems always to have belonged to the Lord of 

the Manor, but was retained by Miss Dalrymple when the pro- 
perty was sold. 

There are few Dissenters in the parish, — none among the te- 
nantry, with the exception of one family recently come. The peo- 
ple attend church with becoming regularity. Average number of 
communicants 95 ; male heads of families, 32. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one. The salary 
of the schoolmaster is L. 34, 4s. 4d. with an allowance for de- 
ficiency of garden ground. He has the legal accommodations, al- 
though the house is small and inconvenient. There is a capital 
school-house lately built anew. Owing to the convenience of situ- 
ation of the school and other circumstances, there is a much greater 
attendance of scholars than the parish supplies,— the average num- 
ber being so high as 75. The branches taught, are, besides the 
usual ones, geography, mensuration, and French. There are 
generally three or four learning the languages.— There is not an in- 
dividual of a proper age in the parish who cannot read, and;the peo- 
ple have a just sense of the value of education to their children. — 
The minister meets the children belonging to the congregation 
after sermon on the Sabbath. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The sources of aid to the poor of 
the parish are, the collections of the church door, and mortcloth 
dues, the interest of a small sum of money now lessening, and when 
these fail assessments. There is at present only one person 
receiving a regular allowance, but a few others get occasional aid, 
and a supply of coals, meal, and flannel in winter. There is, be- 
sides, the burden of an orphan child. The people still cherish in 
general an honourable aversion to " coming upon the parish." 

Fuel— The fuel used is coal, brought generally from Penston 
colliery, distant about eight miles. The price of a cart is nearly 

doubled by the carriage. . tt n i . i 

" Jnns —There is only one ale-house at Crossgate Hall, kept by 
the patriarch of the parish. . There is not a drunkard from one 
end of the parish to the other.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Morliam is one of those few very small parishes in the church 
which ought either to be annihilated, by dividing them among the 
surrounding parishes, or augmented to a sufficient amount of po- 
pulation by additions from such populous parishes as may lie con- 
tiguous. In the case of Morham, the latter is the process that 
ought to be adopted. Additions might, with propriety, be made 
to it, from the outskirts of several of the contiguous parishes, where 
the inhabitants are considerably nearer the church of Morham 
than that of their own parish. And, in particular, while complaint 
is made of the want of church accommodation in the extensive pa- 
rish of Haddington, an easy remedy of the evil, in great part, 
offers itself, by annexing that portion of the landward district of 
Haddington which lies in to Morham to that parish, and, on the 
west side transferring another portion of it to Bolton.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV JOHN ABERNETHY, A, M. MINISTER. 



I.— Topo GBAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

The etymology of the name of this parish is quite uncertain. 

Extent, §-c. — It extends in length nearly 6 miles, and its me- 
dium breadth may be 1 mile. Its figure is extremely irregular, 
and could not be easily described without a map. It is bounded 
on the north-west, north, and east by the parish of Haddington, 
which is separated from it on the east and north-east for about 
three miles, by what is called the Gifford, or the Bolton, or the 
Coalston water, after the parishes, or properties through which 
it runs ; on the south, by Tester parish ; and on the west and 
north-west, by the parishes of Humbie and Salton. 

There are no mountain ranges in this parish, and scarcely any- 
thing that can be called a hill, the highest ridges being all under 
the plough, or capable of being so. The surfiice, however, is agree- 



272 HADDINGTONSHIRE. 

ably diversified by undulating elevations ; and everywhere iia» 
abundant declivity for thoroughly draining the soil. 

Hydrography. — The parish is abundantly supplied with spring 
water, with the exception, perhaps, of two farms. The principal 
, stream is the one already mentioned, as constituting the greater part 
of the boundary between this parish and that of Haddington. It 
is a small rapid river, which has its principal sources in the Lam- 
mermuir hills, but is fed by various tributary streamlets in its 
course downwards. After running through the grounds of Yester, 
Eaglescarnie, Dalgourie, Bolton, Coalston, and Lennoxlove, it 
joins the Tyne in the grounds of the latter place, about a mile 
west from Haddington. 

This beautiful stream is well stocked with trout, and through- 
out the greater part of its course its banks are adorned with plan- 
tations of wood. Some of the trees are very fine. 

The only other rivulet worthy of notice is the Birns Water, which 
also rises in the Lammermuir hills, and forms the boundary between 
this parish and that of Humbie. It holds on its course down- 
wards between the parishes of Humbie and Pencaitland on the 
one hand, and that of Salton on the other, till it unites with the 
Tyne in the grounds of Mr Fletcher of Salton. At the point 
of junction with the Tyne, it is rather the larger of the two. 

Meteorology —On this head nothing need be added to what has 
been already stated in the other accounts of the district. Like 
that of the surrounding, parishes, the climate is very salubrious. 
A good many instances of longevity occur in the register of deaths. 
There are several such instances at present, and about five years 
ago, one woman died in the hundred and fifth year of her age. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— On this head almost nothing can at 
present be said, as there is not an open quarry in the whole pa- 
rish. The strata are to a small extent exposed by the action of 
the river first mentioned. In part of its course may be seen a 
sort of coarse sandstone nearly horizontal. Limestone might pro- 
bably be found, as it occurs very near the boundaries, in the pa- 
rishes of Salton and Yester. Boulders are met with, when the 
soil is opened up by drains or otherwise ; and it is probable, have 
been of frequent occurrence, but have been broken up for econo- 
mical purposes. Any that the writer has examined are of very 
compact greenstone, no body of which is known to exist w.thui a 
very considerable distance. 

The soil is all arable, and is all under the plough, excepting 



BOLTON.

what is covered by wood, which is also capable of cultivation, nd 
a few inconsiderable patches on the sides of the streams. 

There is a tract extending from Morham Muir through part of 
the parishes of Morham, Haddington, Yester, Bolton, Salton, and 
Hunibie, the soil of which is of a very inferior quality, being gene- 
rally a cold thin clay on a tilly subsoil. Part of this tract has been 
originally covered by heath, as is evident from what is still to be seen 
in the woods. The soil of the rest of the parish is generally good 
— a fertile clay with some inconsiderable exceptions; and has been 
brought into a very productive state by the improved system of 
cultivation which has long prevailed in this district. 

Botany. — In the different plantations are found all the ordinary 
species of forest trees. Eaglescarnie, which is well wooded, has 
fine old timber on its grounds, and, in particular, some Spanish 
chestnuts of large size near the house. In these woods the prin- 
cipal native plants of any note occur ; among which may be noticed, 
as not so common, Listera nidus avis, and Campanula rapuncu- 
hides. Silaiis pratensis is seen in considerable abundance. 

II. — Civil History. 
It is stated by Chalmers in his Caledonia, Vol. ii. p. 437, &amp;c. 
" that the manor of Bolton was early enjoyed by the St Hilaries, 
who were succeeded by William de Vetereponte, who married 
Emma de St Hilary. Notwithstanding the terrible disasters of the 
succession war, in which, as we learn from Rymer and Prynne, 
this family was involved, yet was Bolton, with lands in other dis- 
tricts, enjoyed by it under Robert T. and David II. In the reign 
of James II. it belonged to George, Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. 
It was at length acquired by Patrick Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, 
after a long suit in Parliament with Marion, the Lady of Bolton," 
in which his principles and character appear to great disadvan- 
tage. " In 1526 and 1543, Bolton was in possession of a cadet 
of his family, by the name of Hepburn of Bolton. In January 
1568, John Hepburn of Bolton was executed, as the associate of 
the Earl of Bothwell, his chief, in the murder of Darnley. The 
manor of Bolton, thus forfeited, was given to William Maitland, 
the well known Secretary Lethington. It was confirmed to the 
Earl of Lauderdale in 1621. Richard, Earl of Lauderdale, who 
died about the year 1693, sold the barony of Bolton, and even the 
ancient inheritance of Lethington, to Sir Thomas Livingston, who 
was created Viscount Teviot in 1696 ; and Sir Thomas transferred 
the whole to Walter, Master of Blantyre, afterwards Lord Blan-

tyre, in J 702, in whose family the property remains." The money 
for this purchase was left by Frances Teresa Stuart, Duchess of 
Richmond and Lennox, who was grand -daughter of the first Lord 
Blantyre. The name was by this Lady's will changed from Leth- 
ington to Lennoxlove, not certainly a happy change so far as the 
sound is concerned. 

Land-owners. — The only residing heritor in this parish is the 
Honourable General Patrick Stuart, Commander of the Forces 
in Scotland, whose place of residence is Eaglescarnie, pleasantly 
situated near the stream already mentioned. Eaglescarnie was for 
several centuries the residence of a branch of the Haliburtons, 
Lords of Dirleton. In 1747, Patrick Lindesay, Esq. of the Lind- 
says of Kirkforthar, descended from the Lords Lindsay of the 
Byres, married Margaret, daughter and heiress of Thomas Hali- 
burton, Esq. of Eaglescarnie, and she being heir of line, Patrick 
Lindesay, Esq. was designed by that title. Their eldest daughter, 
Katharine, married Alexander, tenth Lord Blantyre; and the Ho- 
nourable General Patrick Stuart, before-mentioned, is their se- 
cond son, and acquired the estate of Eaglescarnie by a deed of 
entail of his grandfather, Patrick Lindesay. The other land- 
owners in the parish, are. Lord Blantyre, the Marquis of Tweed- 
dale, the Earl of Dalhousie, Lord Sinclair, Fletcher of Salton, 
Bogue of Kirkland, and Grant of Pilmuir. 

Parochial Registers — These consist of several volumes, the 
earliest of which commences anno 164L They comprehend the 
records of the kirk-session and registers of baptisms, marriages 
and deaths. The register of deaths has not been very regularly 
kept, and the first volume of the records is a good deal tarnished. 

Antiquities. — Chalmers, in his Caledonia, Vol. ii. p. 404, says, 
" The most prominent objects which next attract the antiquarian 
eye, are the hill-forts of the earliest people. Of this nature, pro- 
bably, is the camp in Bolton parish, comprehending five or six acres, 
and is called Chesters." In Vol. i. p. 163, 164, he says, " from 
St Abb's-head, along the coast, no Roman camp has yet been 
discovered, whatever antiquarians may have supposed." 

Chalmers is certainly incorrect in this conjecture and assertion. 
The camp in Bolton-muir, though now greatly defaced, has evi- 
dently been quadrangular, whereas the British strengths, it is be- 
lieved, were almost uniformly circular, unless when unavoidably 
otherwise, from the nature of the situation, which is not the case 
here, as the ground is level, bounded on one side only by a ravine

of no great depth. Although there be no known remains of Ro- 
man roads in East Lothian, this is no evidence that there may not 
have been such. In a country so early and so completely cultivated 
as East Lothian, such roads must long since have disappeared, ex- 
cepting in so far as their direction coincided with the existing roads. 
It is hardly conceivable that a people, so shrewd and able as the 
Romans were, who so long occupied the best parts of Britain, 
and who had such large armies to maintain, should have over- 
looked so fertile a district as this is. Besides, the great Ro- 
man road by Lauder, Channelkirk and Soutra-hill, considerable 
remains of which are still visible in the less cultivated portions 
of its tract, passed along close by the district of East Lothian, 
and in its progress over Soutra-hill, commanded a most mag- 
nificent and extensive prospect of almost the whole of its surface. 
No one who knows the history of the Romans can suppose it pos- 
sible that this could have escaped their notice, or that they did 
not take advantage of the supplies which such a district was capa- . 
ble of affording them. To secure these supplies, they must have 
had stations at proper intervals. Two of these, at least, it is be- 
lieved, are still to be seen. The late intelligent Mr Sangster of 
Humbie pronounces the fort on the lands of Whitburgh to have 
been a Roman castellum. It is only a short distance east from 
the itinerary station of Curry on the Gore Water, the Curia of the 
Romans. The camp in Bolton parish is distant from this fort 
somewhere about six miles. The very name Chesters seems to 
indicate a Roman origin. This name, which occurs so often, both 
singly, as in the present instance, and in composition, as in the 
names Taidcaster, Worcester, Ma.ncheste7\ &amp;lc. is certainly a cor- 
rupt on of the Roman Castra, and points out many of the military 
stations of that remarkable people. 

There is now no vestige of the remains of a mansion on the 
manor of Bolton, mentioned in the former Statistical Account ; but 
the field on which it stood is still called the Orchard Park.

During the three years preceding the date of this report, there 
was one illegitimate birth in the parish. 

Manufactories. — There is one manufactory for smith-work, one 
for rural carpentry, and one corn and barley-mill, belonging to 
three families, and employing six or seven individuals. There is 
no tailor, no shoemaker, and no public-house. 

There are no insane persons at present in the parish, and none 
deaf and dumb, or blind. It is not believed that there are any 
who engage in poaching or smuggling. 

As Bolton is an entirely agricultural parish, and none encouraged 
to reside in it but such as are necessary for agricultural purposes, 
the trifling increase or decrease of the population in different 
years is owing to the state of agriculture, and to the state of the 
families, as to numbers, which are perpetually fluctuating, in con- 
sequence of the frequent changes of residence from one parish to 
another. The same cause accounts, to a certain extent, for the 
fluctuation in the proportions between the male and the female 
portions of the population. 

But there is another point of view of much more importance, 
in regard to the influence which these frequent changes are cal- 
culated to have on character and morals. Those who are fre- 
quently shifting their places of residence can never feel themselves 
identified with the views and interests of any neighbourhood, nor 
fully experience the salutary influence of its institutions. In re- 
ference to the causes of these frequent changes, is it not deserv- 
ing the serious consideration of all parties concerned, whether they 
sufficiently cherish that reciprocal sympathy and regard for each 
others interests, which is so productive of good in every relation, — 
and whether there be a proper distinction made by those who have

lings a week to the parish, supported in the Edinburgh Asylum for the Hlind, with a 
view to his being instructed in some iirt by which he may le enabled to support 
himself.

the power, between the conscientious and well-behaved, and those 
who are otherwise  

In' some of the other parochial accounts, attention has been 
earnestly called to the very inadequate accommodation provided in 
the houses of the most numerous class of our population, which is 
far from being propitious to their morals or their comfort. No- 
thing, surely, but the awakening of attention to the subject, is ne- 
cessary to bring about some amelioration. It cannot be doubted 
that there are many who only require to have the matter brought 
prominently under their notice, to induce them to abate this cry- 
ing evil. If there should be others indifferent or hostile to any 
alteration for the better, they might be influenced to change their 
views, by the example of those who have the good of their fellow- 
creatures more at heart.

The highest rent is seven bushels of wheat, and the lowest, 
three bushels at the medium fiars, with a maximum of L. 3, 10s. 
per imperial quarter, and no minimum. There might also be quot- 
ed in one case, a maximum of L. 3, 4s. and a minimum of L. 2, 4s.

HADDINGTONSHIUE. 



nearest market-town is Haddington, distant nearly two miles from 
the lower part of the parish, and two miles and three-quarters from 
the church. Besides what is sold in Haddington, a considerable 
part of the produce is carried to the Dalkeith and Edinburgh 
markets. 

Means of Communication. — The great road from London to 
Edinburgh by Haddington passes within the distance specified in 
the last particular. The road from Edinburgh to Dunse, by 
Tranent, Pencaitland, Salton, Yester, and across the Lammer- 
muir Hills, traverses the parish near the centre, where it is nar- 
rowest, being there scarcely a mile in breadth. There is another 
road tolerably good for a considerable part of -its length, which 
-crosses that last mentioned nearly at right angles, and runs through 
the whole length of the parish. Several of the statute labour 
roads are in a rather indifferent state of repair. There is no post- 
office in the parish. It is accommodated by the office at Had- 
dington, and part of the upper part of the parish bythat atWest 
Salton. 

Ecclesiatical State. — William de Vetereponte, before-mention- 
ed, granted the church of Bolton, with its lands, tithes, and perti- 
nents to the canons of Holyrood ; and this gift was confirm- 
ed by a charter of William the Lion. It remained in the hands 
of the canons of Holyrood till the Reformation, In 1633, the 
epoch of the Episcopate of Edinburgh, it was annexed to the new- 
ly created bishoprick, which was itself subverted in 164L In 
the ancient taxatio, the church of Bolton was rated at the incon- 
siderable value of 20 merks, 

The present church was built in 1809. It is a handsome 
building in what has been called, whether properly or not, the 
modern Gothic style, with a square tower at the western end. It 
can accommodate nearly 300 sitters, and, consequently, is larger 
than is necessary for the population. The situation is very incon- 
venient for the upper part of the parish, being near its lower ex- 
tremity. The manse was built a few years before the church; is 
suitable to the parish, and in good repair. 

The glebe contains 6.286 acres, and was let during the greater 
part of the writer's incumbency for L 25 ; but is not worth so 
much now. The stipend is the minimum, with L.8, 8s. lOd. 
in name of grass mail and communion elements, though now 
quite inadequate for both purposes.

The whole population is connected with the Established Church, 
with the exception of one family, which is Episcopalian, and a 
very few individuals, who are Seceders. The average number of 
communicants for the last fifteen years is 119. 

There has been contributed for a number of years past, upwards 
of L. 10 Sterling a year for religious and charitable purposes. 

Ministers of Bolton. — Mr Andrew Simson, vicar and exhorter, 
November 1567 ; Mr James Carmichael, minister of Haddington, 
Bolton, Estanefurd, and St Martin's Kirk in the Nungaitt, 1574, 
resigned Bolton about 1586 ; William Balfour, reader at Bolton, 
1574; Mr James Lamb, admitted September 1587, died 1640; 
Mr John Courtie or Courtane, admitted 1640; Mr James Nairn, 
admitted 1662; Mr Walter Paterson, admitted November 23, 
1665, outed for refusing the test, 1681 ; Mr John Sinclair, ad- 
mitted November 30, 1682, continued after the Revolution, and 
died 1705; Mr William Hamilton, admitted May 11, 1708, died 
May 1743; Mr John Hamilton, admitted 1744, died February 
14, 1797 ; Mr Alexander Brunton, admitted September 28, 
1797, translated to New Greyfriars', Edinburgh, in 1803; Mr 
Andrew Stewart, admitted April 26, 1804, translated to Erskine, 
1815; Mr John Abernethy, admitted May 14, 1816. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in the pa- 
rish, and it would be quite sufficient for the population if it were 
not for the localities already alluded to. Those children who 
are at too great a distance from the parish school are accommo- 
dated at schools in the neighbouring parishes. The branches 
taught are those common to all parish schools, with geography, 
mathematics, Latin, French, and occasionally Greek, all which 
are efficiently taught by Mr Young, the present master. The 
school-fees are the same with those already reported in the accounts 
of the neighbouring parishes. The salary is the maximum, or 
L. 34, 4s. 5d. The school-fees may amount to nearly L. 40, be- 
sides the other emoluments commonly attached to this office, which 
in so small a parish do not amount to much. Besides the salary 
and school fees, the master has a salary of L. 3, 3s. as session- 
clerk, and five per cent, as heritors' clerk on the money levied for 
roads and assessments for tlie poor, which amounts to about L. 3. 
His fees for registering births and marriages, and for certificates, 
scarcely amount to L. 1 per annum. The legal accommodations 



" Since the above was written, three Dissenting and one Roman Catholic family 
have loiiic to tlie iiarish. 



280 



MADDINGTONSHIRK. 



for the master are provided. The dwelling-house has just under- 
gone extensive repairs. The school-house was built a few years 
ago, and is very neat, substantial, and commodious. The school 
is well attended. The present teacher has had upwards of 100 
scholars in winter. The average attendance is about 72. But 
this school cannot in future be expected to attract so many child- 
ren, as some of the adjoining parishes are now better appointed in 
teachers than they were during the greater portion of the period 
to which the above statement refers. It is not believed that there 
are any above six years of age who cannot read more or less accu- 
rately, and few who cannot also write. The parents, in general, 
seem anxious to have their children educated according to their 
circumstances, although in some cases they are not kept sufficiently 
long at school, nor so regularly as is necessary. 

There is, besides the week-day school, one on the Sabbath, ex- 
clusively for religious instruction ; and a more advanced class taught 
in the minister's house on the Sabbath eveninofs. 

Libraries. — There is a small parochial library ; and for a good 
many years past, there has been stationed here one division of the 
Itinerating Libraries, established by Mr Samuel Brown of Had- 
dington. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid for the last ten years is 4/o, nearly one in 
every 70. The allowance to each for a year is from L. 3, 5s. to 
■L. 3, 18s., although in extraordinary cases more is given. The 
average expenditure for the last seven years has been L. 26, 8s. ; 
but this includes several small fees, for which there is no other 
provision. The income to meet this arises from the weekly col- 
lections, the interest of L. 120 of accumulations, the hire for a 
hearse and mortcloths, and an assessment averaging for the above 
period L. 8, 13s. 2|d. per annum. 

Our experience here accords with that of all the parishes where 
recourse has been had to assessments for any length of time, — 
namely, a diminishing reluctance to apply for parochial aid, and 
less of that honourable and amiable anxiety in children to share 
their gains in promoting the comfort of their aged parents, who 
submitted to many privations on their account, before they were 
able to provide for themselves. It must, however, in justice be 
recorded, that there are honourable and laudable exceptions to 
this common remark. There are some children who struggle hard, 
and submit cheerfully to many privations, for the sake of their aged 



BOLTON. 



281 



parents, and whom nothing but dire necessity could induce to al- 
low those so dear to them to become dependent on foreign aid. 

Besides the above provision for the poor, the late benevolent 
ladies, Katharine Lady Blantyre, and her sister, Miss Lindesay of 
Eaglescarnie, left L. 100 each,— or, after deducting the legacy- 
duty, L. 180, for the relief of persons in distress, the interest to 
be given irrespective of the ordinary allowance. This has been 
hitherto expended in affording occasional relief, in supplying coals, 
and in paying the school fees of children whose parents stand in 
need of such aid. 

:Fuel.—Th\s district is abundantly supplied with coals from Pen- 
ston, Pencaitland, and Huntlaw, which are within a moderate 
distance from every part of the parish. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

In the former Statistical Account of this parish, it is stated that 
there were about 150 acres in wheat, — there are now nearly 300 : 
That ploughmen had ordinarily L. 14 Sterling a-year,— now they 
have from L.23 to L.25. The rent is stated to have been L. 1400, 
—it is now about double that sum ; and during the high war prices 
it was considerably more. 

Great attention has long been applied to that first of agricul- 
tural improvements — draining; and much money has been ex- 
pended on it. Still, owing to the difficulty of the soil, many farms 
were but imperfectly drained. The new system, however, called 
the frequent drain system or furrow draining, bids fair to bring this 
operation to perfection, and to alter almost entirely the character 
of many forms. This system is carried on at present with great 
spirit in this neighbourhood. It must be a great addition to the 
durability of these drains, when the tiles are covered with gravel, or 
small stones, which is not always done.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYJJOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN HENDERSON, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The etymology of the word Tranent, or, as it was an- 
ciently written, Travernent, is involved in some obscurity ; but we 
must reject, as altogether fanciful, its derivation from the circum- 
stance of a party of Danes having landed on the opposite coast of 
Fife, and being repulsed by the natives, who exultingly exclaimed, 
Tranent  Tranent  " Let them swim over." Neither are there 
any better grounds for attributing it to a corruption of the word 
" Trinity." The explanation of Chalmers is much more satis- 
factory, that it took its name from its natural situation. The 
oldest part of the village stood along the edge of a ravine, once 
finely wooded, and in the ancient British language, Trev-er-nent 
is said to signify a village on a ravine or river, which is exactly 
descriptive of its site, — the ravine or glen, through which a small 
stream runs, being immediately to the west of the oldest houses. 

Boundaries and Extent. — The parish is bounded on the north, 
by the Frith of Forth ; on the east, by the parishes of Gladsmuir 
and Pencaitland ; on the south, by Ormiston and Cranstoun ; and 
on the west, by Inveresk and Prestonpans. Its greatest length 
from north-east to south-west is about 3 miles, and its extreme 
breadth, 3 miles. Its area is about 9 square miles, or 3464 acres, 
1 rood, 16 falls imperial. Its former extent was much greater 
as will be noticed under its Civil History. 

Topographical Appearance. — The surface of the ground slopes 
gradually, with gentle undulations from the southern boundary of 
the parish, towards the sea ; — its greatest elevation being about 
320 feet above the level of the Firth of Forth. The parish is

not now well wooded, the fine trees which formerly existed 
at the Palace of Seton, the towers of Elphingstone and Falside, 
and the Heugh of Tranent, having in a great measure fallen to 
decay, or been cut down. The trees of St Germains are now in 
the best preservation of any in the parish, and some of them of 
considerable age. The extent of coast little exceeds 2 miles ; at 
Cockenzie, it is guarded by a dike of greenstone, running nearly 
east and west, and the sea recedes but a short distance from the 
rocks. To the east of Portseton, there is another whinstone dike, 
more to the north, running nearly in the same direction, and 
within it, there is a considerable extent of flat sand, dry at low water, 
while the beach contains a beautiful mixture of fine sand and sea 
shells 

Hydrography. — There is no river in this parish, and only two or 
three trifling rivulets; the greatest discharge of water into the sea 
is from the coal level, commenced by the Earls of Winton in the 
seventeenth century, and subsequently carried forward, nearly two 
miles further, into the basin of the Tranent coal-field, by the Messrs 
Cadells ; but its extension does not seem to have materially in- 
creased the quantity of water. Several mills are thus driven, 
which have the peculiar advantage that no drought during summer 
makes any perceptible difference in the volume of the water, and 
from its high temperature, it is not subject to be frozen in winter. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The parish of Tranent, through its 
whole extent, contains the usual coal measures, or the ordinary 
strata connected with the coal formation, but the regularity of the 
stratification is dislocated and intersected by trap or whinstone 
dikes, by clay dikes, and other disturbing causes, denominated 
" troubles" by the colliers. 

As in many other places, the strata seem to have been origi- 
nally deposited in the form of a basin, and afterwards to have been 
altered by the unexplained convulsions which have taken place in 
our globe. The principal basin at present existing has its lowest 
point or trough a little to the west of the farm-house of Carla- 
verock, nearly a mile south of the village of Tranent ; from this 
the coal seams rise in all directions, and with a much more rapid 
inclination as they approach towards the verge of the basin, which 
may be about half a mile in some places, and in others a mile from 
the centre point, in regard to the uppermost seam, and at greater 
distances as to the others. Beyond this basin, to the west, north, 
and east, there are other seams of coal found, but whether they

are the continuation of seams lower than those worked at Carla- 
verock, or the same seams cast down and altered, has not been 
exactly ascertained. At Longniddry Dean, two coal seams crop 
out, dipping north-west, which looks as if they were connected with 
the principal basin, and the limestone generally found below the coal 
formation does not appear till beyond the boundary of this parish. 
The first of the trap dikes intersecting the strata occurs to the 
north of Portseton ; the second at Cockenzie, about 20 yards 
broad, where it forms a barrier against the sea, and runs from 
north-west to south-east; the third trap dike, not quite so broad, 
lies about half a mile further south, running nearly east and west 
from the Garleton Hills to Seton Castle and Prestongrange Har- 
bour, which it may probably connect with the masses of trap at 
Arthur's Seat, Hawkhill, and Inchkeith. About half a mile to 
the south of the second trap dike, there is a broad clay dike, about 
140 feet in width, which throws the strata about 16 fathoms up 
to the south. The ground here rises more rapidly, and most of the 
upper seams crop out. From this line they descend to form the 
basin at Carlaverock. There are, besides, many dikes and faults, 
especially about Kingslaw, which it would be tedious and out of 
place to narrate. 

Such being a general description of the geological structure of 
the parish, we may now give a more minute account of the coal mea- 
sures or strata themselves at Carlaverock, the centre of the basin. 

The upper or main coal seam, between 6 and 9 feet thick, 
is of good quality, though rather soft, and is about 37 fathoms 
or 222 feet from the surface, at the lowest point in the ba- 
sin. The second seam, which is improperly termed the splint 
coal seam, is about 5 feet thick, and varies from 8 to 14 fa- 
thoms below the main coal seam. The third seam, or 3 feet- 
coal, is from 5 to 8 fathoms below the second seam, but has 
only been worked near the crop, where it approaches the sur- 
face. The fourth seam, or 4 feet coal, is still lower, being between 
3 and 4 fathoms below the third seam, and is reputed to be of ex- 
cellent quality ; but as it has not been wrought, except near the crop, 
where the quality is inferior, its merits cannot be said to be ascer- 
tained. About 16 fathoms below the 4 feet coal, there is also 
a 5 feet coal, but it has not been worked in the parish, except at 
the crop to a small extent. Below these, in the Carlaverock basin, 
it is probable that other seams may exist at a greater depth, but 
they have never hitherto been explored. A thin scam of parrot

or cannel-coal, so much esteemed for gas-works, has lately been 
found, and is now worked in the lands of Falside : it is supposed to 
be the seam of coal next to the limestone. 

The geologist is referred for farther and more scientific infor- 
mation to a very able paper, " on the Mid-Lothian and East- 
Lothian coal-fields," by David Milne, Esq. recently published in 
the 14th Vol. Part I. of the Transactions of the Royal Society of 
Edinburgh, — where the learned author has, with admirable indus- 
try, brought together a great mass of facts, furnished by practical 
men, and illustrates the important conclusions he has drawn from 
them by valuable plans and sections. 

From the seams of coal cropping out, or coming to the surface, 
in many places round Tranent, there can be no doubt that this in- 
valuable mineral must have been known to the earhest inhabitants 
of the district, and we are therefore not surprised to find written 
evidence of coal having been wrought here as early as in any other 
place. Chalmers, in his Caledonia, Vol. ii. p. 400, notices a grant 
by Seyer de Quincy, Lord of the manor of Tranent, to the monks 
of Newbattle, about the year 1202, of a coal-pit and quarry on their 
lands of Preston, which then formed part of the parish of Tranent, 
and, from the cropping out of the seams of coal, must probably 
have been situated in part of the present parish of Tranent. From 
the thirteenth century downwards,, we have abundant evidence from 
numerous charters, of the working of coal in the neighbourhood of 
Tranent, and in the middle of the sixteenth century, 1547, the 
workings seem to have extended a considerable distance underground, 
as Patten, the graphic narrator of Protector Somerset's invasion 
of Scotland, gives an account of many inhabitants of the district 
taking refuge in the coal-pits a few days before the disastrous 
battle of Pinkie. The English, finding it impossible to dislodge 
them, closed up the pits which gave air to the workings, and, placing 
fires at the entrance, endeavoured either to drive them out bv 
other apertures, or to suffocate the miserable creatures within ; and 
the narrator coolly remarks, " forasmuch as we found not that they 
dyd the tone, we thought it for certain thei wear sure of the too- 
ther : wee had doon that we came for, and so lefte them." 

At this period, the mode of relieving the coal workings from 
water, was by what was called '« damming and laving," that is, 
havmg followed the seam of coal as far as they could for water,

they made a dam or bank, rising above the level of the orifice, or 
of a ditch cut from it; and by hiving the water over this bank, it 
gradually escaped from the mouth of the working. A series of 
these dams could be made one after another, and thus the work- 
ings, with considerable labour, freed from water ; but this mode must 
have been very hazardous, as any injury to a dam would allow the 
water to flow back on the lower workings, while no considerable 
growth of water could be overcome. 

In the course of time, a much more efficient mode of draining 
coal-works by day levels was introduced ; but we are ignorant of the 
precise date at which they were commenced. The day-level is a 
mine carried forward from the bed of a stream, or the lowest ground 
that can be found, directly into the heart of the strata, without fol- 
lowing the seams of coal. This mine, of course, can be made the 
means of draining all the coal strata lying above it, and if the 
" level" or water-course be kept clear, effectually relieves the 
workings from water. 

The family of Seyton having obtained a grant of the lands of 
Tranent from Robert the Bruce, for their attachment to his cause, 
seem to have devoted much attention to their coal-workings ; and 
from the preface to " Satan's Invisible World," by Sinclair, we 
learn, that the Earl of Winton of that day had run free levels, for 
several miles below ground, to drain his coal-works, and had ex- 
cited the admiration of the writer, by " cutting impregnable rocks 
with more difficulty than Hannibal cutted the Alps," by " deep pits 
and air-holes" and " floods of water running through the labyrinths 
for several miles." 

This level, commenced probably about the middle of the seven- 
teenth century, still assists in draining the coal, but it has been - 
extended nearly two miles further than the Earls of Winton car- 
ried it, and now reaches the heart of the coal-field. Since he ap- 
plication of the power of steam, this mode of draining coal-works 
has of course been rendered less essential ; but still, where the in- 
clination of the surface admits, it is the most convenient mode of 
relieving the strata above it, and for those below, it is only required 
to raise the water to the mine in place of to the surface. In ad- 
dition to the main level, which runs in a southerly direction, there 
were two other levels made in former times, the Heugh level, a branch 
of the main level, and the Bankton level, which discharges, at the 
surface, near the mansion-house of Bankton. 

The only other improvement in regard to coal- works which il is 



THAN E NT.

Hicunibent on us to notice, is in the carriage of the coal. In older 
tiznes, the coals were almost invariably carried on horseback, as 
the state of the roads afforded little faciUty to wheeled carriages. 
In 1719, after the attainder of the Earl of Winton, the York-Build- 
ings Company of London purchased many of the forfeited estates, 
and they seem to have begun without delay to introduce some of 
the southern improvements. A tram-road or wooden waggon way 
was formed from their coal-works near Tranent to the harbour of 
Port Seton, in the year 1722, by which the coals were conveyed 
to the salt-pans and shipping : this seems to have been the first ap- 
proximation to the principle of railways, which in our own day are 
effecting such changes on the country, as well as on the convey- 
ance of passengers and goods. This old wooden waggon way, each 
waggon being drawn by one horse, and conveying two tons of coal, 
was continued till 1815, when an iron railway was substituted in 
its place by the Messrs Cadells. 

The mode of raising coals where the seam lay within a few fa- 
thoms of the surface, was formerly by means of women called "bear- 
ers," who carried about 1 cwt. on their backs, and ascended the 
pit by a bad wooden stair. In the deeper pits, the coals were carried 
to the bottom of the shaft by women, and then raised in wooden tubs 
by means of a " gin" moved by horses. This mode of raising the 
coal still continues, except where a c/ig or small steam engine is 
substituted, which performs the work with more regularity and 
speed ; below ground also, where the inclination of the Coal seam ad- 
mits of it, the coals are now frequently drawn by horses on iron 
railways, or pushed forwards by men or boys, who are called 
" putters." 

In the coal-workings of this parish, there is fortunately no fire 
damp, which causes such dreadful accidents. Foul air often oc- 
curs in certain states of the atmosphere, or where the ventilation 
IS mcomplete ; but this never requires the precaution of Sir Humphry 
Davy's lamp, and the extinction of the light, with oppression on the 
lungs, are sufficient warnings for the miner to retire. 

In surveying the coal-field in the parish of Tranent, it is diffi- 
cult to imagine that it has been so long wrought,— so large a quan- 
tity taken from it, and still so much of the principal seams remain- 
ing. In the Cess-roll of the county of Haddington for the year 
1653, the Earl of Winton's yearly land rent in the parish of Tra- 
nent is estimated at L.n,591, 18s. 4d., while his casual rent, 
which must have been derived in a great measure form coal, is rat'- 



288 



IIADDINGTONSIIIIIE. 



ed SO high as L. 3333, 6s. 8d. At the time of the purchase of the 
Winton estates in 1719 by the York-Buildings Company, the coal 
and salt-works yielded above L. 1000 per annum. According to 
the former Statistical Account of the parish, the produce of El- 
phingstone CoUieryin 1790, was 6053 tons, 15 cwt.; in 1791, it was 
8348 tons, 10 cwt. At present, the produce of the different coal- 
works of Tranent, Elphingstone, Birsley, and St Germains, must 
be about 60,000 tons annually, a large proportion of which is ship- 
ped at the new harbour at Cockenzie, and a considerable quanti- 
ty exported to foreign parts. 

Besides the consumption of coal for ordinary purposes, a num- 
ber of persons have long been employed in this parish, in con- 
verting coal into cinders or coke for malting or drying grain. The 
process of making cinders, as they are here called, is first to form a 
large fire, and when the mass is completely ignited, and the smoke 
driven off, the fire is then covered up and extinguished, leaving the 
purified cinders in a fit state for the maltster. An improved mode 
has lately been adopted in other parts of the country for forming 
coke, by burning the coal in small furnaces where a small por- 
tion of air is admitted, and the mass is more completely fused; but 
this improvement has not been hitherto adopted in this parish. 

From what is above stated of the coal measures existing through- 
out the parish, it will be inferred, that freestone is generally to be 
found at a moderate depth. In several places, quarries producing 
sandstone well suited for building have been opened, though the 
quality near the surface is rather soft. 

The whinstone or trap dike, intersecting the parish about half 
a mile from the sea, aff'ords excellent stone for the roads, and has 
been wrought in various places, but it is much inferior for that 
purpose to the whinstone obtained from the Garleton Hills, which, 
on being pulverized, becomes a dry sand, while the Tranent whin- 
stone becomes mud. This superiority has induced those having 
the charge of the great post-road to bring the materials for its 
repair from a quarry behind Huntingdon, six miles to the east- 
ward, although the carriage of it is thus greatly lengthened. 

Hitherto, no other mineral strata or veins have been discovered. 
Near the trap dike at Cockenzie, some faint traces of ironstone 
are visible, but of no value. When excavating the sandsfonc o 
form the'new harbour at Cockenzie, organic remains of fossil trees 
were found, and at Tranent there arc abundant specimens of plants

of the Fern tribe, in perfect preservation, in the roof of the coal 
seams, nearly in contact with the sandstone. 

Soil There is much diversity of soil in this parish, from the 

sandy links, which extend along the sea coast, to the old moor of 
Tranent, part of which was only reclaimed thirty years ago. In the 
immediate neighbourhood of the sea, the land is very light and 
sandy, though much of it has been greatly improved of late years. 
Immediately to the south of the Links, is a belt of excellent land 
of loamy quality, about half a mile broad ; there then intervenes, 
from Bankton to Rigganhead, a morass from 15 to 20 feet deep 
to the subsoil, but of late years this has been much improved. 
Round the village of Tranent, the land is of rich loamy quality, 
with the exception of the old moor to the east of the town, which 
is clayey, but has of late been greatly improved by draining. In the 
upper districts of the parish, towards Elphingstone and Falside, 
the land is of good quality. There is no gravelly soil in the parish. 

Zoology. — There are no rare animals in the parish, nor is it re- 
markable for breeding any species of cattle of peculiar quality, the 
attention of the farmers having been chiefly given to the raising 
of wheat and other grain. 

A quantity of fish is brought into the village of Cockenzie from 
the Frith of Forth as well as the German Ocean ; but the neigh- 
bouring coast is chiefly remarkable for the fineness of the oysters, 
as well as the crabs and lobsters, which are caught in great abund- 
ance during the season ; and it is a curious fact, that two years ago 
an untouched bed of oysters was discovered near Portseton, which, 
for a considerable time, yielded that shell- fish of a size and quality 
rarely obtained. 

The ordinary fish caught by the villagers are, the cod, haddock, 
flounder, and whiting, not unfrequently the sole and the mackerel, 
and more rarely the skate, halibut, &amp;c. 

Close to the coast, the prevailing west winds, from the sea and 
the sandy soil, prevent the growth of trees ; but at a short distance, 
where the soil becomes deeper, all kinds of forest trees appear to 
thrive remarkably well, except the fir- tribe. The soil seems most 
congenial to the plane, the elm, and the oak. 

II. — Civil History. 
The parish of Tranent was formerly of much greater extent, em- 
bracing the whole of the present parish of Prestonpans, as well as 
considerable parts of the parishes of Pencaitland and Gladsmuir, 
and the old parish of Seton was annexed to it after the Reforniu-

tion. The parish oC Prestonpans was disjoined from it in 1606, on 
a new church being built by Mr John Davidson, a very eminent 
person, then minister of the district : and Hamilton of Preston 
provided the glebe.  

The lands of Winton were also disjoined from the parish of 
Tranent in 1649, but in 1681 they were reunited to Tranent, and 
in 1715, after the forfeiture of the Winton family, they were final- 
ly annexed to Pencaitland. -f- 

In 1695, the north-east part of the parish of Tranent was an- 
nexed to the new parish of Gladsmuir, which was formed from por- 
tions of the parishes of Aberlady, Haddington, and Tranent. 

Till the commencement of last century, the lands of this pa- 
rish were almost entirely in the possession of one or two distin- 
guished families. 

The most ancient fiimily in this district seems to have been that 
of Saytun or Seton, who obtained a charter of lands in East Lo- 
thian from David L who began his reign in 1124. In the reign 
of William the Lion, who ascended the throne in 1165, they ob- 
tained a charter of the lands of Seton, Winton, and Winchburgh. 

Another distinguished nobleman of this period was Robert de 
Quincy, a Northamptonshire baron, who acquired the extensive 
manor of Tranent from William the Lion, and was made his Jus- 
ticiary. His large estates afterwards came into the possession of 
his grand-daughters, three co-heiresses, and their husbands having 
espoused the cause of Edward H., their lands were forfeited on the 
success of Robert the Bruce, who conferred them on his nephew, 
Alexander de Seton. This family became one of the most influen- 
tial and opulent in Scotland, and were connected by marriage with 
all the principal families in the country. The families of Gordon 
and Eglinton were in fact Setons, the heiresses of these houses hav- 
ing married younger sons of the Seton family. They became Lords 
Seton in the reign of James I., and in 1600 were elevated to the 
rank of Earls of Wintoun. They were always opposed to the Refor- 
mation, and, after possessing property in the parish of Tranent for 
600 years, they were deprived of it by forfeiture in 1715, from their 
devoted attachment to the Stuart family. At this period, the W in- 
ton estates, along with many of the other forfeited lands, were pur- 
chased by the York-Buildings Company, and after their bankruptcy 
were sold in 1779, when they were acquired by various individuals.

The lands of Eipliingstone were held feu of the Wiiiton family, 
and in the fifteenth century belonged to the family of Johnstone. 
About the middle of the sixteenth century, they were acquired by 
the Primroses of Carrington, ancestors of the Earls of Rosebery, 
and are now possessed by Mr Callander and Mr Elphinstone. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners, according to their 
valuations in the parish at present, are Mr Cadell of Tranent ; 
the Earl of Wemyss ; Sir George Grant Suttie, Bart ; Mr Burn 
Callander ; Mr Hunter ; Mr Elphinstone ; Colonel Macdowall ; 
Mr Anderson of St Germains, and Mr Fowler. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers, of late years, have 
been very regularly kept, and exist from 1615 : but the first fifty 
years are very imperfect; and from 1688 to 1720, the registers 
are missing, and appear to have been lent and not returned. 

Antiquities. — There are no very remarkable antiquities in this 
parish. A Druidical circle of stones formerly existed on the west 
side of Longniddry Dean, near the sea ; but in the course of mak- 
ing some agricultural improvements it was unceremoniously de- 
stroyed. 

The old collegiate church of Seton is the finest monument of 
antiquity in the parish, and is an interesting specimen of Gothic ar- 
chitecture, built in good taste. The date of the oldest part is un- 
certain, but it must have been previous to the year 1390, for in the 
beginning of the reign of Robert III. Catherine Sinclair of Her- 
manston, the widow of Lord William Seton, " biggit ane yle on the 
south syd of the paroche kirk of Seytoun of fine astler ; pendit 
and theiket it wyth stane, wyth ane sepulture thairin quhair scbe 
lyis, and foundit ane preist to serve thair perpetuallie." Consi- 
derable additions were subsequently made to this church by the Se - 
ton family, many of whom expended large sums in decorating the 
mausoleum of their race, and there still exist several monuments, 
which appear at one time to have been very richly ornamented. In 
1544, the church was much destroyed by the English, during the 
invasion of the Earl of Hertford, wlio " tuk away the bellis and or- 
ganis, and other tursable moveable thingis, and pat thame in 
thair schippis, and brint the tymber-wark within the said kirk."t 
It afterwards suffered severely in succeeding revolutions ; but it is 
pleasing to find that this interesting and beautiful remain is now

carefully preserved by the present proprietor, the Earl of 
Wemyss. 

The old Palace of Seton, with its fine gardens and terrace-walks, 
which the monarchs of Scotland and their court in former times 
delighted to visit, are now no more, the remains of the former 
having been pulled down by a late proprietor, to build a modern 
and not very elegant mansion, while the policy and walks have 
suffered the necessary consequence of being detached from the 
abode of luxury and wealth. When King James VI. was on his 
way to England to take possession of the throne on the 4th April 
1603, on his train approaching Seton, he met the funeral of the 
first Earl of Winton, one of the most faithful adherents of his un- 
fortunate mother ; the King halted his retinue, and sat down on 
the south-west turret at the corner of the garden, which is still 
quite entire, and adjoining the present road, till the funeral of this 
old supporter of his family moved past. 

The old tower or fortalice of Falsyde is also of considerable an- 
tiquity. It was formerly in the possession of the Winton family, 
and probably given off to a junior branch. It offered some re- 
sistance to the army of Protector Somerset on the morning of the 
battle of Pinky in 1547, and was then burnt ; but the strength of the 
mason-work, the tower being arched at the first story, as well as on 
the top of the building, prevented entire destruction. Additions of 
a later date, but of a less massive structure, appear subsequently to 
have been made, and, as very frequently happened, the family of 
Fawside of that ilk seem to have removed to a more modern mansion 
when peaceable times arrived, at the union of the crowns, — as there 
now exists in the immediate vicinity of the old castle, a house with 
the initials 1. F., 1. L. above one of the windows, and the date 1618. 
In the stair of the oldest part of the castle, is a curious place of 
concealment, and the old dovecot at a short distance has another 
small recess, with an ancient grated-door. The view of the Frith 
of Forth and the waving line of sea coast from this spot, with the 
rich and varied fields of Mid-Lothian stretched beneath, is per- 
haps one of the finest that can be found in the vicinity. 

This parish has been the scene of some interesting historical 
events in former times. Between Tranent and Falsyde, a despe- 
rate engagement took place with the Scotch and English caval- 
ry, the day before the battle of Pinky in 1547, when the Scots 
we're overpowered, and lost 11300 men, which probably contributed 
in w. slight degree to the disastrous result on the next day, the

TRANENT. 



293 



10th of September, when 14,000 Scots are said by Patten to have 
been slain in the flight. 

The scene of the battle of Preston on 21st September 174-5 
lies about half a-mile to the north of the church of Tranent. The 
King's army, amounting to about 3000, was drawn up nearly parallel 
to, and a little to the east of the present line of railway from the coal- 
pits to Cockenzie. The excellent Colonel Gardiner was stationed 
with his cavalry on the right flank, and was killed when endea- 
vouring to rally a small body of infantry near the west end of the 
village now called Meadow Mill, but which was not in existence 
at the period of the battle. Colonel Gardiner thus met an ho- 
nourable death within a quarter of a mile of Bankton, his own resi- 
dence. His servant was unable to convey him thither, as the flight 
was in that direction ; but it is said, having borrowed clothes from 
the miller at the neighbouring mill, he conveyed his dying master to 
the manse at Tranent, where he soon after expired, and was buried 
in the west end of the Church ; but no tablet marks the grave of 
this gallant soldier and admirable Christian. 

The slain were buried near a farm-house called Thorntree Mains, 
erected since the battle ; and towards the close of last century, in 
making some drains to the north-east of the farm- steading, the work- 
men came upon the bodies, when t-he clothes were said to be so en- 
tire, that they could distinguish between the royalists and the re- 
bels. The military chest of the royal army was found at the house 
of Cockenzie, and was there divided by the unfortunate Charles 
Stuart. 

A few coins, of the reigns of James V. and Mary, were dis- 
covered in 1828, while making improvements on the post road to 
the west of Tranent, and might probably have been concealed 
there about the time of the battle of Pinkie in 1547. One or two 
cannon balls have also been found in the fields near Cockenzie, 
which, in all likelihood, were among the few that were discharged 
at the disastrous battle of Preston. 

There is a massive square tower at Elphingstone, said to have 
been built about the year 1300, and a modern house was added to 
it in 1600, which is still inhabited, and was formerly surrounded by 
very fine trees, but they are now all cut down. 

The only mansion-house in the parish, inhabited by a proprie- 
tor, is St Germains, the seat of David Anderson, Esq. which had 
formerly been an establishment of the Knights Templars, but after 



nAiiiNi'jNsiiiia;. 

their suppression was bestowed by James IV. on the King':i Col- 
lege of Aberdeen. 

HI. — Population. 

Until the middle of last century, the greater part of the popu- 
lation of this parish, consisting of colliers and salters, were little 
better than slaves, being bound to their works for life, and after 
having engaged in them after the years of puberty, were not per- 
mitted to leave their employment, unless the trade was given up. 
This cruel practice was happily done away in 1775, but the evil 
effects of it were not so easily overcome. A class thus nurtured in 
bondage, enjoying little intercourse with others, and their religious 
instruction not much attended to, could hardly have been expected 
to keep pace with the civilization of the country. The vice of 
drunkenness spread its perniciousinfluence very widely amongthem, 
and though families frequently make about L. 2 per week, thev 
rarely lay by any of their wages, and have not their dwelling- 
houses so comfortably furnished as the farm-servants and labourers, 
who do not earn half the amount.

Character and Habits of the People. — Among- a population of 
colliers, it cannot be expected that the habits of the people should 
be cleanly ; and the injurious practice of women working in the 
pits as bearers, now happily on the decline with the married fe- 
males, tends to render the houses of colliers most uncomfortable 
on their return from their labours, and to foster many evils which 
a neat cleanly home would go far to lessen. Colliers, from their 
high wages, generally partake of the best butcher-meat, and may 
be said to live well, but unfortunately they indulge very freely in 
ardent spirits, — that bane of our working population. 

From the above remarks, it is evident that the mass of the peo- 
ple cannot be said to be intellectual, moral, or religious. There 
are, however, several marked exceptions ; and it is to be hoped, 
that the present exertions making for the diffusion of religious know- 
ledge in the parish may, by the blessing of God, have a favourable 
effect on the character of the inhabitants. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The whole parish is cultivated or occasionally in 
tillage, with the exception of about 50 acres of links along the 
sea-shore, — which could not be added profitably to the cultivated 
land ; and with the exception also of about 100 imperial acres im- 
der wood, chiefly about the mansion-houses of Seton and St Ger- 
mains. A larae common in the neighbourhood of Tranent was fi- 
nally divided and improved in 1804, and has since been under cul- 
tivation. 

Rent. — The average rent of land to the north of the village of 
Tranent may be said to be from L. 3, 10s., to L. 4 per Scots acre, 
and to the south of Tranent, where it is poorer, about L. 1, 10s., 
to L. 2 per Scots acre, or one-fifth less than each of these sums per 
imperial acre. The grazing of an ox may be reckoned at L. 6 per 
half-year. 

The valued rent of the parish in the county books is L. 10,781, 
9s. Id. Scots, and the present real rent may be nearly L. 12,000, 
exclusive of minerals, which may yield about L. 4000. 

Wages. — The rate of wages is from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. per day for 
farm-servants, and from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 8d. for artisans. 

if 

Husbandry. — The general character of the husbandry, particularly 
in the lower parts of the parish, and in the better parts of the higher 
districts, has been of the most approved and modern kind. All kinds 
of grain have been grown ; but perhaps the culture of wheat has 
been carried to too great an extent generally through the county. 



lIADDINt/roNSIIIItK. 



There is a considerable difference in climate between the lower and 
upper parts of the parish, — the crops being a week or ten days ear- 
lier in the land to the north of Tranent than they are to the south, 
which is above 200 feet higher. Draining has been generally prac- 
tised with much advantage, and of late years great benefit has 
arisen from the introduction of tile-draining. As an instance of 
the effect of draining, the land, which in 1745 separated the two 
armies, was described as an impassable morass, but it now bears good 
crops along its whole extent. Tile-draining is still in the act of 
being vigorously carried on, and experience every year proves 
more strongly the advantages to be derived from it. 

The ordinary duration of leases is for the period of nineteen years, 
and the stipulations are generally of an equitable nature between 
landlord and tenant. 

The state of the farm-buildings is generally good, and the pa- 
rish is, upon the whole, well enclosed with hedges and ditches, 
though this important part of agriculture might with advantage 
admit of more extension. 

The principal improvement which has been made since the last 
Statistical Account, is the cultivation of all the arable part of the 
links near the sea, and the whole of Tranent moor. By this means, 
above 300 Scots acres have been brought under culture and en- 
closed. 

Quarries and Mines. — There are several sandstone quarries in 
the parish adapted for building, though too soft to bear long ex- 
posure to the atmosphere without injury. The trap dikes also, de- 
scribed under " Mineralogy," afford good materials for the roads. 

The extensive coal mines of the parish have already been pretty 
fully described under Mineralogy. It is only necessary to add, that 
about 300 males, 100 females and children, are generally employed 
at them. 

The mode of workingthe coal strata is that usually adopted, name 
ly, " stoop and room," or a sufficient number of pillars of coal left to 
support the roof. Few horses have as yet been used, the baskets of 
coals being pushed by men along iron railways below ground, to the 
bottom of the pit, where they are raised by a horse gin or steam 
power. Most of the modern improvements in mining have been 
introduced, and of late years some of the pits have been " tubbed," 
or cased round with cast iron segments which form a cylinder. 
The operation is performed thus: A "wedging crib" or circle 
formed of pieces of oak is laid upon flic hard stratum, the 



TRANENT 



207 



cast iron seo-ments are then carefully placed on it, and a tlun piece 
of fir-wood is put betwixt every joint. After all the segments re- 
quired are built round the sides of the pit, and the whole kept 
down by a building of stone above, wedges are driven into the 
joints of the segments until the whole is made perfectly water tight ; 
the water being thus prevented from getting out of the porous 
strata and escaping down the pit. In former times, this was at- 
tained more rudely by casing the pit with wood; behind which, fine 
clay was carefully puddled. 

From the numerous old coal pits in the western parts of the pa- 
rish, and the breadth and number of the roads in that direction, 
it is probable that the greater part of the supply of coals for 
Edinburgh, was derived from this quarter in former times. 

Fisheries.— The inhabitants of the villages of Cockenzie and 
Portseton, amounting to about 700, are almost wholly engaged in 
fishing. Their boats are all open, without any deck, but of the finest 
construction, and the largest class : they are suited for the more 
distant fishings, and are calculated to stand a very heavy sea. 

During the winter, the fishermen are employed for the supply 
of the Edinburgh and Glasgow markets, in dredging oysters opposite 
their village, and in catching cod, whitings, flounders, &amp;c. either 
within the Frith of Forth, or sometimes on the Marr, a bank thirty 
miles to the east of St Abb's Head. 

In spring, a number of the men go to the whale-fishing in the 
ships from the Frith of Forth, and the north of England ; in which 
employment, many of them have distinguished themselves as the 
most dexterous harpooneers. A few years ago, several of the men 
endured all the rigors of a Polar winter, the ships having been en- 
circled with ice in Baffin's Bay. Their sufferings were dreadful, but 
the vessels were providentially drifted along many hundred miles 
of coast to the open sea, — where the sailors had the joy of meeting 
the ships which were sent out early in the season, in order to render 
them assistance ; and it is remarkable that, so far from the suffer- 
ings of their friends having the effect of deterring any from this 
dangerous employment, a young man volunteered to go in one of 
the earliest vessels to search for his relatives, and he had the inex- 
pressible delight of being in the first boat that boarded the ship in 
which were his father and others connected with him. The con- 
duct of the Cockenzie sailors during their long night of almost hope- 
lees darkness, was most praiseworthy : they devoted a portion of 



298 



HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



each day to religious exercises, and awaited with calm resignation 
the will of Providence. 

In summer, the fishermen who have not gone to the whale- 
fishing, proceed to Caithness in their large boats for the herring 
fishery, where they sell the produce of their labours to the curers. 
In autumn, they are again engaged in dredging oysters, and taking 
white fish and herrings when they appear at the mouth of the firth. 

There are no rents payable for the deep sea fishings, and the 
dues exigible for the oyster scalps are not regularly levied. 

The energy and enterprise of the fishermen, with no capital but 
their boats, which may have descended to them from their fathers, 
but stand in need of constant repairs and renewals,  are the sole 
means of maintainina the fisheries. 

Manufactures. — The chief manufacture in the parish is that of 
salt, which has been carried on for a long period, — 1.2 salt-pans 
having been built about 1630, by George third Earl of Winton. 
The mode of making the salt is simply, by evaporating by means of 
heat the aqueous particles of the sea, in oblong iron pans, 18 feet 
long by 10 feet broad, and 2 feet deep. The sea water is raised 
into the pans by buckets, swung on a suspended pole; and the coal 
used is of the small description, unfit for most other purposes. 

A man and a boy are employed in each of the six salt-pans now 
in operation ; the wages of the former being according to the quan • 
tity of salt produced, or about 18s. per week, and of the latter 8s. 
per week. The female members of the family also assist in tak- 
ing the salt out of the pans, and carrying it to the " girnels" or 
stores. 

Of late, a steam engine has been erected at Cockenzie for grind- 
ing bones and rape cakes, brought chiefly from Germany, to be used 
in agriculture, which have been found peculiarly beneficial as a 
manure for turnips and other crops. 

In Portseton, also, another steam engine has lately been erected 
for bruising linseed and expressing oil from it. The residue is 
formed into cakes for feeding cattle. 

These employments afford a fair remuneration to the workmen, 
and do not seem prejudicial either to health or morals. 

Navigation. — The number of boats belonging to the fishermen 
amounts to 31, of which 10 are of about 16 tons burden, and 21 of 
7 tons. 

There are two vessels belonging to the new harbour at Cock- 



TUANKNT. 



209 



eiuie, one of 120, the other of 100 tons buiden; they are em- 
ployed in the coasting and foreign trade. 

The number of vessels entering the present harbour of the 
Messrs Cadells during the year, is from 250 to 300, and the ton- 
nage about 20,000 tons. Of this, about one-sixth is from foreign 
ports. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The nearest market-towns are Haddington and Dalkeith, each 
about seven miles from Tranent. The greater part, however, of 
the grain from the parish goes to Edinburgh market, ten miles dis- 
tant. 

Villages.— villages in the parish are, — Tranent, containing 
upwards of 1780 inhabitants; — Cockenzie and Portseton, 757; 
Elphingston, 250; Meadowmill, 150,— total, about 2937 in the 
villages. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication to the 
capital are excellent, the great post road to Edinburgh passing- 
through the parish for three miles. The other lines of turnpike 
roads, extending to six miles, have of late been much improved, by 
being placed under the charge of surveyors. The total length of 
the turnpike roads in the parish extends to nine miles. The pa- 
rish roads, supported by statute labour, are far from being in an 
equally good state of repair. The funds amount to the small sum 
of L. 160 per annum, of which L. 36, 10s. is drawn by the turn- 
pike roaas, and the balance only of L. 123, 10s. is left for expenses 
and the support of the parish roads, extending in length to about 
fifteen miles, over which many heavy carriages pass. 

There is a regular post to and from Edinburgh twice a-day, al- 
so a twopenny post to Haddington, which is a recent and a great 
convenience. 

The public carriages on the post-road are very numerous, be- 
ing six passing Tranent each day to Edinburgh, including the 
Berwick mail, — and the like number out of Edinburgh. There is 
also a daily coach from North Berwick, passing Cockenzie, which 
carries the letters to and from Prestonpans. 

There are no public canals or railroads at present in the parish, 
but the proposed line of the Great North British railroad, to commu- 
nicate by Berwick, Newcastle, and Durham with the great English 
lines, will pass through the centre of the parish, a little to the north 
of the Meadowmill. A private iron railway, as already noticed, has 
been made by the Messrs Cadells, from Cockenzie to their coal- 



300 



IIAD11N;T0NSIIIIIK. 



works on the south side of Tranent, the length being about three 
miles. 

A harbour was erected by the same gentlemen in 1835, at a 
natural basin on the west side of the village of Cockenzie, for the 
purpose of shipping coal The cost amounted to about L. 6000, 
and the work was done in the most substantial manner, from a 
plan by Mr Robert Stevenson, civil-engineer. This harbour has 
16 feet depth of water in spring tides, and 10 in neap tides ; it is 
easy of access, and aftbrds complete shelter to vessels; while, dur- 
ing stormy weather, it is most advantageous to the[fishermen, who are 
thus enabled to run for a place of safety, instead of the exposed 
beach, formerly their only refuge. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church has been rebuilt since 
the last Statistical Account, a new one having been erected in 
1800. The situation is sufficiently convenient for the greaterpart of 
the population, the distance from the extremities of the parish be- 
ing at no place more than two miles and a-half. But the sittings 
having been divided amongst the heritors according to their valued 
rents, the great proportion of the inhabitants of the villages had 
no legal right to church accommodation. The only mortifications 
belonging to the parish are, the interest of L. 100, left by Lord 
Bankton, and L. 2 from Dr Schaw's Hospital at Preston. The 
church contains 888 sittings, of which about 20 are free. The 
manse was built in 1781, but has undergone several additions and 
repairs. The extent of the glebe is about six acres Scots, with 
about an acre of.moorland : and it may be valued at about L. 4 per 
Scots acre. 

The augmentation granted in 1831 raised the stipend to 18 
chalders of victual, but the teinds being exhausted, the amount 
allocated was 47 bolls, 1 firlot, 3 pecks, Of lippies of wheat; 81 
bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 3/g lippies of bear; 149 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 
pecks, Ifl lippies of oats; L. 59, 16s. 8d. Scots money; which at 
the fiars prices of that year amounted to L. 349, 6s. 10|d. Ster- 
ling, being a deficiency of the modified stipend to the extent of 
L.21, 17s. l|d' 

In the village of Cockenzie, a new church was, in 1838, completed 
by private subscription, aided by the General Assembly's Church 
Extension Committee; by the East Lothian Church Extension So- 
ciety, and by L. 150 raised by the Rev. A. Forman of Innerwick. 
It contains 450 sittings, and is built so as to admit of galleries being 
afterwards added. The total expense of this church was about 



THANK NT. 



301 



L. 600. The stipend eno'aged to be paid to the minister, the 
Rev. Archibald Loi:imer, is L. 80 per annum, secured by a bond 
granted by several individuals who are interested in the vielfare of 
the district. The seat-rents, if fully let, with the collections, 
may probably amount to about L. 60 per annum ; but this is just 
one of the cases which so strongly proves the necessity of a na- 
tional endowment, — the fishermen, unwilling to move from the coast 
to a church distant from their boats, wfere so anxious for the minis- 
trations of a clergyman at their own homes, that they subscribed 
to the utmost extent of their means ; they further showed their in- 
terest in the Church by delaying to proceed to the northern her- 
ring fishery for several days, though the wind was favourable and 
the season advanced, in order that they might be present at the 
opening of their place of worship; — and yet with all this anxiety to 
promote the object, they were utterly unable of themselves to fur- 
nish even a small portion of the funds for building the church or 
supporting the minister. 

There is one Dissenting chapel in Tranent, lately rebuilt, be- 
longing to the United Associate Synod. The minister, the Rev. Wil- 
liam Parlane, A. M., it is believed, is paid in the usual way from the 
seat-rents and collections ; but the amount of stipend is not known. 

The total population of the parish, as formerly mentioned, is 
3650 ; of this number about 2980 are attached to the Establish- 
ed Church, leaving about 640 belonging to all other religious de- 
nominations. 

The attendance on the parish church is not particularly regular. 
The average number of communicants at the Established Church is 
about 600. 

Two missionaries, one supported by the friends of the Esta- 
bhshment, the other by the Dissenters, have lately commenced to 
labour among the population of Tranent, and are well received by 
the people. 

There are two Bible and Missionary Societies, one connected 
with the Established, the other with the Dissenting conffreffation. 

1 he church collections for the poor are very small, not exceed- 
ing L. 15 per annum, in consequence of the large assessment. The 
collections for religious and charitable objects may be about L. 13 
per annum. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is seven ; 
the parochial school in Tranent, the average number attending 
being 100; a free school at Stiell's Hospital, endowed, attended 

HADDINGTON. U

HADDINGTONSHIRE. 



by about 140 children ; three schools in the village of Tranent, 
unendowed ; one in Elphingstone ; and one in Cockenzie, chiefly 
supported by private subscription. 

The ordinary branches, English, writing, and geography, are 
taught in all the schools; and in the parochial school such pupils 
as desire it are also instructed in French, Latin, land-measuring 
and architectural drawing. The salary of the parochial school- 
master is the maximum,' L. 34, 6s. 7d., and his school fees gene- 
rally amount to about L. 80 per annum. The parish schoolmaster 
is furnished with a good house and garden. 

Library. — There is a subscription library in Tranent. 
Charitable and other Institutions. — The only hospital in the 
parish is that endowed by the late George Stiell, smith and builder 
in Edinburgh, a native of Tranent, who left property yielding 
about L.900 per annum, for the education of a few boys and girls as 
inmates, and a free day school, in which are educated about 140 
children. The Lord Justice- Clerk, the Sheriff of the county, and 
the minister of the parish, are governors and directors ex officiis; 
and David Anderson, Esq. of St Germains, and John Gray, Esq. 
solicitor-at-law, Edinburgh, trustees for life. 

This institution has been productive of much benefit to the pa- 
rish, as the directors have very wisely devoted their chief atten- 
tion to the free school, their funds not being adequate to the re- 
ception of many inmates. The children, in addition to an excel- 
lent education at the school, are daily provided with bread and milk, 
to prevent the necessity of their return home between school hours, 
or being compelled to bring unequal shares of provision for their 
support during'jthe day. 

A handsome building was erected for this institution in 1821, 
from a plan by Mr Burn, at the cost of about L. 3000: it is situated 
a little to the south of the Meadow mill, in a very central position. 

Friendly Societies.— There are several Friendly Societies con- 
nected with the working population of Tranent and the fishermen 
of Cockenzie ; of these the principal is the Carters' Friendly So- 
ciety of Tranent, which is in possession of considerable funds, and 
has been in existence since 1795; but of late years, many of these 
useful institutions have been broken up, in consequence of then- re- 
sources failing, they having been founded on erroneous calculations. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is from 100 to 110, and the average sum 
allotted to each per week from Is. to Is. 6d ; but the mamte- 



TRANKNT. 



303 



nance of two lunatics in asylums adds considerably to the burdens 
on the parish. 

The annuiil assessment for the poor amounts to aboilt L. 440 or 
L. 450, of which not above L. 15 is derived from collections at 
the church door and mortcloths. There are no other funds available 
for the purpose. 

It is to be feared that the disposition among the poor to refram 
from seeking parochial relief, is far from diminishing, and the for- 
mer wholesome feeling, that it was a degradation to accept of pa- 
rish aid, or to allow their relations to be a burden on the poor's 
funds, is fast wearing out among the lower orders. 

Prisons. — The nearest prison is that of Haddington, the county 
town, seven miles distant. There is a district constable stationed 
at Tranent, who has a temporary lock-up room. 

Fairs. — There cannot now be said to exist any fairs in the pa- 
rish. Cockenzie fair was formerly a place of considerable resort 
on the first Thursday of November, for the purpose of hiring ser- 
vants and providing clothes and other articles for the winter ; but 
since the introduction of shops, it has almost entirely dwindled away. 

Inns, Alehouses. — There are two inns at Tranent, with respectable 
accommodation. The number of ale-hcenses, including the above 
inns, granted in the parish, amounts to no less than 40, being twenty- 
six for the village of Tranent, nine for Cockenzie, two for Portseton, 
two for Elphingstone, and one for the Meadowmill. The Justices 
of Peace have, of late years, done all in their power to diminish the 
number; and it would certainly be a great boon to the country, 
were the public-houses greatly reduced. 

Fuel. — The supply of coal in every part of the parish, is most 
abundant and cheap; the quality is rather soft, and does not con- 
tam so much bitumen as in many other districts ; it is procured in 
various parts of the parish, and the highest price at the pit-mouth 
is at present Gs. 8d. per ton. 

 The keepers of alehouses at Cockenzie and Portseton have lately, in imitation 
of those in Prestonpans, entered into a most praiseworthy resolution to abstain from 
openmg their houses on the Sabbath, except to wayfaring people, and have publicly 
bound themselves to observe this rule.

"PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF T.OTHIAX AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. W. BRUCE CUNNINGHAM, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The parish of Prestonpans, or more properly of Pres- 
ton, derives its name from the circumstance of the monks of Ho- 
lyrude and of Newbottle, the early superiors of the soil, in this and 
part of the adjoining parish of Tranent, having erected on the sea 
shore pans for the manufacture of salt. For a long time, its eccle- 
siastical name was Salt- Preston. Its present name, however, seems 
to have been in common use from an early period. The most an- 
cient name appears to have been Aldhavimer or Alliammcr ; but 
this was soon lost in that of Priestistoun, Pricststoun, Priestoun, 
Prestoun. 

Origin. — The church, a vicarage of the monastery of Holyrude, 
was, with the town and castle of Preston, burnt by the Earl of 
Hertford in 1544, and the inhabitants of the united baronies of 
Preston and Prestonpans had thereafter obtained a right of fre- 
quenting the church of Tranent, though there was not any regular 
union of the two parishes. This continued until the conclusion of 
that century, when George Hamilton, the proprietor of the united 
baronies, and his son, Sir John, having bestowed the ground for a 
church, churchyard, and school, and endowed a minister and 
schoolmaster, with glebe, garden, and stipends ; while, at the same 
time, a church and school-house had been erected at his own ex- 
pense by the celebrated Mr John Davidson. Preston was, in l.'igS, 
recognized by the ecclesiastical legislature as, quoad sacra, an in- 
dependent parish ; and, in 1606, an act of Parliament was obtain- 
ed by Sir John Hamilton, formally separating it from Tranent, in 
order to obviate all dispute in regard to its temporal relations. The 
inscription over the north or principal door of the old church was — 

sedem dedit prestonus. 

aedificavit davidsonus. 

TEXIT AVILLIAMSONUS. 



I'RESTONPANS.

Extent. — Territorially, this parish is one of the smallest in Scot- 
land. It contains about 760 acres, is quoad civilia about 2 miles 
long, and 1 broad ; and is bounded on the north by the Frith of 
Forth ; on the east and south, by the parish of Tranent ; and on the 
west, by Inveresk. 

Topographical Appearances. — With the exception of one or two 
inconsiderable knolls to the south-west of the ancient village of 
Preston, the whole parish is very flat. At the same time, forming 
in part the southern boundary of a wide bay, it commands a very 
extensive prospect. There is nothing more truly picturesque in the 
scenery of the Lowlands than the seaward view from the low sandy 
beach to the east of the village of Prestonpans. Its bulwark to the 
sea is composed of reefs of low rocks, in which there are very cha- 
racteristic proofs of the strong pressure of the waters of the Frith 
on its southern shore. At low water, in one part of the rocks, se- 
veral circular holes of almost similar depth, which are obvious- 
ly the remains of garden- wells, are well fitted to teach the inhabi- 
tants the importance of guarding the natural bulwarks of their vil- 
lage against violation. 

Geology. — In the shale and sandstone connected with the coal- 
field in this parish, the common vegetable fossils are very abundant. 
Branches of trees, with clear impressions of aquatic plants, princi- 
pally of the Juncus tribe, may be found on carefully searching the 
rubbish thrown out from the borings of new shafts. Indeed, there 
are few districts in which fossil botany on a limited scale may be 
more easily studied than the neighbourhood of Prestonpans. 

Zoology — Mammalia. — In so small a parish as this, it cannot be 
thought that the Mammalia will be numerous. Tho wood-mouse 
 Mas sylvaticus, common shrew Sorex araneus, and the weasel 
{Mustela vulgaris, are common. The stoat {Mustela erminea, is 
sometimes though rarely seen. Several years ago, an albino of the 
brown rat {Mus decumanus  was shot. It is now in the minister's 
possession, and in colour is yellowish-white. Although its skin is 
entirely free from signs of disease, its general form and aspect are 
those commonly connected with internal disorganization. Of the 
amphibious quadrupeds which visit the waters of the Frith, the 
Ptioca vitulina, though now comparatively rare on the southern 
shore, is the most common in this neighbourhood. 

Aves. — The ornithology is rich both in aquatic and land birds. 
In the Frith, at their varied seasons, the divers, ducks, and gulls, 
may be seen in great numbers, now floating at the will of the tide

in graceful beauty, and then in all the hurry and din of pursuit after 
the small fry, shoals of which people the water on the outside of the 
rocks. Of divers, besides speckled, we have the northern and the 
merganser {Mergus serrator. Of the duck tribe, the most un- 
common is the scaup {Ni/roca rnarila, of which some beautiful 
specimens were shot during the severities of last year's storm. All 
the other species which are met with in the Frith generally occur 
here also. We have also the shag {Phalacrocorax gramlus, the 
cormorant {Carbo cormoraiiiis, the oyster-catcher {Hamatopas 
ostralegiis, the curlew {Numenius arquata, the whimbrel {Nume- 
nius phcBopus, the redshank, godwit, turnstone, common sander- 
ling, grey, green, golden, and ring-necked plovers, the sea-lark, and 
the water-rail. In addition to the more common birds of the finch, 
bunting, and chat species, the stonechat and the mountain finch 
are sometimes found. A yellow variety of the common bunting is 
in the possession of Mr George Hay junior, who, by most exem- 
plary diligence, has added great knowledge and taste in the prepa- 
ration of specimens to no little natural talent for this most charm- 
ing study. The cuckoo is an annual visitant; the goat-sucker has 
been observed ; the red-tailed and spotted fly-catchers, and the gold- 
crested wren are not uncommon. Not fewer than one hundred spe- 
cies reside in or visit the parish in their proper seasons. Indeed, 
it is believed that there is no district in the whole country of so li- 
mited a nature, and at the same time so abundantly adorned with 
the winged tribes. 

Ichthyology.- — It is to be regretted, that, in some of those dis- 
tricts in which the most ample fields of natural history are pre- 
sented to the inquirer, the means of exploring them are unfortu- 
nately denied to him. Notwithstanding the writer's most anxious 
exertions to procure the rare specimens which the sea occasionally 
yields up to dredge, net, and line, from the fishermen under his 
own pastoral superintendence, he has almost entirely failed in at- 
taining his purpose, through their utter apathy to every thing like 
a love of the " unsaleable" creatures that " swim the ocean's 
stream." 

Perhaps the most rare species in this department of natural 
science, of which the parish can boast, is the ten-spined stickle- 
back Gasterosteus pimgiiius, which has been once met with by 
Dr Richard Parnell, in a small burn to the west of the village. 
This locality is mentioned by him in his admirable treatise on the 



PUESTONPANS. 



Fishes of the Forth. Of other species there is none known to the 
compiler of these notes to be deserving of any particular notice. 

Botamj. — For the study of botany, the parish of Prestonpans 
affords but a limited field. In the season of flowers, however, we 
have our own share of that rich store which nature yields. The 
Salicornia herbacea jointed glasswort grows on the salt flat near 
Morrison's Haven. The Phleum arenarium sea-side cat's-tail 
orass is found amonfj loose-blowing sand near the sea. The com- 
mon cowslip, bright as sun-light, occurs m sandy pastures and 
broken grounds. The common henbane {Hyuscyamus niger of 
dull sepulchral hue, is found in solitary plants amongst rubbish of 
sandstone near the eastern boundary of the parish. The follow- 
ing are also to be met with : the knotted hedge-parsley {Caucalis 
nodosa, between Ravensheugh toll-bar and Preston village ; the 
sea-side purple sandwort by the sea to the west of the Cuthill ; 
tetandrous chickweed near the village of Prestonpans ; and yellow 
stone-crop {Sedum rejiexum in the village of Preston. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Events. — The only transaction of note connected with 
the history of this parish, is the battle of Preston, which occurred 
in 1745, and in which Sir John Cope and the King's forces were 
ignominiously routed by the Highlanders following the Popish 
Pretender in his daring attempt upon the British throne. The 
action is reported to have commenced in the morning twilight of 
the 21st September, in the narrow road leading from the village 
of Preston towards Bankton and Tranent The day was chiefly 
decided in the neighbouring parish. Whatever glory or disgrace, 
accordingly, may be associated in the minds of any of the present 
generation, with an event, the remembrance of which has not al- 
together perished in this district, the parish of Tranent is entitled 
to the entire and undivided inheritance. 

The only memorial deserving of notice in this account is a tomb- 
stone in the eastern wall of the new church-yard, erected to the 
memory of Mr Stewart of Physgill, an officer in the royal army, 
who is described as having been inhumanly and barbarously mur- 
dered by the Highlanders. 

Ancient Family of Preston. — In several works illustrative of the 
earlier periods of our national history, the Hamiltons of Preston 
are honourably mentioned in connection with events of imperish- 
able interest and renown. Possessintr considerable influence at 
court and with the country, more than one member of their family

employed it in an active vindication of the vital principles of ec- 
clesiastical and civil freedom. Their valuable friendship was en- 
joyed by the illustrious confessor, Mr John Davidson, in his times 
of perplexity and peril. And at a later day, when the same great 
principles for which he faithfully contended, were again invaded 
with much indiscretion and little success, Robert, the chivalrous 
and high-minded brother of Sir William Hamilton of Preston, 
•was distinguished as the commander of the Presbyterians in the 
successfid skirmish at Drumclog, and the disastrous battle of 
Bothwell Bridge. Sir William Hamilton, the present distinguish- 
ed Professor of Logic in the University of Edinburgh, is. the re- 
presentative of the family. 

Eminent Men. — Mr Davidson, already referred to, was the first 
incumbent of the parish. He was transported from that of Lib- 
berton, in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, in 1596, and continued, 
with the exception of the time of his imprisonment in Edinburgh 
Castle, in the active discharge of his pastoral duties until his death, 
which, in so far as may be safely inferred from the earliest men- 
tion of his successor's name in the session records, appears to 
have occurred about the year 1606. He was a' man of singular 
natural endowments, and, in common with many of his contempo- 
raries and friends, was greatly distinguished by his extensive and 
manifold acquirements. Possessing a large share of that peculiar 
sagacity which the character of his times was well fitted to unfold 
and sharpen, and being at the same time of remarkable prompti- 
tude and decision of character, he was naturally required to act a 
prominent part in the transactions of the Reformed Church. To 
him was committed the arduous, though honourable part of ex- 
communicating the simonaical and perverse Montgomery, whose 
affection for filthy lucre appears to have been of more strength 
and authority, than his regard to the will of the great Head of the 
Church. In 1596, Mr Davidson was elected to preside at the 
memorable meeting for humiliation and prayer, which was accom- 
panied with a most remarkable discovery of the divine gVace and 
mercy. It was held in the Little Church of Edinburgh, on Tues- 
day the 30th of March. A large number both of ministers and 
private Christians attended. A double portion of the heavenly 
spirit was imparted to them all. Mr Davidson exhorted them, as 
he was well qualified to do, in a strain of powerful and touching 
appeals to their hearts. So great was the success of his ministra- 
tioas on that occasion, that the whale assembly were moved to 



PIIESTONPANS.

weeping-. " Before they dismissed, they solemnly entered into a 
new league and covenant, holding up their hands with such signs 
of sincerity as moved all present." 

In this parish the name of Mr Davidson must ever be honoured 
and precious. He was its generous benefactor. His patrimony, which, 
from the extent of his charities, must have been considerable, was 
in a great measure devoted to promote the best interests of his pa- 
rishioners. " At his own expense," as we read in the Life of 
Andrew Melville, " he built a church and a manse, a school-house 
and a dwelling-house for the master. The school was erected for 
teachingthe three learned languages, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew." 
It is greatly to be regretted that the present generation in Preston- 
pans, equally with the last, have failed to discover the existence of 
this, in many respects, illustrious seminary ; and therp is reason to 
fear that, unless some fortunate concurrence of events shall dis- 
pel the mystery which, for much more than a century, has brooded 
over the fate of an institution by which the youth of our own day 
would be so greatly blessed, their friends in the parish must 
still continue those exertions by which they will most happily 
imitate the noble example set before them, in the generous sacri- 
fices of Mr Davidson. The funds assuredly which have disap- 
peared would have been most serviceable in a parish where there 
is a most dismal deficiency of education, and an equally deplora- 
ble abundance of pauperism. 

Alexander Hume, the Grammarian. — The name of this eminent 
scholar occurs in the first volume of the session records of the pa- 
rish. He was principal master of Mr Davidson's school, having 
been appointed to that office in 1606. In the valuable appendix 
to Dr M'Crie's Life of Andrew Melville, are some interesting no- 
tices of his engagements and high reputation. He appears to 
have been a linguist of no mean order. He was the author of a 
grammar entitled " Grammatica nova in usum juventutis Scoticae 
ad methodum revocata," which was appointed to be used in all 
schools by the Privy- Council and Parliament. After being ten 
years in Prestonpans, he was removed to Dunbar, where he taught 
the grammar school. 

Antiquities — Village of Preston. — In the traditional tales of the 
district, this ancient homestead of the monks has a prominent 
place. Being on the great road of an earlier day, and at any easy 
distance from Edinburgh, Preston was frequently honoured by 
the presence of Royalty itself, and if in this instance the voice of

common fame be that of truth, it was too often the scene of more 
merriment than discretion. It is now not a little remarkable for 
that species of tranquillity which is closely allied to dulness. Of 
ancient families, several mansions, venerable either in form or by 
decay, or both, may still be pointed out. Northfield House, 
the early proprietors of which, with their .descendants, have, in 
common with their ecclesiastical forerunners, long since passed 
away, is situate at its western extremity. At no great distance 
from the south-west turn in the road, is the house in which a 
branch of the Hamiltons once resided. It is memorable as having 
been a place of security from the ravages of the plague, in grateful 
commemoration of which the words " no plague shall near thy 
dwelling come, no ill shall thee befall," are said to have been in- 
scribed over the principal door-way. To the north of the village 
stands the venerable tower in which the lords of the soil dwelt for 
many a day. Its origin is involved in considerable obscurity. Sir 
Walter Scott, who from his familiar acquaintance with the parish, 
no less than his zeal for antiquarian learning, must, if any living 
man could have known any thing whatever of its earliest history, 
have been intelligent and accurate regarding it, supposed it to have 
been an outpost of the Earls of Home in those remote times when 
that noble family ruled with princely authority over the whole 
south-eastern district of Scotland. However that may be, towards 
the conclusion of the fourteenth century, the castle and estate of 
Preston came, by marriage, to the family of Hamilton of Fingal- 
ton and Ross, the premier cadet of the name. The castle, of 
which the keep alone remains, was burned in 1544, by the Earl of 
Hertford ; again, in 1 150, by Cromwell, after the battle of Dun- 
bar ; and it must have been a place of considerable strength and 
importance. The estate, which was sold prior to the Revolution 
of 1688, has been long parcelled out. 

Preston Cross. — In a garden, on the opposite side of the road 
from the castle garden wall, is the ancient cross of the village. 
Annually, in the beginning of July, it is the scene of a little inno- 
cent merry-making. As if at the summons of some ancient wizard, 
in a mood of mirth and gentleness, a numerous company unex- 
pectedly encircle the solitary pillar, and, amidst the agreeable 
warmth of a summer noon, interchange many pleasant and friend- 
ly salutations, in commemoration, doubtless, of imjjortant transac- 
tions which happened long ago. Their accustomed rites being 
duly performed, the reign of silance is again allowed to resume its

sway around that simple monument of departed greatness. It is 
the property of the Chapmen of the Lothians, and is said to have 
been acquired by them in 1636. It is supposed by some anti- 
quaries that the company referred to are the modern representa- 
tives of that most respectable fraternity, and it is worthy of remark, 
that, according to common report, the descendants of those most 
useful persons are men no less deserving of public confidence and 
respect, than their mercantile progenitors were. 

JRuin at Dolphingston. — In the hamlet of this name, through 
which is the great road to London, are several broken walls and 
gables, obviously of very ancient erection. From the peculiar af- 
fection cherished by the monks for this district of country, it is cer- 
tainly allowable, in the absence of any distinct information regard- 
ing their origin and use, to suppose that here they had another 
pleasant and profitable abode. 

Land-owners. — The chief proprietors in the parish are, Sir 
George Grant Suttie, Bart, of Balgone and Prestongrange, pa- 
tron of the parish ; William Aitchison, Esq. of Drummore ; George 
Sime, Esq. of Northfield; John Fowler, Esq. of Hallidoun and 
Burnrigg; the Trustees of Schaw's Hospital; the Trustees of 
George Watson's Hospital ; Colonel Macdowall of Logan ; Mrs 
Gowans; Sir William Hamilton, Bart, of Preston and Fingalton; 
the Heirs of the late Miss Clapperton ; and William Cockburn, 
Esq. of Preston Cottage. 

The number of acres under cultivation is 739. The rental is 
L. 2929, 2s. 1 Od. 

Parochial Registers. — During the last century, the records of 
session have been kept with considerable care. Between the years 
1600 and 1690, there are several important blanks. It is serious- 
ly to be feared that the volumes awanting are irrecoverably lost. 
The earliest entry is in the register of births and marriages. Its 
date is 1596; 1601 is the earliest date in the record of discipline. 
It is supposed, that there are few more venerable registers any- 
where than in this parish. Unfortunately, the apparently sportive 
variations in the writing have hitherto rendered the treasures of 
wisdom concealed in them accessible to an expert few alone.

Character of the People. — There arc many excellent people in 
this parish at present, and it is earnestly to be hoped that the num- 
ber of such may yearly increase. If the means of juvenile educa- 
tion were more abundant, arid the passion for ardent spirits less 
powerful than it is, there would be more appropriate themes for 
the exercise of a despondent mind than the future amelioration 
of our population. Violations of the Lord's day are not so cus- 
tomary here as they once were. A more enlightened regard to 
the sacred behests of scriptural principle is on the increase ; and 
we live in the hope of our posterity being at least no worse than 
their progenitors. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — As the arable lands in the parish are very limited 
in their extent, and the writer of this Account is far from being 
intelligent regarding either the practices or profits of agriculture, 
he deems it no great departure from a modest prudence, to refer 
to the former Statistical Report, in which there is no lack of learn- 
ing on that head. It is believed that the present agriculturists in 
the parish have kept up with the recent improvements in their art. 

Fisheries. — At the proper season of the year, the fishery of oys- 
ters forms the principal occupation of a large number of our sea- 
faring men. Long before dawn, in the bleakest season of the year, 
their dredging song may be heard afar off, and, except when the 
wind is very turbulent, their music, which is not disagreeable, ap- 
pears to be an accompaniment of labours that are by no means un- 
successful. A constant trade is maintained by means of large boats, 
capable of containing 25,000 or 30,000 oysters, with Newcastle, 
Shields, and Hartlepool. Of the individuals engaged in this fishery, 
it may be safely averred, that if their expenditure were regulated 
by a due regard to their incomes, many would be far from being 
poor, and not a few would have the comfort of being passing rich 
on L. 40 a-year. 

Trade. — The trade of Prestonpans was formerly of very con 
siderable extent ; and among the privileges of the barony was a 
free harbour, with right of levying dues and customs to the same 
extent as those exigible at Leith, or any other port of the kingdom. 

Manufactures.— Twv\\-\g a long period, a large lunnber of per- 
sons in the parish were regularly employed in the manufacture of 
stoneware, tiles, bricks, &amp;c. Of late, however, all the operations 



PllESTONPANS. 



313 



of pottingy with the exception of two small works for brown ware, 
have been suspended, to the serious disadvantage of numerous and 
manifold interests. In the immediate neighbourhood of Preston- 
grange colliery, drain tiles are made. 

There is a manufactory of soap, in which several hands are con- 
stantly employed by Mr Paterson, whose business appears to be, 
most deservedly, thriving. 

In the salt-pans of Mr William Alexander, a very large quan- 
tity of that most necessary article of commerce is annually manu- 
factured. He imports his rock salt from the neighbourhood of 
Liverpool, and is enabled to produce a commodity of superior ex- 
cellence. It is equally deserving of remark and extensive imita- 
tion, that Mr Alexander, desirous of advancing the general inte- 
rests of his workmen, has, during the last twelvemonths, paid their 
wages on Friday instead of Saturday ; and the result distinctly 
proves that neither his servants nor himself have had any reason 
to regret the change. It has evidently been followed by conse- 
quences so morally important, as to encourage other masters to 
adopt a similar plan. The condition of families is deeply affect- 
ed by the pay-day. 

The brewery of Mr Fowler has long been signalized by the high 
character of its ales. There is perhaps no similar manufactory in 
Scotland that has for so long a period sustained its well-earned ce- 
lebrity. Nor is it probable, that, in Mr Hislop's management, it 
will be less famous in future than it has been ifl the past. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
The common necessaries of life are procui-ed in the village of 
Prestonpans. It is believed that the greater part of the grain 
raised in the parish is sent to Edinburgh and sold there. 

Means of Communication.— TheYe is a carrier to Edinburgh 
twice a week from the parish. There is also daily communication 
by the North Berwick coach ; and the several carriers from the east 
pass through the village, on their way to town. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church was built in 1774. It af- 
fords accommodation for 750 persons, and, though in no way dis- 
tinguished either by elegance of furniture or beauty of aspect, 
it is, in comfort, inferior to none in the county. It is now by far 

• Since the Revolution, the following ministers have served the cure of this pa- 
rish :-,Mr John Moncrieff", Mr George Andrews, Mr Robert Ilorsburgh, great- 
great-grandfather of the present incumbent, Mr William Carlyle, Mr Matthew 
llcid, Mr William Roy, Dr Joseph M'Corinick, Mr John Trotter, Dr Peter Prim- 
rose, and William Bruce Cunningham. 



314

too small for the population, and, indeed, at the period of its ori- 
ginal erection, it must have been deficient. It is capable of being 
both heated and lighted,— advantages the value of which are duly 
felt and appreciated by the parishioners. The extent of the glebe 
is 6 acres. The stipend is 16 chalders, and above L. 17 in money, 
in which the allowance for communion elements is included. The 
manse was put into a most comfortable state of repair in 1 834. It 
would be a happy condition for the families of ministers, in gene- 
ral, if the same consideration for their comfort were displayed by 
heritors, as those of this parish have all along manifested for the 
personal and domestic comfort of its incumbent. 

Almost all the population adhere to the Established Church, 
and, in so far as any man has an opportunity of knowing the con- 
dition and feelings of the people of a parish so poor as this is, he 
will not be slow to condemn Voluntaryism as utterly inadequate to 
the supply of their spiritual wants. The Dissenters of all deno- 
minations and ages amount to 100 individuals. 

Education. — Besides the parochial and infant schools, the latter 
of which is on the Lowland Scheme of the General Assembly's 
Committee, there are four schools in the parish. One of these has 
been commenced lately under the patronage of Sir George Grant 
Suttie, Bart. As it is planted in what is rather a necessitous dis- 
trict, and receives most valuable assistance from its patron, it is 
likely to be well attended, and to prove exceedingly useful. The 
teacher appears to be diligent in his work, and is deserving of all 
encouragement. The other three schools are taught on the 
teachers' own adventure alone. The parochial schoolmaster has 
the maximum salary : and his fees may amount to L. 40 a year. 
He is also session and heritors' clerk. The school is taught by an 
assistant and successor. A Sabbath school has been taught in the 
parish church for several years. Nearly 200 children attend. It 
is taught by one of the elders, the parochial schoolmaster, and se- 
veral members of the church. 

Friendly Societies. — At one period, this parish had more than 
enough of such institutions. The only survivors now are the Carters', 
Gardeners', several yearly societies, and the Sailors' Incorpora- 
tion. The funds belonging to the last-mentioned exceed L. 1200, 
and hitherto have been managed with considerable skill and pru- 
dence. It is much to be feared that, except the yearly societies 
and the Sailors, the others are not based on those principles which 
can insure their continuance or prosperity. 



PRESTONPANS. 



315 



Poor and Parochial Funds. — The annual assessnaent is about 
L. 300,— a sum wliicli, being required for a population of 2500 
souls, is a painful evidence of the extent and depth of the pau- 
perism. The number of poor on the roll is 80. To a very great 
extent it may be traced to the sale of ardent spirits on the Sab- 
bath, and the many evil habits that ensue from that vicious prac- 
tice. Within the last month, the third lunatic within the last two 
years has. been cast upon the poor's funds ; and in each of these 
lamentable cases, the origin is to be referred to the uncommon faci- 
lities of excessive drinking afforded on the Lord's day by the neces- 
sary cessation of toil, the enjoyment of wages, which are too ge- 
nerally paid on the Saturday night, and the open sale of intoxi- 
cating liquors at all hours on the Sabbath day. Notwithstanding 
the very onerous assessment which is annually born by heritors 
and feuars, there are few parishes in Scotland where so much is 
done in a voluntary way for the poor and destitute of their neigh- 
hood. The average collections for several years have amounted 
to about 12s. each Sabbath, — a sum which, as there are few 
resident heritors in the parish, will cast into the shade the volun- 
tary collections of wealthier and more important districts. The 
average yearly amount of collection is L. 31. No spectacle 
can be more gratifying to the mind of the friends of the poor, than 
the large amount of copper-money which is weekly cast into the 
charity-plates. It is highly expressive of the feelings of a class 
who cannot boast of much gold or silver, — and may dictate a pro- 
fitable lesson to many who have been much more highly favoured 
with the good things of this life. A distribution' of coals, provid- 
ed by a public subscription, is annually made under the auspices 
of Mr Paterson, whose services to the poor are not more unwea- 
ried than they are disinterested, — while, with equal regularity and 
constancy, the members of many a poor and needy household are 
cheered and comforted by the generous offices of Sir George and 
Lady Harriet Suttie, whose aid, amid the rigours of winter, is never 
solicited in vain. 

Inns and Alehouses. — There are 24 houses in the parish in which 
ardent spirits are legally sold ; of these 7 are public-houses. As may 
be inferred from what has been already remarked regarding a main 
cause of the vast pauperism, by which both the property and in- 
dustry of the parish are so severely oppressed, an enormous quan- 
tity of inebriating liquors were at one period sold on the Sabbath. 
The scenes connected with this fearful abuse were of the most 



IIADDINOTONSUIUK. 



affecting and disgusting description. At a very early hour in the 
morning, after a night of drunkenness and riot, mothers of fami- 
lies might be seen hurrying with steps as rapid as if their immor- 
tal flestinies depended on their speed, with vessels containing gallons 
of spirits, but partially, if at all concealed. At a later hour, wither- 
ed-looking children, scarcely escaped from the bonds of help- 
less infancy, might be witnessed passing to and fro amid the 
severities of the wintry storm, in fearful ministry to the cruel and 
remorseless passions of their benighted and ruined parents. From 
the closing hours of the preceding evening, until the midnight 
darkness of the day of God, the peace of the community was ever 
at stake. The coarse shout of brutal merriment, — the vicious 
and vulgar oath, — the shriek of fear bursting from woman's lips, 
— the appalling sounds of injury and violence, — all these might 
be heard issuing from dwellings, where not only men and women, 
but little children, would be found swelling with hoarse notes the 
confused din and disturbance. 

A proposal for discontinuing the sale of spirits on the Lord's day 
having been made, it was, upon the whole, most favourably re- 
ceived by the dealers; who entered unanimously into a formal re- 
solution against the practice. This resolution is now universally 
adhered to ; and its effects have been most beneficial.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. ROBERT BALFOUR GRAHAM, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Various etymologies are given of the name. One 
only appears unexceptionable. Aber is well known to signify the 
termination or mouth of a river, and wick, a town; hence the 
name 'Berwick, dropping the initial letter which is retained in 
Aberdeen, Abernethy, Aberdour, Aberbrothic, &amp;c. This is pre- 
cisely descriptive of the situation of the town of North Ber- 
wick, on a corner or an angle of land at the mouth of the river or 
Frith of Forth. It is called North Berwick, evidently to distin- 
guish it from South Berwick, so designated in the charters of the 
twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries ; which was also ori- 
ginally a Scotch town, though now an English one, and now styl- 
ed Berwick-upon-Tweed. One other etymology may be cited. 
Chalmers, in his Caledonia, states, that in those early charters, and 
in the Northumbrian topography, the orthography of the name is 
Bar-ivic or Bareioic : the bare or naked village ; appropriate, as 
he conceives, to the site of North Berwick, which, according to 
his representation, stands on the naked shore of the Forth. 

Extent — Boundaries. — The parish consists of a royal burgh 
and a landward district, and extends 3 miles from west to east, and 
upwards of 'i miles from north to south. It is bounded on the 
north by the Frith of Forth ; on the south, by the parishes of 
Whitekirk and Prestonkirk ; on the west, by the parish of Dirleton ; 
and on the east, partly by the Frith of Forth, and partly by Auld- 
hame, an ancient parish now united with the conjoined parishes of 
Whitekirk and Tynninghame. 

Mountains. — There is a picturesque range of trap rocks 
from east to west, at Balgone and Rockville, about two miles south 
from the town, partly wooded and partly bare, of great beauty ; a 
deep pass through which line, forming the public road to Linton,

covered with copse, and studded sideM'ay with little perennial 
springs, is an unique picture of choice Highland scenery. North 
Berwick Laio half a mile south from the town, is a very beautiful 
conical hill, about 940 feet above the level of the sea, standing 
on an elevated plain, and of comparatively easy ascent. The 
various views in ascending, and especially from the summit of the 
hill, inland and seaward, are of the most delighting and com- 
manding character. The ruins on the top are only of modern 
date, and were the residence of the party — a naval officer and 
three assistants, in charge of the signal station established there- 
on during the late war, and dismantled on the return of peace. 
The erections are all unroofed, and yearly accumulating the usual 
interest and tokens of time and tempest. The Law is of consider- 
able extent, fully 70 acres, and is used for the pasture of sheep. 
It is wooded near the base to the east, whence there is an ascent 
of the mountain by a prepared zig-zag path, called from its form 
the M-Walk. An enclosed green meadow, enriched with venerable 
elm trees, surrounds it on the south and west. On the south side 
of the hill is a quarry of excellent reddish stone, from which the 
town has principally been built. 

Links. — Links extend along the shore. Those to the west of the 
town are attached to the Abbey portion of the barony of North Ber- 
wick, and are pastured by the cows of the inhabitants of the West- 
gate, the portion of the town beyond the bounds of the royalty. 
Those to the east of the town are the property of the town, a 
common for the burgesses, whose cows graze along, terminating 
with the public washing-house and bleaching green, and bounded 
by Mill-burn, the only stream in the parish. It is proposed to 
feu the southern and elevated portion of the eastern links for vil- 
las, according to a plan which is now being arranged ; a scheme 
which promises to be an essential improvement to the appearance 
and interests of North Berwick. 

Coast. — The coast, very rocky, full of inequalities andindentures, 
mav be stated to be of about three miles and a-half in extent, faced 
on the west by the greenstone island of Craigleith, and on the east 
by the Bass. A very beautiful semicircular bay lies immediately 
to the west of the harbour reaching to Point Garry ; a smaller is to 
the east of the town at the foot of the Rhodes farm ; and a third and 
larger, much admired, named Canty Bay, lies about three miles 
east of the town, directly opposite to the Bass, which is the resi- 
dence of the tenant of the Bass, and his assistants, where boats 

4

are constantly kept for the conveyance of visitors to the far-famed 
rock. The shore to the west is somewhat flat and sandy, but to 
the east it is generally high and rocky, with several rugged project- 
ing- headlands, terminating north-east with the extensive lofty pre- 
cipice on which stand the venerable and classic ruins of Tan tall an 
Castle. 

Directly opposite to the town of North Berwick, a mile from the 
shore, is an island, about a mile in circumference, called Craigleith. 
It is a bare barren rock, inhabited only by rabbits and sea-fowl. The 
jack-daws are in immense numbers, and it is a favourite residence 
of the Tommy-norrie, alias the Coulterneh or puffin. Th • town- 
council had resolved, many years ago, in pecuniary difficulties, to sell 
this island, and it was intended to dispose of it by lottery. Arrange- 
ments were gone into accordingly ; but it was discovered that such 
a transaction would have been illegal; and in 1814 it was sold to 
Sir Hew Dalrymple, Bart, for L. 400. It is now conjoined with 
the North Berwick barony. Steamers and other vessels regularly 
pass in the channel between the island and North Berwick. Oc- 
casionally in storms from the north-east or east, the tremendous 
dashing and breaking of the mighty waves on the white precipitous 
cliffs on the eastern part of this island, create a scene peculiarly 
sublime. 

Climate. — On the whole, the climate is peculiarly salubrious- 
There is no prevalent distemper, no ague; and pulmonary consump- 
tion is peculiarly rare. The register of deaths for the last six 
months of 1838 gives only two adults, and three young children. 
Throughout 1838, the recorded deaths in the parish are only five 
adults, and seven children. The winter is generally clear and 
mild; in spring, however, from the prevalence of the east and 
north-east winds, it is often keenly cold ; the geniality of summer 
and autumn is amply attested in the crowded influx of strangers for 
the enjoyment of sea-bathing and perambulation among the beau- 
tiful scenery around. 

Hydrographij.—The Frith of Forth bounds the parish on the 
south and east, semi-circumambient to Auldhame Bay. One or two 
msignificant streamlets wind their course to the Forth, but are 
scarcely more than the confluence of drains or trivial marshes. Mill- 
Burn, however, deserves notice, meandering its way round the west 
and south base of the Law, and through a sweetly secluded and 
wooded ravine, styled the G/e/,— a delightful retreat and walk, shel- 
tered from every wind, and opening at its termination on a splendid

view of the Frith, embracing the Isle of May, the east nook of 
Fife, and Craigleith. 

Geology. — The rocks in this parish belong to the secondary and 
alluvial classes, and of these the predominating kinds are secondary. 

I. Secondary formations. — These are sandstone, limestone, and 
trap. The sandstone, generally of a red colour, sometimes con- 
tains beds of limestone ; one of these, remarkable for its offensive 
smell, occurs at Rhodes quarry, about half a mile from North 
Berwick. The sandstone and limestone are older than the true 
coal metals and, therefore, workable coal is not to be expected 
under or in them. The trap or whinstone rocks which form the 
greater part of the parish, either cover or traverse in various ways 
the sandstone strata. Immediately above the town of North Ber- 
wick, rises the beautiful conical hill, named North Berwick- Law, 
whose summit is about 940 feet above the level of the sea, and 
800 feet above its base. The district around the hill is low, and 
slightly undulated. The lowest rock visible is a variety of trap 
tufa ; higher up is amygdaloid. The middle and upper parts of 
the hill are of a beautiful and very sonorous variety of clinkstone 
porphyry ; and the summit rock is clinkstone porphyry, intermixed 
with crystals of augite, thus forming a transition to augite-green- 
stone. The clinkstone is, in some places, columnar, and forms 
cliffs of considerable magnitude. The Bass Rock, so celebrated in 
history, is a vast mass of secondary trap, resembling that of North 
Berwick- Law. It is an augite greenstone, generally fine granular, 
but sometimes so abounding in felspar as to verge on clinkstone. 
It exhibits, in a very marked manner, the tabular structure, as is 
also the case in the similarly composed Isle of May. 

IL Alluvial Strata. — These do not differ in individual and ge- 
neral characters from the alluvial deposits in the neighbouring pa- 
rishes. A more detailed account of the geology of this parish is 
given by Professor Jameson, in the third volume of the Memoirs 
of the Wernerian Natural History Society. 

Soil — The soil of this parish is, in general, as stated in the for- 
mer Statistical Account, rich, fertile, and well cultivated, pro- 
ducing large crops of wheat, barley, oats, peas and beans. No 
hemp is raised, nor flax. Turnips are now extensively cultivated, 
a'nd potatoes are raised in considerable quantities. This parish 
has largely shared in the improvements of modern agriculture ; 
and is distinguished for the science, and care, and success of its 
husbandry. 



NORTH BERWICK.

Zoology. — It is on the island of the Bass, that the rarer species of 
zoology in this parish are to be found. We subjoin the statement of 
the birds that breed on the Bass, as furnished to us by the keeper of 
the island. "The Solan goose or gannet, measuring 6 fet from tip 
to tip of the wings ; the large black gull, about 5 feet ; the large blue 
gull, about 4 feet 9 inches ; the kittiwake, about 3 feet 7 inches ; 
the common marrot or guillemot, about 2 feet 8 inches; the puffin 
or Tommy-norrie, about 2 feet ; the razor-billed marrot, or common 
puffin, about 2 feet 4 inches ; the falcon or hawk, the large raven, 
the eider-duck, and the cormorant; with innumerable flocks of 
smaller birds not peculiar to the Bass." 

The most celebrated of the sea fowl frequenting the Bass is cal- 
led the solan goose, or the gannet, a large white bird, measuring six 
feet from tip to tip of the wings, of which there are numberless thou- 
sands. It is almost peculiar to the Bass and Ailsa Craig ; though 
occasionally, we believe, it is seen in some of the northern and 
western islands of Scotland. It hatches on the bare niches or 
shelves of the rock. Its season of incubation is in the months of 
June and July. The keeper assures us it is mere fiction, that the 
bird broods with her sole on the egg, whence the name is supposed 
to have arisen, for that the egg under the body of this bird, is 
hatched in every way just as in the case of the domestic goose. It 
is equally a fiction that she lays but one egg. The keeper has 
taken more than a dozen eggs successively from the nest of one 
bird ; but leave her with her first egg and she will lay no more. 
It is equally a fiction that the egg is fastened to the rock by any 
peculiarly adhesive glutinous substance. The solan goose is a bird 
of annual migration. They come to the rock early in February 
in successive increasing flocks. It is about the beginning of August 
that the young are taken, after which the old begin to depart. 
They prepare to migrate as soon as their young are taken from 
them. They linger till October, and by December they were 
wont to be almost entirely gone, no one knows whither ; but with- 
in these last three years, hundreds have remained on the rock 
throughout the winter, — because herrings have remained; and 
they depart and return in correspondence with the movements of 
the fish on whom they prey.  Only the young birds are taken 
and sold. Sometimes even 1700 have been taken in a season, 
and sometimes not 700. They are taken from the - rock by the 

We nre asxurjd that, not for forty years, have so mnny herrings been taken in the 
Frilh of Forth as tluring last year.

keeper, who descends with a rope fastened around his waist, and 
held above by his assistant ; another rope is fastened to the rock 
above, which he holds around his hand, to facilitate his movements. 
He lays hold of the bi d with a hook, draws it toward him, and kills 
it with a stroke on the head ; then with great force throws it from him 
over the projections of the rock to the sea below, where the men in 
the boat are prepared to pick it up. The act of throwing, the keeper 
tells us, is the most difficult and perilous effort in the process. The 
feathers are valuable, and skilfully prepared for use : the grease is 
carefully secured, and sold for a variety of purposes. The flesh 
is of a fishy peculiar flavour, an epicurean honne-bouche ; not, how- 
ever, adapted to universal taste or enjoyment. — It is also a tradi- 
tional error, that the solan goose remains at one ancient invariable 
price. It has long ceased to be 2s. 6d. The keeper tells us, 
twenty years ago it was only Is. The usual price now is 9d. The 
eggs of the sea-fowls that are sold, are those only of the black 
aiid blue gull, at Is. 6d. a dozen. 

The parish is not remarkable for breeding any peculiar species 
of cattle. The fish commonly taken in the Frith are cod, had- 
dock, whiting, skate, turbot, and flounders ; of course herrings and 
mackerel in their seasons. The shell-fish are abundant and excel- 
lent : chiefly lobsters and crabs. These are conveyed in carts to 
Edinburgh and Glasgow, and to London by fish smacks, express- 
ly built for this purpose. The usual retail price of a lobster is 
Is. and of a crab Id. 

Botany. — The dominion of the plough is not favourable to the 
objects of the botanist, and, excepting the Law and the Links, the 
parish is wholly arable. These exceptions, of course, present 
the usual varieties suited to such soils. There are very fine 
aged trees at Balgone and Leuchie— ash, beech, elm, oak, plane — 
which species seem best fitted to the atmosphere and soil, and 
grow magnificently. For the botany of the Bass, see Dr Walker's 
« Essays on Natural History." 

H. — Civil History. 
North Berwick, though its origin is unknown, is a town of very 
ancient date, — being as old, at least, as the thirteenth century. 
It stands low, on the verge of the Frith of Forth, and consists 
of one long street from west to east, and of another near its 
eastern termination, from the north down direct to the har- 
bour ; this latter street, ornamented with a row of trees on each 
side, is the principal residence of the gentry. It was indebted 



J

323 



for its incorporation as a roj al burgh to its charter from Robert 
III. ; and its municipal privileges were confirmed by a charter of 
James VI., dated 18th September 1568. It is governed by two 
bailies, a treasurer, and nine councillors. There is no guildry, 
and there are no incorporated crafts. It has, at no time, been 
a place of much commerce or consideration, as is evident from the 
small amount of the sums levied from it at the successive periods 
of public taxation. Of course it was represented by its commis- 
sioner in the Scottish Parliament ; and since the Union, it has been 
associated with Haddington, Dunbar, Lauder, and Jedburgh, in 
the election of a representative to the united Parliament. 

The manor and the town of North Berwick, are stated as having 
been possessed by the Earls of Fife, the descendants of Macduff, 
during the twelfth, thirteenth, and a part of the fourteenth centuries. 
The last of this great family who enjoyed this estate was Isabel, 
the last Countess of that line, who lived during the revolutionary 
reign of David II. At the accession of Robert II , by an unre- 
corded arrangement with Robert Duke of Albany, William Earl 
of Douglas acquired the barony of North Berwick, and so laid the 
foundation of the long, extensive, and powerful influence of the 
Douglases in East Lothian. In 1373, by a charter of Robert II. 
to Earl William, North Berwick was made a burghj with the 
privileges of buying and selling, with a port and custom-house for 
the entrance and clearance of ships, and a tron for the weighing 
of wool. This is the most ancient charter of North Berwick. 
The , Earl at the same time entered into an obligation to resign 
this charter, " if the sime should be found detrimental to the 
king, to the nation, or to the burgh." It does not appear that the 
Earl succeeded in his beneficent design. Even in 1692, more than 
three centuries afterwards, the town is stated to have had " only 
two fishing boats." It will be seen, in a future place, to what com- 
parative importance it has progressively advanced. 

The manor of North Berwick often changed its lords. It was 
forfeited in 1455, by James Earl of Douglas; but in 1479, it was 
granted by James IIL with most of the forfeiture of that Earl, to his 
heir-male Archibald Earl of Angus, and erected into a free barony ; 
— though the king was ill requited for his benefaction, for Angus 
pursued James III. to his dethronement and death ; and in the pos- 
session of this younger line of the family of Douglas it long remain- 
ed, associated with the lands and castle of Tantallan, the renowned 
seat of their power and defence. We find that the site of the mo-

nastery, with much of the property belonging to it, was granted by 
James VI. to Alexander Home, the possessor of the barony of 
North Berwick ; but his family failed, and the property was trans- 
ferred successively to other owners, and in 1640 a ratification was 
passed in Parliament of the right of Sir William Dick to the lands 
and tithes of the barony. These possessions were many years af- 
terwards acquired by Sir Hew Dalrymple, Lord President of the 
College of Justice ; who purchased also from the Marquis, after- 
wards Duke of Douglas, representative of the Earls of Angus, the 
remainder of the barony of North Berwick, styled the lands and 
lordship with the fortalice of Tantallan. The property of the 
whole has descended regularly in entail, and is now vested in Sir 
Hew Dalrymple, Bart., the lineal descendant of the President of 
the Court of Session. 

Eminent Characters. — Many illustrious men in ancient times 
have lived and died in the parish of North Berwick, and illustri- 
ous women too; the Lords of Tantallan, the Prioresses of the mo- 
nastery, and the Martyrs of the Bass, — over most of whom the veil 
of oblivion has long fallen, and it cannot be upraised. How very soon 
the mighty and the famed, the learned and the good, fade into the 
shade of forgotten time, without the faintest memorial even of their 
existence ; no note even to tell us where they sleep  So fares it 
here with the bouse of Douglas, and the house of Home, and the 
many beside, rich and powerful, and noted in their various genera- 
tions. Tradition reports St Baldred, the disciple of St Kentigern, 
and the apostle of East Lothian, as a resident on the Bass. He 
died in the beginning of the seventh century. 

As an eminent character, celebrated in the fifteenth century, the 
name of John Mair or Major must be recorded as a native of this 
parish. He was born at Gleghornie in 1469. He became a mem-, 
berof Christ's College, Cambridge, where in 15 IS he seems to have 
written his learned history. He became a member of the University 
of Glasgow, and bore the titles of Canon of the Chapel Royal and 
Vicar of Dunlop. He is represented as Professor of Theology in 
Glasgow in 1521, and one of the Deputati Rectoris ; during that 
year his work " De Gestis Scotorum" was published in Paris. He 
remained in Scotland about five years, and taught theology in 
the University of St Andrews ; where, in 1525, Buchanan is stated

tu have studied under him in the College of St Salvador, and to 
have been so fascinated with his instructions as to have followed 
him to France. He returned to Scotland in 1 530, and resumed 
his teaching of theology in St Andrews, which he continued for 
many years, and died about the year 1547.— The Earl of Angus, 
the famed husband of Margaret of England, the queen mother of 
James V., whose changeful and eventful life occupies so prominent 
a place in the-Scottish Annals of the sixteenth century, died at 
Tantallan about 1556 or 1557.— Of the Martyrs the name of 
John Blackader, minister of Troqueer, a descendant of the House 
of TuUiallan, who died on the Bass in 1685, after five years con- 
finement, remains in vivid and hallowed remembrance. He is 
buried in the churchyard of North Berwick, where a large flat 
monumental stone, with an appropriate poetical inscription, marks 
the place of his sacred rest. Its legend was renewed some years 
ago under the inspection of Dr Andrew Crichton, while officially 
resident here, whose published " Memoirs of Blackader" are full 
of interest and instruction. — Besides Sir Hew Dalrymple, Bart, 
raised to be the Lord President of the Court of Session in 1698, 
and which office he filled till 1737, the name of Sir Hew Dal- 
rymple, a later ancestor of the present Baronet, is very honourably 
known throughout the country for his enlightened enterprise and 
improvements in agriculture, as is also the name of the late Sir 
George Suttie, Bart, of Balgone. 

Land' owners. — The heritors are. Sir Hew Dalrymple, Bart, 
the chief proprietor, a Captain in Her Majesty's 71st Regiment, 
now on service in Canada; Sir George Grant Suttie, Bart, of 
Balgone and Pre&amp;tongrange ; Mrs Hamilton Nisbet Ferguson of 
Dirleton and Belhaven ; the Earl of Dalhousie ; Sir Edward 
Thomas Troubridge, Bart, of Rockville ; Patrick Dudgeon, Esq. 
of East Craig; and William Waddell, Esq. of SydserfF. It is to 
be recorded, with great regret, that there is not one of the heri- 
tors resident in the parish. 

Parish Registers. — The parochial records were, at one time, 
voluminous and in excellent preservation ; but for very many years 
they were kept with extreme carelessness and irregularity. It 
is only very recently that they have been kept with resumed ac- 
curacy and propriety. There is an inventory made early in 1692, 
on the induction of Mr Matthew Reid as minister, which repre- 
sents the records as commencing in 1604; but the two earliest 
volumes, containing proceedings from 1604 to 1638, with subsc-

quent records, have unaccountably disappeared, and the earhest 
register we have seen is dated 19th October 1651. From this 
date the register of baptisms and of proclamation of marriages 
seems in pretty good order; while from 1758 onward to a recent 
date, there appear no minutes of session whatever. There are 
now regular and authentic records carefully kept of the proceed- 
ings of session, and registers of births and baptisms, of proclama- 
tion of marriages, and of burials. The Dissenters "seldom register 
the birth of their children in the parish session records, — occa- 
sionally they do. A serious neglect in parochial registration has 
prevailed here, as generally elsewhere, we fear, in the proclama- 
tion of marriages alone being recorded, and not the solemnization. 
It has happened repeatedly during the incumbency of the present 
minister in this parish, that proclamation was duly made and re- 
corded, but the proposed marriage never took place. Parties 
after marriage should present the certificate of its celebration to 
the clerk of session, and have the fact of marriage duly registered. 
The other parochial registers, as now conducted, however, are 
more correctly the registers of baptisms than of births, and of 
burials than of deaths. 

Antiquities. — This parish is noted for its antiquities, sacred and 
civil ; and the delineations of them, literary and graphic, are nu- 
merous and valuable. The former Statistical Account is unrea- 
sonably and unaccountably meagre ; and details somewhat more 
lengthened, perhaps, seem due to the genuine and popular inte- 
rest of the subjects. Only a few brief notices, however, are all 
that may be expected to receive admission here. 

Abbey. — About a quarter of a mile west from the town, on 
a gentle elevation toward the south of the public road, stand 
the venerable but awfully mutilated ruins of the Abbey of North 
Berwick. It was a Cistertian nunnery, founded by Duncan Earl 
of Fife, who died in 1154', of which there are, on the whole, very 
accurate views in Grose's " Antiquities of Scotland." The site 
is admirably chosen, commanding extensive and magnificent 
views — on the one hand of the beautiful and lofty Law, and on the 
other of the rich and variegated coasts of Fife, the Frith with its 
numerous rugged rocky islands, and the immeasurably expanding 
ocean. It was consecrated to the Virgin Mary, and richly endowed 
with lands in the manor of North Berwick, and with revenues 
from different sources in Fife, Berwickshire, Roxburghshire, Ayr- 
shire, Edinburghshire, and West Lothian. Its founder bestow-

ed on the convent the patronage of the church of North 
Berwick, with its tithes and pertinents. Afterwards were ac- 
quired the advowsons of the church of Largo, of Kilconacher, 
Kilbrachmont, and St Monance in Fife, with lands that belonged 
to each of them. The Bishop of Dunblane added the church of 
Logie Aithry, near Stirling ; and Adam de Kilconacher, Earl 
of Carrick, a zealous patron of the convent, in 1266, confirmed 
to the nuns the grants of his fathers. In the ancient Taxatio, 
the lands which belonged to the nunnery were rated at L. 66, 13s. 
4d. In 1296, the Prioress submitted to the power of Edward I , 
and received in return writs to the several sheriffs of Fife, Edin- 
burgh, Haddington, Berwick, and Roxburgh, to restore the estates 
of her convent. Submission thus insured protection ; and, for a 
while, the female inhabitants of the nunnery were again safe in the 
enjoyment of their possessions. But, in the future progress of 
anarchy and turbulent violence, their weakness invited deprivation 
and plunder under James III. ; the servants and the tithes of the 
Prioress within the parishes of Kilconacher, Kilbrachmont, and 
St Monance were assaulted and seized. The Prioress, in 1482, 
applied to Parliament for protection and redress ; and the Lords 
decreed the restoration of the property, and the repair of the da- 
mages that the assailants had inflicted. — In the succeeding reign, 
Margaret Home, fourth daughter of Sir Patrick Home of Pol- 
warth, who died in 1504, became a nun, and rose to be Prioress 
in the convent. Her niece, Isabel, third daughter of Sir Alexander 
Home of Polwarth, who died in 1532, also from being a nun, suc- 
ceeded her aunt as prioress. It is thus seen, that, previously to the 
Reformation, the nunnery had become in a measure the inheritance 
of the Homes. After the Reformation the revenues of the con- 
vent which remained unalienated and untransferred, were erected 
into a lordship for Sir Alexander Home of North Berwick, a spe- 
cial favourite of James VI. ; and the patronages of the various other 
churches were distributed to various suitors, at the pleasure of the 
King and the Parliament. At the Reformation the convent contain- 
ed eleven nuns, whose income was about L. 20 each, yearly. 1 he 
income of the nunnery is stated thus : " Money, L. 556, 17s. 8d ; 
wheat, 9 chalders, 12 bolls; bear, 19 chalders, 4 bolls; oats, 14 
chalders, 4 bolls ; pease and beans, 3 chalders, 9 bolls ; malt, I 
boll, 3 firlots, and 3 pecks ; 18 oxen, 13 cows, 1 last and 9 barrels of 
salmon." Books of Assumption. The monastery has been, at one

tensive area of ground. But it luis occasionally been very lightly 
esteemed, and is sadly dilapidated ; though the nasive remains 
are very picturesque, embosomed among trees, and form a very 
interesting memorial of olden times. Various relics are occa- 
sionally gathered from the fallen ruins. Leaden pipes of con- 
siderable extent have very recently been discovered, which served 
for the conveyance from the higher ground of water to the convent, 
and which are obviously of great antiquity. The Vaults, which 
formed one of Grose's Views, were many years ago, entirely de- 
stroyed and erased. 

AuldKirk. — Near the harbour, on a small sandy eminence, close 
to the shore, stand the remains of what is traditionally called the 
Auld Kirk; but these interesting vestiges have been sadly diminish- 
ed, even in very recent years. The main entrance, a strongly built 
archway, is still entire, and the font is still permitted to remain in its 
primeval position and perfection. Thebuilding, said by some to have 
been a chapel belonging to the abbey, would seem to have been the 
Auld Kirk of the parish, and evidently was surrounded by the paro- 
chial burying-ground, very long disused. Year after year, in the vio- 
lent north-east storms which are not unfrequent in winter and spring, 
the sea makes melancholy ravages on this scene of ancient sepulture, 
and continues to disturb and discover many forms which for cen- 
turies have reposed there. Care is taken to have these human relics 
removed on their exposure, and re-interred in the present church- 
yard. It was in a vault at the Auld Kirk, in 1788, a metallic seal 
■was found in a stone-coffin with the legend Sigillum VV iilieUui 
de Douglas," — the impression it produces is very distinct; it is 
round, of the size of a half-crown. It were exceedingly desirable 
that means were taken to prevent the destructive encroachments of 
the sea on this antique cemetery, and to prevent the remaining ruin 
from further dilapidation. A large stone lies flat in the green 
centre of the area which the building must have inclosed, and is 
said to mark the burying-place of the Lauders of the Bass. 

Tantallan. — About three miles east from the town of North 
Berwick, on a projecting precipitous eminence, of trap tufa rest- 
ing on sandstone, overlooking the sea, which surrounds it on 
three sides, stands the far-famed castle of Tantallan, in naked 

• A curious etymology of this name is given traditionally, that two supMintend- 
enis of the building of the Castle, called TItomas and AHutt obtained permission from 
its Lord, to inscribe iheir names as architects prominently on the walls in Lalin :  the 
inscription stood thus : Tarn et Allan, hence the name the people save it, Tfrtn 7 .■ll/au. 
'I bis and other amusing traditions and representations may be found in the Notes to

majestic ruin. Its form is an irregular hexagon. The outward 
structure is comparatively entire; the walls are of enormous 
thickness. The only approach is from the west, which was defend- 
ed by towers of a very massive construction,— and two ditches inter- 
vened—the inner one of uncommon depth. The entrance was over 
a drawbridge. Above the entrance there still remains, sculptured 
in a stone shield, though now much effaced, the memorable em- 
blem of the Bloody Heart, the well known ensign of the Douglases, 
its early, proud, and powerful proprietors. The interior exhibits 
a labyrinth of inaccessible chambers and broken staircases ; the 
walls of the buildings remain all unroofed, of great size and extent, 
and arched gloomy vaults beneath them. There are several dis- 
mal subterraneous dungeons, the former prison-holds, no doubt, of 
the miserable captives ; and long, in later days, the hidden haunts 
of smugglers, and the unsuspected depositories of their contrabands. 
Oneof tliemost deep, and dark, and dismal of these dungeonsis out- 
side the castle, at the north-west angle, and only recently discover- 
ed; and is conjectured to have been the dungeon-keep of the 
guard-house. The site of Tantallan Castle is admirably adapted 
for a warlike strength. Its origin and the date of its erection are 
equally unknown. It rose with the power of the House of Douglas, 
whose original settlement in East Lothian was on the accession of 
Robert II., when William, Earl of Douglas, acquired the barony of 
North Berwick. For centuries, Tantallan was the great and principal 
strength and defence in the east of this proud and powerful family. 
It was so admirably situated and so skilfully constructed, that it 
mocked every military enterprise for its conquest. Its destruction 
was regarded as impossible ; hence the popular conviction, " Ding 
down Tantallan  — mak a brig to the Bass," — accomplishments 
viewed as equally hopeless. The barony of North Berwick, 
with the Castle of Tantallan, was forfeited bv the Earl of Douglas 
in 1455. In 1479, they were given by James III. to Archibald, 
fifth Earl of Angus, the well known " Bell the Cat," whose patriot- 
ism and exploits, — whose remonstrance with James IV. against his 
war with England, and consequent retirement to Tantallan, — have 
become familiar to every reader, by the admirable delineations of 
the author of Marmion, whose descriptions by the way are vi- 
vidly faithful to the real character and localities of the celebrated 
stronghold. When the succeeding Earl of Angus, married to the 
queen-mother of James V., had fallen from his supreme elevation, 
and lost his power over the person and councils of that youthful

monarch, he withdrew to the Castle of Tantallan, and there for a 
time defied the hostile force of the kingdom. The King appeared 
before it in person in September 1528, and attempted its reduction, 
but without avail. At length, huwever, Angus was compelled to 
flee to England; and the castle, by a compromise with Panango, the 
governor, on the 4th December, was surrendered to the royal forces. 
Tantallan and all the other castles and estates of the Earl were 
forfeited to the Crown. In 1537, the King personally visited Tantal- 
lan to ascertain its capabilities of defence. On the King's death the 
Earl obtained permission to return from his long exile ; his restora- 
tion to the possession of his castles and manors took place in 1 542, 
and he made Tantallan stronger than ever. He is stated to have died 
at Tantallan about 1557. But this mighty stronghold fell before 
the fervid zeal and tremendous energies of the Covenanters. The 
Marquis of Douglas had favoured the designs of Charles I., and 
his castle was besieged, captured, and garrisoned by the Covenan- 
ters, against the King, in 1639. It is stated as having been finally 
Jefended against Oliver Cromwell, and taken after a short siege. 
In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the castle and lands 
were sold by the Marquis, afterwards Duke of Douglas, to Lord 
President Dalrymple, when the castle, till then habitable, was dis- 
mantled, and left to decay. 

The Bass. — Facing Tantallan Castle on the north, in the mouth 
of the Frith, about a mile and a-half from the shore, stands the im- 
mense rugged circular rock called the Bass. It is fully a mile in 
circumference. It rises 420 feet above the surface of the sea, and 
from the fathomed depth of the waters around, it may be estimated 
about 600 feet in total height. On the north, it is peculiarly lofty 
and precipitous, and stupendously overawing. On the south, it is 
somewhat conical in form, sloping moderately down nearly to the 
base. It has been fancifully stated to resemble in this aspect the 
spoon and knife and fork-box, such as used to grace our family 
sideboards. Its superficies is guessed at seven acres. A cavern- 
ed passage penetrates through the rock from north-west to south- 
east, where the rock grandly projects, perhaps, forty feet. The ca- 
vern is passable even at full -tide, if the sea be calm. The Bass is 
inaccessible save on one flat shelvy point to the south-east; the 
south and the north side of this point are the only two landing- 
places. Commanding this point, is a small fortalice at the extremi- 
ty of the curtain. At one time, the fortification could be reached

only by ladders, or a bucket and chains, raised at the crane bas- 
tion ; but afterwards, the ascent was by three flights of stairs within 
the rampart, each protected by a strong gate : these inner gates 
have long ago disappeared. The fort and the dungeons are all un- 
roofed, and in vnms.—Blacliader's Cell is still pointed out with its 
three small iron-barred windows to the west, and awakens many a 
solemn sacred feeling. — One solitary gun yet remainsof the ancient 
defence, now much corroded : the few other cannon on the Bass 
were brought thither from Leith only in 18'2-2, to salute George 
IV, on his visit to Scotland, when the southern landing-place was 
somewhat prepared in the possibilily of his Majesty landing there. 
The King of Belgium visited the Bass in 1819. 

About half-way up the acclivity of the rock, a little below the 
old effaced garden, are the interesting remains of a chapel, 
pretty entire. The niches for the fonts shew that it was built prior 
to the Reformation.  When the Buss became the Bastile of 
Scotland, the state-prison for the persecuted Covenanters, this 
chapel was desecrated by being made the ammunition magazine 
for the garrison. 

How early this island was tenanted by man, is quite unknown. 
It is traditionally reported to have been a residence of Baldred, 
the apostle of East Lothian, even in the sixth century. It is on au- 
thentic record, that it was inhabited in the beginning of the fifteenth 
century ; for in 1406, Robert III. placed his son on the Bass after- 
wards James I. to be beyond the cruel machinations of his uncle, 
the Duke of Albany, till a vessel was procured to convey him to 
France ; and hence he embarked in his memorable ill-fated voyage, 
which terminated in his nineteen years captivity in England. It 
is familiar to our readers that he was treacherously way-laid by 
directions of Henry IV., and captured off Flamborough Head: when 
the intelligence was conveyed to his father in Rothesay, he sunk 
in bitterest anguish into an immediate grave. 

 A few years ago, an incident occurred on tlie Bass, expressive of a strong linger- 
ing desire to retain the chapel, occasionally, at least, for its original destination. A 
young lady, in the presence of her father, was here solemnly confirmed in her Romish 
faith and profession, and the due ritual services were gone through in the presence 
also of the keeper of the Bass and his boat assistant. On the conclusion of the 
solemnities, the priest turned to the keeper, and asked him, with due decorum, if he 
would not also now kneel down before the altar, and follow them in similar dedica- 
tion and worship. ' Me" said the Protestant Presbyterian James, " Me Na, 

na, am thankfu' there's mair sense gi'en me I wad just as soon, Sir, fa' doon and 

worship ane o' thae puir solan geese about us," iointing to tlie myriads around 
hirn " than e'er gang on wi' ony sic mockery."' .My friend and parishioner James re- 
mains an invincible adherent of the Reformation, and also, as well may be conjectured, 
the Bass being ever before him, a stern abhorrent of prelatic tyranny and regal des. 
potism.

The Bass for many generations was the property of an ancient fa- 
mily, styled Lauder of the Bass, one of whom is stated to have been 
a compatriot of Wallace. The family residence, however, it is be- 
lieved, was not on the Bass, but in the town of North Berwick. A 
large flat stone in the desolated cemetery at the Auld Kirk, is said 
to mark their burial-place. This family, it would seem, at length fell 
into decay, and the Bass underwent various transferences. It was 
purchased by government in October 1671, from Sir Andrew Ram- 
say of Abbotshall, for the sum of L. 4000. Bigotry was then ram- 
pant, and tyranny was triumphant. The prisons of our northern 
kingdom were gorged with the persecuted, and the Bass was con- 
verted into a state-prison for the Covenanters under Charles II. It 
served this debased purpose during the reigns of the last two deluded 
monarchs of the House of Stuart. It held out for several years af- 
ter the Revolution against the new dynasty, amidst numerous and 
vigorous enterprises for its subjection, and was signalized as the last 
place in Great Britain that yielded to the dominion of William III. 
In February 1701, he directed the fortifications to be demolished. 
Ultimately, in 1706, the Bass was granted by the crown to Presi- 
dent Sir Hew Dalrymple for one Scots penny, reserving the power 
of refortifying the Bass, if Government at any time should think 
it proper to do so. The fort and the prison were afterwards dis- 
mantled. The walls remain in naked desolation. 

The Bass is an impressive historical scene in the eyes of en- 
lightened and thoughtful men. It is an object of deep national 
interest, associated with the great scheme of civil and religious 
freedom. No one should view it without holy gratitude to God 
for the removal of the mournful oppressive gloom in which the 
political liberties of these realms, a century and a-half ago, were 
enshrouded ; and for the advanced constitutional freedom of these 
better and illuminated times in which we are privileged to exist. It 
is not here we can have space to dwell on one of the foulest pages of 
our country's annals ; on the enormous injustice, the cruel and bitter 
sorrows, and the accumulated and intolerable wrongs it records ; in 
the reviewal of which the mind and the heart of every man, alive 
to the inalienable rights of man, fail within him in abhorrence, 
indignation, and shame. But the names of these venerated cap- 
tives of the Bass, these Presbyterian faithful, deserve to remain 
in imperishable remembrance.

The island is let to the keeper for L. 30 yearly, on a lease of nine- 
teen years. He resides at Gantry Bay, an opposite hamlet on the 
shore, a mile and a-half from the rock, where boats are always to 
be had in the season for the conveyance of visitors. The best 
season for visiting the Bass is June and July, during the incuba- 
tion of the geese ; and the best hours are early in the morning or 
evening. The tenant of the Bass alone possesses the key of the 
Castle ; and it is to the honour of the keeper to record, that the 
Sabbath is kept inviolate, and on week days alone the Bass is to 
be visited. 

There are about seven acres of grassy surfaceon the rock, which 
afford pasture for about thirty sheep. The pasture rent is from 
L. 5 to L. 7 annually. The sheep are in high estimation for their 
very peculiar excellencies, and bring a high corresponding price. 

It is a curious remnant of olden ecclesiastical privilege, that 
twelve solan geese, entire with the feathers on, are annually paid to 
the minister of North Berwick, — the vicar of the Bass. 

Baldred's Well. — About half a mile south-west from Tantallan 
Castle, there is a plentiful spring of water of peculiar excellence, 
substantially and tastefully enclosed, called Baldred's Well, which 
immemorially has supplied the inhabitants of Castleton, and even 
of Auldhame. It is held in high modern estimation for its quali- 
fications to make tea. 

The ancient House of Fenton Toioer is also in this parish, the 
property of Mrs Hamilton Nisbet Ferguson of Raith. It is a pro- 
minent object, on a very elevated and exposed situation, close to 
Kingston Hill, — but the walls of the building alone remain, in bare 
solitary desolation.— Adjoining is the ancient, place of Sydserf, 
said to be named from St Serf, the revered instruqtor of St 
Mungo or Kentigern, to whose memory, as is well known, was de- 
dicated the beautiful and magnificent Cathedral of Glasgow. The 
mansion-house has long ceased to be the residence of its proprie- 
tors, and is now occupied by servants in charge of the property. 

Mansions.— Kxnoug the mansions of the parish, North-Berwick 
House, or Leuchie, built in 1777, finely embosomed among old and 
young extensive woods, and commanding views of great richness and 
grandeur. It is the property of the chief heritor. The garden is 
extensive and fruitful ; large sums from time to time have been ex- 
pended on its enlargement and decoration.— ZaZowtf, the property 
of Sir George Grant Suttie, Bart.,— and liockvillc, the property of 
Sir Edward Thomas Troubridge, Bart., with their ample woods and

picturesque rocks, are beautiful seats ; but both, as Leuchie, are 
deserted by their respective respected baronets. This universal 
absenteeism is universally felt as a severe bereavement. 

Occurrences. — In 1831, the Great Northern Whale, exhibited in 
Edinburgh and elsewhere, as one of the most remarkable natural 
phenomena, was discovered at sea a few miles hence, o the pro- 
perty of Sea- Cliff, and brought to the beach at North- Berwick. 
It had been dead for some weeks, and was partially emaciated 
and corrupted. Its length was 78 feet. A vertical section of the 
skull exhibited a part of its walls more than 3 feet in thickness. 
The weight of the skeleton was 28 tons. The whale was sold by 
public roup for L. 37 only. The flesh and blubber were employ- 
ed as manure. The skeleton was purchased for the trifling sum 
of L. 10, by Dr Robert Knox of Edinburgh, who has since sold 
it to the College Museum of the University of Edinburgh. 

In January 1832, the Asiatic cholera appeared in North-Berwick. 
It was among the very earliest of its destructive appearances in Scot- 
land, and in its commencement it was invariably fatal. There 
were sixteen cases : the first seven died, the others all recovered, 
Measures of arrestment and remedy were promptly adopted; and, 
under the Divine Blessing, were successful. There has been no 
return of this awful visitation. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1755, was . 1412

1811, . . 1727 

1821, . 1694 

1831, . 1824 

At present the amount is nearly the same as in 1831. The popu- 
lation of the town, including the Wester Gate, may be stated about 
1100, and of the country fully 700. There are several families of 
independent fortune resident in the town. 

Games. The prevailing popular game of the parish is the Golf, 

for which the western hnks are peculiarly well adapted. The North 
Berwick Golf Club was established on the 8th May 1832, and is 
formed of noblemen and gentlemen from all parts of the country. 
The number of members is limited to 50, who are admitted by bal- 
lot ; one black ball excludes, and the ballot must take place in the 
rotation of nomination, " before going to dinner." The regular meet- 
ings are on the first Wednesday of May, June, July, and August. 
The Captain is elected annually in August, and' the rules of the 
green are, with a slight exception, the rules of the Golf Club of St

Andrews. The meetings are generally well attended. This is a 
favourite amusenient of the inhabitants throughout the year. 

Poaching is rare. Smuggling prevailed here, forty or fifty years 
ago, to a great extent, but the means and the temptations are 
believed to be nearly extinct. A boat with eight men, belonging to 
the coast-guard, for the suppression of smuggling, is stationed at 
North Berwick; most of these men have families, and are of very 
exemplary character. 

During the last three years there were 8 illegitimate births in the 
parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Foundery. — There is a foundery in the parish, where upwards of 
20 workmen are employed in the manufacturing of steam-engines, 
and machines for making drain tiles. The latter is the invention 
of the Marquis of Tweeddale, for which he has a patent. 

Agriculture. — For the following statements and calculations, I 
am mainly indebted to the kindness of Alexander Burn, Esq. 
Bennington, and Andrew Richardson, Esq., North-Berwick Abbey. 
The total number of acres in the parish is 3456, of which 3282 
are cultivated, and 174 in old grass and plantation and links, — 
perhaps 30 acres being in links. 

Of the lands under tillage, about 200 acres, and likewise about 
300 acres of old pasture, are in the possession of the owners ; the 
remainder is occupied by tenants, on leases of nineteen years, and 
at rents from 7 to 12 bushels of wheat per acre, the value of which 
is ascertained partly by the first and partly by the second fiars, of 
the county, with the exception of about 400 acres let at four guineas 
per acre. 

There are eleven tenants paying about L. 12,000 per annum, 
though the sum varies annually with the prices of the fiars ; and 
each tenant employs on an average seven ploughmen and other 
labourers. 

The greatest proportion of the land consists of a strong clay, 
upon a close hard bottom ; the remainder along the coast, consists 
of links, upon which the house proprietors of North Berwick have 
the exclusive privilege of grazing cows. 

With a slight exception, the six course shift of cropping is ge- 
nerally adopted, viz. fallow, wheat, grass, oats, beans and pease, 
wheat ; the land calculated for a four shift, being turnip, barley, 
or spring-wheat, grass, and oats. 

The land intended for fallow is generally ploughed in winter ; 
m spring it is ploughed across; it is then formed into ridges, the

dung afterwards applied, which is then, by another furrow, covered 
in ; and, should the weather permit, it gets an additional one before 
sowing, in order to kill any animals that may make their appearance ; 
and it is then sown about the middle of October. In March, grass 
seeds are sown amongst it, and harrowed in, occasionally only rol- 
led ; and the following year commonly pastured. Tn January the 
land is ploughed, and in March sown with oats. It is again plough- 
ed in winter. In March, it is harrowed before drawing off the drills 
for a crop of beans. When that is finished, the dung is applied, the 
seed deposited, and finally both covered in. In summer, they are 
hand-hoed, the paring and grubbing plough put through them 
before the bean begins to blossom, and afterwards not unfrequent- 
ly furrowed up by a double moulded plough. After removal of crop 
from the ground, it is ploughed and sown with wheat. The land 
for turnip is ploughed during winter. In spring, it is then reduced 
by frequent ploughings, harrowings, and rollings, when it is drawn 
off into drills, dung applied, drills reversed, then sown. Should the 
weather be favourable in producing a braird in the course of a 
month, the plough and hand-hoe are among them. Upon removal 
of the crop from the ground, it is ploughed, and sown with barley 
or spring wheat ; in the spring with grass seeds at same time ; then 
it is either pastured or cut for hay the following year, which is suc- 
ceeded by a crop of oats, and this completes the rotation. The 
distribution of the land, under different modes of cultivation is as 
follows : — 

Turnips about - - . 200 acres annually grown. 

Barley, - ... 230 • 

Wheat, upwards of - - 800 

Oats, - - - - 500 

Beans, pease, and tares, about - 430 

Potatoes, - . - BO 

Clover and rye-grass, upwards of - 500 

There is an assessment of L. 2 levied upon each ploughgate 
for the support of the poor, of which the landlord pays one-half. 
The sum of L. 2 is paid for every sixty acres as road money. 
There are 52 pJoughgates in th§ parish. 

The rate of grazing for the season is L. 6 for a cow, and about 
10s. 6d. for a sheep. 

JYapes. — Farm-servants are generally paid in grain. The wages 
of a hind are 72 bushels of oats ; 18 of barley, 8 of beans, 1 pair 
of shoes; L. 1 for lint; cow's grass; 1000 yards of potato 
ground, and ahouse, forwhichthe master receiveseighteen days work 
of a shearer in harvest; the hind has leave to keep a pig. La- 



NORTH BERWICK.

bourers are paid 10s. per week in summer, and 9s. in winter; ma- 
sons, 3s. to 3s. 6d. per day in summer, and 2s. 6d. to 3s. in winter ; 
carpenters are paid about the same wages as masons. 

Live-Stock. — From 300 to 400 cattle are purchased in autumn, 
of which about 250 are fattened upon turnips during winter, and the 
remainder are kept in the straw-yards through the winter, and fat- 
tened upon the grass during the following summer. A few are rear- 
ed in the parish, principally of the short-horned breed. Generally, 
those purchased are of the north country breeds. About 1000 sheep 
are fed during the season. There are about 300 pigs reared an- 
nually, and chiefly sold to the fleshers in the neighbourhood, and 
to the farm-servants. Many are sent to the London market. 

Manure, 8j-c. — Lime as a manure has been of late years used 
only to a very limited extent, the ground having been already ma- 
nured with it. Rape-cake has been very much used, both for wheat 
and turnip. Furrow draining, with tiles, is carried on to a consi- 
derable extent in the parish, and almost always at the expense of 
the tenant. The cost of draining, where the drains are' put into 
every furrow, at a depth of 30 inches, is about L. 7, 7s. an acre. 

Leases are always granted for 19 years. 

The offices on the different farms are generally in good repair. 
The cottages for the farm-servants and labourers are, with few ex- 
ceptions, too small, having only one apartment where all the family 
must sit and sleep. This system is much to be deplored. The 
bothy system has been introduced by some of the tenantry, but 
not with much success or general approbation. There are eight 
steam-engines in the parish ; seven are used in driving the machi- 
nery of the thrashing-mills, the other engine is in the foundery at 
North Berwick. Entails and the non-residence of proprietors are 
among the great barriers to agricultural improvements.

is procured. The other two are lime quarries ; one at Rhodes, 
and the other on the Balgone estate. 

Fisheries. — Fishing to a very limited extent only is carried on 
from the burgh. To remedy this deficiency, a joint stock fishing 
company is just established in North Berwick, with promising 
views of success, for the supply of the town and neighbourhood, 
and for the general curing of fish. 

Navigation. — The harbour is secure and commodious; large 
sums, from time to time, have been expended in its enlargement and 
improvement; and though dry at low water, and somewhat difficult 
of access, it is considered very safe in consequence of its bemg a 
boomed harbour. There are nine vessels belonging to this port, of 
various burthens, four of which engage in foreign trade, amounting 
in all to 568 tons of old measure, and they are in constant employ- 
ment. There has been considerable decrease of late years in the 
grain and lime trade ; but there has been increased traffic in the 
exportation of turnips and potatoes, chiefly to the Newcastle and 
London markets. No foreign vessel statedly trades to this sea- 
port, but there is a considerable importation, occasionally of foreign 
rape and oil-cake, and crushed bones, for manure. The coals for 
the town and its neighbourhood are generally imported. The 
four largest vessels belonging to this port have been added to it 
during the last three years. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market, -c.—North Berwick is a royal burgh, with a market- 
place, and is duly supplied with all the necessaries and comforts of 
ordinary life. The population is of the usual description ; but the 
resident gentry are here more numerous, perhaps, than is common 
in such small towns. There are two surgeons, and one bank,— 
and a branch of the Western Bank of Scotland is on the eve of 
being estabhshed. Besides the burgh officer, it has no other 
police. There is no village in the parish. There is a post-office 
subordinate to the office at Haddington ; the post arrives daily 
about eleven in the forenoon, and departs at half-past twelve. 
There is a stage-coach to Edinburgh every lawful day, which 
leaves North Berwick at half-past seven in the morning, and 
reaches Edinburgh in three hours, and leaves Edinburgh in the 
afternoon at four: it is conducted with great propriety. Four car- 
riers go to Edinburgh on their respective days, in the course of the 
week. The turnpike roads, and bridges, and fences, are in excel- 
lent condition ; no canal or railroad.

Ecclesiastical State. — A church has been estabhshed at North 
Berwick from remote antiquity. St Baldred may have been its 
founder in the sixth century. It is shewn to have been esta- 
bhshed before the reign of David I. Under that monarch, Duncan 
the Earl of Fife, who died in 1154, founded the convent for 
Cistertian nuns, to whom he granted the church of North Berwick, 
" with its tithes and pertinents." It was dedicated to St Andrew. 
There was an altar in it devoted to the Virgin Mary. It is a cu- 
rious record of the olden time, that Agnes Fawlaw, wife of Robert 
Lauder of the Bass, with the consent of her husband, granted an 
annuity of ten merks from a tenement in Edinburgh, and five from a 
tenement in Leith, for supporting a chaplain to officiate at the Vir- 
gin Mary's altar in St Andrew's Kirk at North Berwick, which grant 
was confirmed in 1491 by James IV. This church was of con- 
siderable value ; in the ancient Taxatio it is valued at 60 merks. It 
remained in the patronage of the nuns till the Reformation. Il pro- 
bably was then transferred, along with the grant of the nunnery, and 
much of its property, made by James VI. to Alexander Home, pos- 
sessor of the manor, — all of which possessions were acquired by 
Lord President Dalrymple, and are enjoyed by his lineal descend- 
ant. — It is an original and single parish. The Auld Kirk, near the 
shore, with its surrounding cemetery, is in entire desolation. The 
present church was erected in 1770, on the foundation of a former 
one, said to have been built in 1670; and, with the exception of the 
old oak seat of the Dalrymple family in front, the interior was 
wholly renewed in 1819, and is all in excellent condition. It affords 
accommodation for 550 ; of course, there is great and evident defi- 
ciency of church accommodation for the population of the parish. 
The seats are allocated to the heritors and tenants, excepthalf of the 
western gallery, which is allotted to the magistrates and council and 
burgesses of the town. — The church stands in a large square area, 
forming the parochial burying-ground, encompassed with rows of 
lofty, venerable, and wide-spreading elm trees. The solemn beauty 
of the scene excites universal observation. The church is conve- 
niently placed for much the greater part of the population, — no 
house being farther distant than three miles. The present manse 
was built in 1824-5, and is peculiarly substantial and commodious, 
and is inferior to none in the kingdom. It is beautifullv situated 
on a gentle elevation, in the centre of the glebe, and commands 
every view of the beautiful and grand scenery around it. The 
offices are excellent, numerous, and extensive. The glebe is some-

what more than 6 acres in extent, rich, and fertile ;— the stipend 
has comfortably progressed in amount. In 1755, it is stated at 
L. 72, 6s. 8d., in last Statistical Account it is stated, on an average, 
at L. 116. The stipend decreed on 4th February 1818, for crop 
and year 18J7, is 18 chalders of victual;— 2 chalders of wheat, 42 
bolls of oats, and the remainder, half meal, half barley, according 
to the highest fiars prices of the county,— with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for 
the communion elements. There is a Dissenting meeting-house of 
the United Associate Synod, erected in 1778, and rebuilt in 1832, 
whose minister is paid from the collections and the seat rents. The 
stipend is about L. 100. The present minister, the Rev. George 
Brown, has been minister for thirty years, son of the excellent Rev. 
John Brown of Whitburn, and grandson of the distinguished John 
Brown of Haddington, and is a man of much piety and usefulness. 

It is estimated that of the stated population of the censusin 1831, 
amounting to 1824, 1592 are under the pastoral superintendence 
of the Established Church, and 232 belong more immediately to 
the Dissenters. The number of communicants on the roll of the 
Estabhshed Church may be stated about 500. — There are four 
silver communion cups, which are believed to have descended from 
Episcopalian service to the Presbyterian Kirk. The inscriptions on 
them bear date 1670; but at least two of the cups bespeak, as we 
conceive, a much more remote antiquity ; these bear the simple in- 
scription " This cup pertaineth to the Church of North Berwick, 
1670." The other two, similar to each other, but of a somewhat 
different form from those which appear the more antique, bear re- 
spectively — " Gifted to the Church of North Berwick by Mrs Bar- 
bara Young, relict of Archbald Douglas, some time Captain of 
Tomtallan, 1670." " Left in legacie to the Church of North Ber- 
wick, by Mr Henry Aikinheid, late Pastor therof, and performed by 
Archbald Riddel and James Rige his sones-in-law, 1670." The 
ancient metal ewer for baptismal water, of elegant antique form, 
though sadly mutilated, and the iron chest, very curiously form- 
ed, for the reception and security of the pecuniary offerings at the 
church, are relics carefully preserved by the present minister ; and 
even the hour sand-glass, frail as it is, which was wont to regulate 
the eloquence and services of those long no more. 

• It may be noticed as a curious circumstance, that the living of North Berwick 
was in the possession of one family in regular succession for 130 years. In 1692, Mr 
Matthew lleid was ordained successor to Mr John Herbert, and survived to 1 72». i\Jr 
Keid's daughter was married to Mr George Rlu rray, assistant and successor lo Mr 
lleid. Mr George Murray was succeeded by liis son, Mr Matthew Murray, who, in

Church collections are occasionally made for religious and cha- 
ritable objects, and these are suitable and liberal. 

Education— There are in the town, at the present time, four 
schools taught by male teachers, and three schools by female 
teachers. There is a parish school— and a burgh school built and 
endowed to remedy its deficiencies, and the others are supplementary 
to both. The most ordinary branches of tuition are taught in them, 
English reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography. The parish 
school has the maximum salary, and the usual school fees, with the 
legal accommodation. But it is nearly deserted, — 24 scholars only 
were present at the last presbyterial examination ; consequently 
the amount of fees must be inconsiderable — and, from circum- 
stances, the other emoluments are but trifling. Education is in 
the most unsatisfactory state. Some legislative enactment is im- 
peratively called for to secure and increase the efficiency of the 
parochial institutions of our land, on which the intellectual, and 
moral, and literary character of our rural population are so early 
and mainly dependent. — There is a sub-parochial school in the 
neighbourhood of Tantallan, for the immediate locality, under the 
patronage of the chief heritor and the kirk-session, with a free 
school-house and dwelling, and a small glebe. — A Sabbath school 
is taught in the parish church in the evening, and is productive of 
much benefit. 

Literature. — There is a subscription library of considerable va- 
lue, which was established in 1827. It contains many of the best 
works in English literature, and is rapidly increasing. Already, 
there are more than 500 volumes. The town and parish are also 
gratuitously favoured with divisions of the East-Lothian Itinerating 
Library, under the direction and management of Mr Samuel Brown 
of Haddington, to whom the population of the county is under 
weighty obligations for his generous and unwearied exertions to 
promote their mental and moral improvement. 

Friendly Societies. — There is a " Benefit Society" established in 
North Berwick, which serves the double purpose of providing aid 
in seasons of sickness and bereavement, and accumulating savings 

his turn, was succeeded by his son, Mr George Murray, who died in 1822 ; when the 
present incumbent was transhited from the parish of Stenton. The brief interval of 
the ministry of Dr Henry Ilill, Professor of Greek at St Andrews, was a mere tem- 
porary arrangement, he holding the living till the late Mr George Murray, his nephew, 
was of ago to obtain license for ordination to his father's church. Dr Henry David 
Hill was brother of Mrs Matthew Murray, and of the eminent Principal Hill of 8t 
Andrews. 

The moderator's chair in the kirk-session is said to be one of the ancient oaken 
chairs brought from Tantallan Castle, on its final demolition.

in bank. Every member pays Is. weekly, with 2d. for sick and 
funeral money. The sick money ensured to him is, for the first 
thirteen weeks, 5s. a-week, for the second thirteen, 3s., and for 
the remainder of the year. Is. 6d. a-week. If a member dies, his 
heirs receive L. 2, 10s. j for a member's wife, L. 1, 10s. is paid ; 
and 15s. for a member's child under twelve years of age. Each 
member pays Is. at the end of the year to the treasurer. Its ex- 
istence is annual. At the close of the year, the savings, with due in- 
terest, are paid, and the balance of sick and funeral money is dis- 
tributed to the members. The arrangement has been pursued 
for many years, and has essentially promoted the industry, the 
comfort, and the independence of the people. — There is also the 
" North Berwick Benevolent Society," established for the mainte- 
nance of two distinct funds, — the " Tuneral Fund" for allowances 
upon the death of members, their wives, or widows ; the other the 
" Cow Fund," for giving mutual relief and assistance to members 
losing their cow by death; — to either or both of which funds the 
members of the benevolent society may contribute. It " disclaims 
every thing that bears the name or appearance of charity ;" and the 
allowances exigible, it is declared, " shall be claimed and paid as 
a right." The whole is under wise and generous management, 
and continues to prove beneficial and praiseworthy. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of famihes 
receiving parochial aid during the last three years is 25, and of 
persons 32. The annual amount of contributions to the poor's funds 
has been an assessment on the heritors and tenants of L. 104, 10s. 
at the rate of L. 2 per ploughgate, the church collections about 
L. 15, an ancient mortification to the poor yielding L. 9, 3s. 4d., 
and the mortcloth fees. The highest relief to persons on the pau- 
per roll has been L. 5, 14s. per annum, and the lowest L. 1, 16s. 
The highest individual monthly allowance is 8s. The gross an- 
nual sum paid to paupers for 1838 may be correctly stated at L. 95, 
with an additional sum of L. 9 for house rents, and L. 10 of occa- 
sional donations sessionally given to reheve temporary indigence. 
But claims are multiplying and enlarging, and the present assess- 
ment, though recently augmented, will not be able, probably, to 
meet the increasing and urgent claims of parochial necessity. In- 
dependent of necessary claims on public charity, however, it can- 
not be concealed that disinclination to enrolment as a pauper, for- 
merly so strong, is now sadly decreased, and is still decreasing. 
Probably owing to the compulsory assessment, collections for the

poor on ordinary Sundays at the church are almost annihilated 
among the tenantry, and well nigh extinct among all but the higher 
classes, whose contributions are chiefly in silver. Such a change 
is, in a variety of views, to be regretted very seriously. 

There are two permanent benefactions to the poor of this 
parish. The one is a mortification from Alexander Home of 
North Berwick, conveyed through Sir John Home, his executor, 
of 3300 merks, to the minister, elders, and deacons of the parish ; 
the interest of which sum to be annually distributed by them among 
the poor. The kirk-session were, on a bond for this sum, duly in- 
feofed in 1710 on the Abbey lands of the barony of North Ber- 
wick, by Lord President Dalrymple, and his eldest son. Sir Ro- 
bert Dalrymple of Castleton ; which bond is among the records of 
the kirk-session.— The other is the conjunct sum of L. 450, a later 
mortification usually styled the Edwin Fund, in reference to the 
benevolent source whence it originated. This sum was granted in 
1771 to the poor inhabitants of the town and barony of North Ber- 
wick, in two bonds, one for L. 150, by Sir Hew Dalrymple, Bart, 
and the other for L. 300, by Charles Dalrymple, Esq. his brother, 
—the interest of which sum to be paid annually to the minister, el- 
ders, and magistrates of the parish and burgh, by the heir of the 
estate of North Berwick, in whom is vested the nomination of the 
individuals to receive the charity. 

Prison. — There is a prison conjoined with the Town-Council 
Hall, consisting of one apartment for debtors, and two apartments 
beneath for criminal offenders, in tolerable condition, and suppos- 
ed to be quite secure. No prisoner last year. The burgh officer 
is the jailor, who in his own person embodies the entire police of 
the burgh and parish of North Berwick 

Fairs. — There are two annual fairs, — one in the month of June, 
and the other in November, neither of any moment. 

Inns, Alehouses. — It is to be recorded with deep regret, that, 
within the burgh of North Berwick, the system of free trade in 
the sale of spirits prevails, and the multiplication of licenses has 
reached an appalling extent. There are thirteen public-houses, to a 
population perhaps of 650, affording a public-house to every fifty 
persons, men, women, and children. Of these public-houses no 

fewer than eioht are under the management of as many widows,

mistaken and delusive policy. Whisky is emphatically the curse 
of North Berwick, the fruitful source of most of its domestic 
miseries ; and these are oftentimes of the most mournful, and bit- 
ter, and permanent character. A better and different system pre- 
vails in the West Gate, which is the locality without the limits of 
the royalty. It is somewhat under the delegated surveillance of 
the kirk-session, whose certificate in recommendation for license 
is asked for the satisfaction of the Justices of the county. Here a 
population of perhaps 4.50 is amply satisfied with two licentiates. 
Except at Gantry Bay, kept by the keeper of the Bass, there is 
no other alehouse in the landward part of the parish, — a merci- 
ful privation to the peasantry. 

Fuel. — The fuel is coal, brought to the harbour from Bo-uess, 
the coast of Fife, and Newcastle, principally for the use of the in- 
habitants of the town, at the average price of 14s. a ton for Scotch 
Great coal, and 17s. a ton for English. The landward part of 
the parish is supplied chiefly by land carriage from the parishes 
of Pencaitland and Tranent, — a distance of twelve or fourteen 
miles. The coals are very costly, and form here a very heavy 
burthen on the industry of the poor man.

PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND 

TWEEDDALE. 

THE REV. A. MAKELLAR, D. D. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name, Pen-caith-lan, is supposed to be of Cam- 
bro-British origin, and to signify in that language, " the head or 
end of the narrow enclosure." It may have received this name 
from the circumstance of its being situated near the end of the 
narrow valley, through which the Tyne flows in its descent from 

 We have it stated on what is deemed authentic testimony, that within the burgh 
of North Berwick alone, upwards of 3000 gallons of whisky are sold in the course 
of a yefir — and perhaps above 700 more in the immediate suburb. Wliat a melaii-

the hills to the sea. That stream, which divides the parish almost 
into two equal portions, is here but very inconsiderable. The 
ground rises from it on either side by a gentle acclivity, until it 
reaches nearly the same level. 

Boundaries, Extent, Sfc. — The parish of Pencaitland is situated 
near the western extremity of the county of Haddington. It is 
bounded on the south and west, by Ormistoun ; on the east, by 
Salton ; and on the north, by Gladsmuir. It is rather more than 
4 miles from west to east, and 3 from north to south. 

The general aspect of this parish is destitute of any marked 
features ; but it is throughout well enclosed, well cultivated, and 
agreeably diversified with fields, and meadows, and woods, which 
give to it a very pleasing appearance. 

Climate. — The climate of this parish is believed to be more 
equable and salubrious than of some of the neighbouring parishes, 
which may be accounted for partly by the lay of the ground, and 
by its sheltered situation. The ground rises considerably, at some 
distance to the westward ; and it is often observed, that when there 
is a good deal of rain in that quarter, it is quite fair in this place. 
The watery clouds that are seen advancing from the west often 
stop and divide when they come to the Roman camp, near Cran- 
ston, one portion being attracted by the Lammermoor-hills, and 
going off in that direction, — while the other is drawn away to the 
Forth, so that the small valley through which the Tyne flows fre- 
quently escapes altogether. The fact of the healthiness of this 
place is very much confirmed by the frequent cases of old age, 
which occur from time to time. Within the last twenty years, 
four or five individuals have died, each of whom exceeded the acre 
of ninety, and not a few others who approached fourscore. This 
account, however, will not apply to the population employed in the 
collieries. Among them there ar.e but few who exceed threescore 
and ten ; and the greater numbers are cut off much earlier. This 
arises no doubt from the nature of the occupation in which they 
are engaged. Affections of the lungs are very common among 
them. There is one variety of these which claims some particular 
notice. It is known among themselves by the name of the black 
spittle. This disease is of a very peculiar character, and often 
proves the cause of premature death to not a few of the miners em- 
ployed in the coal-works in this district. Owing to the thinness of 
the coal seams, and the confined space in which the miners work,

the supply of atmospheric air must be very defective. This speedi- 
ly impairs the healthy p,ction of perspiration. Vigorous men, after 
a short employment in such work, are sometimes permanently af- 
fected with difficulty of breathing, and frequent cough, accompa- 
nied by an expectoration of an inky fluid, which increases in quan- 
tity as the disease advances. This fluid resembles finely ground 
black paint, and seems to be produced by breathing an atmosphere 
heavily charged with carbonic acid gas. At an advanced stage 
of the disease, the expectoration is sometimes very considerable, 
amounting even to twelve ounces in twenty-four hours. This dis- 
ease, after it has established itself, is seldom removed. It main- 
tains its existence, and spreads its influence till death closes the 
scene, by putting a period to the patient's sufferings. It is to be 
hoped that, ere long, this remarkable disease, connected with the 
operations of coal-mining, will engage the serious attention of phy- 
siologists, and that the Giver of all good may be pleased to guide 
to the discovery of means which may serve to prevent its occurrence, 
or to effect its cure. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Coal and lime are the prevailingmine- 
rals in this parish. There are also several quarries of excellent free- 
stone. The great coal range of the Lothians appears to terminate 
here. There are two seams wrought at present. The upper or chew 
coal seam is of a rich but soft quality, lying about 60 feet from the 
surface, and from 3 to 4 feet 8 inches in thickness. It lies im- 
bedded between a stratum of fine clay and grey sandstone. The 
under or splint coal, which varies from 1 to 3 feet in thickness, 
is generally found between fine clay and a freestone pavement, and 
at the depth of from 60 to 70 feet below the upper seam. When 
a shaft is put down, and the pit completely formed, main roads are 
broken off" in two or three directions, from which rooms as they 
are termed or places about 6 yards wide, are formed for the col- 
liers to work in. When they have cut or quarried the coal, it is 
transported to the pit-bottom in carts or hurleys, propelled upon 
iron- railways, by young persons of from eight to fourteen years of 
age. From the nature of their employment these are called put- 
ters. The coal is then raised to the mouth of the pit by a steam- 
eno-ine. There are at present employed in the diff'erent coal-works 
in this parish about 90 men, and the same number of women, be- 
sides 30 or 40 children. The colliers work on an average about eight 
hours per day, and five days in the week. There is a large breadth

of carboniferous limestone in this parish, which is wrought to con- 
siderable advantage. A great variety of the fossil remains that 
frequently characterize this class of rocks, is to be met with. These 
are not confined to the quarries, but are sometimes to be found in 
the fields. The most common of the fossil shells belong to the 
genera Echinus, Productus, Te7r'bratula, and Orthoceratite. 

Botany. — As the ground in this parish is for the most part ara- 
ble, any interesting plants to be met with are chiefly confined 
to the woods. In these and along the banks of the Tyne, the 
following plants are not uncommon. 

Tragopogon pratensis Epilobium hivsutum Verbascum nigrum 

Listera ovata Circaea lutetiana Parnassia palustris 

nidus avis Valeriana officinalis Juniperus communis. 

Solanura nigrum Scirpus lacustris 

The old trees in the grounds of Winton, and in the woods of 
Fountainhall, are covered with splendid specimens of Fungi, belong- 
ing to the genus Polyphorus, and in the same places are also to be 
found a few specimens of the rare and beautiful Fistulina liepatica. 

There are occasionally discovered on the upper layers of the coal 
wrought at Huntlaw in this parish, distinct impressions of leaves 
belonging to plants not now growing in this country, but which 
are to be found in more southern regions. 

II. — Civil History. 
This parish is very ancient. During the reign of William the 
Lion, the manor of Pencaithlan was possessed by Everard de Pen- 
caithlan, who assumed a surname from his place. Everard 
granted to the monks of Kelso the church of his manor of Pen- 
caithlan, with the tithes and other rights belonging to it in pure 
alms for the salvation of his Lord, King William, from whom it 
is probable he obtained the lands. In the ancient Taxatio the 
church of Pencaithlan was rented at forty marks. Before the ac- 
cession of Robert the Bruce, the church of Pencaithlan had 
ceased to belong to the monks of Kelso ; from what cause is not 
known. The manor of Pencaitland, soon after the succession wars, 
came into the possession of John de Maxwell, younger brother 
of Sir Eustan Maxwell of Carlaverock, who granted an annuity, 
from his lands of Pencaitland to the monks of Dryburgh, besides 
the advowson of the church of Pencaitland, with the chapel of 
Paystoun and the church lands, tithes, and profits. The church 
of Pencaitland and the chapel of Paystoun remained with the ca- 
nons of Dryburgh till the Reformation. The cure was served by 
a Vicar.

IIADDINGTONSHIRI'; 



Eminent Men. — David Calderwood, an eminent divine and eccle- 
siastical historian, was, in the latter years of his life, minister of this 
parish. He lived during a very eventful period in the History of 
Scotland, and experienced largely the vicissitudes which charac- 
terized those times. His attachment to Presbytery was enlighten- 
ed and conscientious. This led him to oppose with great firmness 
the attempts that were made to introduce Episcopacy into Scotland. 
A rather amusing account is given of a conversation which King 
James had with him, when summoned to appear before the commis- 
sion court that sat at St Andrews. Mr Calderwood maintained his 
own principles with great propriety, and resisted all the atterppts 
of the King to win him by persuasion or overawe him by authority. 
For this conduct he was first imprisoned, and then sent into ba- 
nishment. The country to which he removed was Holland, where 
he resided for six years. While there, he published in 1623 his 
celebrated treatise, entitled " Altare Damascenum,'' the object of 
which was to expose the insidious means by which the polity of 
the English Church had been intruded upon Scotland. After 
the death of King James, Calderwood returned to Scotland, 
and resided at Edinburgh in a private manner for many years, com- 
piling a history of the Church of Scotland from the death of 
James V. to that of James VI. He attended the celebrated as- 
sembly at Glasgow in the year 1638, — where his acquaintance 
with the constitution and records of the Church were of great ser- 
vice. About this time he resumed his proper functions as a mi- 
nister, and was settled in this parish, where he continued to labour 
faithfully till a short time before his death. He was a member 
of the committee for drawing up the Directory for public worship. 
An abstract of his Church History was published under the care 
of the General Assembly. 

Mr Robert Douglas, another minister of this parish, was a very 
distinguished man. The first public notice taken of him is as 
chaplain to a brigade of auxiliaries sent over to Germany from 
Scotland, to aid the Protestant cause under Gustavus Aldolphus. 
He continued a considerable time with the army of that celebrated 
commander, who said of him, that Mr Douglas might have been 
counsellor to any Prince in Europe ; for prudence and knowledge, 
he might be Moderator to a General Assembly ; and for military 
skill said he, " I would very freely trust my army to his conduct." 

Mr Douglas returned to Scotland, and was one of the ministers 
of Edinburgh, in 1641. Two years after this time, he was ap-

pointed one of the Commissioners from ScotUind to attend the 
famous Westminster Assembly, but, owing to some cause or other, 
was prevented from attending. He frequently preached before the 
Scotch. Parliament during the course of the civil war, " and 
shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God." He laboured 
much for the restoration of Charles 11. to the throne of his an- 
cestors, and was appointed to preach at the ordination of that mo- 
narch, at Scone on the 1st January 1651. It was said of him in 
his own day, " that few contributed more to the Restoration than 
Mr Douglas, and derived less benefit from it." Subsequently to 
this period, he was settled minister of this parish under the Indul- 
gence, and died about the year 1673, full of years and of honours. 

Another person of distinction connected with this parish, was 
Sir John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall. He was an eminent lawyer 
and statesman, and not less remarkable for his zealous attachment 
to the Protestant faith, than for his exemplary conduct in the va- 
rious relations of life. His industry as a writer on subjects con- 
nected with his profession was very great, and the fruits of his la- 
bours are justly regarded as most valuable. Besides the two vo- 
lumes published under the title of " Fountainhall's Decisions," he 
left three quarto and ten folio volumes of manuscripts, and there 
is reason to believe from his references, that some others were lost. 

James Hamilton, son of Lord Presmennan, was appointed one 
of the Judges of the Court of Session, and also a Lord of Justici- 
ary by the title of Lord Pencaitland. Although he confined himself 
almost entirely to the duties of his own profession, yet the worth of 
his character was extensively known and highly estimated. It seems 
to have been in the person of this gentleman, that the connection of 
his family with the estate of Pencaitland was formed — a connection 
which reflected great honour on their own character, and that 
has proved to be a signal benefit to this place. It would be im- 
proper to pass over without some notice, George Seton, fifth and 
last Earl of Winton. He was eminent for his high rank in society, 
for the antiquity of his family, and for his chivalrous but disastrous 
attachment to the House of Stuart. He joined in the rebellion 
in 1715, was taken prisoner at Preston, tried for high treason, 
sentenced to be executed, and his estates and honours forfeited to 
the Crown. He found means to escape out of the Towerof London, 
and fled to Rome, where he died unmarried, about the age of 70.

the foundation of several famiUes of great distinction through the 
rest of Scotland." 

Landed Proprietors. — The Right Honourable Lady Ruthven 
is the principal proprietor and patron of the parish. Her Lady- 
ship's family the Hamiltons of Pencaitland have been long in 
possession of that estate, to the great advantage of their tenantry, 
and all connected with them. Andrew Fletcher, Esq. of Salton ; 
Patrick Dudgeon, Esq. of East Craigs ; Sir Thomas Dick Lau- 
der, Bart, of Fountainhall ; Mrs Johnston Brown of Milton ; and 
the Right Honourable the Earl of Hopetoun,— are the other 
chief proprietors. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of baptisms and mar- 
riages is 1598, and of deaths, 1616. From the above dates to 
the present time, these registers appear to have been kept, re- 
spectively, with great correctness, with the exception of a period 
of fifty years in the register of marriages, which is wanting. The 
minute book of the kirk-session, from 1633, and the cash book of 
transactions in managing the poor's funds, from 1729 till this time, 
bear marks of having been kept with much attention. A register 
of certificates granted to persons in communion with the Church 
when leaving this parish, and also a book containing inventories 
of the effects of paupers taken at the time that they were put upon 
the roll, have been kept since 1817. 

Antiquities.— In the village of Wester Pencaitland, there is an 
old cross, the history of which is not known. It may, however, 
as frequently happens in England, have marked the distinction 
of a market-place. This idea is countenanced by a notice that 
Was published in the Edinburgh Gazette, from Monday, 21st, till 
Thursday, 24th August 1699, in the following terms : « This is 
to give notice that two new fairs are to be holden at Wester Pen- 
caitland, in the sheriffdom of Haddington, for horse, nolt, sheep, 
and all sorts of linen and woollen cloth. The first upon the 4th 
of October, and the other on the 8th day of June yearly, free of 
customs for three years." 

III. — Population.

1791, ... 925 

1801,

From this statement it appears that the population has not fluc- 
tuated much in point of numbers for the last eighty years. There 
is a small increase from the time of the census m 18;31.

The general character of the inhabitants of this parish is high- 
ly respectable. Of course there are here, as well as in other places, 
some " that walk disorderly," but for the most part the people are 
diligent in their various callings, moral in their habits, and regu- 
lar in their attendance on the ordinances of religion. A marked 
improvement in the observance of the Sabbath has taken place 
within the last twenty years. Still, however, it is greatly to be 
desired that there should be more decided evidence of the spirit 
and power of true godliness. 

IV. — Industry. 

This parish, as we have seen, possesses some valuable minerals 
in addition to the productions of the soil. 

The amount of land may be estimated at 3800 acres Scots, 
which may be divided as follows : 

In tillage, . . . 3400 

permanent artificial pasture, . 160 

wood, . , . . 240 

3800 

There are sixteen farms in the parish, varying from 160 to 360 _ 
acres in extent, besides a few detached portions of land on which 
there are no buildino-s. 

Leases and Rents. — The duration of leases for the most part is 
nmeteen years, agreeably to the general practice in this county. 
The total rental of corn and grass land may amount to L. 6400. 
The rent of land in tillage varies from L. 1, 5s. to L. 3, and may 
average about L. 1, 15s. Pasture land brings from L. 1, 10s. to 
L.2, lOs. per acre Scots. The rents are almost entirely paid in 
money. The dwelling-houses of the farmers are suitable to their 
condition, and generally very comfortable. The farm-offices are 
also well adapted to the improved state of agriculture. It is gra- 
tifymg to find that greater attention is paid to the comfort of the 
farm-servants. Their houses for the most part consisted formerly 
but one apartment, with bare walls, and all open to the roofing. 
Of late years, however, a considerable improvement has taken 
place in the style of these dwellings. This is the case over the 
whole parish, but especially on the estate of the Right Honourable 
Lady Ruthven, the principal heritor. Each one of these houses, 



352 



IIADDINGTONSIIIUE. 



lately built upon her Ladyship's estate, is provided with three 
apartments, one for a kitchen and place of sleeping, another exclu- 
sively for a sleeping apartment, and the third for the produce of the 
dairy and household necessaries. These apartments are all plaster- 
ed on the walls and ceiling, and, in other respects, very comfort- 
able. This increase of accommodation must have a very beneficial 
effect not only on the health and comforts of the peasantry, but also 
on the delicacy and propriety of their domestic intercourse. 

The lands are judiciously subdivided and inclosed for the most part 
with thorn hedges, which, upon the whole, are kept in good order. 

Live-StocL — Owing to the high price of live-stock for some 
years back, the attention of the farmer has been more directed to 
this branch of rural economy. A considerable number of cattle 
are now reared and fattened. The sheep stock in general are not 
reared in the parish, but bought in at the spring and autumn fairs. 
The total number besides lambs may amount to 70 or 80 scores. 
They are principally sent to the Edinburgh market. 

Husbandry/. — A considerable portion of the soil here is un- 
favourable to the cultivation of turnips and other green crops. 
Fallowing is therefore an indispensable part of the course of crop- 
ping. The rotation generally followed is, what is called, the six- 
shift course. The application of lime to the soil has greatly fal- 
len off for a number of years back. The favourite mode of im- 
provement at present is by tile-draining. This operation is carried 
on vigorously in this parish, and the beneficial effects of it are very 
manifest. Steam-engines are coming into use for the thrashing of 
corn, which relieves the horses of the severest part of their labour, 
and at the same tirhe proves a considerable saving to the farmer. 

Produce.— The gross amount of raw produce may be estimated 
as follows : — 

Wheat, . . • 'o-M 

Barley, . • • - IS" 

Oats, ... 

Pease and beans, • • •

Marhci-Toions.—The market-towns chiefly resorted to arc 
Haddington and Dalkeith. But grain and cattle are also frc- 
qnently sent to the Grassmarkct of Edinburgh.

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is a very venerable 
antl picturesque structure. One part of it, called the Pencaitland 
Aisle, from its form and style of architecture, must have been built 
in the days of Popery. The other and larger portion was erect- 
ed in the year 1631. It is still in excellent preservation, and very 
comfortable as a place of worship, having lately received a com- 
plete repair. It is situated in the centre of the parish, and there- 
fore very convenient for the attendance of the people, who are, 
upon the whole, regular in the practice of church-going, and at- 
tentive to the preaching of the word. The number of Dissenters 
of all ages does not exceed 20, and of these some frequently 
attend the parish church. 

Through the kindness of the heritors, the manse is in excellent 
condition, and very commodious. The glebe, along with the gar- 
den, and site of manse and offices, contains rather more than six 
Scotch acres. The land is of good quality. The stipend consists 
of 70 bolls, 3 firlots, wheat ; 75 bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, barley ; 1 15 
bolls, J firlot, 1 peck, oats ; with L. 3, I3s. 7id, of money. 

Education.— Theve are three schools in this parish. The pa- 
rochial school is in the village of Wester Pencaitland, It is well 
attended, and well taught. The average number of scholars in 
winter is 70, and in summer, 65, The usual branches of educa- 
tion in country schools are taught here, with some of the higher 
branches. The schoolmaster has the maximum salary, and is well 
accommodated with a house, and garden, and school-room. 

There is another school in the village of Easter Pencaitland 
for instructing girls in the elementary principles of education, and 
teaching them needle-work. This school was established by the 
late Mrs Hamilton Campbell of Pencaitland, whose estimable qua- 
lities rendered her very dear to her friends, and whose memory 
will long be cherished as a benefactress to this place. 

There IS a third school in the village of Newtown, that is chiefly 
attended by the children of the colliers. As these children from 
an early age are more or less engaged in work, this school labours 
under great disadvantages from the irregularity of their attend- 
ance. Nevertheless, it is in a respectable state, and proves a 
great benefit to that place. The teacher receives certain gra- 
tuities from Lady Ruthven and the gentleman who rents the coal ; 
but he IS chiefly supported by the school-fees. 

On the Lord's day there are assembled in the different schools, 
either before or after the time of public worship, about 130 child- 
ren, for the purpose of receiving spiritual instruction. They are

taught by the regular teachers, assisted by others who cheerfully 
join with them in sowing the good seed of the kingdom in the 
minds of those young ones, trusting that, through God's blessing, 
it will take root and bring forth fruit unto everlasting life. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of poor on the roll 
who regularly receive assistance is 32. The funds for their re- 
lief are derived from the stated Sabbath collections, the interest 
of certain sums bequeathed to the kirk-session for behoof of the 
poor, — the mortcloth dues, and an assessment on the heritors 
and tenants. The average allowance to each pauper is rather 
more than L. 4, 10s. The disposition on the part of the poor to 
seek relief is on the increase. Aged parents wish to ease their 
children, and children to be freed from the obligation to help 
their parents. There is, within the last few years, a strong ten- 
dency towards a state of things that is inconsistent both with the 
feelings of nature and with the law of Christ. It is proper, how- 
ever, to state, that there are some honourable exceptions. 

Lms. — There are three public-houses in this parish, and one 
store where malt liquors are sold, to be used off the premises. 

2i\el. — There are three coal-mines wrought in ihis parish, so 
that the inhabitants have access to that necessary of life at a mo- 
derate price. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
While it affords great cause of thankfulness that the inhabi- 
tants of this parish are so generally distinguished for propriety of 
conduct and regularity of attendance on the pubhc ordinances of 
religion, yet there is one exception of rather a serious character. 
It is no uncommon thing for married women in the lower classes 
to be remiss in their attendance on the House of God. Of course, 
it is admitted that there are times and circumstances in the con- 
dition of families, when the mothers cannot be absent from them 
without inconvenience, or perhaps injury. The notice here taken 
does not apply to those occasions, but rather to times when there 
is reason to fear that absence from church proceeds from coldness 
or carelessness in the things of God. Neither is such remissness 
peculiar to this parish. On the contrary, it is believed that it pre- 
vails to a greater extent in some other parishes in this county, 
and perhaps also in other parts of Scotland. It is not difficult to 
form some estimate of the injurious consequences to the well-oenig 
of sotiety, and to the prosperity of rehgion, which must How from 
this source. If the mothers in Israel do not themselves repaw to 
the pool of ordinances, that they may drink of its health-giving

and refreshing waters, how can they be disposed or qualified to 
instil into the minds of their children those principles that will 
bring forth the fruits of holy and happy living. This marked no- 
tice is taken of an evil which threatens much injury to the rising 
generation, in the hope that other pastors and other elders in our 
Church may be stirred up to counteract and correct it by all the 
means in their power.

1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of the parish is derived from the name of 
the kirk town : and the ancient appellation of the village was 
usually written in charters, Aldhamstoc and Aldhamstok. These 
forms of the word are evidently derived from the Saxon Aldham, 
the old habitation, and stoc, a place. 

Extent, Sfc. — This parish lies six miles east of the town of Dunbar. 
It extends from the German Ocean on the east into Lammer- 
muir ; and is bounded on the north and west by the parish of In- 
nerwick ; on the south by that of Cockburnspath. Its length from 
north-east to south-west is about 6 English miles, and its breadth 
from north-west to south-east from 2 to 3 miles. 

The face of the country presents a succession of little hills gra- 
dually rising about each other, and receding from the shore. 

Soil. — The soil is generally sharp and dry ; very fertile towards 
the sea, but at a distance from the shore, barren and heathy. Some 
account of the Geology of this parish will be found under the Ge- 
neral Observations on the County. 

There is a seam of coal in the parish, but it has not been wrought. 

II. — Civil History. 
" The church of Oldhamstocks is ancient. In the ancient Tax- 
atio, it was rated at the high value of 60 marks. In Bagimont's 
Roll it was rated at L. 10. This church never belonged to any 
monastery ; the patronage of the rectory seems to have continued 
with the lord of the manor, who cannot be easily traced on so 
doubtful a frontier : Oldhamstocks appears not among the manors 
or baronies of Haddington constabulary in the tax-roll of 1613 ; 
and froni this circumstance we may infer that it had been long

merged in the barony of Dunglass. After various successions, tlic 
patronage of the church of Oldhamstocks became invested in 
Hunter of Thurston. On the 28th of August 1296, Thomas de 
Huntingour, the parson of Oldhamstock, swore fealty to Edward 
I. at Berwick, and was thereupon restored to his rectory." 

Land-oioners. — The principal land-owners in the parish are, Sir 
James Hall of Dunglass, Bart. ; James Hunter, Esq. of Thurs- 
ton ; Thomas Dods, Esq. of Statencleugh ; and Jam.es Balfour, 
Esq. of Whittinghame.

school is situate in the village of Oldhamstocks. The salary of 
the master is L. 25, 15s. and his fees amount to about L. 19 a 
year : he has also about L. 6 a year from other sources. In the 
other schools, only the ordinary branches are taught. All the

can write ; and there are very few who are not also taught the

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="NA">HADDINGTON</name>.</head> 
<p>


Haddingtonshire is situated between 55° 46' 10" and 56° 4' 
of north latitude, and between 2° 8'' and 2° 49' longitude west 
from London. It is bounded by Mid- Lothian on the west ; Ber- 
wickshire on the south; the German ocean on the east; and by the 
Frith of Forth on the north and north-west. It is nearly 25 
miles in length from Ravenshaugh burn on the west to Dunglass 
burn on the east, and being something like the form of a triangle 
on each side of that line, its greatest distance from it to the south 
in the parish of Fala is 9 miles, and its greatest distance to the 
north, in the parish of Dirleton, is 9 miles, which gives 224 
square miles, or 114,688 acres Scotch measure, as the superficies 
of the whole county, and of which 82,184 are known to be arable. 
It takes its name from Haddington, the county town, which is 
pleasantly situated on the river Tyne, near its centre. The county 
is generally spoken of as East Lothian, but that name properly 
refers to the arable lands only, the rest of the shire being com- 
posed of part of the Lammermuir-hills, which stretch along its 
southern border. It was long merely a constabulary, and subject 
to the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Edinburgh, and it is still occa- 
sionally mentioned under that designation ; but in the first act of 
James VII. it is considered a distinct shire, and has continued an 
independent sheriffdom since the Revolution. 

For many years, the county formed part of the Saxon kingdom 
of Northumberland, but it was annexed to Scotland by Malcohn 
II. in A. D. 1020. From that period till 1296, it is said to have 
enjoyed comparative tranquillity, and to have made considerable 
progress in agricultural improvement; but the sanguinary wars 
that commenced then, regarding the succession to the Scottish 
throne, desolated the county to nearly the middle of the follow- 
ing century. During the fifteenth century, it also repeatedly suf-

fered severely from the turbulence and lawless ambition of its 
nobles. In 1650, it was the theatre of the defeat and slaughter 
of the Scotch army by Oliver Cromwell; and again in 1745, its 
soil was polluted with blood by the infatuated politicians of that 
unhappy period. But fortunately, since that time, it has enjoyed 
uninterrupted tranquilhty, when every circumstance connected 
with its domestic and rural economy have been in a state of stea- 
dily progressive improvement. 

Topographical Appearances. — East Lothian presents a finely di- 
versifiedlandscape when viewed from the adjoininghillsof Lammer- 
muir. From the Garleton-hills, near its centre, the prospect islikewise 
interesting and beautiful. From that position the inequalities of 
the surface are more discernible ; and it is seen that, although the 
country rises from the sea shore to its southern boundary, yet that 
the ascent is not uniform, but generally by ridges of gently swell- 
ing undulations, and almost entirely stretching in an east and 
westerly direction. The first of these ridges from the sea com- 
mences with Gulane-hill, in the parish of Dirleton, and, stretching 
eastward through the parishes of North Berwick and Whitekirk, 
embraces the entire northern angle of the county. The second 
distinctly marked ridge has the Garleton-hills for its centre, and 
extends west into Mid- Lothian, and east into the parish of Pres- 
tonkirk, where it terminates near the sea. All the rest of the 
county has a pretty regular and gentle ascent to the south, but 
generally composed of easy swells of the surface, and stretching 
from east to west with hardly a single exception. North Berwick 
Law and Traprain Law are conspicuous objects in the topography 
of the district. They are seven miles distant from each other, 
and rise singly in the open plain, the former a beautifully shaped 
conical hill to the height of 800 feet, and the other to 700 feet 

above the level of the sea. 

Hydrography.— T\ieve is nothing particularly deserving of no- 
tice in the hydrography of the county, as, from its geographical 
position, and limited extent, all its streams are necessarily of a 
very short course, and trifling dimensions. The Pelfer is a small 
slu'jo-ish burn or stream, that runs through a tract of flat alluvial 
soir,\nd discharges its waters into the sea, the one-half by the 
west at Aberlady, the other half by the east in the parish of White- 
kirk. Its course altogether is about ten miles, and it drains the 
valley stretching along the southern border of the three parishes 
that constitute the northern angle of the district. From appear

ances in the strata, it is probable that the sea continued to flow 
through the bed now occupied by the Peffer, after both sides of it 
had become dry land, when, of course, the ground to the north 
would form an island. The Tyne is by far the largest stream in 
county, yet its course is so short, and its waters so limited, as 
hardly to deserve the name of river. It rises in Edinburghshire, 
and running eastward through nearly the centre of East Lothian, 
a level fertile district, to which it is highly ornamental, it falls 
into the sea at Tynninghame, after a course of little more than 
twenty miles. Besides enlivening the landscape, it is at the same 
time found highly convenient, indeed valuable, by the number of 
mills it puts in motion during its course, and likewise by its effec- 
tually draining all the county to the south of the Garleton ridge 
already spoken of. Salton and Giflford waters, as the streams are 
named, are tributaries to the Tyne, by draining into it all the 
south-west section of the county. Beltonford-burn is the only 
other stream in the district worthy of notice. It rises in the pa- 
rish of Garvald, among the Lammermuir-hills, and, after a north- 
eastern course of about eight miles, falls into the sea a little to the 
west of Dunbar. It is but a trifling streamlet, of a few yards 
broad even at its mouth; yet its banks are distinguished by some' 
of the sweetest scenery in the county, as at Beil, for instance, the 
elegant mansion of Mrs H. N. Ferguson, where nature and art 
united have done so much to adorn and beautify the landscape. 

Geology. — The geology of the county presents a field of inquiry 
deeply interesting to the philosopher, and of profound contempla- 
tion to the partially informed, as well as to the man of science or 
general learning. It can hardly be said to have as yet been studied 
with reference to agriculture, notwithstanding of its intimate con- 
nection with that art, and its direct influence in determining the 
character of the husbandry of every nation, wherever the business 
is properly understood. It is therefore particularly deserving of 
notice, when treating of a district that owes so much to its agri- 
culture. The county exhibits in very marked features two lead- 
ing geological divisions within its boundaries : \st. The Lammer- 
muirs, composed of transition strata and chiefly those of nep- 
tunian or aquatic formation. These hills stretch from east to 
west along the entire southern border of the county, and form near- 
ly a fifth part of its superficial contents. They are from 500 to up- 
wards of 1700 feet in height, and are consequently unfitted for grow-

GENERAL OBSEllVATfONS ON THE 



Jng corn with advantage ; besides, their general steepness, and the- 
rugged and barren nature of the soil, render cultivation for the 
most part out of the question. At Fassney water, there is a very 
interesting display of neptunian and plutonian transition rocks, 
which are described in the Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural His- 
tory Society, and in Mr Cunningham's prize essay, published in the 
seventh volume of the Wernerian Society's Memoirs. Pasturage 
is the natural purpose to which they are fitted, and to which they 
are found admirably adapted, as shown by the healthy stock of 
sheep that are annually sold to be fed in more genial climates. In 
the glens and hollows, the soil composed of the debris washed from 
the hills is found generally dry and fertile, and produces oats, tur- 
nips, and potatoes of excellent quality. 

It is perhaps impossible to determine whether or not the Lam- 
mermoor range of hills had attained their present elevation, when 
the adjoining low country to the north was immersed in the depths 
of the ocean. But the probability is, that they then formed a por- 
tion of an extensive continent, comparatively little elevated above 
the level of the sea, and which yielded that luxuriant vegetation 
that now forms the rich coal-fields on the western part of the 
county ; and, that when the present arable district was lifted up 
to its present position, these hills, too felt the effects of the move- 
ment, and had their foundations elevated in the general convulsion, 
by a pressure from below, and laterally, with a force of that tre- 
mendous magnitude which the human faculties can never fairly 
comprehend. 

2f/y, There appears to be no difference of opinion among geo- 
logists, regarding the real character of the low lands of the county, 
or of what, strictly speaking, is denominated East Lothian, as these 
are allowed on all hands to be of the secondary formation. The 
old red sandstone, which may be considered the basis of that 
formation, rests on the transition strata. The rock is distinct- 
ly seen at different places on the sea coast, and is known to 
flank the Lammermoor-hiils from the west to the eastern ex- 
tremity of the county. It is considered the lowest of the car- 
boniferous formation, and on which, throughout the district, rest 
various of the strata of the series consisting of limestone, coal, 
fire-clay, with ironstone, clay, shales, and all their alternating 
sandstones peculiar to the period. The only exception, if such it 
is, to the district being entirely of secondary strata, arises from the 



COUNTY OF HADDINGTON. 



301 



trap rock that occupies a portion of its surface, as that rock has 
obviously burst through the entire strata after even the niost recent 
of it had been deposited. It is impossible to form any estimate 
of the length of time that has elapsed since the country was raised 
from the bottom of the ocean. Yet it is extremely probable that 
it took place at the same period of the trap irruption. And it is 
almost obvious to ocular demonstration, that after the movement 
had commenced, at least after the highest lands of the district had 
beo-un to emerge from the sea, that the motion had been steadily 
progressive, whatever the rate may have been at which it proceed- 
ed, until the land and sea had each attained their present respec- 
tive positions. At the same time, there are certain circumstances 
that distinctly show, such as the accumulation of particular kinds 
of diluvium on the eastern sides of the trap hills, that the lifting- 
up of the ground had not been instantaneous, like what is ex- 
perienced in an earthquake. Although such is the fact, as appli- 
cable to the district as a whole, when speaking of its being lifted 
from the bottom of the ocean, yet there is one exception which, 
although of aUmited description, is deserving of notice, as it shows 
clearly there has been a second movement, perhaps in the subsid- 
ing of the sea, but more probably in the lifting up of the dryland. 
That fact is distinctly visible on the sea shore in the parish of 
Dirleton, where the outline of the ancient beach is clearly dis- 
cernible in some places more than a mile from the sea, and the 
new, or at least more recent land is apparently thirty feet above 
the present high water-mark. It is curious that the south side of 
the same parish, in the vale of Peffer, affords indications, although 
not so distinctly marked, of the same interesting circumstance. A 
very considerable portion of the soil in the centre of that parish 
rests on trap rock, which renders it more probable that the whole 
parish has been elevated, than merely the narrow strip around its 
margin. 

There is a difference of geological structure in the arable por- 
tion or low lands of the county, which, although of a minor charac- 
ter, may warrant its description under three separate heads or sec- 
tions, as that diversity extends to both the natural structure of the 
land, and also to the system of husbandry suitable to each. The 
south-eastern portion, extending from Oldhamstocks parish west 
to Garvald, and including the parishes of Dunbar, Innerwick, Spot, 
Stenton, and Whittinghame, may be considered as forming the

first of these sections, and which ujay be designated the red sand- 
stone district. The space occupied by the sandstone strata itself, 
where it has been lifted to the surface, is comparatively limited, 
and the rock at its disruption is either generally covered with the 
diluvium brought from a little distance, or its disintegration is so 
complete as to offer no obstruction to cultivation. But, besides 
that space itself, almost the whole adjacent lower grounds to the 
north and eastward of the rock are covered whh diluvium princi- 
pally of the sandstone, its debris and rougher fragments having 
been carried by the current of the superincumbent waters, and 
spread over the less elevated portion of the original strata. And 
to such a depth have these materials been accumulated in various 
situations, that they actually constitute something like a new 
formation. There are, however, parts of this section, and especi- 
ally near its western confines, where a considerable mixture of clay 
is to be found in the ground, and which, consequently, confers a 
different character on it, as well as a difference in its value, and 
the nature of its produce. The greater proportion, however, by 
far of the surface of the parishes mentioned is composed of the 
sandstone diluvium, mixed to a greater or less extent with the 
other materials furnished by the disrupted strata of secondary for- 
mation, and which constitutes what is denominated a sandy loam, 
a soil naturally fitted to become, what much of it actually now is, 
a tract of the most fertile land in Scotland. 

Limestone is found near the eastern extremity of the district, 
but confined to a comparatively limited spot, composed entirely of 
the original strata. Trap rock is also found to a trifling extent, 
but chiefly within the sea beach or near to it. Clay fit for tile- 
making is apparently restricted to one spot on the sea coast, to the 
west a little of Dunbar. There are no other minerals known to 
exist in the district. 

The second section comprehends the parishes of Giff"ord and 
Morham, and from these, and from the Garleton-hills to the 
westward to the boundary of the county, the surface of much 
of that district is tolerably level, the strata having been compara- 
tively less disturbed and dislocated than some other parts of the 
country. Throughout a considerable portion of it, the soil has con- 
sequently been formed on beds of clay, and similar materials, more 
nearly approaching to the original strata than the soil of the land 
to the eastward. The action of the atmosphere, through the lapse

of ages, has no doubt greatly modified the stubborn character of 
the original surface ; but much of it will long continue to show 
the natural barrenness of the undisturbed strata of lands of the 
epoch to which it belongs. Along the sea shore, as also in dif- 
ferent limited tracts in the interior, the soil is of, what has already 
been described, diluvial origin, — being the less adhesive materials 
of the previous strata washed from the higher into the lower lo- 
calities, while the ground had been covered with water. The 
land of such situations is consequently of good quality, and well 
calculated for all the purposes of modern husbandry. In the 
higher and south-west corner of the district, the old red sandstone 
makes its appearance to a limited extent, when the land covered 
and mixed with its debris, like what occurs elsewhere, forms the 
earliest and richest soil of any in its neighbourhood. Had the 
rock, however, been lifted to the surface in its original horizontal 
position, it would, in respect to its productive powers, have re- 
mained in a state of comparative barrenness ; whereas, in being 
lifted up, it has been so far twisted and dislocated, as to have 
enabled the superincumbent mass of waters to break it up, and 
spread abroad its fragments in a rougher or more comminuted 
. state, and which are everywhere found so highly favourable in 
promoting a plentiful and vigorous vegetation. This section com- 
prehends a portion of the coal-measures that extend westward in- 
to Mid- Lothian, and is composed of clay, shale, and sandstone 
peculiar to the formation of the carboniferous series. But the 
fertility of the incumbent soil varies greatly, and altogether de- 
pends on the nature and quantity of the diluvial materials with 
which it is covered. Where the limestone has been heaved up to 
the surface, its strata must be referred to an earlier era. Yet 
there is no perceptible difference in the productive powers of the 
soil that covers it, and what has been more recently accumulated 
on the strata after the coal formation. Trap-rock abounds along 
the sea coast ; clay also, for the ordinary purposes of the potter, is 
met with in different situations. 

The third district or geological section comprises the parishes 
of Haddington, Athelstaneford, Prestonkirk, Whitekirk, North 
Berwick, and Dirleton, and presents a character entirely different 
from the rest of the county. These parishes at one period, with- 
out doubt, formed part of the same plain, and were overlaid with 
such deposits as are common to the secondary formation. But in 
numerous situations, the strata have been burst asunder ; and the 



364 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 

melted materials of a lower region iiave been forced to the sur- 
face, and now form Traprain Law, Garleton-bills, North Berwick 
Law, and all the other rocks of igneous origin so conspicuous in 
the district, as well as the various isles and rocks that stud its 
shores. These rocks and hills differ both in structure, and, in 
some degree, in the materials of which they are composed, and 
are, consequently, distinguished by various names, such as por- 
phyry, clinkstone, greenstone, basalt, &amp;c. The designation 
trap-rock is sufficiently descriptive of the whole family; hence 
we here use it as a generic term. Trap is generally found in 
the vicinity of limestone, which has led to the conjecture of the 
latter being connected with the formation of the former. It 
has already been stated as existing on the sea shore in the 
eastern district of the county. The harbour of Dunbar is in part 
formed of a rare and really interesting description of trap, which, 
from the colour and materials of which it is composed, leads to 
the belief of its having been formed by the fusion of the red sand- 
stone and limestone, that both abound in the neighbourhood. In- 
deed, it is highly probable that the various descriptions of trap 
are all merely the result of different degrees of heat, acting on 
different materials met with in the interior, and, like other rocks 
of igneous origin, have forced their way through the various 
strata to the surface of the globe. The upbreaking, however, 
of the regular strata of the section of the county at present 
mider consideration, by the trap, appears to have produced a 
greater diversity of soil of the present surface than could pos- 
sibly have existed otherwise ;— as, being lifted up and broken 
to fragments in deep water, running with a heavy current, the 
more clayev portion of the mass has, in some degree, floated 
till carried "to the sheltered side of the first rock in its course, 
where it has been deposited, and now forms richer soil than that 
composed of the rougher and harder materials hurled to compara- 
tively lower and more exposed situations. Hence the ndges or 
tails of deep rich loam, forming the eastern slopes of Traprain 
Law North Berwick Law, Garleton-hills at Barneymains, Dirle- 
ton 'Pentontower, Whitekirk-hills, and various other localities. 
Th'e interesting fact, that the waters that then covered the country 
ran with a strong current from nearly due west, is also strikingly 
illustrated by these deposits,_the ridges or slopes stretching east 
and west, and invariably resting on the east side of the trap-hiUs 
and rocks : and further, rocks are common with a bold clear face

IVontiug the west, but never with a clear face in the opposite direc- 
tion. Boulders of trap have also been found in great abundance, 
strewed in a direct line to the east, from the parent rock, but none 
are ever seen lying to the westward of the same rocks. As to the ef- 
fects of the trap irruption on the general fertility of the district, it is 
highly worthy of notice, that the lands every where are undoubt- 
edly better fitted for all the purposes of modern agriculture, by 
the commingling together of all the various original strata, than 
they possibly could have been if lying in their first position. 

The mineral products of the county are of the utmost import- 
ance to the general welfare of its inhabitants, and are therefore de- 
serving of particular notice. 

1st, Coal is found in great abundance in the western parts of the 
county. It is a continuation of the Mid- Lothian coal-field, 
and extends eastward through the parishes of Prestonpans, Tra- 
nent, Ormiston, Pencaitland, Gladsmuir, and into Haddington, 
but in the last it is so interrupted by faults, dikes, &amp;c. as to be un- 
worthy of working. It is consequently found principally in that part 
of the district that escaped the trap irruption. The article is said 
to have been known so early as in a. d. 1200, when it was worked 
at Prestongrange by the monks of Newbattle. It crops out in 
Seton sands, which may have led to its discovery and use at that 
early period. Trials have repeatedly been made to the eastward 
of Haddington, indeed to the eastward of Dunbar, to discover coal, 
but hitherto without success. Nor, from the character of the strata 
is it at all probable, that it ever can be found in that direction 
worth working. In the parish of Dirleton, to the north of that vil- 
lage, a thin seam crops out near the sea, but in place of running into 
the higher ground, it dips rapidly away towards the sea, shewing as 
if the outer edge only of the basin in which the coal had been form- 
ed had been lifted up by the trap- rock found in its neighbourhood, 
but on the opposite direction of the dip of the coal. About two 
miles further west, also near the sea, the 7iew red sandstone has been 
lifted up, and is probably the only rock of that series found within 
the limits of the trap district; but its appearance adds to the pro- 
lability of coal lying in that direction, and which may extend across 
below the sea, and unite with the coal-field worked with such ad- 
vantage on the opposite coast of Fife. 

2d, Limestone is every where met with, at a few miles distance, 
throughout the county, in great abundance, and of the finest qua- 
lity. In some cases, the rock dips with a considerable angle, the in,

366 GENERAL OUSETIVATIONS ON THE 

dination being sometimes in one direction and sometimes in an- 
other, having reference to the point at which the moving power by 
which the surrounding strata had been elevated, had exerted its 
greatest energy. Indeed, in some instances, where it has been raised 
to the surface, the dip is so rapid that it is found unworthy of work- 
ing. But in general, the strata are tolerably level and the rock so 
near the surface, that it is readily procured at a moderate price every 
where. The limestone of the county is understood to be all of the car- 
boniferous series, and often exhibits beautiful specimens of theencri- 
nite, and of other organic remains of that era. From 12 to 14 feet 
is the common thickness of the rock in all the principal quarries, 
which strengthens the probability of its having all formed part of the 
same original deposit. The Hairlaw rock, in the parish of Glads- 
muir, at a short distance from the western boundary of the trap, 
presents a vivid picture of the movement by which the limestone 
and all its superincumbent strata had been hfted to its present po- 
sition. The limestone dips from the trap away below the coal 
worked at no great distance to the westward. But its rising there 
and elsewhere to the eastward, without any coal being seen in the 
neighbourhood where it makes its second appearance, cuts off all 
hopes of the mineral ever being found in that direction. 

Qd, Clay-ironstone, fit for smelting, is met with in various situations. 
A number of years ago, it was worked at Gullane, on account of the 
Carron Company at Falkirk ; but nothing has been done in the bu- 
siness, either there or elsewhere in the district, for a considerable 
time past. When speaking of the prospects of coal in the parish 
of Dirleton, allusion was made to the new red sandstone, which 
there makes its appearance. The rock has obviously been lifted 
up by the trap, which forms the conspicuous land-mark of Gullane- 
hill. The sandstone cropping out to the surface is composed of 
various strata, both red and white, and leaning on the trap-rock dips 
to the north-west, away towards the sea. A thin seam of coal, and 
also two seams or beds of fire-clay, are found in the sandstone 
strata. The undermost bed of clay is about 6 feet thick, and con- 
tains ironstone in blocks, imbedded in the clay. It was that seam that 
was formerly wrought by the Carron Company ; it was worked out 
by mining, something in the manner of working coal. The upper- 
most bed of the fire-clay is about 2 feet thick, the sandstone ad- 
joining it being red, and which is quarried for the ordinary pur- 
poses of building. The seams of clay contain blocks of red chalk, 
provincially keil an article much used by shepherds in marking

set 



their flocks. The clay is highly indurated, most probably by the 
pressure of the incumbent mass of sandstone ; so much is that the 
case, that it may with propriety be denominated slate rather than 
clay, especially when first dug out of the rock, although exposure 
to the atmosphere soon makes it exhibit its argillaceous origin. 
The materials forming clay and sandstone are so different in their 
characters, that it is interesting to see the one imbedded in the 
other, without the slightest intermixture of their respective com- 
ponent parts ; at the same time it is evident that the currents of the 
ancient ocean in which these materials had been deposited were 
subject to the same sudden change as marks the deposits of more 
modern eras. Flints, in chalk, are supposed to have originated from 
some organized body having been deposited among the chalk, and 
which had attracted the silica in quantities-sufficient to form the 
fluids. Could something of the same nature among the clay, at the 
remote period of its formation, have served as the nucleus for at- 
tracting the oxide of iron so as to form the red chalk in one bed, 
and the ironstone ore in the other  

4th, Clay of good quality, and fit for manufacturing brick and 
tiles, is met with in numerous situations. In the clays found in 
the higher part of the county, the colour is not uniform, and the 
beds of it are comparatively limited. The mineral in such loca- 
lities was most probably deposited after the partial dislocation and 
upraising of the strata of the secondary formation. But in the 
lower district, circumstances connected with the clay formation 
appear to have been materially different. There, it is all invariably 
of a blue colour, and extends partially along, or at least not far 
from the sea, from the vicinity of Dunbar to the western boun- 
dary of the county. It is probable that the clay originally ex- 
tended, at a remote period, in an unbroken line between the 
points here mentioned. The vale of the western branch of the 
Peffer-burn, however, is the field where the mineral is found in the 
greatest abundance, and which extends into the sea beneath the 
flat and wide sands of Aberlady. It varies in depth from ten to 
25 feet thick, probably deeper, although hitherto unascertained. 
Shells apparently of marine origin are found in the clay, but ge- 
nerally so much decomposed as to be incapable of handling. 
There are likewise very thin beds or lamina of fine sand found 
interspersed occasionally among the clay, but so very thin as to be 
merely perceptible, although they serve to render the clay easier 
worked by the labourers when employed in raising it, And these 



3G8 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON TIIP 

beds of sand are so uniformly deposited in something like hori- 
zontal strata as to shew distinctly that they must have been form- 
ed in very still water. The surface of the clay, on the other hand, 
is generally covered with sand a few feet deep, and which con- 
stitutes a moorish soil peculiar to the district. But under that 
sandy soil, when cleared away, the surface of the clay is seen 
thickly indented with irregularly shaped holes of from one to three 
feet deep, notwithstanding of its firm tenacious character, and 
which shews in the clearest manner, that, before the moorish sand 
was deposited, its surface had been washed and broken by water 
far more violently agitated than what had happened during the 
long period of the slow deposition of the argillaceous sediment, 
and as the level character of the stratum of the clay, as marked by 
the lamina of fine sand, shows that in all probability it had been 
deposited in very deep water, so its broken surface may be sup- 
posed to have resulted from its being raised into, and washed by 
comparatively shallow water, before being left entirely dry. The 
deposition of the seams of fire-clay in the sandstone strata may 
apparently be referred to the formation of the earlier period of the 
carboniferous series, while the blue clay of the lower district would 
appear to belong to a more recent period, although at the same 
time anterior to the trap irruption. 

btlu Sandstone for building can be readily obtained, and some 
of the trap quarries likewise produce excellent materials for the 
same purpose, but nothing can excel the latter rock for road mak- 
ing, and throughout a great portion of the county, it is easily ob- 
tained in the utmost abundance. In some situations, too, such as 
at North Berwick-law, the trap, although not stratified, is of that 
firm texture as to be cut into blocks, and used for gate posts, and 
likewise heavy rollers suitable for the purposes of the agricultu- 
rist. 

Such, in a brief sketch, are some of the leading facts m the geo- 
logy of Haddingtonshire. On a transient glance of the subject, 
the mind is apt to perceive nothing but merely a succession of 
tremendous convulsions of nature, which have been alike ruin- 
ous as irresistible. But a more deliberate consideration of all the 
astonishing phenomena, connected with the deeply interesting 
subject, that have followed each other during the lapse of an al- 
most inconceivable number of ages, leads to the cheering convic- 
tion, that design by a Supreme Ruler is most distinctly manifested

in making beneficent provision for the extensive existence and 
enjoyment of his animated creation. 

Agriculture. — The Lammermuir-hills, that constitute the south- 
ern and higher district of the county, are principally devoted to 
the breeding of sheep, part being black-faced, but the great pro- 
portion are of the Cheviot breed, which are generally preferred 
on account of the superior value of the wool. The native stock 
are well-known as excellent thrivers, and generally sell at compa- 
ratively high prices, to be fed on grass or turnip in lower districts 
of the kingdom. Much care has been bestowed by the store -mas- 
ters on the improvement of their stock, in respect to both wool and 
carcass, and the recent high prices of the former certainly hold 
out the most flattering encouragement for every exertion in that 
direction. Salving the sheep is invariably practised throughout 
the district, and it is probable that careful experiment may yet 
lead to the use of more valuable materials than any that have as 
yet been employed. 

East Lothian is an agricultural district entirely in the strictest 
sense of the word, and has been long celebrated for the skill and 
success with which its husbandry has been conducted. The atten- 
tion of its tenantry have long been steadily directed to the improve- 
ment of what is termed the alternate system of husbandry, as the 
practice best suited to both their soil and climate. At the same 
time, the fattening of stock of all descriptions for the butcher forms 
an important item in that system, and now constitutes a regular 
part of the economy of every well conducted farm. Comparatively 
few sheep or cattle, however, have hitherto been bred in the dis- 
trict, nor is there a single variety of any one description of our do- 
mestic animals, that owes its origin as a distinct breed to the 
county. 

Of cattle bred for feeding either on grass or turnip, some are 
of the short-horned breed, but the greater proportion are from 
the Highlands and the north-eastern counties of Scotland. The 
sheep fed on grass are generally ewes, which are bought in the 
autumn, with a view to have lambs in the spring, when both are 
fattened and sold off during the summer. A considerable num- 
ber of black-faced Highland wedders used to be fed on turnips 
annually, but of late that kind of stock has, in some measure, been 
set aside, and half-breed hogs fed in their stead. These are ge- 
nerally from Cheviot ewes by Leicester rams, and are common- 
ly sold early in summer after being dipt, the recent high prices of

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



wool having greatly encouraged that system of management. It 
will be observed, however, that, although the feeding of stock is 
now carried on during the winter months as well as in summer, 
yet that every description of soil is not equally well-fitted forthat 
profitable practice, and it is chiefly on that account that land suited 
for the growth of turnip, and which at the same time is equally 
well calculated for the production of wheat, is so truly valuable to 
the farmer. 

It is from possessing that character in so eminent a degree, that 
the land§ in the eastern or red sandstone district are so particu- 
larly distinguished for their fertility and value. There, with some 
exceptions, in its north-west point, to which the sandstone does not 
extend, every acre yields annually an abundant crop, either as food 
for fattening stock, or of grain of the finest quality. When, con- 
trary to what results from cropping with grain alone, the more 
abundant and weighty the cattle crops are, so much the more is 
the land enabled to yield valuable crops of corn. Turnip is con- 
sequently the basis of the system of cropping on all such soils, and 
which are part eaten on the ground, and the other portion carted 
to the straw-yard for cattle. Wheat sown at any time after the 
ground is cleared, or barley in the spring, always follow the turnip, 
when clover and ryegrass seeds are sown for the next, season. 
Grass, either cut or pastured, is the third year's crop, and which is 
followed by oats, that commonly finish the rotation. In cases 
where the soil is of a heavier character, the oats are followed by 
pease and beans, when wheat, sown in the autumn, finishes the 
course. There are 19,882 acres of that soil in the district, and 
the gross annual produce over the whole is estimated at from L. G, 
10s. to L. 8 Sterling per acre, Scotch measure. 

In the western district, over the lands that exhibit something like 
their original strata, summer fallow is the basis of the system of 
cropping. Along its southern border, there are occasionally seen 
pretty extensive fields covered with diluvium from the adjacent 
transition rocks, and are consequently fitted for the successful cul- 
ture of turnips. In such cases, barley with grass seeds follows, 
which often is pastured two or three years, when it is again broken 
up for oats. That system is still more applicable to the tract co- 
vered by the red sandstone diluvium, which is found peculiarly 
valuable for the growth of turnips and grass, and consequently the 
feeding of stock. But, from the nature of the original strata, the 
ereater part of the district has a subsoil of such a retentive tenaci-

ous character, that a bare summer fallowing is found by far the 
best foundation for its profitable cultivation. Wheat regularly 
follows the fallow, and is sown in the spring with grass seeds, 
which, the year after, is cut or pastured, and the fourth year the 
land is sown with grass seeds, which concludes the rotation. Some- 
times, the grass lies two years before the oats are taken, and, in 
other cases, beans and pease mixed succeed the oats, which, being 
followed by wheat, forms the sixth and last year of the course. 
But it is only on the better description of land that the sixth course 
system can be adopted with any thing like advantage to the culti- 
vator. The climate, too, being rather late, is against that prac- 
tice, and which, on the whole, is rarely pursued. At the same 
time, all that portion of the western district that slopes to the north, 
and lies within a mile or two of the sea, is generally of very fine 
quality, and yields the richest crops of every description. The 
entire south-western district contains 25,231 acres, and its gross 
annual produce is estimated at L. 3, 10s. to L. 6 per Scotch acre. 
The sea-side part of the district contains 5740 acres,. and its gross 
annual produce is valued at L. 6, 10s. per acre. 

In the third or trap district, the circumstance that more particu- 
larly distinguishes the system of cropping there from that in other 
parts of the county, is the very general cultivation of pease and 
beans, or black crop, as these are commonly designated. The greater 
part of that district has a retentive subsoil, and the soil itself is, in 
many cases, of a heavy loamy character, — consequently very well 
fitted for the leguminous crops mentioned, although not so well 
calculated for growing turnip. The climate is likewise favourable, 
which, united with a kindly enough working soil, enables the far- 
mer, with considerable certainty, to have the bean stubble regu- 
larly sown with wheat before the winter, — a circumstance on which 
much of the prosperity of the district depends. Summer fallow 
has long been the foundation of the system of cropping adopted, 
— the land being commonly sown with wheat in the autumn, and 
with grass seeds in the spring for the year following. The third 
year, the greater part of the grass is pastured with sheep, only what 
is necessary for the work horses being cut with the scythe. Oats 
the fourth year follow after the clover lea. Beans drilled the next, 
when wheat, the sixth year, finishes the rotation. On dry sandy 
or gravelly loam, found to a limited extent near the sea shore, tur- 
nip have long commenced the rotation, and latterly, by skilful 
draining, tlie cultivutiou of that useful plant, has been gradually

GENERAL OBSEftVATIONS ON THE 



and profitably extended. In such cases, the after- rotation is similar, 
for the most part, to that where the land is summer fallowed, and 
it will be seen by what is stated, that the ground generally of the 
district is cropped with wheat twice every six years, and hitherto, 
it may be added, without any apparent diminution of its fertility. 
The arable lands of this district extend to 27,786 Scotch acres, 
and the gross annual value is estimated at L. 6, 6s. per acre. 

Great attention has been paid in selecting the most valuable va- 
rieties of grain of all kinds for seed, experience having proved, 
where attention has been paid to the subject, that varieties of the 
same kind of grain will often dilfer in their produce, to the extent 
of the full rent of the land. 

Of wheat, the staple produce of the county, both the white and 
red varieties are cultivated, but the former by far the most exten- 
sively. Of these. Hunter's sort has long stood the test of public 
approbation, and which, after many trials with a number of differ- 
ent kinds for the last thirty years, is still found the best suited for 
all the various soils and situations of the county. The woolly-ear- 
ed is also a valuable sort of the white kind for some situations. The 
Taunton-dean variety promises well, but has not as yet been suffi- 
ciently tested. The blood-red is a valuable kind for very rich soft 
land ; the Lammas red answers well on moderately good soils, 
while the Peaston red, a variety recently introduced, is found to be 
productive of grain of a very superior quahty. The woolly-eared 
has a square set ear, and has short fine straw. Hunter's Taunton- 
dean and the Lammas red are open in the ear, with pretty long 
straw. The blood -red has a square set ear, with short thick straw. 
The Peaston red likewise has a square set ear, but with long straw. 
The character of the straw ought always to determine the situation 
on which to sow the different varieties. 

Of barley, the Chevalier variety has lately been introduced, and, 
after repeated experiments made in competition for premiums offer- 
ed by the county Agricultural Association, for ascertaining its true 
character, as compared with the other sorts long cultivated, itis found 
to be the most productive of any kind known, and has consequent- 
ly nearly superseded all other varieties. It is, however, a few days 
later in ripening at harvest. Of oats, the potato and Hopeton are 
the two best early varieties, the former for soft rich land, and 
the latter for soils of a harder description. While the grey Angus 
oat, as a late variety, is better suited to all the diflferent soils and

situations of the county, taken as whole, than any other kind of oat 
whatever. 

It is ahiiost unnecessary to add, that potatoes are every where cul- 
tivated, although generally only for domestic use. In the farm ro- 
tation they are sometimes substituted for a part of the turnip 
crop, but more frequently they are grown on a part of the land al- 
lotted for pease and beans, and are always found an excellent pre- 
parative for wheat or barley. 

Almost the whole arable lands of the county have been limed 
within the last thirty years. Lime obviously acts as a chemical 
agent, and its effects have consequently been much more conspi- 
cuous on some soils than on others. On deep dry rich land, it 
does not operate so powerfully as on thin soils of every descrip- 
tion, more especially if they contain any thing of a ferruginous cha- 
racter, where, by neutralizing the oxide of iron, or other ingredients 
alike pernicious to vegetation, the effects of time have been found 
equally beneficial as permanent. The abundant supply of that 
valuable mineral has therefore been of the utmost consequence to 
the successful cultivation of a very considerable portion of the land 
of the county. 

Draining is another branch of rural industry that has long been 
particularly attended to. Till of late, the great object of the prac- 
tice was to free the land of spring-water, that used to rise to the 
surface, and souring the soil, checked and enfeebled vegetation of 
every description. Drains from three to four feet deep, and filled 
with stones, was the mode employed, and in many cases is still the 
practice. But within these few years, the plan of tile-draining has 
been introduced, with the view to relieve the land from rain or sur- 
face water, as well as from springs, and generally so far as it has 
as yet been carried, with very great success. All cross or water fur- 
rows bid fair to be got entirely rid of, which have hitherto en- 
tailed a constant expense in clearing out, on the occupiers of all 
clay land farms. These drains are always made in the furrows be- 
tween the ridges commonly in every alternate furrovi, and as the 
ridges are often about eighteen feet wide, it gives a drain in every 
thirty- six feet. The drains are, for the most part, nearly two feet 
deep, and where the subsoil is of soft material, flats are used along 
with the curved covering tiles. The expense runs from L. 4 to 
L. 5 per acre when the drains are in alternate furrows; it is, there- 
fore, a serious matter to drain an extensive fiirm. Yet such are 
the immense advantages on all lands with a retentive subsoil, that

GENEUAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



some farmers have begun draining in every furrow, when the 
above-mentioned expenses are of course doubled. The landlords, 
at the same time, in many cases, are liberally bearing a share of the 
burden. New tile-works are being erected on all the clay-fields, 
formerly noticed to supply the yearly increasing demand for these 
tiles. 

Statute labour or road money is the only public burden that is 
everywhere levied on all the occupiers of the soil, whether land- 
lord or tenant, and is applied to the maintenance of both parish 
and turnpike roads, — the former in many cases being now made 
turnpike. The amount paid by each individual is regulated by 
the ploughgates of land he occupies. The term, as originally used, 
was rather indefinite, but meant the extent of land that a plough 
was understood to be able to cultivate properly throughout the 
year. In 1833, however, a new Act of Parliament was obtained 
for regulating the management of the roads, when, by a general 
arrangement with the Justices of the Peace, it was understood that 
sixty Scotch acres, nearly on an average, should be taken as the 
ploughgate; and, according to that scale, the road money has 
since been levied in the different parishes, commonly at the rate 
of L. '2 the ploughgate. The number of ploughgates was then 
found to be 1344, which gives L. 2688 Sterling, as the sum an- 
nually expended in maintaining the roads, besides what is derived 
from the toll-bars, now so common in almost every direction. The 
entire arable land of the county was also found to be 82,184 acres 
Scotch measure, or very nearly so, exclusive of plantations extend- 
ing to nearly 7500 acres.  There are besides about 2000 acres 
not arable, of sandy soil or links along the sea shore, generally 
occupied as rabbit warrens, and of which nearly one-half of that 
extent at Gullane is the only common worth noticing in the dis- 
trict. The Lammermuir-hills in this county are computed to con- 
tain 20,000 acres. 

There are 386 separate farms of from 60 acres and upwards, 
the average size being something near to 250 acres. Each farm 
has a thrashing machine, of which about 80 are driven by steam, 7 
by wind, 30 by water, and the rest by horses. About 40 of these 
farms are in the natural possession of the proprietors, being mostly 
in pasture ; the others are all let to tenants on leases of from nine- 
teen to twenty- one years. Rents are commonly paid by grain, 
generally wheat, the price being regulated by the annual fiars of 
the county. Seven bushels of wheat per Scotch acre may be

considered as something like the average rent of the wheat lands 
of the district. The valued rent of the county is L. 168,878, 5s. 
lOd. Scotch, and the real rent, valuing the wheat at L. 1, 6s. per 
boll, will be found very near the same sum in Sterling money. 
The gross annual produce per acre over the arable land is. 
nearly L. 6 Sterling, or for the whole county L. 493,104, which 
the annual cost of stock, viz. sheep and wool from the Lammer- 
muir-hills, will raise to about half a million Sterling.

Roads. — In 1750 the first turnpike bill for Scotland was an act 
of Parliament obtained by the land proprietors of this county, for 
repairing the great post road from Dunglass to Ravenshaugh. 
But long after that period, a single mile of continuous hard road 
was scarcely anywhere else to be seen in the district. Travellirtg 
in carriages was consequently tedious even in summer, and in 
winter it was almost out of the question. Riding on horseback 
was therefore common, and when ladies left home they were ge- 
nerally mounted behind a servant on a pad, an article of furniture 
then to be found in the possession of every family who had a horse 
to ride on. Grain was then also carried to market on horseback, 
even to the distance of Edinburgh. Coals were brought home in 
summer by carts of a very frail construction, with hardly a bit of 
iron about them, the axletree being of wood, and the wheels slightly 
shod with iron in place of being ringed as at present. On farms 
of the larger size, there were carriages of higher pretensions, and 
dignified with the name of icai7i. When the roads became pass- 
able in spring or summer, the clumsy machine used to be put in 
motion, and drawn by four oxen and two horses, and conducted by 
the hind and his goadman, it would transport loads of from 42 
to 48 bushels of oats or barley, to the great self-satisfaction and 
importance of the individual intrusted with so weighty a charge. 
After the accession of his late Majesty George III. greater atten- 
tion began to be paid to the internal improvement of the county, 
and numerous acts of Parliament for improving and managing the 
public roads have since been obtained, and vast sums expended in 
constructing and repairing them in every corner of the county, and 
now a man with a single horse and cart, can easily transport the 
above-mentioned quantities of grain to wherever it may be found 
necessary. The turnpike and parish roads of the county extend 
to 350 miles or thereby.

GENERAL OIJSK UVATIONS ON TIIH 



Moile of Occiqmncy, Cropping, Sj-c. — Long after the middle of 
last century, almost the whole county was open field, with much 
of the lands rundale, and divided field about amongst its numerous 
tenantry. These frequently resided together in a cluster of mean 
houses, dignified by the name of town, and were any thing but 
conveniently situated for the profitable management of their re- 
spective possessions. Summer-fallowing was then rarely thought 
of, and turnips and sown-grasses were hardly even known. It was 
then a common employment for the farm-servants, in the summer 
afternoons, to gather thistles from among the corn, or wherever 
else they could be found, to feed their work-horses during the 
night, these being the only green food the animals ever tasted while 
in the stable. And after harvest, when the crop was secured in the 
stack, and the barn-yard slap built up, the horses after their day's 
work were turned out during the night to the fields, to seek such 
provision as nature provided. That season was called lo7ig halter 
time, and the poor animals, unless detained by some spot more 
than ordinarily overrun with couch and other root weeds, were of- 
ten to seek far enough from home in the mornings. Now the 
whole county is inclosed, and every farm has within itself its own 
farm-house and offices. Summer-fallow annually occupies at 
least on the heavy soils, about one-sixth of the arable land, and 
sown grass and turnips are everywhere far more than sufficient for 
the working stock necessary on every farm ; and all these im- 
portant and beneficial changes have been introduced within almost 
the lifetime of a single generation. 

Tenantry and Labourers. — Indolence and want of enterprise 
marked the character of the tenantry of the county up even to 
the middle of the last century. Alike destitute of the knowledge 
of agricultural improvement and the means of carrying it into ef- 
fect, they jogged on in the beaten track, perfectly satisfied with 
the system they pursued, and with the comforts it affijrded them. 
As proof of this it may be mentioned, that so late as in 1772, a 
farm in the northern angle of the county had been deserted by its 
new tenant, after he had merely ploughed his patch of fallow in 
the spring, when it lay without a tenant from the Whitsunday till 
after the harvest, although it was frankly offered on lease at L.l, 6s. 
per Scotch acre. The land, too, was naturally of very superior 
quality, and without any particular expenditure since in improve- 
ment, has been long let at nearly three bolls of wheat per acre. 
Farm-servants were then but poorly paid and scantily fed, and

with the feeble cattle and ineffectual implements of husbandry, 
were ill fitted, in any portion of time, to perform a reasonable 
amount of labour. Lord Kaimes, when writing about the imple- 
ments of husbandry then used, says of the harrows, " they were 
better fitted to raise laughter than to raise mould" and every 
thing else was of a piece." And so feeble were the cattle, that 
when making the barley-seed, a serious matter in those days, it 
was necessary the labour should be performed early in the morn- 
ing, and late in the evenings, when the sun's rays were compara- 
tively weak, otherwise the starved animals were unable to crawl. 
A married ploughman was paid in the produce of the farm, the 
same as at present, but he received 24 bushels less of oats than is 
given now : besides, the grain was fully ]0 per cent, inferior to the 
produce of the present time, and the cow, from the want of sown- 
grass, was often scarcely worth the milking, and, still more, po- 
tatoes were then hardly known. The consequences were, that the 
poor hind was miserably fed, poorly clad, feeble, and particularly 
liable to sickness. At that period, regularly in the spring, in 
every hamlet and village, the ague made its appearance in almost 
every family, and there can hardly be a doubt of that sickness hav- 
ing often been the natural effects of poverty and filth, more than 
any thing else. It is a singular fact, that, since the time that po- 
tatoes were at the command of the children in the labourer's fa- 
mily, the ague has not so much as even been known among them. 

With respect to smuggling and poaching offences, when in- 
dulged, always pernicious to the happiness of a rural population, 
the conduct of the people of the period under consideration, stands 
directly opposite to that of the present inhabitants. At that time 
poaching was utterly unknown, and simply because nobody then 
thought of preserving game, and every man shot or hunted as he 
thought proper. Pheasant preserves had not then been introduced 
to tenant the jails, and swell the criminal calendar of the kingdom. 
On the other hand, smuggling was exceedingly common, and as 
yet, wherever it is followed, was greatly pernicious to the best in- 
terests of the community. At that time, the entire sea-coast from 
Berwickshire to near Prestonpans, was occupied by one connected 
line of smugglers, and all intimately acquainted with each other. 
The articles dealt in were chiefly French wines and brandy, and 
even the respectable families of the district were regularly supplied 
with what of these commodities they required, by the contraband 



378

trader alone.  Whiskey was then scarcely known, tiie farmers 
and working classes generally using malt liquors, and who, for the 
trifling duty then levied on the article, were ever ready and eager to 
undergo the trouble, and incur the risk of cheating the ganger. 
But the exciseman and the union with England were considered part 
and parcel of the same concern, and were consequently alike hateful 
for a long time to the people of all classes ; and although that feeling 
had gradually softened, it was not altogether subdued till about the 
time of the American war, which interrupted the communication 
with France, and at the same time, furnished a new topic of in- 
terest, of the most deeply exciting description, to almost every fa- 
mily in the country. At the present day, and for a considerable 
time past, smuggling is little more than known merely by name, 
and there is probably no corner in the kingdom where the people 
in general are more disposed to respect the magistrate, and obey 
the laws, than the rural population of this county. 

Ecclesiastical Sifoe.— Christianity is understood to have been 
introduced into the county, at least so early as the sixth century, 
and ample provision made for its support, according to the notions 
of the times, at a very early period. History notices particularly 
the endowment of different extensive religious establishments; and 
the names of places, and the massive ruins still to be met with, 
testify to the piety of its ancient population. Since the Reforma- 
tion, the county has been divided into twenty-four parishes. Had- 
dington alone is a collegiate charge. 

Parish ministers, besides their spiritual duties, have also, with 
the assistance of their sessions, the important interests of the poor 
of their respective parishes to look after ; and from the chairman 
of the session, viz. the minister, being alike independent of those 
who contribute, and those who receive parochial aid, and the ser- 
vices of the session as a body, being entirely gratuitous, they are 
peculiarly well fitted for the discharge of the duty intrusted to 
them. It is to be understood at the same time, that, wherever 
legal assessments are raised for the poor, it is more peculiarly the 
duty of the session to say who are fitting objects to be put on the 
roll, when the heritors of the respective parishes attend to the rais- 
ing of the money.

pauperism in the county, which is too often to be traced to ignorance 
and profligacy united. Every circumstance, therefore, thathas a ten- 
dency to degrade the taste and habits of the woricing classes, neces- 
sarily paves the road to immorality, and ought, therefore, to be se- 
dulously guarded against, as far as practicable, by every wellwisher 
of his country. The state of the cottages of the district is, under 
that impression, well deserving of consideration. These cottages 
generally consist of only one apartment, where all the members of 
the family live and sleep without regard to either age or sex. In 
cases where the family are grown up to men and women, such a 
condition must be any thing but favourable to that delicacy of 
feeling, especially among the females, so essential to sound mo- 
rality; and when sickness happens, the want of fresh air, from the 
small window being frequently incapable of opening, renders the 
narrow crowded apartment alike pernicious to both the moral and 
physical welfare of the inmates. A man or woman accustomed 
to such misery can have no great apprehensions about pauperism, 
and, consequently, such people have generally little hesitation in 
throwing themselves on their respective parishes. Were it for no 
other cause, the owners of landed property would find it no loss 
in the end, to be at the expense of providing better accommoda- 
tion for their labourers, than in too many instances that class of 
the community are found in possession of. It is painful to see the 
industrious labourer confined to the same miserable hut that shel- 
tered its ragged inmates of former generations. It is to be hoped, 
however, that the cottages of the hinds and labourers of East Lo- 
thian will not much longer remain the solitary exception to that 
enlightened improvement that has so fortunately marked the pro- 
gress of events in every corner of the country, during the last half 
century. Friendly societies are frequently to be found among 
the labourers ; and such institutions, that teach them to trust to 
their own resources, are highly deserving of every encouragement. 

A complete change, as may be seen from the tenor of the pa- 
rochial Reports, has taken place gradually in the public senti- 
ment, with regard to being put on the parish poor roll.

Total convictions, 183G, 189. Do. 1835, 193. 

The number of individuals annually convicted of offences by the 
civil authorities, as shewn by the above table, is greatly beyond what 
the people generally have any idea of, the offenders being nearly 
as one in every hundred of the whole inhabitants. Fortunately, 
however, a considerable proportion of these offences have been of 
a minor character, such as furious driving, leaving carts, and graz- 
ing cattle on road sides. A few years since, the people of the coun- 
try were much annoyed by numerous bands of gipsies and Irish, 
with too many of the characteristics and propensities of gipsies, 
who were to be found encamped during great part of the year in 
almost every retired road and lane in the county, and, being tole- 
rated for a time, their numbers increased with a rapidity almost in- 
conceivable. Such hordes were literally nurseries of thieves. Very 
soon, however, after the evil became obvious, a most efficient 
remedy was provided by the appointment of the present superin- 
tendant of police.

It will be seen that the annual income of the different parishes 
exceeds the amount paid to their respective paupers, the salaries 
of session-clerk, precentor, &amp;c. being always paid from the same 
funds. Infirm and aged people frequently leave the country and 
settle in the towns, which may account in part for the greater pro- 
portional number of paupers in some parishes than in others. 
Every parish is also occasionally subject to an extra expense aris- 
ing from the maintenance of imbecile or fatuous persons, which 
likewise may account for the difference observable in the expendi- 
ture of several of the parishes,

Schaio's Hospital. — Since the date of the former Statistical Ac- 
count, in which all that, in so far as I know, is important re- 
specting the origin and objects of Schaw's Hospital, is admirably 
narrated, a new house, of considerable exterior elegance, and very 
superior internal accommodation, has been erected. The boys have, 
at no period since the commencement of the institution, been under 
better control, or enjoyed more real comfort than at the present 
time. The duties of the governor and house-keeper are perform- 
ed with the most praiseworthy fidelity and prudence. The hospi- 
tal, with its grounds, which are kept with care and taste, form a 
very attractive feature in the scenery of the parish. The Institu- 
tion is under the superintendence of ] 9 trustees. 24 boys are ad- 
missible : and the trustees are authorized to bind them as appren- 
tices, or do according to their wisdom, for their benefit, on their 
leaving the Institution.

PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALK. 

THE REV. PETER COSENS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries. — It cannot be doubted that the town of 
Lauder gave its name to the parish, and that the town derived its 
■name from that of the river, near to which it is situated. This is, 
indeed, now, and has long been, called Leader water ; but since it 
is termed Lauder by Camden in his Britannia, and the vale through 
which it flows has, from time immemorial, been termed Lauder- 
dale, its more ancient, and, probably, its original name was Lauder. 
The etymology of Leader, or Lauder, is traced by certain antiqua- 
ries to Laitdur, a Celtic word, denoting the lesser river, or the river 
lohich breaks forth. And, accordingly, the Leader, though it be a 
comparatively small stream, swelled, as it occasionally is, by tor- 
rents from the neighbouring hills, rises rapidly, bursts its banks, and 
floods its fertile haughs. 

In }Xint of area, the parish of Lauder seems to be the largest 
in Berwickshire. The distance between its northern and southern 
confines is not less than 13 miles. This, however, is somewhat 
more than its absolute length ; for toward the south it is complete- 
ly intersected to the extent of H mile, by an angular part of the 
lands of Blainslie, which belong to the parish of Melrose, and the 
county of Roxburgh. Its entire length, then, is 11 miles. Its 
greatest breadth is 8 or 9 miles, and its medium breadth about 5, 
so that its extent is nearly 58 square miles. On the north and 
north-west it is bounded by Giffbrd and Channelkirk; on the west 
and south-west by Stow and Melrose ; on the south and south- 
east by Melrose, Earlston, and Legerwood; and on the east and 
north-east by Westruther, Longformacus, and Cranshaws. 

Topofj7'aphical Appearances. — The parish is of an irregular oblong 
figure. Two-thirds of it are moorish and hilly. Its northern limits, 
for several miles, are formed by the Lammermoor hills, one of which, 
called Lammerlaw, the highest in the parish, is about 1500 foct

above the level of the sea. Connected with those of Lammermoor, 
and extending in a south-east direction on each side of the Leader, 
are ranges of hills of a moderate height, to the summits of which 
cultivation has been pushed, and in which there are various open- 
ings to the east and the west. Between the ranges lies Leader 
vale, varying from one to two miles in width, and in which is to be 
found the best land in the parish. 

Meteorology. — In the spring months, and sometimes in May, 
the prevailing winds are from the east, and are for the most part 
attended with drought and cold weather. During the rest of the 
year they blow more frequently from the south and south-west. 
In a dry summer it has often been observed, that the clouds, af- 
ter collecting apparently above the higher districts of IVeed or 
Ettrick, are attracted by the Lammermoor hills on the north, or 
the Cheviot on the south, and diffuse their refreshing showers on 
either of these places, leaving the intermediate regions, especially 
in the lower parts of the parish, in a parched state. The climate, 
though variable, is, on the whole, salubrious. To its influence no 
epidemical disorders can be traced. Agues and consumptive com- 
plaints were at one time rather prevalent, but the former have 
long ago disappeared, and the latter are now very circumscribed 
in their ravages. 

Hydrography. — The parish is generally well supplied with pe- 
rennial springs of excellent water, some of which issue from whin- 
stone rock, and others from sand or gravel. The principal river 
is the Leader, which has its source in the junction of two rivulets 
descending from the hills of Lammermoor, about four miles above 
the town of Lauder. To the extent of nine or ten miles it winds 
its course through the parish, and about nine miles below Lauder 
it mingles its waters with the Tweed at Drygrange. It runs with 
considerable rapidity, and in a south-east direction, affording good 
sport to the angler. The localities on the banks of this stream 
have been celebrated in the old Scottish song of  Leader haughs 
and Yarrow."  

Geology. — On the rising grounds to the south-west of the Leader 
there is an inexhaustible supply of rock whinstone of very excellent 
quality, which is used for building, as well as for making the turn- 
pike roads, and is equally adapted for both these purposes. The 
soil is much diversified. In general that of the arable land is light 
and dry, peculiarly fitted for turnip husbandry ; a good deal of it

is inclined to clay, and there is also a considerable quantity of 
rich loam upon a gravelly or sandy bottom. 

Botany. — Till lately there were but few plantations in the pa- 
rish. The oldest is Egrop or Edgarhope wood, comprehending 
about 100 acres. It is situated on the side of a hill, in the upper 
part of which grow chiefly the larch and the Scottish fir, while 
towards the bottom it abounds with oak, elm, and ash. In the 
park at Thirlstane Castle there are some remarkably fine hard- 
wood trees of great dimensions. An elm, the largest in the park, 
measures in girth, at three feet from the ground, fifteen feet. 
These trees are probably 150 years old. On the estate of the 
Earl of Lauderdale various new plantations, covering several hun- 
dred acres, and designed with much taste, have been recently exe- 
cuted, and appear to be thriving admirably. At Chapel, too, 
in the southern part of the parish, there are ninety acres under 
wood, fir, ash, oak, and beech, to the growth of which, especially of 
the two last species, the soil in that quarter is most congenial. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — From the chartularies of monasteries, and 
the title-deeds of certain estates, it appears that, as a kirk town, 
Lauder is as ancient at least as the reign of David I. ; that it, with 
its lands on Leader water, was granted by that monarch to Sir 
Hugh Moreville, constable of Scotland ; that his territorial rights 
descended to a long succession of heirs, chiefly females, who in- 
troduced the Lords of Galloway and the Baliols ; and that, when 
for their political delinquencies these were deprived of their estates, 
Lauder and its territory became the property of Sir James Doug- 
las, and afterwards of the Earl of Angus. The lands of Thirlstane 
in the parish were granted by Sir Hugh Moreville to one of his 
friends, whose grand-daughter, the heiress of Thirlstane, married 
Sir Richard Mautaland or Maitiand, the ancestor of the present 
noble family of Maitiand, to which the greatest part of the parish 
now belongs. In former times, Lauderdale, which now forms one 
of the three large divisions of the county, was a separate Regality, 
or almost independent jurisdiction, under the name of a Bailiary. 

The town of Lauder is the only royal burgh in the county. Its 
original charter having been destroyed, it obtained from James IV., 
m 1502, a new charter, which was confirmed by an act of Parlia- 
ment dated the 28th June 1633. Lauder has also been the seat 
of the presbytery of the bounds since the year 1768, — the former 
seat, Earlston, being inconvenient for the accommodation of the

members. It must be well known to most readers of Scottish his- 
tory, that about the end of July 1482, when James III. and his 
army were encamped in the vicinity of Lauder, the nobles held in 
the old church their celebrated conferences, which terminated in 
the murder of six of the king's minions, whom they hanged over a 
bridge crossing the Leader, a little below Thirlstane castle. 

Maps, Sfc. — A map of Lauderdale was sketched in the reign of 
Charles 1. by Mr Timothy Pont, son of the famous Rev. Robert 
Pont, and is to be found in Blaeu's Atlas Scotiae. Since that pe- 
riod, surveys of the county, including Lauderdale, have been made 
by various respectable individuals. In a large map of Berwick- 
shire, surveyed in 1825 and 1826, and published by Thomas Sharp 
and Company, London, the boundaries of this parish, with its prin- 
cipal localities, seem to be distinctly and correctly delineated. 

Eminent Men. — Among various distinguished persons connect- 
ed with the parish by residence, may be reckoned Sir John Mait- 
land, Lord Thirlstane, who was successively Lord Privy Seal, Se- 
cretary of State, and Chancellor of Scotland, in the reign of James 
VI. As chancellor, he accompanied the King in his matrimonial 
excursion to Denmark, where he became intimately acquainted 
with the celebrated Tycho Brahe. He was a very able and up- 
right statesman, and, by the wise exercise of his high political and 
moral influence, he contributed, in no small degree, to promote the 
peace and prosperity of the National Church. In the end of the 
year 1595, when on his deathbed, he was visited by Andrew- 
Melville, along with his nephew, Bruce, one of the ministers of 
Edinburgh, and the conversation which he then held with them, 
was most satisfactory to his visitors. " The loss of this excellent 
statesman was quickly felt by the nation, and must be viewed as a 
principal means of bringing on the evils with which the church was 
soon after assailed." The King, too, extremely regretted his death, 
and honoured him with an epitaph of his own composition. 

It is not perhaps very generally known, that Mr James Guthrie, 
the first of our presbyterian ministers who suffered unto death after 
the Restoration for his intrepid adherence to the cause of truth, 
was for some time minister of this place. He was settled at Lau- 
der in 1638, appears to have been translated to Stirling in 1649, 
and was martyred at Edinburgh in 1661. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are the Earl of Lauder- 
dale, the Marquis of Tweeddale, Lord Maitland, Adnni Fairholmc, 



LAUDER. 



5 



Esq. of Chapel, Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden, Alexander Allan, 
Esq. of Muircleugh, and the community of Lauder. 

Parochial Registers. — Of the state of the parochial registers no 
satisfactory account can be given. The register narrating the pro- 
gress of discipline and church censures commenced in 1677, and 
was regularly continued till the 27th August 1688: then it has a 
chasm till April 1707, when it is again filled up for nearly two 
years, after which it exhibits another blank till May 1733, since 
which period the proceedings of the session are regularly recorded. 
The register of births and baptisms is equally defective, for in some 
years the entries are numerous, in some they are very few, and in 
others they are entirely omitted. This, though it now contain a 
complete list of the children baptised to members of the Established 
church, is still imperfect, in consequence of the general neglect or 
refusal of dissenters to insert in it the names of their children. 
Hitherto there has been no register of burials, but it is resolved 
that this shall be the case no longer. The register of marriages 
has been well kept for a considerable number of years. 

Antiquities. — Under this head is to be noticed a Roman road, 
the line of which has been distinctly traced through a considerable 
part of the parish, and is in various places still perceptible. It 
passes a little to the west of the town of Lauder, and proceeds 
towards the manse of Channelkirk. — Near this ancient road, on 
Lauder hill, are the remains of a military station, and about two 
miles north from this, on an elevated spot at Blackchester, are the 
vestiges of an oval camp, having one entrance on the east and 
another on the west, and fortified by two ditches and mounds of 
earth. — A camp of similar form and of larger dimensions is traced 
on Tollis or Tullius hill, in the northern extremity of the parish. 
Spanish, Scottish, and English coins have been dug up, some of 
which Dr Ford, the former minister, had in his possession, as well 
as several Roman coins inscribed with the names of Julius Caesar, 
Lucius Flaminius, and others. — Many tumuli are to be seen on 
Lauder moor, near the old road to Melrose, where battles had pro- 
bably been fought, as fragments of swords, bows, and arrows have 
there been found. The arrows were pointed with flint stone, ta- 
pering from the juncture, about an inch long. In the vicinity of 
Lauder, on the banks of the Leader, stands Thirlstane Castle, for- 
merly styled Lauder Fort. According to tradition, it was origi- 
nally erected by Edward I. during his invasion of Scotland ; cer- 
tain it is that it was built or rebuilt by Chancellor Maitland, and 



6 



BERWICKSIIIKE. 



subsequently improved by the Duke of Lauderdale. It is a spa- 
cious and massy edifice, having some stately apartments decorated 
in the best taste of the age of Charles II., and is surrounded by a 
park, which, being recently enlarged and beautified, is now much 
admired. 

In concluding these historical notices, the writer may here re- 
mark, that there is no reason whatever to suppose, as has been done 
by Dr Ford in his Statistics, that the church of Lauder was ori- 
ginally a chapel of ease attached to Channelkirk, and that it was 
not raised to the dignity of a church till the era of the Reforma- 
tion ; for, in the oldest records, it is represented as a separate 
church. In the ancient taxation it was valued at ninety merks, 
and that of Channelkirk only at forty. To this it may be added, 
that Lauder, as a mother church, had formerly two chapels of its 
own, — one at Kedslie, and another at St Leonards. 

III. — Population. 

Respecting the ancient state of the population of the parish, no 
information is to be obtained, on the accuracy of which dependence 
can be placed. It is supposed by some that the population in the 
country district was greater in the olden time than it is at present, 
as formerly the farms were comparatively small, and more hands 
were employed in cultivating them. Certain it is, that the births 
in the whole parish were, a century and a-half ago, more nume- 
rous than they are now. It appears from the register, that in 
1682, 1683, 1686, and 1687, the yearly average entries were 66, 
whereas now the average births exceed not 54. But since there 
is no register of deaths for these years, from the above statement 
no just inference in regard to the total population can be deduced. 
Considering the present more improved mode of living, and other 
circumstances which aflfect health and longevity, it may be pre- 
sumed that the population is now as large at least as it ever was 
in more ancient times. 

According to the census of 1821, the population was 1841, and 
in 1831, it was 2063. This increase of 222 may be caused in a 
great measure by the greater demand for labour, to aid in prose- 
cuting various agricultural improvements in the neighbourhood of 
Lauder, as well as in road-making. The population residing in 
the town of Lauder is 1075, and in the country, 988. The villages 
being small, and inhabited almost solely by farm-servants, the po- 
pulation of these is included in that of the country part of ho 
parish.

There are three persons fatuous, and one blind in the parish. 
During the last three years there have been nine or ten illegiti- 
mate births. 

Habits and Character of the People. — It may be affirmed of the 
people, on the whole, that they enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the 
comforts and advantages of society, and that they are contented 
with their situation ; as one indication of which it may be stated, 
that few families in the parish, — not more than four or five, — have, 
in recent times, emigrated from the land of their fathers. Their 
character is, no doubt, as in every other place, considerably diversi- 
fied, some being neither wise nor good ; but, in general, they are 
well informed, — orderly in their conduct, — and observant of the 
ordinances of religion. Poaching, though instances of it may be 
occasionally detected, is not prevalent; and smuggling does not 
seem to exist. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of imperial acres 
in the parish is 37,753. Of these 12,060 are either cultivated, or 
occasionally in tillage, and 25,043, never having been cultivated re- 
main waste, or in pasture. Several hundred acres might, with a pro- 
fitable application of capital, be added to the cultivated land, and 
afterwards kept in occasional tillage, or in permanent pasture ; but 
perhaps there is very little of the waste lands which would yield to 
the farmer a fair remuneration for their improvement during the 
currency of an ordinary lease. In a state of undivided common, 
there are 2381 acres, of which 686, in the higher grounds of Lam- 
mermoor, are the joint property of the Marquis of Tweeddale and 
the Earl of Lauderdale, and are depastured by the sheep of their 
tenants; and 1695, outfield land, belong to the corporation of Lau- 



8 



BERWICKSIIIUE. 



tier. The number of acres ujider wood little of which is natural 
is 650. 

The trees commonly planted are Scotch and spruce firs, larch, 
oak, ash, beech, elm, birch, poplar, and willow. In the same plan- 
tation there is a mixture of trees, which are planted thick, for the 
purpose of alFording shelter as they grow up. They are in general 
regularly and carefully pruned and thinned ; and from time to time 
numbers of them are cut for forming paling, roofing houses, or 
making implements of husbandry. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of arable land varies from L. 3 to 5s. 
per acre; the average of the whole may be 16s. The average 
rent of grazing a cow or full-grown ox in summer is L. 3, and of 
foddering it in winter, L. 1 ; and that of grazing for the year a 
sheep is, for the black-faced, 5s., for the Cheviot, 8s. and for the 
Leicester, 18s. Of grazing the three breeds overhead, 8s. may be 
stated as a fair average rent. 

Rate of Wages. — Hinds, who form the most numerous class of 
farm-servants, and who are engaged for the year, are generally paid 
in money, oatmeal, barley, a cow's-keep, potatoes planted, and 
several small perquisites, all of which may be fairly computed at 
9s. per week, or L. 23, 8s. per year. Each hind is bound to keep 
a woman servant called a hondager, to work at hay, turnips, &amp;c. 
during the summer half year, at lOd. per day, without board. 
Single men-servants receive in the half year from L. 4, 4s. to 
L. 5, 5s. with board; women from L.4, 4s. to L. 5, 5s. in summer, 
and in winter, from L. 1, 12s. to L. 2, 2s. with board and washing ; 
common day labourers 9s. in winter, and 10s. in summer, per week, 
in hay and corn harvest, about the same wages, with the addition of 
board. Masons and carpenters get at the rate of 12s. per week, 
Avith victuals. Blacksmith work is generally done by contract, at 
L. 3 per annum for each pair of horses, including, besides shoeing 
the horses, all repairs on the ploughs, excepting the cast metal 
used, harrows, grapes, forks, &amp;c. 

Breeds of Live-Siock. — The sheep most generally kept are of 
the Cheviot breed. On two or three of the highest farms the black- 
faced are kept, and numbers of the Leicester kind are depastured 
on the lower improved lands. Sheep of the last kind rising one 
year old receive turnips from three to five months, in winter and 
spring; the ewes receive turnips three or four weeks before they be- 
gin to lamb, after which they ai-e put on the young grasses. In some 
instances, the Cheviot and the black-faced ewes are put to Leices- 



LAUDER.

ter tups, and their produce is sold in lambs, but the cross thus ob- 
tained is never used for breeding. 

Of cattle, the common breed is the short-horned or Teeswater. 
It is thought by some intelligent farmers, that, if a smallerreed 
of cows were kept, such as the Kyloe, or some of the other north- 
ern varieties, and a good Teeswater bull, this cross would pay bet- 
ter, as a greater number of cows could be kept, and of calves rear- 
ed, which would more than compensate for the larger size, and the 
superior prices of the others. The young cattle in winter and 
spring receive turnips from four to five months, along with straw, 
those rising three years are put on turnips in the middle of Oc- 
tober, are fed from three to six months, and sold fat, to go to the 
market of Edinburgh or Morpeth. Such of the farmers but they 
are not many as do not rear so many as they require for their 
grass and turnips, buy for that purpose the Angus and West- 
Highland cattle, in nearly equal proportions. 

Husbandry. — The general character of the husbandry pursued 
is not inferior to that of the husbandry of any part of the country. 
The outfield arable lands are, for the most part, allowed to remain 
two or three years in grass, when they are taken up for a crop of 
oats, succeeded by plain fallow or turnips, with manure ; the third 
year they are cropped with oats or barley, with which perennial 
grass seeds are sown, after which they are subjected to a similar 
rotation of management. The infield lands are not seldom crop- 
ped in the four-\nh rotations, oats, turnips, barley, grass, a 
system which, although it be not the best, necessity obliges the 
farmers to adopt. The greater part of the land being light soil, well 
adapted for turnip culture, large quantities of that valuable root 
are raised annually, of which one-half is white, and the other half 
yellow, and ruta baga. The husbandry would doubtless be im- 
proved by keeping the arable lands longer under pasturage, and 
by consuming more of the turnips upon the ground by sheep ; to 
which, however, the climate and want of shelter in many places 
operate as hindrances. 

Most of the land susceptible of aration has been reclaimed by 
draining, — by frequent ploughing and harrowing, — and by liming 
at the rate of ten single horse carts per acre. The arable land in 
'Various parts of the parish still needs to be more thoroughly drain- 
ed. On the farms where Cheviot sheep are kept, the wet grounds 
have been much improved by small surface drains, fifteen inches 
wide, and nine inches deep, which cost one penny for six lineal

yards. Irricjahon, though it be here unknown, might be advanta- 
geously practised on several spots. Emhankmg is nearly confined 
to he policy grounds of Thirlstane Castle, but it would be de- 
sirable that this improvement should be extended along the whole 
course of the Leader, as from the circuitous course of the river 
and the gravelly nature of the subsoil, considerable damage is oc- 
casionally done to the best lands in the parish. 
wJ' "ration of leases is almost universally nineteen years 
When the farm requires to be limed all over, and much of it to 
be drained, it might be expedient that this period should be ex- 
tended to twenty-five years, to allow the tenant sufficient time to 
reap the full benefit of his outlay. 

The farm-buildings are, on the whole, good, and so also are the 
enclosures. Great and striking improvements, by draining, liming, 
and enclosing, have recently been made in the parish by various 
individuals, and, m particular, on the farms of Woodhead and 
Wyndhead,— the former occupied by the noble proprietor, the 
Jiarl of Lauderdale, and the latter by his son. Sir Anthony Mait- 
land, on both of which farms every species of improvement is ra- 
pidly advancing to the limits of perfection. On these farms, as 
well as on one lately let, belonging to the Marquis of Tweeddale, 
superior office-houses have been erected, and the latter and Sir 
Anthony's have steam thrashing-machines, being the only machines 
of the description in this district of the county. 

There is still a considerable quantity of arable land unenclosed. 
This may be owing to the unsuitableness of the soil for growing 
thorns in some places, and to the want of building materials in 
others ; but now that whins or furze have been tried, and found to 
be no bad substitute for these, it is hoped that this defect will be 
speedily remedied. 

Produce.— As nearly as the writer has been able to ascertain, 
the average gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish is as 
follows : 

Ofgrain of all kinds, , . _ L. 14,082 0 0

nearly correct estimate of the raw produce raised in a parish of such great extent, 
and farmed by so many individuals. It is probable that the total value of the pro- 
duce IS greater than what is exliiblted in the above statement.

LAUDER.

Lauderdale Agricidtural Society, having for its object the improve- 
ment of the different breeds of stock, and improvements and dis- 
coveries in agriculture, in regard to tillage and the management of 
grass lands, as well as in all other matters connected with rural 
affairs, was established in 1830. The Earl of Lauderdale is pa- 
tron of the society, and its funds are supported by his Lordship's 
very liberal subscription, and by the subscriptions of all the land- 
holders, and most of the tenants, in the district. The funds, 
amounting to nearly L. 100, have been annually expended in pre- 
miums, awarded for the best specimen of breeding stock from any 
quarter. At the half-yearly meetings much excellent stock has 
been exhibited. The society is obviously fitted to exert a most 
beneficial influence on the improvement of the district. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Toion. — The only town in the parish is Lauder, which is also 
a maiiet-town. It has little or no trade, most of its inhabitants 
being small retailers, mechanics, day-labourers, or agriculturists. 
The police of the town is chiefly under the superintendence of the 
magistrates, who appoint a fiscal for the burgh, and occasionally 
hold bailie-courts for the determination of small debt cases, petty 
offences, &amp;c. Formerly small debt courts were held monthly by 
the justices of the peace, but these are not now so regularly con- 
tinued, especially since the Sheriff small debt court came into ope- 
ration. In the course of last summer 1833 several public-spi- 
rited individuals combined to establish in Lauder a iceekly market 
for corn, in order to accommodate the people in the district, and 
hitherto the scheme has met with some encouragement, but, as it 
is yet in its infancy, it would be premature to speak confidently of 
its ultimate success. The market-towns nearest to Lauder are, 
Kelso, distant seventeen, and Dalkeith, distant nineteen miles, to 
the last of which the farmers have been long accustomed to carry 
their corn, and from the neighbourhood of which they bring home 
lime and coal. 

Means of Communication. — Very ample means of communica- 
tion are enjoyed by the parish. It has a post-office in the town, 
and a daily mail, brought by the curricle which runs through Lau- 
derdale between Edinburgh and London. It has two turnpike 
roads ; the one on the east side of Leader, six miles long in the 
parish, leading by Whitburn Inn to Greenlaw, Dunse, and Ber- 
wick, as well as to Coldstream and Kelso, and the other on the 
west side of the river, eight miles long in the parish, leading to 



12 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



Melrose, to Jedburgh, and to Kelso by Earlston. On these roads 
travel five public carriages, which pass through Lauderdale, and 
four of them through Lauder, every lawful day to and from Edin- 
burgh, Dunse, Kelso, Newcastle, &amp;c. The two principal bridges 
cross the Leader, the one in the upper part of the parish, and the 
other a little to the east of Lauder. These, as well as the smaller 
bridges and the fences, are kept in good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church, which formerly stood 
on the north of the town, fronting Thirlstane Castle, is now si- 
tuated close to the town on- its south-west side. Its distance is 
eight miles from the northern extremity of the parish, and five 
from the southern extremity. It could not be more conveniently 
situated, as upwards of half the population reside in the town, 
while few of the people in the country have to travel to it more 
than three or four miles. It was built in the year 1673. Since 
that period it has undergone frequent repairs, the last of which 
was in 1820 ; and though from its form, which is that of a cross, 
it is found to be somewhat incommodious, especially during the 
celebration in it of the Lord's Supper, it is on the whole substan- 
tial and tolerably well fitted up. It needs much to be heated, by 
means of stoves, in winter. It can conveniently hold 850 persons. 
No free sittings in it are appropriated to the poor ; but all of this 
description who are willing to attend may be and are gratuitous- 
ly accommodated. A handsome benefaction of four silver com- 
munion cups, and of two massy silver flagons, was granted to the 
church in 1677 by the noble family of Lauderdale. 

The present manse was built in 1812. Of the glebe the extent is 
about nine acres, and the yearly value, now that it has been enclosed 
and much improved by the incumbent, may be L. 18. The sti- 
pend, as modified in 1816, is 17 chalders, one-half of which is 
oatmeal, the other half barley, payable by the highest fiars of the 
county. When it was afterwards localled, in consequence of the 
surrender of their teinds by the burgesses of Lauder and others, 
it was fixed at L. 67, lis. 9d. Sterling, and 217 bolls, half meal 
and half barley, 3 bolls of oats, and 2 of bear. The stipend of last 
year 1832 exclusive of L. 10 for communion elements, was pre- 
cisely L. 246, 3s. 4|d. 

In the parish there were formerly two dissenting chapels, Anti- 
burgher and Burgher, which, in 1824, were merged into one, in con- 
nection with the United Associate Synod. Its minister is paid from 
the seat rents and from Sabbath collections, the rent also ol" a small

croft of land, and the interest of L. 100, both these being ]er- 
quisites bequeathed by friends to the chapel. The amount of his 
stipend is L. 100, with a house and garden. The number of fa- 
miUes in connection with the Established church is 318, and of 
persons of all ages connected with it, 1543. The dissenting cha- 
pel is frequented by persons from the neighbouring parishes of 
Westruther, Legerwood, Melrose, and Channelkirk, as well as 
from that of Lauder. It is seated to hold 400 people, and it is 
stated that 370 of the seats in it are let. In this parish the dis- 
senters of all ages form about one-fourth of the total population. 
At the Established church, and at the chapel, divine service is ge - 
nerally, when the weather is favourable, well attended. The num- 
ber of communicants at the Established church is about 650. 

Religious Society. — In the parish a Bible and Missionary society 
was established in 1815, which, till 1832, contributed at an ave- 
rage yearly the sum of L. 17. Collections have also been made 
from time to time in the church in aid of the Scottish Missionary 
Society, and of the General Assembly's schools and Indian mis- 
sion, which collections last year amounted to L. 15, Os. 6d. It is 
proposed, agreeably to a recommendation of the presbytery of 
Lauder, that the General Assembly's educational and missionary 
schemes shall henceforth be supported by regular yearly collec- 
tions in the church, or by a parochial association, or by both these 
combined. 

Education. — In the parish there are four schools, all in the town 
of Lauder ; one parochial, and three unendowed. The branches 
of instruction generally taught in tico of these are, English read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, geography, practical mathematics, Latin, 
French, and Greek. The other two schools, which are superin- 
tended by ladies, are attended chiefly by girls, who, in addition to 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, are taught also sewing. The 
Bible is read frequently in each of the schools, and the shorter 
catechism, psalms, and hymns are repeated, and occasionally ex- 
plained. The parochial schoolmaster has the medium salary L.30, 
andL.5 yearly given him by the magistrates of Lauder from the funds 
of the burgh, for teaching poor children. The other teachers are 
supported solely by the school fees, which, as well as the fees ex- 
acted by the parochial teacher, are, for reading, 2s. 6d. ; for read- 
ing and writing, 3s. 6d. ; for these, with arithmetic and practical  
mathmetics, 4s. 6d. ; and for the higher branches, 6s. per quarter. 
The general expense of education for the year, including the price 



14 



BERWICKSriIHK. 



of books, and of paper and other incidental payments, is, for read- 
ing, 13s. ; for writing and reading, 18s. ; for these, with arithme- 
tic, L. 1, 6s.; for Latin, Greek, and French, L. 1, 12s. The pa- 
rochial teacher has rather more than the legal house accommoda- 
tion, and somewhat less than the legal extent of garden ground. 

Of the young betwixt six and Jifteen years of age who cannot 
read or write, there are probably noie, and of persons above fifteen 
years of age who cannot read, there is reason to believe that there 
are not more than tico aged females, whilst amongst those who 
are advanced in life there is doubtless a number, though compa- 
ratively small, who cannot write. The people in general are ahve 
to the benefits of education, and evince that they appreciate these 
by sending their children to school at five or six years of age, and 
endeavouring to secure their attendance till they may acquire that 
usefuUearning which is necessary to fit them for discharging the 
duties of life, with credit to themselves, and advantage to society. 
At our parochial school were trained the present minister of Jed- 
burgh, the minister of Hope Park Chapel, the Rev. John Wilson, 
an ordained minister of the Established church, and an intelligent, 
indefatigable, and useful missionary, now labouring at Bombav, 
under the direction of the Scottish Missionary Society, a promis- 
ing young man about to receive Hcense to preach the gospel, and 
a minister of the United Associate Synod. 

In those parts of the parish which are at a considerable distance 
from the town ofXauder, parents find it more convenient to send 
their children to the parochial school of Channelkirk, to a private 
school at Spottiswoode, in the parish of Westruther, or to another 
of the same description at Blainslie, in the parish of Melrose. 
About 50 of our children are educated at these seminaries, to two 
of which those of them who attend have to travel from 2 to 2 
miles. An additional school, taught at a hamlet in the country 
district of the parish, would doubtless be advantageous. The 
average number of children in the whole parish attending school 
is about 300. Respecting the salutary influence of education 
there can be only one opinion ; and, since the means of this are 
here abundantly enjoyed, so they appear to be producing in a 
greater or less degree their usual beneficial effects on the moral 
habits and general welfare of the people. 

Library. — A subscription library has long existed in Lauder, in 
which the principal persons in the parish have shares. There is also 
one more recently formed for mechanics, together with two libraries 



LAUDEH. 



15 



furnished chiefly with rehgious books, which are lent to the young 
cattending the Sabbath evening schools, of which there are two, 
as well as to persons more advanced in age. 

Friendly Society. — A friendly society had been in the parish 
many years previous to 1814, when, in consequence of the ex- 
penses incurred by a litigation with one of its members, its funds 
were wasted, and the society dissolved. Another, the Brotherly 
Society of Free Masons, formed in 1772, still exists, having at pre- 
sent 82 brethren, and to such of them as are in distress, not ob- 
viously occasioned by their own immoral conduct, it affords season- 
able pecuniary relief. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons at pre- 
sent receiving regular parochial relief is 22 ; of these, one, who 
is fatuous, receives 4s. per week ; one, old and feeble, 3s. 6d. ; and 
another, with a young family, also 3s. 6d. ; these sums being the 
highest weekly allowances given to any of our paupers. The 
remaining 19 get from Is. 3d. to 2s. Including the three who re- 
ceive the highest sums, each pauper receives at an average per 
week about 2s. Id., or per year, L. 5, 8s. 4d., so that the whole of 
the enrolled poor receive at the rate of L. 1 1 9, 3s. 4d. in the year. 
This expenditure is met by an assessment laid upon the heritors, 
who hold a meeting along with the minister and elders every half 
year, for the purpose of adjusting the roll and fixing the requisite 
supplies. The present annual assessment is L. 150, of which L.30 
are expended in the payment of house rent to several persons not 
yet taken on the roll, and of salary to the heritors' clerk, who col- 
lects the money and distributes it monthly. The church collec- 
tions in 1832 L.39, 17s., and the money derived from the use of 
mortcloths, L. 9, 5s. ; from use of a hearse, L. 6 ; and from the in- 
terest of L. 100, mortified by the Rev. James Lindsay, a former 
minister of the parish, L.4, amounting in all to L.59, 2s., are con- 
fided by the heritors to the sole disposal of the members of the 
session. From that sum they give to their clerk who also provides 
a precentor L. 5 yearly; to the beadle, L.2; to the presbytery and 
synod clerks, and to the presbytery officer, L. 1. Of the balance, 
L. 51, 2s., they give at each of the half yearly meetings about L.16 
in donations, varying from 5s. to 12s., to a considerable number of 
persons verging towards pauperism, and a part of it they allot from 
time to time to the relief of such of the poor as may be in want, 
occasioned by the pressure of personal or domestic affliction. From 
their funds they also defray the expense connected with the burial 



16

of paupers, and sometimes aid poor strangers who are overtaken 
with calamity in travelHng from one place to another. It is an ob- 
ject steadily kept in view by the managers of our poor, to keep 
down as much as they can the legal assessment : and their efforts 
have not been altogether unsuccessful. The assessment is indeed 
still considerable, but at no distant period it was larger ; for a num- 
ber of years it has been pretty stationary, and although there be 
some who feel not the least delicacy in demanding such support as 
the law may afford them, yet in general our poor do appear to con- 
sider it as rather degrading to seek parochial relief, and therefore 
do not seek it till they be involved in real indigence. 

Prison. — In Lauder, there is a prison, containing three apart- 
ments, tolerably well-secured. It happily has seldom any inmates. 
In the course of last year a very few culprits were confined in it for 
a short period, on account of rioting or pilfering. 

Fairs. — Five fairs are annually held in the parish, the first in 
the beginning of March, at which seed-corn is sold by sample, and 
the farmers engage their hinds ; the second in April, for hiring 
single servants of both sexes for the ensuing half year ; the third 
in June, at which a few cattle, chiefly milch cows, are sold; the 
fourth in July, at which lambs are exposed to sale ; the fifth in Oc- 
tober, for the same purpose as the one in April. The principal 
are the hiring fairs in April and October. 

Inns, Src — There are in the parish not fewer than 22 inns or 
public houses, 15 in the town and 7 in the country. Goodwould 
it be for the morals of the inhabitants, if the number of these some 
of which are too often the haunts of folly and vice, were greatly re- 
duced. At the same time, it is but fair to state, that drunkenness 
seems to be somewhat less prevalent than it was formerly. 

Ftiel — The fuel burnt by a few of the people who reside in the 
hilly parts of the parish is peat or turf; but coal is almost univer- 
sally and solely used. It is brought from the neighbourhood of 
Pathhead, Mid- Lothian; its quality is generally good; but in con- 
sequence of the long carriage 14 or 15 miles it costs the people, 
when laid down at their doors, about lOd. per cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The appearance of the arable part of the parish is very much 
changed for the better since the period when the last Statistical 
Account was written. The lands are now far iDetter cultivated by 
an intelligent and industrious tenantry, while the landlords espe- 
cially the principal one have done much by draining, planting,

and enclosing, to add to the fertility of the soil, and improve the 
general aspect of the district. Both the turnpike and the cross roads 
are decidedly superior to what they were formerly. Forty years 
ago, only one stage-coach travelled every alternate day to Edin- 
burgh, whereas at present five stage-coaches run through the parish 
every day to and from Edinburgh and other places. The desire 
of education seems to have more generally increased, and the style 
of it, too, is better. It must, however, be admitted, that there is 
abundant scope for additional improvements, — some of which have 
already been hinted at. Additional planting is required : and to 
promote the industry and frugality of the labouring-classes, and 
nourish in them a spirit of independence, it is desirable that there 
should be established in the parish a savings bank, in which they 
could from time to time deposit such sums as they might be able 
to spare from their necessary expenditure. It is always incumbent 
on the affluent and the influential of every description to do what 
they can to advance not merely their intellectual, but their religi- 
ous and moral improvement. " Godliness is profitable unto all 
things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which 
is to come. Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach 
to any people."

PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. DAVID WILLIAM GORDON, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 

2s[ame — Boundaries. — The name of this parish was originally 
Ercildoun, which is still used by some of the older inhabitants. 
The origin of the name is uncertain ; but the place itself appears 
to have early attracted attention, and this may be sufficiently ac 
counted for not only by its vicinity to the monasteries of Melrose 
and Dryburgh, but hkewise by its having been the residence of 
Thomas the Rhymer, who, in many respects, was one of the most 
extraordinary men of his age. The parish is in length from east 
to west upwards of 6 miles, and about 4| in breadth. It is bounded 
on the west by Lauder and Melrose, on the south by Merton, on 
the east by Smailholm and Nenthorn, and on the north by Gordon 
and Ledgerwood. 

Topographical Appearances.— The parish contains no mountain 
ranges, though part of the country be hilly; nor are any of its hills 
remarkable save one about a mile south of the village, which is 
thought to bear some impressions of having been the site of a Ro- 
man encampment, and rises nearly 1000 feet above the level of 
the sea. 

Climate and Diseases.— The climate, more especially toward the 
west, is universally acknowledged to be mild, and thus, with a dry 
atmosphere, contributes to bestow upon the people considerable 
exemption from disease. It is observed by Mr Riddel, one of the 
surgeons of the parish, that the periodical epidemics are of a gentle 
nature. Scarlet fever has appeared but seldom since 1820, and 
even then no deaths occurred in the village from that disorder ; 
typhus fever is of rare occurrence, and perhaps the free ventilation 
which the village enjoys, together with the healthy situations of the 
farm-houses, prevent the spread of that dangerous malady. Neither 
scrofula nor consumption is seen so often as formerly, while distem-

pers of the skin, so frequently observed among the lower orders qf 
society, are here exceedingly rare. 

Hydrography. — There are two rivers in the parish, the Eden 
and the Leader, both of which have their source in Lammermoor, 
and flow into the Tweed. And though neither of them be re- 
markable for breadth or depth, or extent, yet the Leader, on ac- 
count of the beauty of its banks, has been justly celebrated in Scot- 
tish song. Its windings between the hills of Carolside and through 
the classic grounds of Cowdenknows, till its waters at Drygrange 
are lost in 'the principal river of the south of Scotland, form part of 
a scene of uncommon beauty. 

Soil. — Considerable' varieties of soil appear in the parish of Earl- 
ston. The arable land is for the most part dry ; it is of a loamy 
rather than a sandy nature, and some of it is justly considered as 
strong and rich. A proportion of barren heath is here and there 
to be met with ; and while in the eastern quarter there is a good 
deal of marshy ground, there is a moss in the northern division 
consisting of several hundreds of acres. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Persons. — Among the eminent characters connected with 
the parish both by birth and residence, a conspicuous place must 
be assigned to Sir Thomas the Rhymer, to whom a considerable 
portion of the lands of Ercildoun belonged. This extraordinary 
man lived about the end of the thirteenth century, and though it 
be not now easy to ascertain whether he himself made any preten- 
sions to more than mortal knowledge, ■ he was very soon after his 
death represented by his countrymen not only as a poet but as a 
prophet. The accounts which have descended to our own times 
concerning the predictions he is said to have uttered respecting 
many families of importance, and the ruin of the grandeur of his 
own family, and the union of the British nations under one monarch, 
together with the popular belief of his having been carried off at 
an early age to fairy land, are all particularly mentioned by Sir 
Walter Scott in a poem of uncommon beauty, to be found in the 
Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. 

The succeeding biography of the parish presents no such singular 
materials as those that are furnished by the history of this prophet 
or poet, but it affords others ftu' more interesting and useful in 
the lives of several individuals who were distinguished not only by 
rank and talent, but by worth severely tried in the furnace of afflic- 
tion. Among these individuals the Right Honourable Georae 



20 



BEllWICKSHIKE. 



Baillie, Esq. of Jerviswood, merits a conspicuous place. He was 
the son of the venerable patriot who in the reign of Charles II. 
fell a victim to a tyrannical government, and whether he be viewed 
as an exile soon after the death of his father, or as afterwards fil- 
ling high offices of responsibility in his native land, — whether he 
be regarded as a member of Parliament or as a private gentleman, 
there are few men of his station who have left behind them such 
purity of character or more striking attestations of all that is useful 
and edifying both in public and private life. Nor was the worth 
of his wife. Lady Grizzel Baillie, either less conspicuous or tried 
less severely than his own. It was by means of her courage and 
caution in regularly bringing by night a necessary supply of food, 
that while as yet a child she preserved the life of her father, the 
Earl of Marchmont, when, persecuted by arbitrary power, he was 
forced to seek refuge in the confinement of a tomb. And when 
to this it is added, that the same true greatness of soul uniformly 
distinguished her behaviour both in the conjugal and in the paren- 
tal relations, we can scarcely be surprised that a writer of no or- 
dinary talent should have adopted this lady as a heroine of the 
highest order in the scale of female excellence. 

But in mentioning some of the more eminent characters con- 
nected with the parish of Earlston, the writer of this article would 
consider himself as chargeable with unjust omission were he to 
pass unnoticed the late Mrs Baillie of Jerviswood, the mother 
of the present representative of that honourable house, since her 
conduct presents a most useful example to those of her own sex, 
who, possessing similar means of doing good, are at the same time 
placed in such circumstances as induce them too hastily to con- 
clude that they have a just title to be exempted from several of 
the duties of life. This amiable woman was confined to bed dur- 
ing almost the whole of the last thirty-two years of her existence. 
Yet, instead of resigning herself to indolence, or satisfying her- 
self with the performance of those offices of piety by which she 
was comforted in the solitude of her chamber, she was never 
more actively benevolent, even in her healthiest days. Her de- 
light was to employ a messenger of kindness, whose office was to 
search out cases of distress, that to the indigent and helpless, 
to the ignorant and thoughtless, to the sick and dying, to widows 
and orphans she might communicate immediate and effectual re- 
lief. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners in the parish are George 



EARLSTON. 2l 

Baillie, Esq. of Jerviswood ; Dr James Home of Cowdenknows ; 
Captain Brown of Park ; and James Home, Esq. of Carolside. 

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest entry in the pa- 
rochial registers is the 30th September 1694. They are not vo- 
luminous, but are regularly kept, though for some years past pa- 
rents have not been so attentive as before to the registration of 
births. 

Antiquities. — The only remains of antiquity are, part of one of 
the walls of the tower or castle of Sir Thomas the Rhymer, the 
pit, and tower, and trees of Cowdenknows, a stone inserted into 
the front wall of the church, bearing the inscription " Auld Rhy- 
mer's race lies in this place," and a stone taken from a grave, on 
which is a figure bearing a near resemblance to a Maltese cross. 
There existed some years ago, near the western extremity of the 
village, an ancient thorn tree, on which the fortunes of the place, 
according to the superstitious traditions of the older inhabitants, 
were alleged to depend. 

Modern Buildings. — The venerable thorn, above alluded to, at 
length yielded to the tempest, and near the spot where it had long 
flourished, there now stands a handsome house, lately erected by a 
gentleman of the Law, whose correct taste has thus given an orna- 
ment to the town, and whose attention to the interests of the in- 
habitants may well reconcile them to the loss of their ancient thorn. 
The principal mansion-houses in the parish are Mellerstain, the 
princely residence of Mr Baillie the house of Cowdenknows, 
whose adjoining scenery has been made classical by the beautiful 
melody of " The Broom o' the Cowdenknows," and the house of 
Carolside, which, from the stillness of the vale around it, and from 
the hills which shelter it, and partly conceal it from the view, ap- 
pears to the traveller a sweet and secure asylum from the toils 
and trouble of the world. 

HI. — Population. 
The population at present is 1710, of which number there are in 
the village of Earlston, 847 ; in Fans, 147; in Redpath, 114; in 



Mellerstain, 202 ; and in the country, 400.

three, but there are at least eight proprietors of land of the year- 
ly value of L. 50 and upwards. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres stand- 
ard imperial measure, either cultivated, or occasionally in tillage, 
is 5600 ; and the number either constantly waste or in pasture is 
2118. But there is no encouragement to add to the cultivated 
land, since the improvement of the waste has for the most part 
turned out not to the advantage, but to the loss of the cultivators. 
No part of the parish is in a state of undivided common. The 
number of acres in wood is 915; and on the Mellerstain estate, 
where there is a regular felling of timber for sale, a great extent 
of waste land has been planted chiefly with Scotch fir. 

The management of plantations is on the whole good ; and on 
the estate of Cowdenknows much improvement has been made 
by plantations laid out with great taste, forming an ornament both 
to the scenery of the Leader, and to the village of Earlston. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land, per acre, is 
about 18s.: but in the immediate vicinity of the village, where the 
soil is uncommonly rich, some land rents so high as from L. 3 to 
upwards of L. 5. The common grazing allowance for a cow is 
L. 3 ; that for a full-grown sheep, 15s. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of married farm-labourers vary 
from L. 25 to L. 30 per annum. An unmarried male-servant, 
within the house, has from L. 9 to L. 11, Avhile unmarried wo- 
men receive about L. 7. The current wages of women labour- 
ing in the field are lOd. per day in summer, and 8d. in winter ; 
and Is. 8d. in summer, and Is. 6d. in winter, are the ordinary al- 
lowance for men. Masons, when employed by the day, receive 
from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 4d. Blacksmiths, contracting by the draught 
or pair of horses, have from L. 2, 10s. to L. 3. The ordinary 
wages of carpenters are from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per day, but they have 
stated prices for the various implements of husbandry. Weavers 
are at present in poor circumstances, as they are unable, with all 
diligence, to gain more than 9s. per week. 

Husbandry. — The prevailing kinds of stock in the parish are the 
Leicester breed of sheep, and the short-horned breed of cattle, to 
both of which considerable attention is paid. The five-shift hus- 
bandry, as it is usually denominated, is the system generally fol- 
lowed, where the land, after being two years in grass, is cropped 
with oats, next with turnips, then with oats or barley and grass, 



EARLSTON. 



23 



which closes the rotation. Little wheat is sown, as the soil is 
suited chiefly for turnips, in the cultivation of which bone manure, 
recently introduced, has proved an excellent substitute for dung. 
Every acre of waste that could repay the labour of the farmer has 
been improved. The wet arable has been generally dried by 
draining ; and the extensive moss already mentioned having been 
redeemed at an expense of from L. 1200 to L. 1400, affords now 
tolerable grazing for cattle. With regard to the leases, there is 
no doubt that, were they longer than they are, the effect would be 
a considerable increase of agricultural improvement. They run 
at present from fifteen to twenty-one years. The principal pro- 
prietor, Mr Baillie of Mellerstain, has been at great expense in 
improving the farm-offices on his extensive property ; and as the 
parish is nearly all enclosed, so the fences being generally kept at 
the mutual cost of landlord and tenant, are thus preserved from the 
neglect which they might otherwise experience.  

Manufactures. — There are two manufactories in the parish, one 
belonging to Miss Whale and Company, the other to Mr Wil- 
son. The former is a manufactory of ginghams, merinos, shawls, 
muslins, shirtings, and furniture stripes, — the latter of plaidings, 
blankets, and flannels ; and in both, but more especially in the 
former, employment is given to many who would otherwise be 
destitute. In Miss Whale's establishment, whre the whole is 
wrought by hand-loom weaving, work is afforded to fifty weavers, 
and to about sixteen additional individuals, chiefly women and 
children. In Mr Wilson's manufactory, where upwards of forty 
are employed, some of the men gain 12s., and the children 2s. 6d., 
per week. They work eleven hours per day ; and as yet no bad 
effect has appeared, either on the health or the morals of the 
workmen. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The nearest market-town, Melrose, 
is distant about five miles. But there is a post-office in the village 
of Earlston; and on the road which passes through it, and extends 
five miles in length from one end of the parish to the other, 
there is a daily coach from Edinburgh to Kelso, and from Kelso 
to Edinburgh. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, built in the year 1736, 
and now undergoing an extensive repair, stands in the village of 

 An cstinnate of the average gross amount and value of raw produce raised in the 
parish may probally be stated in the general summary of this county.

Earlston. It is almost in one extremity of the parish, and is five 
miles distant from the other. It has hitherto been unable to af- 
ford accommodation to more than 450 persons, of whom none, 
with the exception of the heritors, have free sittings ; but, besides 
the repair, it is now also receiving an enlargement, which will be 
capable of holding nearly 200. — The manse was erected in 1814, 
and repaired in 1824. — The stipend is 16 chalders. — The glebe, 
which is between 7 and 8 acres in extent, is so valuable, as to let 
at upwards of L. 5 per acre. 

Among benefactions for religious and charitable purposes, the 
following may be mentioned as the most interesting and import- 
ant, viz. L. 50 by the late Honourable Mrs Baillie of Jerviswood, 
for the more frequent dispensation of our Lord's supper ; L. 200 
by Mr Tod of Kirklands, for coals to the poor ; L. 86 for the 
same purpose, by a person whose name is at present forgotten ; 
L. 600 by J. Wilson, Esq. surgeon, Bombay, for the benefit of 
the parish school, and L. 30 for teaching the children of the en- 
rolled poor. 

There are two dissenting chapels in the parish, one of which, 
belonging to the' Antiburgher Seceders, has existed almost from 
the commencement of the Secession, while the other, connected 
with the Relief church, is not more than fifty years old. The sti- 
pend of the minister of the Antiburgher chapel does not exceed 
L. 100, nor does that of the Relief minister amount to more than 
L. 120, and both are raised from the seat-rents, and from the 
weekly collections on the Sabbath. In the former congregation 
there may be a few more, and in the latter a few less, than 300 
communicants. The number of persons of all ages connected 
with the Established church is about 800. The number regularly 
attending is about 400. The number of communicants at the last 
dispensation of the sacrament was 404. And the average amount 
of church collections yearly may be stated at L. 22. 

Education. — There are at present three schools in the parish, 
two of which are endowed ; one of these is at Mellerstain, where 
the teacher has a salary of L. 5 from Mr Baillie, and where the 
ordinary branches are taught. The other is the parochial school, 
where the teacher's salary is L. 28, and where the branches of in- 
struction taught are, English, reading, and grammar, writing, arith- 
metic, practical mathematics, algebra, geometry, plain and sphe- 
rical trigonometry, Latin, Greek, and French. 

The people, in general, are alive to the benefits of education ;

nor 



do I know a single family in the parish, any of whose mem- 
bers, from six to fifteen years of age, have not been taught to read. 

Lxbrainj, Friendly Society, and Savings Bank.— The other m- 
stitutions existing in the parish are a Subscription Library, and a 
small library for children; a Friendly Society for affordmg relief 
to its sick members ; and a Savings Bank for the lower classes of 
the people, in which there may be at present about L. 100. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— T\ie average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 34. The average sum allotted to each 
is 8s. per month, which is raised by regular half-yearly assess- 
ments. A few individuals may occasionally be met with who are 
unwilling to be placed on the roll of paupers ; but it must be 
acknowledged, that the people in general are not reluctant to ap- 
ply, and that they consider it as no degradation to receive a regu- 
lar support. 

Inns.— In the town of Earlston there are four inns, and six 
other houses where ale and spirits are sold. 

Fairs. There are here also two annual fairs for horses and 

cattle, one of which is held on the 29th of June, and the other on 
the third Thursday of October. 

Fuel— The principal fuel is coal, which, as it is brought chiefly 
from the neighbourhood of Dalkeith, a distance of twenty miles, 
seldom costs less than Is. or Is. 2d. per cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Among the variations between the present state of the parish 
and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Account, 
considerable improvements in the system of husbandry deserve to 
be noticed, together with the erection of a considerable number of 
neat and comfortable houses in the village of Earlston. And, 
while much advantage is anticipated from an intended alteration 
in the road from Kelso to Edinburgh by the way of Earlston, the 
facilities of communications would be still much increased were a 
line of road made from Fans through the waste land eastward to 
the Edinburgh turnpike by the neighbouring parish of Gordon.

PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

REV. JAMES DUNCAN, MINISTER. 



' — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, -c— In the immediate vicinity where the 
old village stood there is a piece of marshy ground. Perhaps 
from this, both the village and parish may have been designated 
Mire-town or Mertoun. The parish is situated in the south-west 
corner of Berwickshire. It is bounded on the south by the river 
Tweed, on the north by Earlston, and on the east by Smailholm 
and Makerston. In length the parish may be about six miles, 
and in breadth from two to three. 

Topographical Apjearances, -c— The western part of the parish 
stands high, and is extremely picturesque. From Bemersyde hill, 
the property of James Haig, Esq. over which one of the most 
public roads in the parish passes, the eye of the traveller is at once 
gratified with every thing beautiful and magnificent,— wood, water, 
hills, ruins, and fertile fields. The rest of the parish gradually 
declining to the south is also extremely pleasant, the prospect 
being agreeably diversified by excellent enclosures, beautiful hedge- 
rows, and thriving plantations. The soil towards the Tweed, par- 
- ticularly the haughs, is sharp, with a gravelly bottom. Towards 
the north, and indeed through the rest of the parish, with very few 
exceptions, is a stiff clay with a till bottom. 

There are no lakes in the parish, and very few springs ; conse- 
quently, in very dry seasons, the farmers are sometimes at a loss 
for water to their cattle. 

The rocks are all greenstone and other trap-rocks, except on 
the banks of the Tweed, where they are deposits of old red sand- 
stone. This latter stone is very durable, and admits of the high- 
est polish. 

II. — Civil History. 
It may deserve notice, that Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden, hav- 
ing purchased the library of his grandfather, the Right Honourable 



MERTON. 



27 



the Earl of Marchmont, has in consequence of this, in his posses- 
sion, a number of letters, papers, pictures, and other documents 
relative to Scottish history. 

Land-owners.— T\ye principal, and indeed the only land-owners 
in the parish, are Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden ; James Haig, Esq. 
of Bemersyde ; Sir David Erskine of Dryburgh ; Charles Riddell, 
Esq. of Musilee ; and John Anderson, Esq. of Gladswood. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest date of our parochial regis- 
ters is 1697. They have been very irregularly kept, and contain 
nothing of any importance. 

Antiquities.— The Abbey of Dryburgh, so much admired by 
travellers, lies in the south-west corner of the parish ; but, as an 
account of it, written by the late Right Honourable the Earl of 
Buchan, is pubhshed in Grose's Antiquities, it is unnecessary to 
say any thing about it. 

Modern Buildings. — It may be proper to remark, that the late 
Earl of Buchan, with a liberality that does honour to his memory, 
erected a suspension bridge across the Tweed 261 feet. This 
bridge is a great accommodation to the pubhc, as foot-passengers 
and single horses can pass at all times with safety. On a little 
eminence at this end of the bridge, he erected a circular building, 
which he designated the Temple of the Muses. The workman- 
ship is well executed ; and, taken in conjunction with the adjoin- 
ing scenery, forms a beautiful object. 

He also erected at a short distance, upon the brow of the con- 
terminous hill, a colossal statue of Sir William Wallace. This is 
chiefly remarkable, as being the workmanship of a common stone- 
mason who had never been taught sculpture. It is a conspicuous 
object from the turnpike road leading to Jedburgh.

In the last there are 312 males and 352 females. The increase 
arises from most of the proprietors and their families being resi- 
dent at the time the census was taken, and also from several new 
cottages being built for the farmers' married servants.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The total number of acres in 
the parish is about 5550. The number of acres annually sown, 
and the average return per acre, may be nearly as follows : —

Perhaps there are 300 acres capable of being cultivated with a 
profitable application of capital; and there are about 500 acres 
under wood. There is no land in undivided common. 

Husbandry. — The land sown with wheat and barley is generally 
sown down with grass seeds, and this is either pastured or cut 
for hay, as circumstances may require. Much improvement has 
taken place within the last twenty years in every department of 
farming, though much yet remains to be performed. A good deal 
of ground has been drained, and a considerable quantity of lime 
used ; the expense, however, of the latter is so great, — from IDs. 6d. 
to 13s. per single cart, — that an adequate remuneration is seldom 
obtained. But this evil might be remedied in some degree by the 
use of shell-marl, of which an abundant supply can be got in the 



MERTON. 



29 



parish. But the price of this, Is. 2d. per single cart, and the ex- 
pense of driving the quantity requisite, preclude the farmers in a 
great measure from using it. Would the proprietor, Hugh Scott, 
Esq. of Harden, charge no more than the mere expense of takmg 
it out of the pit, both he and his tenants would find their advan- 
tage in it, especially if the latter were obliged to lay it upon the 
grass sward, and submit it to the action of frost ; for, bemg of an 
adhesive quality till it is pulverized by frost, it can have little or 
no effect upon the soil. Besides, this could be done at less ex- 
pense than spreading it in its natural state upon fallow, and the 
beneficial effects either as to grass or corn would be sooner felt. 
This marl was carefully analyzed by the late Dr Kennedy of Edin- 
burgh, and found to contain about 73 per cent, of carbonate of lime. 

Though spouts or springs are not frequent, yet surface water is 
not drained off so completely as it ought to be. Except at the com- 
mencement of a lease, the ditches are seldom scoured or kept clean, 
and, of course, the surface-water cannot be drained off. Were a 
person accustomed to the use of the spade mutually employed by 
landlord and tenant, this evil might be easily remedied ; and, what 
would be no inconsiderable advantage, if this person could cut and 
clean hedges, the fences would be kept in better order. 

It would be uncandid not to acknowledge that the landlords have 
been extremely liberal in giving their tenants good houses, and every 
accommodation necessary in point of offices and curtains or courts 
for their different kinds of stock. Much also has been done in the 
improvement of roads, so that, with few exceptions, there is now 
easy access from every part of the parish to the neighbouring turn- 
pikes ; and last, though not least, a mill upon a large scale has 
been erected. The machinery is of the most approved kind, and 
fitted to manufacture every kind of grain, and has at all times 
an abundant supply of water. A tenant of skill and enterprise 
might carry on an extensive and lucrative business. 

A great improvement has taken place since the introduction of 
bone dust, as by this excellent turnips are raised, and the farmer is 
enabled to give a greater quantity of dung for the production of wheat. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The greatest attention is paid to the 
rearing of stock. The cattle, with few exceptions, are of the 
short-horned breed, and these are kept up or improved by buy- 
ing annually at high prices, from the best breeders in the south, 
bulls and cows of that kind. The sheep are of the best Lei- 
cester kind. Some years ago, Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden, pur- 



30 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



chased a stock of these, which were selected from the best flocks 
in England; and to keep up this stock, and still further to im- 
prove It, he annually either hires or buys the best tups that 
can be got; and, in order to accommodate his tenants and benefit 
the neighbourhood, he rears from his carefully selected stock, a 
considerable number of tups, which are regularly sold by auction 
towards the end of September. Much attention is also paid to the 
rearing of horses, both for the draught and saddle. 

The following is the amount of the different kinds of stock kept, 
bred, and fed in the parish.

Rent of Land. — A considerable quantity of ground, well en- 
closed, sheltered, and watered, is annually let by auction for graz- 
ing; the rent varies from L. 1, 10s. to L.2, 10s. per acre. The 
average rent of land upon a lease of 19 or 21 years may be from 
15s. to 20s. per acre. The real rent of the parish is betwixt 
L. 5000 and L. 6000 per annum. 

Price of Labour. — A hind receives per annum 5 loads of oat- 
meal ; 15 bushels of barley; 6 bushels of pease; 1000 yards of po- 
tatoes planted; 5 single carts of coals drawn, but he pays the price 
at the coal-hill ; a cow kept summer and winter ; L. 3 in moneyj 
he furnishes a shearer for his house, and provides his master with 
a worker, who is paid lOd. and 8d. in winter per day. Single 
men who live in the farmer's house receive from L. 7 to L. 8 per 
annum and their victuals : women from L, 5, 10s. to L. 6, 10s. per 
annum and their victuals : day-labourers from Is. 6d. to 2s. per day 
without victuals : men in harvest from 12s. to 13s. 6d. jper week 
with victuals : women in do. from lis. to 12s. 6d. per week with 
victuals : smiths are paid by the year for a pair of farm horses from 
L. 2, 15s. to L. 3 ; joiners per day, 2s. ; masons, 2s. 6d. 

Quarries. — Though sandstone or freestone abounds on the banks 
and in the bed of the river, no quarry has been wrought for many 
years. This is no small inconvenience, nor can it be remedied with- 
out a greater expense than the proprietors are willing to incur. 

Fisheries. — We have three salmon fisheries ; but they are not 

3 



MERTON. 



31 



very productive, and, consequently, the rent derived from them is 
but'triflino-. The fishers follow the practices of their forefathers, in 
■uiolino- setting small nets in cairns when the river is in flood, and 
kilTino'the salmon with hsters when the river is small and the even- 
ino- serene : and this they call burning the water, because they are 
obliged to carry a hghted torch in the boat. Long nets, such as are 
used near Berwick, and upon the Tay and Tummel in the north 
might certainly be employed in many places with great safety and 

advantage. , ,  , .  -p. 

There is a large orchard belonging to Sir David Erskine at Dry- 
burgh, which yields from L. 100 to L. 150 per annum. 

V. — Parochial Economy, 

Means of Communication.— There are three small villages in the 
parish. The means of communication are very scanty, and not a 
little inconveniently placed. We have no turnpike roads, no coaches 
nor carriers. In the village of Lessudden there is a daily post ; and 
though in a direct hne it is not above two miles distant ; yet the 
Tweed intervening, it is at all times inconvenient, and sometimes 
impracticable of access, unless we go nearly double the distance, 
by Dryburgh, where there is a Suspension Bridge. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The situation of the church is extremely 
beautiful, being placed in the midst of a grove close to the patron's 
house and policy; it is, however, extremely inconveniently placed 
both for the minister and people, being about a mile from the 
manse, and about the same distance from the centre of the parish. 
It was built in the year 1658,. and repaired in the year 1820. It 
is remarkably well fitted up, and in the most complete repair ; all 
the sittings are free, every tenant has a pew assigned to him, and 
there is a gallery appropriated in common to cottagers and farm- 
servants.— The manse was built in the year 1767, and has under- 
gone various repairs.— The glebe is 14 acres, and may be worth 
L. 14 per annum— The stipend is 16 chalders, with L. 10 for 
communion elements. — There are no chapels of ease nor dissenting 
meeting-houses in the parish. The average number of communi- 
cants'may be about 240. The collections in the church are from 
L. 16"to L. 18 per annum. The church will accommodate about 
380 ; and is generally well attended. It is difficult to estimate the 
number of dissenting families in the parish,— as they are chiefly 
those of married servants, whose residences fluctuate. 

Education.— The only seminary in the parish is the parochial 
school, at which the average number of scholars may be from thirty 



32 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



to forty. English, writing, arithmetic, practical mathematics, 
Greek, and Latin, are taught. The salary is L. 30 ; and the school 
wages may amount to L. 10 per annum. Besides the above emo- 
luments, the teacher has L. 4, 4s. for precenting in church and 
officiating as session-clerk. He has also every legal accommoda- 
tion in respect of a house and garden. When parents are very 
poor, the heritors make no difficulty in paying for the education of 
their children. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. —Voovs' rates were established in the 
year 1771 ; they may amount to about L. 30 or L. 40 per annum. 
This, with the annual collections in the church, is generally sufficient. 
The heritors, however, by no means restrict themselves to this, 
but cheerfully assess themselves to the full amount of what the 
minister and session deem necessary. The landlords and tenants 
pay in equal proportions; and though the latter are not consult- 
ed when the assessment is made, they have never been known to 
grudge their share. The average number of poor upon the roll is 
about 8. They receive from Is. to 2s. 6d. per week, according to 
circumstances. It deserves notice, that the poor in this parish are 
provided for at less expense than in any parish of the same extent 
in the south of Scotland. This arises chiefly from the custom of 
giving temporary supply in cases of distress, and also from the ex- 
treme liberality and attention of the patron's family. 

Inns. — There are no inns in the parish, nor is any person al- 
lowed to sell spirituous liquors. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The greatest inconvenience experienced by this parish is the dis- 
tance from coal and lime, 25 miles. Every cwt. of the former costs 
Is. 3d., and every single cart of the latter, from 10s. 6d. to 13s. 
Another great inconvenience is, the want of an easy and ready com- 
munication with the south side of the river, unless by the suspension 
bridge at Dryburgh, which is useful only for foot-passengers or 
single horses. There is no bridge nearer than Kelso, which is nine 
miles, or Drygrange bridge, which is four miles. A suspension 
bridge for carriages, &amp;c. if erected in this immediate neighbour- 
hood, would be of immense use ; it would not only benefit this 
and the conterminous parishes, but would continue the road from 
Selkirk and St Boswell's Green to Berwick.

PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES PATERSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Spc. — The name of this parish was originally 
Goirtean, signifying in Gaelic a little field — a little farm — a little 
corn field. It lies in the western part of the Merse, Berwickshire, and 
is about 7 miles long, by from 2 to 4 in breadth, containing about 
21 square miles. Its form is oval ; and it is bounded on the west 
by part of the parish of Legerwood ; on the north by part of Le- 
gerwood, Westruther, and part of Greenlaw; on the east by 
Greenlaw ; and on the south by Hume, now annexed to the pa- 
rish of Stitchel, and by part of Earlston. It contains no moun- 
tains ; and the whole surface is uneven and hilly. The situation 
of the parish is high, and the atmosphere in general pure and sa- 
lubrious. The district is exposed to no prevalent distempers. 

The small river Eden runs through the parish from north to 
south, dividing it nearly into two equal parts. The Blackadder 
bounds it on the north-east for upwards of two miles, separating 
it from Greenlaw. 

The only species of rock with which the district abounds con- 
sists of pieces of whinstone, varying in weight from two tons to 
a few pounds. These blocks are thickly scattered over the sur- 
face of those moors which are as yet uncultivated ; and it is evi- 
dent that much of the land now under tillage must have at one 
time been encumbered with them. There are no masses of rock. 
In some places small beds of red sandstone are to be found, but so 
very friable as to be of little or no use. 

n. — Civil History. 
Family of Gordon.—Thi parish at one time contained the re- 
sidence and part of the possessions of the noble family of Gordon, 
who took their name from the place. They are said to have settled 
here in the reign of Malcolm Canmore, and to have removed to 
the north of Scotland about three or four centuries ago. It is con- 

BERWICK. c 



34 



be:rvvicksiiire. 



jecturecl, that, at then- departure, they transferred some names of 
places from their old to their new domains. Thus Huntly, a pa- 
rish with which they are connected in the north, was also the name 
of a small hamlet which existed till of late, and stood in the west- 
ern extremity of the parish. A solitary tree still stands to mark 
the spot. A little to the north of the village of West Gordon, 
an eminence, dignified by the appellation of The Castle, is yet 
pointed out as the spot on which the ancestors of the Duke of Gor- 
don had fixed their residence. A moat or ditch may still be traced ; 
but the whole is now covered with plantations, and even the very 
name is becoming obsolete. 

Greenknow tower, now nearly in ruins, was once the residence 
of a zealous Covenanter, Pringle of Greenknow, whose memoirs 
have been lately published. 

Land-owners. — The chief land -owners are, Bailhe of Jervis- 
wood ; Fairholm of Greenknow ; Robertson of Ladykirk ; Hamil- 
ton of Rumbletonlaw ; Innes of Stow ; and Erskine of Shieldfield. 

Parochial Begisters.—The first date in the parochial registers 
is the 11th of January 1652. They are on the whole regularly 
kept, especially of late.

There are no nobility, nor individuals or families of independ- 
ent fortune residing in the parish. 

The parish has been long remarkable for the number of insane 
persons residing in it. At present there are only 3, 1 blind per- 
son, and ] deaf and dumb. 

Character and Habits of the People. — They are rather remarka- 
ble for the persevering steadiness with which they attend to their 
several occupations, and for their industrious and frugal habits. 
Like all who are actively engaged in the business of life, the people 
are disposed to relax at times, and to seek a reasonable degree 
of enjoyment in a frank and friendly intercourse with one another. 
This disposition shows itself among all classes of society. They 
possess a considerable extent of religious knowledge ; and this, from 
their fondness for reading, is every day gaining ground. Many of 
the better sort evince a knowledge and a taste in literary matters 
which would do credit to men in far more elevated stations, and 
with far superior advantages. Smuggling is almost unknown : not 
so poa,ching. 

The number of illegitimate births in the parish for the last three 
years has been 7. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. 

The number of acres, standard imperial measure, in the parish which are cultivated, 
or occasionally in tillage, is about . . . 4300 

acres which have never been cultivated, and which remain con- 
stantly waste, or in pasture, about . . . 4100 
acres in undivided common, ... 0 
under wood, about . . . 50O 

The trees are mostly fir, intermixed with some beech, oak, elm, 
&amp;c. I am informed that about 1000 acres might be added to the 
cultivated land. But it appears doubtful whether even the occa- 
sional cultivation of such land would. repay the trouble, expense, 
and risk attending it. A few good crops might be got at first, after 
which the land would become less profitable either for crops or grass. 

Rent of Land.~The average rent of the arable land may amount 
to about L. 1 per acre. The average rent of grazing in the whole 
parish, at the rate of L. 2, 10s. on good grass land, and L. 1, 10s. 
on meadow and waste, per ox or cow grazed ; and at the rate of 
18s. per ewe, or full-grown sheep, pastured for the year, — may 
amount to about L. 3300. 

Rate of Wages. — Farm-labourers receive, in summer, Is. 8d. per 
day, and in winter, Is. 6d. Masons receive 2s. 6d. per day, and 
joiners the same.

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry pursued is excellent, 
being- the same which has been practised for a considerable time 
past in several of the southern counties of Scotland, and in the 
north of England. The land in general is light and sandy, well 
adapted for the growth of turnips. In cropping it is divided for 
the most part into five breaks. These breaks are cultivated in re- 
gular rotation as follows : — The first crop is made to consist of oats ; 
the second of turnips, one-half of which is eaten by sheep on the 
land, and the other half is led in to fatten cattle ; the third of bar- 
ley, when grass and clover seeds are also sown ; the fourth is a 
hay crop or pasture ; and the fifth is allowed to remain entirely in 
pasture. 

Much has already been done in reclaiming waste land, and in 
draining. In the latter respect something, perhaps, may still be 
done, but it is doubtful if much, or any, of the waste land could 
be reclaimed so as to afford profit to the farmer. The farm-build- 
ings are substantial and commodious. The arable land is all en- 
closed with stone-dikes or thorn hedges, and many of the fields 
are now well sheltered. 

During the late war, when all kinds of farm produce were sold 
at high prices, a considerable quantity of waste land was brought 
into a state of cultivation ; and though improvements of this kind 
are nearly given up, yet other improvements are still carrying on ; 
and if any obstacles to these can be said to exist, they are to be 
found in the articles of lime and markets, the distance to both be- 
ing upwards of 25 miles. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, under the follow- 
ing heads, may be rated as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man or the domestic 
animals, ..... . L. 10,230 0 0 

Of potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. .... . 1,788 0 0 

Of hay, whether meadow or cultivated, . . • 400 0 0 

Of land in pasture, rating it at L. 2 per cow, or full-grown ox, grazed, 
or that may be grazed for the season ; at IBs. per ewe, or full-grown 
sheep, pastured, or that may be pastured for the year," . 2,927 0 0 

L. 15,345 0 0

Market-Town, Sfc. — The nearest market-town is Kelso, at the 
distance of about eight miles. The only village is West Gordon. 

Means of Communication. — There is no post-office ; yet there is 
no want of means of communication. The road from Kelso to

Edinburgh crosses the parish at the broadest part ; and another 
road from Earlston to Greenlaw traverses its whole length. Be- 
sides these, there are a good many parish roads, leading from the 
main ones to the several farm-houses ; and these are kept in to- 
lerably good order. 

Ecclesiastical The church stands nearly in the centre of 

the parish, and is very conveniently placed for the greater part of 
the population. It was built in 1763, but has since undergone seve- 
ral repairs. At present, it is in rather an indifferent state, particularly 
as regards the seats.  It is capable of containing about 400 sitters. 
There are a few free seats, which may accommodate about 50. — 
The manse was built in 1803. — The glebe consists of 12 acres of 
arable land, and might be let at a rent of from L. 25 to L. 30 per 
annum. — The stipend is payable partly in money and partly in 
grain. The money stipend amounts to L. 90 per annum. The 
grain stipend, which is paid by the fiars of the county once a-year, 
consists of meal, 16 bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, 3 lippies; barley, 16 
bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, 3 lippies ; oats, 28 bolls, 3 firlots ; bear, 25 
bolls. 

There are no Dissenting, Seceding, Episcopalian, or Roman Ca- 
tholic chapels in the parish. The number of families attending 
the Established church may amount to about 173. Persons of all 
ages attending it may be calculated at about 350 or 400. The 
number of Dissenters and Seceders cannot much exceed 50. There 
are neither Episcopalians nor Roman Catholics. Divine service at 
the Established church is tolerably well attended. 

There are no societies for religious purposes, but the average 
amount of church collections yearly for religious and charitable ob- 
jects may be about L. 17. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in the parish. 
Besides the ordinary branches, practical mathematics, geography, 
and Latin, are taught. The salary is the maximum, and the school- 
master has more than the legal accommodation. His fees amount 
annually to about L.20. There are few, if any, of the young be- 
twixt six and fifteen who can neither read nor write, and none what- 
ever upwards of fifteen. All classes are alive to the advantages 
of a good education; and parents in the humblest condition of 
life exert themselves to the utmost to secure for their children as 
much education as possible. 

Library. — A parish library was established upwards of ten years

ago. It is in a flourishing- state, and has been the means of spread- 
ing a taste for general reading. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 25. The average sum allotted to each 
per week is Is. 4id., or per year, L. 5, 3s. Od. The annual 
amount of contributions for the rehef of the poor, besides the church 
collections, is L. 142, 16s. 4d. The only regular mode of procur- 
ing funds is by assessments on the landed property, and by church 
collections. The church collections for 1833 amounted to L. 14, 
2s. 7|d. In some cases there is a backwardness shewn in solici- 
ting relief; and instances have occurred wherein the parties have 
been known to submit to many privations rather than resort to what 
they consider the last shift. 

Inns, Src — There is one inn and one alehouse ; neither of which 
at all tend to the promotion of good morals. 

Fuel. — The fuel used consists of peat and turf. Coal, which is 
brought from a distance of twenty-four miles, is also used, but not so 
generally. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Improvements in the parish have been going on sin6e the last 
Statistical Account was written. The chief of these has been the 
planting of part of the moors, which has greatly improved the ap- 
pearance of the country. 

There is a circumstance relating to the improvement of some 
waste land in the neighbourhood of the village, which is well worthy 
of the attention of political economists. In 1787, the then pro- 
prietor of Greenknow estate sold in perpetual feu about 100 acres 
of his moors to purchasers, in lots of from forty acres to two. The 
lots were disposed of at L. 5, L. 3, and L. 1, 10s. per acre,- with 
Is. per acre of feu annually. No sooner were the purchases 
made, than the feuars commenced the clearing of their lands; and 
some idea may be formed of the laborious nature of the undertaking, 
when it is stated, that in most places upwards of a thousand tons 
of stones per acre had to be raised and removed before the soil 
was capable of bearing any crop. Many of these stones had to be 
blown with powder before they could be carried away. In marshy 
places, draining also had to be resorted to ; and some of these 
drains measure six feet wide and five feet deep. This helped to get 
rid of the stones. Another method was by building small enclo- 
sures of from one to six acres. Some of the dikes thus built mea- 
sure from three to four and a-half feet thick, and four feel high. 



GORDON. 39 

The whole is now in a state of cultivation, and more or less pro- 
ductive. On the best land, eight bolls of barley per acre have 
been produced, and, on an average, eight bolls of oats. 

Part of the lots were sold to labourers and trades-people, who, 
employing all their spare time in bringing their small properties 
into a condition fit for tillage, have at last greatly ameliorated their 
condition. It nay be mentioned, as a proof how well even soils 
of an inferior quality will pay from this mode of treatment, that a 
lot of twenty-four acres, which was originally purchased for L. 72, 
was sold for L. 900 a few years ago. I have presumed to state 
these facts, as an evidence that even the worst soils will in the end 
well repay all the labour required to bring them into an arable 
state, provided liberal encouragement, as in the present instance, 
be granted to such purchasers as are above described, if sold in 
similar lots. 

p, S. Since writing the above, 27 acres of moor contiguous 

to that sold in 1787 has been disposed of on the same conditions, 
at from L.21 to L.5 per acre, — average price L. 11. It was dis- 
posed of by public roup, and put up in lots of about two acres each. 
Several proprietors of the old feus became purchasers, and some 
of them bought several lots together, amounting to 12, 8, and 3 
acres. Only two individuals bought lots a piece. The soil in 
these new feus is by no means good ; some of it is decidedly bad, 
and none of it surpasses the greater part of that of the old feus ; yet 
I have no doubt but in the course of time it will prove a profitable 
speculation to those who have bought it.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. ABRAHAM HOME, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries. — Greenlaw is said to have stood originally 
where the farm onstead of Old Greenlaw is now situated about a 
mile from the present town. This is the more likely, as the pre- 
sent town stands in a vale upon the banks of the Blackadder, 
whereas Old Greenlaw stands upon a round hill, or detached emi- 
nence, of which kind there are several in the parish, and which, from 
their conical figure, are well known in Scotland by the name of 
Laws. It is from one of these, which, in the original uncultivated 
state of the country, was greener than the others, that the town 
and parish have evidently derived their name. The parish is be- 
tween 8 and 9 miles in length from north-west to south-east, and 
on an average about 3 miles in breadth ; is of the form of an ir- 
regular parallelogram, with the corners rounded off ; and is bound- 
ed on the east by the parishes of Polwarth and Fogo ; on the 
south by Eccles and Hume ; on the west by Gordon ; and on the 
north by Westruther, Longformacus, and a part of Cranshaws. 

Meteorology. — Climate. — At Greenlaw, which is well sheltered 
by the surrounding eminences, the air is mild. It is more so in 
the south than in the north division of the parish, where the winds 
during the spring and autumn months are keen and penetrating. 
The town and parish are particularly healthy, and no epidemical 
disease has appeared in either for a great number of years. 

Hydrograpliy. — There are a number of excellent springs in the 
parish, one of which, situated about 200 yards from the town, af- 
fords an abundant supply of excellent water.  There are also 
some mineral springs ; but they have never been correctly ana- 
lyzed nor have they been resorted to for medicinal purposes. There' 

• The water was brought into the town, ami two handsome receivers of cut stone 
whence tlie water is drawn were erected by Sir W. P. llunie Campbell, Bart, who 
has been on this as well as many other occasions a judicious and liberal benefactor to 
tlie town of Greenlaw. 



GREENLAW.

is a loch in the moor north of the town, called the. Huille moss 
or loch. It is of small extent, and of no great depth. 

The Blackadder or Blackwater, which is joined by a small 
stream, called the Faungrass, about two miles above Greenlaw, is 
the only river that runs through the parish. Advantage is taken 
of it for the purpose of working the machinery of one fulling-mill, 
one lint-mill, and two common flour-mills, which have been erected 
on its banks. The water of the Blackadder though its colour is 
black is exceedingly pure. The engineers appointed to equalize 
the weights and measures of the county found it nearly correspond 
to the weight of distilled water. 

Geology. — The Blackadder divides the parish into two parts, 
which differ remarkably from each other in their external charac- 
ter. The southern division is covered with a deep soil, which pro- 
duces excellent crops of grain, and belongs to the new red sandstone 
formation. The northern division, on the contrary, consists of a 
wild moor, clothed with heaths, [Calluna vulgaris, Erica Tetralix et 
cinerea, moor-grasses, and the rein-deer lichen [Cenomyce rangife- 
rina. Where the Blackadder leaves the parish a coarse white 
sandstone is exposed, and over it lies a dark claystone porphyry. 

Along the course of the river, above the town, its banks, which 
are high and precipitous, exhibit a section, and afford inexhausti- 
ble quarries of red sandstone. This rock, which is rather soft, 
has a clay basis, and the fracture presents occasional portions 
of a white sandstone. The sandstone is covered by a thick 
coat of red clay, evidently derived from the disintegration of the 
substrata, and extends as far as the transition range of the Lam- 
mermoors, where it becomes gradually harder and coarse granu- 
lar, and passes into greywacke. Hence the northern division of 
the parish belongs to the old red sandstone formation. Across 
the moor, in the upper part of the parish, runs an irregular gravelly 
ridge, called the Kaimes. The Kaimes extend upwards of two 
miles. The ridge is about 50 feet broad at the base, and between 
30 and 40 feet in height. The ground on the north side is boggy ; 
and on the south is an extensive moss, called Dugden Moss. 

The Kaimes are evidently a natural production, and in endea- 
vouring to account for their formation, it is to be observed that 
the stones scattered over the fields towards the Tweed consist 
principally of greywacke, which must have been detached and car- 
ried thither from the rocks of Lammermoor hills by the agency of 
a current of water setting in from the north towards the south ; 



BERVVIClvSHlKE. 

and as the Kaimes are composed of similar materials reduced to 
a very moderate size, its formation is to be ascribed to the same 
cause. It is generally allowed that mosses are produced from de- 
cayed vegetable matter, such as wood, furze, fern, &amp;c. Now, if it 
be admitted that Dugden Moss was at one time an extensive wood, 
the waters subsiding at the universal deluge, or some more partial 
inundation, and rushing with great impetuosity from the Dirring- 
ton Laws, which are about two miles north-west from the Kaimes, 
would carry with them all the wood and underwood to a conside- 
rable distance, till the collected materials would form a kind of 
dam or weir, through which the waters could not penetrsite, and 
would force up against this dam or weir the gravel and sand which 
form the ridge, in the same manner as is frequently done by rivers 
in certain parts of their courses during great floods. The mate- 
rials of which the ridge is composed, and its shape, which is some- 
what like a horse-shoe with the hollow towards the hills, favour 
this explanation. 

Dugden moss, which consists of about 500 acres, is in some 
places ten feet deep. The peats, when dug from the bottom and 
prope-ly dried, are little inferior to coals. The moss rests upon 
a fine sand. 

II. — Civil History.  

Land-oioners. — Sir William Purves Hume Campbell, Bart, of 
Marchmont, is the chief land-owner, and possesses about two- 
thirds of the lands of the parish. The other heritors are David 
Anderson, Esq. of Rochester; Robert Nisbet, Esq. of Lambden; 
and the Managers of the Orphan Hospital, to whom the farm of 
Old Greenlaw belongs. 

Parochial Register. — The date of the earliest entry in the pa- 
rochial registers is 1669. The registers are not voluminous, nor 
are they quite entire. They are now kept as they ought to be, and 
according to a prescribed plan. 

Antiquities. — There were to be seen a few years ago in this 

 There is a tradition that, upon one occasion, when Sir Patrick Home of Polwiirlh 
afterwards created Earl of Marcliinont was obliged to flee lledbraes house, now 
• called Marchmont, he crossed the country a little above Greenlaw, where he met wiiii 
a man of the name of Broomfield, the miller of Greenlaw mill, who was repairing a 
slap in the mill caul. Sir Patrick addressing him by the occupation in which he was 
engaged, said, Slap, have you any money u]on wliicli liroonifield supplied him with 
what was considered necessary for his present exigency. Sir Patrick was obliged 
about this time to go over to Holland, and when he came back witli King William, 
did not forget his former benefactor. It is not known what return he made him, but 
the family were settled in a free house so long as tliey lived, and always retained the 
name of Slap. 'I'lic last of the family died aiiinit fourteen years ago, and frequent 
mention is made in the kirk-session records of Broomlield of Slap.

neighbourhood the ruins of two religious houses dependent upon 
the priory of Kelso, when Popery was established in this country, 
but there is not now a vestige of them remaining. 

There are the remains of an encampment about two miles above 
the town, at the confluence of the Blackadder and Faungrass 
rivers, and on the very verge of their precipitous banks. The 
camp, which is called the Blackcastle Rings, is on the northern 
side of the river; and on the south side, exactly opposite, is the 
beginning of an entrenchment which runs about half a mile 
along the bank, and then turns off to the south in the direction of 
Hume Castle. That part of it which runs in a southerly direction 
is called the Black Dikes. In removing the turf for a quarry in 
the hne of this trench, a number of gold and silver coins of the 
reign of Edward III. were found about two years ago. A piece 
of a silver chain was also found at the old camp. 

Several silver coins were found this summer in clearing away 
the old buildings connected with the Castle Inn, but these coins, 
as well as the others above-mentioned, were seized by the work- 
people, — except a few, which were given to Sir William Purves 
Hume Campbell, Bart. 

There are several barrows or cairns in the north-west part of 
the parish, one of which was removed a few years ago by some 
people who were employed in building dikes ; below it, was found a 
human skeleton, which was so placed as to lead to the belief that 
the body had been cut through the middle, and the one-half placed 
over or above the other. 

Modern Buildings. — Besides the New Jail, to be afterwards no- 
ticed, there is an elegant County Hall, which has just been finished. 
The building is of Grecian architecture, and of very chaste design. 
It contains a large hall 60 feet long by 40 feet wide, the ceiling is 
28 feet in height. The hall is adorned with two fluted columns 
with Corinthian capitals at each end. There are also a number of 
other apartments in the building for the accommodation of the 
sheriff" and the gentlemen who attend the county meetings. There 
is in front a beautiful vestibule surmounted by a dome, in which 

' About a mile north from the town, an old wall or earthen mound, with a ditch 
on one side, known by the name of Herriot's Dike, runs across the parish. It could 
at one time have leen traced fourteen miles eastward, and tradition says it proceeded 
in the same direction as far as Berwick. It is snjiposed to iiavc extended westward 
t a place in the parish of Iejerwood called Boon ; a word in the Celtic language sig- 
nifying boundary or termination. It is not known by whom or at what lime this wall 
was built, nor for what purixwe it was iiilenik'd.

there is a firesproof room for holding the records of the 
county.  

There is now in progress a new Inn, intended to supply the place 
of the Castle Inn, — which, when finished, will be found to be one of 
the best and most commodious upon the road between London and 
Edinburgh. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755 the population was - 895 

1785, - - 1210 

1811, - - 1270 

1821, - - 1349 

1831, - - 1442 

It may be proper to add, that in 1821, thie population of the 

town of Greenlaw was 765, that of the country parish 584: in 1831, 

the town population was 895, that of the country parish 547.f 

1. Number of families in the parish, - - - 302 

of families chiefly employed in agriculture, - . 84 

chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 87 

of other families, - - - - 131 

The average number of illegitimate births yearly, during the last 
three years, has been four. 

It appears from the foregoing statements that the population 
has been and still is upon the increase. This may be accounted 
for in part by the improvements which have been made in the 
town, by the encouragement which has been afforded to labourers, 
by the improved state of agriculture, and the increasing comforts 
of the people. 

Almost the whole of the town of Greenlaw is feued. The feu- 
ars 80 in number are a respectable class of people. There are 
several instances of longevity in the parish. A man died lately 
upwards of ninety, and five or six of the villagers are between eighty 
and ninety. 

Character and Manners of the People. — The inhabitants of this 
parish are in general sober and industrious. There are some, in- 
deed, as there are in every community, of a different character, but 
they are few in number. Those who are frugal and industrious 
enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts and advantages of so- 
ciety, and are contented with their situation and circumstances. 

 This noble edifice was built at the sole expense of Sir W. P. II. Campbell, Bai t, 
of Marchmont, and presented by him to, the county. The gentlemen of the county 
have requested Sir William to sit to one of the most eminent artists for liis bust, to 
be put up in the large hall in token of their resjjcct aiul gratitude. 

f Of the population in 17U5, 223 were below eight years of age; of the 987 who 
were above eight years of age, 832 belonged to the Establislied church, 62 were 
Burghers, 82 Antiburghers, 7 Camcronians, and 4 of the Relief persuasion.

The common above referred to is pastured during the whole year 
by the cows of the villagers. Every householder appears to have 
a right of pasturage, and the cattle are tended by a common herd. 
They are brought home every night, and sent out on the morn- 
ing. The right of pasturage is of considerable value, and enables 
the greater number of the householders to keep a cow. The ex- 
pense of herding to each individual amounts only to a few shiUings 
yearly. 

Rent of Land. — The valued rent of the parish is L. 6836, 3s. 
lligcl- Scots. The rent of land varies according to its quality 
and situation. Near the town of Greenlaw, where it is let in small 
portions, the rent is from L. 1, 10s. to L.3 an acre ; enclosed arable 
farms let at from L. 1 to L. 2 an acre ; unenclosed farms, which 
are partly in tillage and partly stocked with sheep, are not let by 
the acre but in the lump. About fifty years ago, the real rent of 
the parish did not exceed the third part of what it is at present. 

The great rise of rent is owing not so much to any considerable 
rise in the price of grain as in the price of sheep and cattle, and 
the vast improvements which have been made in agriculture, by 
which more grain is raised than formerly. 

Rate of Wages. — The price of labour has greatly increased since 
the late improvements were introduced into Berwickshire. Far- 
mers' men-servants, who have their victuals in their masters' houses, 
receive from L. 8 to L. 12 a-year; the women from L. 7 to L. 8. 
But most of the men-servants employed in husbandry are married, 
and eat in their own houses. They receive for meat and wages 
twelve or thirteen bolls of grain, L. 4 in money, food for a cow dur- 
ing the whole year, with some other allowances, which may amount 
in all to L. 25 yearly. 

Men day-labourers, when they furnish their own victuals, which 
they generally do, receive Is. 6d. or Is. 8d. a-day, except in mow- 
ing time and in harvest, when they get 2s. or 2s. 6d. per day, with 
their victuals; women receive for working at hay and weeding turnips 
Is. a-day, without victuals. The day's wage of a mason in summer 
is from 2s. 4d. to 3s., of a carpenter the same. Work, however,

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Tow7is.— The town of Greenlaw is a burgh of barony, 
the superior of which is the proprietor of the estate of Marchmont 
It was created the head burgh of the county in the year 1669, 
and the public meetings of the freeholders are regularly held there 
It is long since any weekly market was held in the town of Green- 
law. Regular markets for the hiring of single servants, and the 
sale of cattle and sheep, have been lately established ; and on the 
first Thursday of May 1834 being the first of the late established 
markets a good deal of business was done. 

Means of Communication.— There is a post-office in the town, 
and the communication by the curricle mail is uncommonly rapid. 
Letters'from London reach us in about forty hours, and letters from 
Edinburgh in three hours and a-half. 

There are about eighteen miles of roads in the parish, which are 
kept in a good state of repair by the conversion money. A dailv 
coach to and from Dunse and Edinburgh passes through Greenlaw. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which is in the town of Green- 
law, is conveniently situated, being nearly in the centre of the pa- 
rish. It was lately repaired and painted, and although it is too 
narrow considering the length of it, which is the case with almost 
all old churches, yet it is upon the whole a very comfortable place 
of worship. 

Broomjield's Mortification. — In the south wall of the church 
outside is a monumental slab put up by the kirk-session in the 
year 1744, to the memory of Thomas Broomfield, a considerable 
benefactor of the parish, who died in the year 1667. He left a 
legacy of 2000 merks Scots to the kirk-session, a part of the inte- 
rest of which is expended yearly, in terms of the deed of mortifica- 
tion, in the education of poor children, and the remainder in sup- 
plying the wants of the poor. It appears from an inscription upon 
the church bell, that it M'as also a present from him ; and it is said 



GREKNI-AVV. 



47 



that he left funds for building a bridge over the Blackadder, at the 
west end of the town. 

Manse, 8fc. — The manse was built in the year 1817, and an ad- 
dition, was made to it in the year 1829. It is a very commodious 
and comfortable dwelling. The stipend is 15 chalders, 14 bolls, 
3 firlots, 3 pecks, and 3 lippies, one-half of which is barley, and 
the other half meal, with the exception of about seven bolls of oats. 
The money stipend amounts to L.31, 7s. 6d. Sterling. The va- 
lue of the grain and meal is fixed annually by the county fiars price 
of grain and meal. The average amount of the stipend in money 
for the last seven years is L.271, 3s. 4d. The glebe consists of 
ten acres, and is worth about L. 30 of yearly rent. 

Divine service in the Estabhshed church is well attended by 
about 204 families. The average number of communicants may 
amount to about 370. The average amount of church collections 
may be stated at L. 14 yearly. 

There are two dissenting or seceding chapels in Greenlaw, at- 
tended by about 98 families. The ministers are paid by their 
hearers. 

A branch Bible society, in connection with the Berwickshire 
Bible Society, was established here several years ago, the annual 
contributions to which amount to about L. 15. 

Education. — There is one parochial, and one private school. 
The branches of education taught in the parochial school are 
Latin, Greek, French, mathematics, &amp;c. The schoolmaster has 
the maximum salary, and a very excellent house, to which is at- 
tached the legal quantity of ground for a garden. The average 
number of scholars may be stated at 130. The fees actually re- 
ceived by him amount to about L. 45 Sterling a-year. 

Library. — The inhabitants of Greefilaw have long enjoyed the 
advantage of a subscription library, which contains a very good col - 
lection of books. There is also a small library in connection with 
one of the dissenting congregations, for the use of the children who 
attend the Sabbath school. 

Friendly Society. — A friendly society was established in the year 
1814, which has been of great advantage to the members. It was 
remodelled about two years ago, agreeably to the instructions con- 
tained in the table published by the Highland Society. The so- 
ciety consists of 150 members. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The heritors and kirk-session meet 
twice a-year, about the terms of Whitsunday and Martinmas, for 



48 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



the purpose of making provision for the poor. At each of these 
meetings an assessment is made sufficient for maintaining those 
that are admitted upon the roll for the ensumg half-year. One- 
half of the assessment is paid by the heritors, and the other half 
by the tenants. The heritors are very liberal in providing for the 
poor ; and yet the poor-rates are not very high, — not amounting 
to more than sixpence in the pound Sterling of real rent. They 
are kept thus moderate by a minute attention to the v,-ants of the 
industrious poor, who are often prevented from becoming enrolled 
paupers, by a httle judicious and timely aid in sickness. The ave- 
rage number of persons receiving parochial aid for the last five years 
is 28 ; and the average usual sum allotted to each individual is L. 5 
Sterling. The average amount, for the last five years, of contri- 
butions for the poor, is L. 298 Sterhng a-year ; whereof L. 16 arise 
from church collections ; L. 222 from legal assessments ; and L. 60 - 
from alms or legacies. 

Fairs. — There are two fairs held annually in Greenlaw, — one 
on the 22d day of May, and the other on the last Thursday of 
October. They afford a good market for milch cows and lean 
cattle. A great deal of business is generally done at the summer 
fair. «. 

Inns. — There are in Greenlaw 1 principal inn, 1 inferior one, 
and 7 alehouses. 

Jail. — A new jail was erected in the year 1824. It is a very 
neat building, consisting of two day rooms for felons and one for 
debtors, with eighteen sleeping cells. There are three courts to 
which the prisoners have access during a part of the day. The 
building is surrounded by a very high wall, upon the top of which 
is a chevaux de frieze, which renders it quite secure. There is 
a plentiful supply of water 'within the jail, and the whole establish- 
ment is kept in a state of perfect order and cleanliness. The ave- 
rage number of prisoners may be stated at 8, — they are chiefly 
felons. 

Fuel. — The chief article of fuel is coals, which are brought from 
Northumberland, — a distance of eighteen or twenty miles. They 
are sold by weight, at from 6d. to 8d. per hundred weight. A few 
turf and peats are also used, but the expense and trouble of winning 
them is so great in proportion to their value, that the use of them 
is nearly given up.  

• Sir William P. H. Campbell, Bart, built, a clciot for coal, and gave L. 50 to fill 
it. The poor, who formerly ]ail very dear for their coals, ly buying them in small

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It is impossible to view the high lands in the northern division 
of the parish, which extend to thousands of acres, without regret- 
ting that they should have continued so long the almost exclusive 
habitation of the moorfowl and the lapwing. It is true that the 
quality of the soil, — its altitude, — and its distance from lime and 
markets, — preclude the idea of its amelioration by tillage, and by the 
present improved system of agriculture; but were these bleak and 
barren moors judiciously enclosed, drained and planted, they would 
assume a new and improved aspect ; in place of the heath and the 
rein-deer lichen, we should have the fir and the oak, and what is 
now a sterile waste, would soon become a leafy forest. The pro- 
prietor would thus sow the seed of an ample and certain harvest, 
for it is a well known fact that nothing tends more to enrich and 
to fertilize than thriving and extended plantations. The high 
would then rival the low lands in beauty nd productiveness, and 
every spot, even the most sterile, would ultimately become as 
beautiful and fertile as it is possible for skill and industry to 
make it. 

quantities, are now supplied from the depot at a moderate price. Sir William made 
the inhabitants a present of a weighing-machine, which has been of essential service 
to them. Coals, which were formerly sold by the cart-load, are now sold by the 
weight.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES THOMSON, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries. — The name Eccles occurs in each of the 
three kingdoms. It was a sirname and baronial title of great anti- 
quity in Dumfries-shire, and was carried in the beginning of the 
seventeenth century, from that county to Ireland, by a cadet of 
the Eccles family. Eccles in Berwickshire seems to have derived 
its name from the number of churches or chapels at one time 
situated in the parish ; for we have evidence that, besides the pa- 
rish church, there was formerly a chapel at Leitholm, and another 
at Birgham.f The term is plainly derived from the Greek word 
signifying a church. 

It appears from the " registrate of the valuation of teinds," made 
in 1634, that the parish was anciently divided into four quarters. 
1. Magealens or southern quarter, comprehending " Lochton, 
Newtoun, Templand, Fairnyrigg and Birgim." 2. St John's or 
northern quarter, including " Mersingtoun, Overplewland, Litle- 
thank, Herdrig, Burnhouses." 3. Ladies or eastern quarter, con- 
taining " Lawrig, Buthrig, Belchester, Newbigging, Antonshill, 
Peill, Stainerigg, Litem." 4. St Cuthbert's or western quarter, 
consisting of " Kennetsydhead, Hassingtoun, Nethermains, Whyt- 
house, Hardaikers, Stainfeeld, and Dedriges." 

The greatest length of the parish from north-east to south west 
is 6| miles, and the greatest breadth from north-west to south-east 
5 miles, and it contains 17.413 square miles, according to Mr 
Blackadder. 

The river Tweed bounds the parish on the south. The whole 
of the parish, with the exception of some slightly elevated parallel 

• This account has been drawn up by Robert D. Thomson, M. D. 

+ The churchyard at Birgliam stiU exists. Tlic chapel of Leitholm stood at the 
west end of the present village. The site of it is marked by an old ash tree known by 
the name of the chapel tree, which grows on tiie sunnnit ot the chapel know. 1 lie ad- 
joining ground was used as a place of burial, and is now cultivated. Bones and cof- 
fins have been occasionally dug up.

ridges, called Cotchet ridge, Brae Dunstan, and Bartlehill, con- 
sists of a plain beautifully fenced, cultivated, and wooded. 

Meteorology. — The heat of springs in the parish is 48°, which 
may be considered the mean annual temperature of the atmosphere. 
The state of the weather from an average of five years is as fol- 
lows : 120 rainy days, 12 snowy days, 39 frosty days, and 234 fair 
days, making the proportion of rainy to fair days as 1 to 2 nearly. 
The mean height of the barometer for two years was 29.390 inches, 
which gives 364 feet for Eccles above the level of the sea. 

Diseases. — The inference drawn here from observation is, that 
disease does not increase in proportion to the gross amount of the 
rain which falls, but according to the length of its duration in the 
atmosphere, or, in other words, to the diminution of the atmosphe- 
ric pressure. Hence the year 1830 in which there were long 
tracks of wet weather was accompanied with many acute diseases. 
Scarlet fever raged with great virulence in the village of Eccles, 
and in Leitholm scarcely a family escaped the small-pox, though 
none died but one child who had not been vaccinated. Measles 
also were very frequent. 

Before the general introduction of draining, intermittents were 
very common, but during the last thirty years they were never 
heard of, until about three years ago, when several well marked 
cases of ague occurred in the village of Eccles. Inflammations, as 
must happen wherever persons are exposed to sudden alternations 
of heat and cold, are frequent, especially during autumn. As far 
as the writer of this article has been able to learn, a case of calcu- 
lus has never occurred in the parish. 

Notwithstanding these incidental complaints, the inhabitants 
may be said to be very healthy. Many attain a very great old age, 
and there are instances of persons reaching nearly the age of a 
hundred. 

Hydrography. — The average depth of the wells in the parish 
is fifteen feet, and the water obtained at this level is extremely 
clear and palatable, which may in some measure be ascribed to the 
great quantity of sulphate of lime which it holds in solution, and 
which is partly separated when the water is evaporated and allow- 
ed to cool. 

The sp. gr. of the well water at Eccles manse is 1.000792 and 

" The propagation of this disease is in a great measure to be ascribed to the ineffi- 
cient manner in which vaccination is performed ; the principal operators being mid- 
wives and otiier ignorant people, who cannot be supposed capable of distinguishing 
between a genuine and spurious vesicle.

it contains in the imperial gallon, sulphate of lime, 57.750 ; com- 
mon salt, 29.752 ; = 87.503. 

On the borders of the parish, at the Leet, there is a chalybeate 
well which was furnished with a stone cover in 1780. The supply 
of water is pretty copious. Its sp. gr. is 1.00237, and in summer 
the temperature is 48°. The solid contents are sulphate of lime, 
common salt, and a minute portion of iron held in solution by car- 
bonic acid. At the east of Birgham Haugh there are springs ori- 
ginating in the calcareous sandstone, which are impregnated with 
bicarbonate of lime, and when they drop upon plants, leave a de- 
posit by which elegant masses are formed. 

The river Tweed forms part of the south boundary of the pa- 
rish, and separates it from Northumberland. Its breadth on the 
west side of the haugh by measurement is 114 yards, and its ave- 
rage depth from 2 to 3 feet in summer. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The best section of the rocks of the 
parish is seen at the Tweed, for the banks of that river rise in the 
form of elevated cliffs, and reach a height of 50 feet in some 
places above its level. They consist of a dark slaty marly sand- 
stone, which contains 25 per cent, of carbonate of lime and a white 
compact sandstone dipping at a slight angle to the south-west. At 
Lochton, thin beds of red massy gypsum with crystals imbedded, 
termed alahuss by the common people, containing  per cent, of 
peroxide of iron and white fibrous gypsum, occur. 

Proceeding along the course of the river, the northern bank 
continues high and precipitous for about a quarter of a-mile, when 
its height gradually diminishes, and at Birgham Haugh exceeds 
the level of the water only by a few feet. Here the bed of the 
Tweed consists of magnesian hmestone, containing red hornstone 
and crystals of calcareous spar. The south bank is formed of al- 
ternations of this rock and claystone porphyry, and these extend 
for some miles up the river. The sandstone of Eccles quarry, 
which is three miles to the north of the Tweed, reposes on a simi- 
lar rock. The analysis of tolerably pure specimens from Hadden 
rig gives nearly : Carbonate of lime, 6.25 ; carbonate of mag- 
nesia, 5.25 = 11.5; or an atom of each, with some impurities; 
a little silica, alumina, and iron. A few shells have been observed 
in this rock. At the east end of the haugh, the sandstone is co- 
vered by amygdaloid, containing green steatite and calcareous spar. 
The upper portion resembles greenstone, and the cavities contain 



ECCLES. 



53 



quartz nodules. The inferior part of the rock has a wacke basis 
approaching to clay, and stilbite occurs sparingly in it. 

In the sandstone which is exposed near Kennetside head, the 
silicious particles predominate to such an extent as to constitute 
almost a quartz rock. The same marly sandstone which is seen 
at the Tweed appears on the banks of the small river Leet, and 
contains thin beds of gypsum. 

From these facts it appears that the whole of the parish is situ- 
ated in the new red sandstone formation. A bluish marl contain- 
ing 30 per cent, of carbonate of lime occurs at Harlaw and Over- 
mains, which was used as a manure, but it seems now to be near- 
ly exhausted. There is considerable variety of soil in the parish, 
that on the banks of the Tweed being light, while to the south- 
east there is some moor land ; in the middle and northern parts, clay 
and loam predominate. 

Zoology. — The banks of the Tweed and the plantations at May- 
field, harbour a number of foxes, weasels, and rabbits. The otter 
frequents Ferneyrig bog. 

Besides about eighty common birds, the parish is occasionally 
visited by some rarer species. Of these may be mentioned the 
Coluviha titrtur turtle dove ; Aquila alhicilla sea eagle ; Turdus 
vescivorus missel-thrush, which was very uncommon till within 
the last three years ; Corythus enucleator hawkfinch ; Alcedo is~ 
pida king's fisher ; Ardea nycticorax night heron or bull of the 
bog ; M.ergus merganser goosander ; Lanius excuMtor, Linn, 
greater butcher bird. 

On the Tweed, the salmon fishery, the property of the Earl of 
Home, had very much declined, but during the last two years it has 
in some measure revived. Pike occurs in the Leet, Ferneyrig and 
Harlaw bogs. 

Botany. — Notwithstanding the high state of cultivation of the 
parish, above 360 Phenogamous or flowering plants grow within 
its bounds. They may all be classed under three soils, but the 
rarer plants alone deserve notice ; I. marshy ; 2. light and moor ; 
and 3. clay soils. 

1. Fernyrig marsh furnishes a considerable variety of the first, 
viz. Hippuris vulgaris Utriculariavidgaris, Potamogetonheterophyl- 
lus natans var. Samolus valerandi, Enanthe ■plidlandrium Par- 
nassia palustris, Spergula nodosa. Banunculus lingua, which occur on 
the borders of the marsh, while the water is overgrown with the 
Arundo phragmites, the stems of which are used for thatching

houses, and by weavers, and the Scirpus lacustris, and Typha latA- 
folia. In the bog south of Hardacres grow the Galium horeale, 
Valeriana cleltoides, and Listera ovata. Pyrola minor in Bank- 
head wood. Epilobium angustifulium, Eupatorium cannabinum, 
Tweedside at Birgham. Potamogeton perfoliatus, pectinatus, pu- 
sillus and lucens, narrow-leaved var. in the Tweed, Nuphar lu- 
tea, pond at Karnes; Iris Jhetidissima, pond at Anton's Hill. 

2. On the banks of the Tweed are the Dianthus deltoides, Ceras- 
tium arvense, the three British Malvae; Euphorbia esula, Birgham 
Haugh ; Centunculus minimus, Mayfield moor. 

3. In the glebe and likewise on the banks of the Tweed, and in 
the fields about Eccles, grows a species of Tragopogon, which has 
been hitherto confounded with the T. pratensis. It was first ad- 
ded to the British Flora during the present year 1831 by the 
writer of these pages, who has been able to identify it as the T. 
major. The Senecio tenuifolius grows near Sunnyside and Grizzle- 
rig. Anchusa sempervirens at Belville and Hassington. Solanum 
dulcamara near Orangelane ; Ricbus ccesius, Tweedside. 

About 40 species of fleshy fungi have been collected in the pa- 
rish, of which 30 are Agarici. Of the latter may be mentioned 
the A. muscarius and A. Listeri. The greater proportion oc- 
cur at Bankhead wood. Alectoriajubata on trees at the same place. 

There are numerous thriving plantations scattered over the pa- 
rish, consisting of every variety of tree, but few of a century's stand- 
ing. The most aged are some elms and ashes at Leitholm Peel, 
and Eccles- House. 

11. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — Birgham, a village on the Tweed, former- 
ly called Brigham, from a bridge which it is supposed united the 
two kingdoms at this point is celebrated as having been the place 
where several important affairs were transacted. In 1188, when 
the distresses of the Holy Land had induced Henry II. of Eng- 
land and Philip of France to agree to tax their dominions in order 
to carry on a new crusade, Henry having determined in a great 
Council in his own kingdom, that a tenth of all the moveables and 
revenues of the clergy and laity should be exacted for that pur- 
pose, sent Hugh, Bishop of Durham, with some other courtiers, 
to collect a similar tax in Scotland. On the arrival of the Bishop 
and his attendants, William the Lion of Scotland met with him 
at Birgham, in an assembly of his bishops, earls, barons, and many 
inferior vassals. The meeting terminated by William informing

and laity to give the Saladin tenth demanded 

On the 17th March 1290, after a dispensation had been ob- 
tained from Pope Nicholas IV. for the marriage of Prince Ed- 
ward, son of Edward 1. with Margaret of Scotland, a numerous 
meeting of the community of Scotland assembled at Birgham, and 
expressed their approbation of the intended match, upon condition 
of Edward's giving them security for certain matters relating to 
the state of their country. This assembly also wrote a letter to 
the King of Norway, informing him of their consent, and request- 
ing him to send his daughter as speedily as possible to England. 
Another meeting, furnished with greater powers, was held at the 
same place about the middle of July following, at which were 
present the Bishop of Durham and five others, who solemnly as- 
sented, in their master's name, to every important regulation made 
by the Scots for securing the independence of their kingdom. 
The death of the young queen soon after in one of the Orkneys, 
as is well known, defeated the intended marriage, f 

Purves-Hall, the seat of John Purves of that ilk, is situated in 
the parish. This family was founded early in the seventeenth 
century. 

Eminent Men. — Eccles was the native parish of Henry Home, 
Lord Kames. He was born at Kames in 1696, and there spent 
his youth. It was in this quiet retreat that he entertained Dr 
Benjamin Franklin and his son in 1759 ; that he wrote many of 
his philosophical works ; and studied those agricultural processes 
which he has so ably described in his " Gentleman Farmer." 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners at present connected 
with the parish are, the Marquis of Tweeddale ; the Earl of 
Home ; Sir W. Purves Hume Campbell ; and Sir John Marjo- 
ribanks. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the parochial regis- 
ters is 1698. The present incumbent introduced a great improve- 
ment in the mode of registration. Every two opposite pages are 
divided into ten columns, and each column has a distinct title, 
stating the names of the parents, their residence, and profession, 
the names of the children, dates of birth and baptism, whether 
public or private, and the names of the witnesses. Two copies

are preserved, one by the minister, and the other by the session- 
clerk. 

Antiquities. — At Crosshall, about a mile to the north of the vil- 
lage of Eccles, there is a cross or monument of white sandstone, 
without any inscription. It consists of a column, which passing 
through a base or pedestal, penetrates into the earth. The late 
Sir John Paterson wished to remove it to near the mansion-house 
of Eccles, and for that purpose employed workmen, who dug seve- 
ral feet into the earth without being able to reach the foundation 
of the column. An antiquarian would regret that this monument 
has never been protected by any enclosure. The column above the 
base measures 10 feet high, 1 foot 6 inches broad on the west and 
east sides at the bottom, and 1 foot on the north and south. The 
pedestal, which is a large solid block of sandstone, is 2 feet 6 inches 
high, and 3 feet square on its upper surface, and is raised 1 foot 
6 inches above the ground, so that the whole elevation of the cross 
is 14 feet. The north face of the column presents the sculpture 
of a cross Calvary, with the upper part surrounded by a kind of 
shield. The west side gradually becomes narrower upwards, and 
has at the summit a circular expansion 1 foot 6 inches in diameter, 
with a cross, and below an escutcheon, with a cheveron in the dex- 
ter and sinister chiefs, and precise middle base respectively, and 
a St John's cross. The south has an escutcheon similar to that 
on the west side, and beneath an ancient double-handed sword : 
the east a circular expansion at top, with a cross, and below, the 
naked figure of a man and a greyhound. Some have supposed that 
this monument was raised to the memory of one of the Percies of 
Northumberland. The conjecture of Mr Robertson is more pro- 
bable, that it was erected after the second crusade, which happened 
in 1 114, the crosses referring, perhaps, to the Holy War, in ho- 
nour of the father of Sir John de Soules, Lieutenant or Viceroy 
to John Baliol. The local tradition says, that a governor of Hume 
Castle was killed on the spot in a skirmish. The place where it 
stands was, till lately, called Deadriggs, and is reported by tradi- 
tion to have been so named from a battle which was fought there,

cross, there are traces of entrenchments, and some cannon balls  
have been found between it and Hume Castle, which stands two 
miles north-west. The latter are, perhaps, remnants of Colonel 
Fenwick's attack upon Hume Castle in 1650. f 

Eccles was anciently the seat of the Bernardine or Cistertian 
nuns. At what period the first foundation of this nunnery was 
laid, no account can be derived from history. According to Hove- 
den and the Melrose Chronicle, it was founded a second time in 
1154, or, according to Cowpar, in 1155, by Cospatrick, Earl of 
March, father to Earl Waldave, and was consecrated to the Vir- 
gin Mary. The abbreviation of the Scoto-Chronicon, annexed to 
Fordun, says that this nunnery was established by the Countess of 
March. In 1296, during the interregnum in Scotland, Ada de 
Frazer, prioress of Eccles, obtained a letter of restitution, in con- 
sequence of the fealty sworn to Edward I. by the Scots. In 1333, 
Edward III., after taking Berwick, received the fealty of the con- 
vent of Eccles, and of the other nunneries in the adjacent country. 
The convent of Eccles was visited 13th November 1523 by the 
Duke of Albany, when retreating from Wark Castle. He stayed 
till midnight, and then marched to Lauder. 

In 1545 the abbey and town of Eccles, together with the tower 
of Mersington, were destroyed by the Earl of Hertford, who, hav- 
ing been entrusted with the command of the troops in the north of 
England, made an inroad into Merse and Tiviotdale, and ravaged 
and burned the whole country in his way, without receiving any 
check from the Scots.:]: 

There is in the public records, Lib. xxi. No. 537, a charter, 
whereby Marieta Hamilton, prioress of Eccles, dispones to Sir 
Alexander Hamilton of Innerwick, the village and lands of Eccles 
in 1569, which charter was confirmed by Queen Mary at Edin- 
burgh the 11th of May, the same year. The place was formed 
into a temporal lordship in favour of George Hume, afterwards 
Earl of Dunbar. § 

The ancient nunnery, from the investigations of the Rev. Mr 
Murray, author of the former Statistical Account, appears to have 
occupied a square of six acres. The only remains of it are a wall,

which forms part of the east gable of the mansion-house, and two 
vauhed cells contiguous to the churchyard. 

On the west side of the ruin, there is a large arched gate or 
door-way 9 feet 8 inches high, and 6 feet 1 inch broad, and within 
this there is part of a ruined stair, and the door of the south cell, 
which is 6 feet 4 inches high, and 3 feet 1 inch broad. The cell 
itself is 22 feet 3 inches by 12 feet 6 inches, and 10 feet 9 inches 
high. The walls are 3 feet 9 inches in thickness. The north cell 
is similar, but less. In digging the adjacent burying-ground, the 
workmen are interrupted by the foundations of walls. Before the 
front door of Eccles House a stone coffin was dug up many years 
ago about 6 feet long, and covered above with flag stones, contain- 
ing the figure of a human body. Nothing remained but some of 
the earthy matter of the bones, which, when weighed by Sir John 
Paterson, was found to amount to an ounce and a-half. 

On the farm of Hassington Mains there is a broad elevation 
which is raised several feet above the surrounding surface, and can 
be distinctly observed for some hundred yards. It is called the 
Karnes by the people in the neighbourhood, who have a tradition- 
ary opinion that it extends from sea to sea. A gravelly ridge, of 
which this seems to be the western termination, can be traced run- 
ning through the parish by Loanknow and Ploughland. It was 
opened some years ago, and found to consist of large water-worn 
stones and sand, compactly thrown together, so as to form a kind 
of fortification, and at one place a heap of wood ashes was disco- 
vered. The adjoining farm on the south is called Kaimflat. 

The production of this ridge, of which there is a similar example 
upon a larger scale in the neighbouring parish of Greenlaw, can 
be satisfactorily accounted for upon the supposition that an aqueous 
current had at some period existed, setting in from the north to- 
wards the south, as the stones found in it were greywacke, and 
therefore derived from the Lammermoor hills. 

On the property of General Hunter, Sir Martin, of Antonshill, 
is Leitholm Peel, the remains of a stronghold, to which tradition 
says the borderers were accustomed to drive their cattle for protec- 
tion during invasions. 

" The frightened flocks and herds are pent 
Beneath the jieel's rude battlement." 

The remnant consists of a wall 31 feet long, about 15 feet high, 
and 4 feet thick.

In 1750, according to Dr Webster, the population amounted to 1489 souls.

During- 1830-31, no less than 94 persons emigrated to America,

preceding census.

Seven persons of independent fortune reside in the parish. 
There are 25 heritors, and of these 5 cultivate their own lands. 

There are 1 insane and 4 fatuous persons in the parish. 

Language, Customs, Sfc. of the People. — The language spoken 
by the common people corresponds with that of the greater part 
of the Lowlands. One peculiarity, however, in the pronunciation 
of the syllable ch, pertains to this parish, as well as to the rest of 
Berwickshire. Thus, cheap is pronounced sheap; church, sliurch. 

A curious custom connected with marriage is still kept up by 
the youths here. Once a-year, or oftener, according to circum- 
stances, all the men who have been married within the last twelve- 
month are creeled. This consists in having a creel or basket sus- 
pended to the individual's shoulders, and, while he runs with all 
his speed from his own house to that of his next new-married 
neighbour, he is pursued by the unmarried men, who endeavour 
to fill his basket with stones. The wife, following armed with a 
knife, strives to relieve her husband of his burden, by cutting the 
rope which attaches the basket to his person. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — In no part of the county of 
Berwick has agriculture made greater progress than in the parish 
of Eccles ; for the whole of it, consisting of 11,000 acres, is ara- 

 The actual average of births is here under-rated, because very few dissenters en- 
tor their children's births in the register. Tlio biu-ials also given hero are under the 
true number, because no accurate account is kept of the intcrmenls in I3irgl\anv 
cluircliyard.

ble, and, being all enclosed and studded with thriving plantations, 
it presents to the view a rich and elegant appearance. 

The increase of the rental within the last forty years is a strik- 
ing proof of the improvement of the land, but is not greater than 
was anticipated. Mr Murray states the amount of rent in 1793 
to be L. 11,000, but adds, " it would not be surprising if in the 
course of a few years the rental of the parish should exceed 
L. 18,000 or L. 20,000." Accordingly, in 1822 it amounted to 
L. 20,000, the valued rent being only L. 15,604, 3s. 4d. Scots. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent per acre is under L. 2. The 
size of farms varies from 50 and under to 1000 acres. The rents 
of co\irse vary in proportion, the greatest being L. 1400. 

Husbandry. — The general duration of leases is 19 and 21 years, 
but one or two farms are let for 15 years. Most of the larger 
tenants keep a greater or smaller number of sheep, principally of 
the Cheviot and Leicestershire breeds. The former, from their 
greater hardihood, are best suited for clay lands. The four shift 
husbandry has been long, and for some time successfully practised 
here. Excellent wheat, oats, and barley are produced. Turnips 
are raised by every farmer, both for sheep and cattle, and, although 
the light soil of the southern part of the parish is best adapted for 
their growth, yet in the clay and loam they attain a very fair size, 
and are healthy and well-flavoured. In all the stiff" lands it has been 
remarked of late years that the broad-leaved clover {Trifolium 
pratense sown in spring rarely stands the ensuing winter. Va- 
rious reasons have been assigned for this, but the fact indicates 
the propriety of making some change in the present rotation, and 
the employment of gypsum as a manure.  

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — The parish is very well supplied with respect to mar- 
kets, for, although there are none within its bounds, yet Kelso and 
Coldstream are only about 6 miles, and Berwick 18 from the centre 
of the parish. There are four villages in the parish, and of these 
Leitholm is the largest, having a population of 343 souls, and a 
bye-post to Coldstream. 

Means of Communication. — The London road from Edinburgh

by Greenlaw traverses the parish from north to south, by which 
the mail passes daily and that from Edinburgh to London by 
Kelso, with the road from Kelso to Berwick crosses it from west 
to east. A London coach passes by the south road, and there are 
two coaches from Berwick to Kelso. All these turnpikes are kept 
in excellent order, and, notwithstanding its extent, there is not a 
toll in the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated about a mile 
from the western side of the parish, and is therefore not so con- 
veniently placed as it might be. It is a large spacious building, 
furnished with a handsome spire, and was built after the model of 
the St Cuthbert's Chapel of Ease, Edinburgh. Its length is 78 
feet 6 inches, and its breadth 34 feet. It was erected in 1774, 
and conveniently holds 1000 people. The expense was 48 months' 
cess, or L. 999, 15s. 7d. All the sittings are private property. The 
stipend is 16 chalders. The manse and glebe formerly lay to the 
south of the mansion-house of Eccles, but their situation was chang- 
ed at the expense of Sir John Paterson. The present manse is 
placed about a quarter of a mile to the east of the church, and was 
built in 1813. The glebe, formerly called Birgham Park, lies in 
front of the manse, amounts to 21 acres, and consists of good land. 
Since the Revolution there have been five clergymen whose names 
and dates of ordination or admission are as follows : — John Lauder, 
1691 ; Matthew Sandilands Dysert, 1731 ; Adam Murray, 1774; 
James Baird, 1797; James Thomson, 1805. 

The average number of communicants for five years preceding 
1829 was 549, but in 1831, in consequence of the emigration, the 
number was only 505. As to the number of Dissenters in the pa- 
rish, no exact statement can be given, as they vary every year from 
the annual emigration and immigration of hinds. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish, but only one 
of these is a parish school, the remainder being entirely supported 
by school fees. The parochial schoolmaster teaches Greek, La- 
tin, English, writing, and mathematics, and has two chalders of 
salary. Mr Waddel, the present schoolmaster, has the merit of 
having established, at his own expense, a library for the use of 
his pupils, and he finds that they are much benefited by private 
reading. He has the maximum salary. 

Charitable Institutions. — An association termed the " Eccles 
Friendly Society," was established on the 31st March 1808, for 
the purpose of relieving its distressed, infirm, and indigent mem-

bers. The fund ainoiiiited in 1826 to L. 267, 8s. 9d. At pre- 
sent it is L. 329, 10s. 5d. and the number of members 79. 

Poor. — The poor are supported by assessment, and those who 
may want occasional aid are relieved by the money collected in 
church on Sunday. Assessment produces here, as wherever it has 
been introduced, a carelessness about providing for old age, but it 
would be improper not to mention that the highest spirit of inde- 
pendence is exhibited by many as long as nature will permit. 
The average number upon the poors' roll for the last year is 50, 
and the different rates by which the poor are paid quarterly vary 
from L. 2, 5s. 6d. to 10s. The amount of assessment from Mar- 
tinmas 1830 to 1831 is L.270, 9s. Id., and the number of months' 
cess 13. 

The system of poor rates commenced here in 1763 ; the num- 
ber of months' cess then charged was 2, and the sum L. 44, 12s. 
4d. The highest amount of assessment was in 1819, when it was 
L. 416, and the number of months' cess 20. The greatest ave- 
rage of paupers on the roll was 62 in 1820, and the smallest 16 
in 1766. 

Inns. — There are six inns and alehouses in the parish. Such 
a proportion for the population is far too high, and hence they are 
a great evil to the lower orders. 

uel. — Coal and lime are brought from North Durham; and 
the distance 15 miles at which the collieries are situated consti- 
tutes one of the greatest disadvantages under which the parish 
labours. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking differences between the present state of the 
parish and its condition when the last Statistical Account was 
drawn up, a period of 38 years, are in the following particulars : 
The rental has nearly doubled. The number of tenants in 1793 
was 56, now it is 36. Previous to 1793 the population was ad- 
vancing at the rate of 727 in a century, or about 1\ per annum. 
Now it is at 240 per century, or about 2| per annum. The poor 
have increased 13 ; and the poor rates have trebled. The regis- 
tered births, deaths, and marriages have all diminished by the re- 
spective numbers, 49, 3, If.

PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. ROBERT JAMIESON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 8fc. — The original name of this parish was 
Wolfstruther. In the old glossaries the word Strutlier is defined 
to be a naked and swampy place, so that from the etymology the 
parish appears to have anciently been an extensive marsh, occu- 
pied by wild animals, especially wolves.  As these animals dis- 
appeared, the first part of the original name fell gradually into dis- 
use, and gave place to the prefix West, meant to distinguish this 
from another morass which lay to the eastward, and was called 
Easter Anstruther, now Dogden Moss. 

It was only of a comparatively modern date that Westruther be- 
came a separate and independent parish. It belonged anciently 
to the widely extended parish of Home. On a new parochial di- 
vision of this district at the Reformation it became a part of the 
parish of Gordon, and, down to the year 1647, the inhabitants of 
this place had no nearer place of worship than the church of Gor- 
don. That church, however, being about eight miles distant from 
the most northerly part of Westruther, and there being no communi- 
cation but through almost impassable moors, a disjunction was ef- 
fected, and the people supplied with religious ordinances at Bas- 
sendean, which was selected from the double reason of there being 
an old Catholic chapel there, which, though it had been discon- 
tinued since the Reformation, was still in good condition, — and of 
its being the site of a populous and thriving village. This, how- 
ever, was only a temporary arrangement. For in two years after, 
the inhabitants of Wedderlie, Thornydyke, and Spottiswoode, at 
each of which places there were hamlets of considerable extent, 

• This description is confirmed by immemorial tradition, and was adopted by the 
author of an old manuscript account of Berwickshire, who, in his notice of Westru- 
ther, describes it " as a place wliich of old had great woods, with wild beasts, fra 
quhilk the dwellings and hills were designed, as Wolfstruther, Roccleugh, Hindside, 
Ilartlaw, and Ilarelaw." 



G4 UERWICKSIIIRE. 

being still dissatisfied with the distance, the heritors agreed to 
make choice of a more central situation for a church, and, accord- 
ingly, the minister was removed from Bassendean to Westruther 
in 1649. 

The parish is of an irregular form, though it inclines to circular. 
It is about 7 miles in length from north to south, and 5 at its 
greatest breadth from west to east. It is bounded on the north 
by Cranshaws ; on the south by Legerwood and Gordon ; on the 
west by Lauder ; and on the east by Longformacus and Greenlaw. 
The north is considerably elevated above the rest of the parish, 
the highest point being 1260 feet above the level of the sea. 

Topographical Appearances. — The whole of the northern quarter 
presents the appearance of a continuous ridge of hills, whose bleak 
and barren summits are destitute of every attraction, save that of 
affording a wide prospect of the rich and beautiful scenei'y of Merse 
and Tiviotdale. Descending from this northern boundary, it ap- 
pears an extended valley, unbroken by the smallest eminence, and 
intersected by varied spots of heath, pasture, and arable land in 
the centre it rises throughout the whole extent from west to east 
to a considerable elevation, and again inclines to a gentle slope 
at the southern extremity of Bassendean. There is no point with- 
in the parish which commands an entire view of the whole, or from 
which any thing more than a small detached portion can be seen 
at once. But from the neighbouring heights of Lauder, or after 
passing the moor of Greenlaw on the east, it appears to great 
advantage, with its stripes of waving plantation stretching in 
every direction, and comes on the traveller with an agreeable sur- 
prise to find so rich and cultivated a spot, where he might little 
expect it, skirting the cold and heath-clad brow of the Lammer- 
moors. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of Westruther was considerably 
colder than that of the lower parts of the county. But this has 
been remedied in a great degree by thfi growth of wood, and espe- 
cially by the extensive drains that have been cut in various parts 
of the parish. The rains which the powerful attraction of the Lam- 
mermoors brought down in the earlier part of the season, and the 
frosts which were so common and so severe in autumn, made the 
people in the low boggy parts of the parish, about thirty years ago, 
lay their account with having their crop damaged every four or five 
years. So much, however, has now been done by planting and drain- 
ing to subdue the rigours of a capricious and ungenial climate, that 



WESTRUTIIKH.

the fanners can calculate on the regular return of favourable weather 
with nearly as much certainty here as in any other part of Berwick- 
shire. The boggy character of the soil makes dry weather themost fa- 
vourable for the production of grain, which, indeed, was never known 
to fail from drought but in 1826. The crop is often excellent and 
luxuriant here, when a long tract of dry and scorching weather has 
been attended with injurious effects in more favoured regions. A 
wet season is what most of all awakens the fears of the farmers of 
Westruther ; and where it does not prove ruinous to their hopes, 
leads invariably to a late harvest. 

Of the winds to which the parish is exposed, the west wind is 
the most prevalent, and productive of greatest injury to trees and 
to grain, while the north-east is generally the coldest, and the 
never-failing harbinger of a storm. Formerly, in the most marshy 
places, rheumatism and a good deal of croup prevailed. But these 
have so entirely disappeared with the improving condition of the 
parish, that there cannot now be said to be any distempers indige- 
nous to the district; and such is the known salubrity of the climate, 
that for a long time a boarding- school of considerable celebrity was 
kept in the parish, which was attended by young men belonging to 
families of the first respectability in the country. 

Hydrography. — The springs are numerous, and, except during 
very violent heats, are perennial ; so that a scarcity of good potable 
water is never known in the parish. All of these springs on the north 
side of the parish issue from greywacke, and all on the south from 
sandstone freestone. That from the former was lately analysed by 
an eminent chemist, who pronounced it to be almost pure, with the 
smallest portion of carbonate of lime. In Harelaw moor there is a 
spring of a chalybeate nature, which is perpetually boiling, and has 
never been known to freeze during the greatest intensity of winter. 
It is bottomed with flags, to which it has given a very yellow tinge, 
and is about nine feet long, and six broad, and from two to three 
feet in depth. It is reputed to be very efficacious for the removal 
of scurvy, and was much resorted to in former times, by patients 
who came from a distance to lodge on the spot for the benefit of 
drinking it. It is still as copious as formerly, but its virtues have 
fallen very much into oblivion, and it has been so long neglected, 
that it is nearly covered up by a crop of luxuriant rushes. 

There are several rivulets, which roll a considerable volume of 
water, and all of which flow in a southerly direction; some westward, 
as tributaries to the Leader ; others choosing an easterly course, con- 

BRRWICIC. K

tribute to swell the Tweed. The only river is the Blackadder, one 
of the tributaries of the latter, which takes its rise at Wedderlie. 
Flowing in a south easterly direction, it separates Westruther from 
Greenlaw, and during its whole course through this parish, which 
including its windings, cannot exceed three miles, it is inconsider- 
able both in breadth and quantity of water. It increases in magni- 
. tude, however, as it descends along the skirt of Harelaw moor, where 
it meanders through a fine rich meadow, the sloping sides of which 
want only a little plantation ta render it one of the most beautiful 
and romantic solitudes in the whole of Lammermoor. 

Geology. — The parish abounds chiefly with greywacke, the beds 
of which are interspersed with perpendicular beds of imperfect 
slate. There is no covering over greywacke but the natural soil. 
A stone quarry occurs at Houndslow, from which excellent stones 
of a pink colour are procured for building, of which several houses 
in that village, and the external part of the new mansion at Spot- 
tiswoode, are composed. Over the whole of the stone in this south- 
ern district, which consists of sandstone freestone, there is a cover- 
ing by a red dent. A I'ed sandstone is found to the north-west of the 
village of Westruther, and a quarry at Flass, of a coarse grain. There 
is a little mica in this stone. About twenty-eight years ago, a slate 
quarry was wrought at Bruntiburn, in which, many roods of pave- 
ment for soles of drains were found, but this slate was found not to 
be of a durable quality. There is little or no marl, although shell 
marl was found in a pit at Whiteburn, to the depth of seven feet, 
and rock marl appears in a quarry which is now in the course of 
being wrought at Wedderlie, in a vein about two inches thick. 
Sand is found in great abundance in various parts of the parish. 

Fossil organic remains have been discovered at different times, but 
neither in such number, nor such a state, as to enable us to give a 
satisfactory account of them. It may be mentioned, however, that the 
antlers of a deer were found near Whiteburn, and several horns have 
been dug out of the mosses, said to have been of much greater dimen- 
sions, than those of any living animal; some of them exceeding a foot 
in circumference. All these, however, soon crumbled into powder, 
after exposure to the action of the air. Eight or ten feet below the 
surface of the moss, in Jordanlaw, there is a bed of wood, consist- 
ing wholly of hard wood, out of which bed oaks have been dug of a 
very great size, measuring in one instance twelve feet in periphery. 

Soil— The general quality of the soil is light, with a rocky and 

 Erom the same moss was dug a small bronze urn, supposed to have been a K.- 
man camp-kettle.

gravelly subsoil. Its general depth may average from six inches to 
a loot J but it varies greatly in character in different places; the highest 
farm in the parish, for instance, having a deep clayey soil, which at 
Redhall, especially, has borne good wheat, — the moorland being in 
general a black sandy soil, — the high parts about Spottiswoode dry 
and stony, — whereas a little farther to the west again it is wet. 
The land about Thornydyke and Bassendean js said to be the best 
and richest soil in the parish. 

Zoology. — On this head it may be only noticed, that the Eden 
river, which rises a little to the south of Houndslow, is so cele- 
brated both for the quality and size of its fish, as to attract ama- 
teurs in angling from a great distance. There is also, in deep 
stagnant pools near the source of this streamlet, a shell-fish called 
the diamond fish, — probably the horse-muscle. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is a short account of the ancient state of the parish drawn 
up by Mr Veitch, who was first minister of it, and who, says the edi- 
tor, " wrote for me ane description of Berwickshire in the Merse, 
— twa sheet and a-halfe." It is to be found in Sibbald's Reper- 
tory of Manuscripts in the Advocates' Library. This, with the 
exception of some casual notices taken of it in modern topographi- 
cal works, and of the papers which each proprietor may have rela- 
tive to his respective domains, comprises all the known sources of 
information on the civil history of the parish. The greater part 
of the parish, at least on the eastern side, belonged anciently to 
the family of Gordon, who gave the right of pasturage to the monks 
of Kelso and Melrose, with whom they were ecclesiastically con- 
nected. At the beginning of the seventeenth century it seems to 
have been divided among a great number of heritors, — no less than 
twenty-two having voted themselves, or sent proxies to support 
their interest, at the appointment of a minister. 

Land-owners. — At present there are only six land-owners, — 
John Spottiswoode, Esq. of Spottiswoode; Lord Blantyre in Wed- 
derlie ; Earl of Lauderdale in Harelaw ; Colonel Home, Bassen- 
dean ; Christie of Baberton ; and Somerville, Evelaw. 

Family of Spottiswoode. — Of these families, the Laird of Spot- 
tiswoode is the only large proprietor, and the only one who re- 
sides, though he too has hitherto been an absentee during one-half 
of the year. The family of that ilk have had a local habitation 
and a name in this district long before the commencement of authen- 
tic history, and several of its mctnhors hnve attained the highest 
honours in various departments both in church and state. In the 



BERWJCKSIIIIIE. 



early days of Presbytery in Scotland, John Spottiswoode was su- 
perintendent of the Merse and Lothian, " which office," says an 
old historian, " he discharged with advantage to the church, and 
with honour both to himself and to posterity." The name of his 
son, the Archbishop, is so identified with the public history of the 
period in which he lived, that it would be superfluous to detail it. 
It may be sufficient to mention, that after having studied with great 
eclat under the celebrated Andrew Melville, he was made an Ex- 
traordinary Lord of Session; and having joined the ranks of Epis- 
copacy, was successively raise.d to the Archbishoprick of Glasgow 
and St Andrews, — had the high honour of crowning King Charles 
L at Holyroodhouse, — and was afterwards appointed Lord High 
Chancellor of the kingdom. The reverse of fortune which befel 
him in common with his order, from the national resistance to the 
introduction of the liturgy into Scotland, overwhelmed him with 
grief, and at last brought him to the grave. His remains were 
interred in Westminster Abbey. 

Sir Robert Spottiswoode, son of the archbishop, was born in 
1622. He rose to the dignity of a Privy- Counsellor and Lord of 
Session, and afterwards to that of President of that court. The 
prominent part which he acted in the cause of royalty made him 
obnoxious to the Presbyterians, in consequenee of which he was 
specially excluded from the act of oblivion proposed to be passed 
in 1641 ; but, after a short imprisonment, he was ordered to be set 
at liberty, on finding caution "to conduct himself in away that would 
tend to the peace and quietness of the kingdom." In 1643, he was 
made Secretary of State ; and while he was in Scotland executing 
some commissions which that office required him personally to at- 
tend to, he was taken prisoner at Philiphaugh, — tried by Parlia- 
ment at St Andrews, — and sentenced to be beheaded at the mar- 
ket cross. His character has been variously drawn by historians, 
according to the principles of the party they have espoused ; but 
all allow that he had a great influence in the national councils of 
that stormy period. 

John Spottiswoode, advocate, stands in the records of the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh as first professor of law in the earlier part of 
the last century. He was the author of several excellent works on 
jurisprudence, — particularly the well-known work on Stiles of Writ, 
which has gone through many editions, and, as the preface inti- 
mates, was written for the use of the students in Spottiswoode's 
college of law. 

There was another member of this family who attained the rank 



WESTRUTllER.

of General during the reign of George II., and having made him- 
self conspicuous also in the political world, he was appointed go- 
vernor of Virginia, where he died. 

Family of Home of Bassendean.— The family of the Homes of 
Bassendean have also for centuries been connected with this pa- 
rish, and borne always a most respectable rank in the county. The 
only member of this family, however, known to have been eminent 
in public life was George Home, who Hved in the troublous 
period of the seventeenth century. Being a zealous Presbyterian, 
and having, in conjunction with the lairds of Polwarth, Torwood- 
lee, and others, used all his influence to oppose the arbitrary 
measures of the court, and preserve the integrity of Presbyterian 
worship, he was proscribed, and an order issued for his apprehen- 
sion. He had just time to escape, when the officers arrived, — the 
place of his concealment being a vault contiguous to his own man- 
sion at Bassendean. In that retreat his necessities were supplied 
by the tender and assiduous care of his wife ; and he would pro- 
bably have entirely eluded the vigilance of the King's myrmidons, 
had not the advancing pregnancy of his wife, exciting their suspi- 
cions that he was not far distant, forced him to consult for his safe- 
ty in a remoter place. He succeeded in effecting his escape to 
Holland, then the liberal asylum of the Scottish refugees, and 
joining his former associates, concerted in that foreign land mea- 
sures for the restoration of freedom at home. Bassendean was one 
of that little band of Christian patriots, consisting only of eleven, 
who, with the Earl of Argyle at their head, met at Amsterdam on 
17th April 1685, " and resolved to declare and undertake a war 
against the Duke of York and his assisters, for restoring and set- 
tling the true religion, and the native rights and liberties of the 
three kingdoms." He shared in all the troubles of Argyle's expe- 
dition, and at length, after the Revolution, he was restored to Bas- 
sendean, where he lived to enjoy the fruits of that civil and religious 
liberty which he had done and suffered so much to establish. His 
remains are buried within the old chapel there. 

James Bassantin, son of the Laird of Bassantin, flourished dur- 
ing the reign of James IV., and enjoyed a high reputation for his 
extensive acquirements in the physical sciences. To improve him- 
self in his favourite pursuits he made the tour of Europe, to as- 
certain the state of science on the Continent. On a vacancy oc- 
curring in the mathematical chair of the university of Paris, he 
was elected professor ; and his prelections, which were honoured 
with a numerous attendance of students from all parts of France

and the Continent, were continued till 1562, when he returned to 
Scotland, determined to spend the remainder of his life on his pa- 
trimonial estate at Bassendean. His works, written in Latin, con- 
tain a laborious collection of the theories and observations of pre- 
ceding astronomers, and are monuments of his own extensive ac- 
qun-ements; and, though beheving in the mysteries of judicial astro- 
logy, he certainly deserves to be ranked among the foremost of 
those eminent men who ushered in the dawn of science and lite- 
rature in Europe. 

John V itch.— The name of Veitch, first Presbyterian minister 
and an heritor in Westruther, is intimately connected with the civil 
history of the parish. The fidelity of this excellent man,~his un- 
compromising principles,— his extensive influence and celebrity as 
a preacher, procured him the distinction of being included in the 
number of those Scottish ministers who were watched and marked 
for proscription by the advisers of Charles II. An order was in 
consequence issued for his removal from Westruther, and a curate 
appointed to fill his place. About a year after, however, he return- 
ed to this charge on the death of the curate, and upon a pressing 
invitation from the people. Though his name does not appear in 
the number of indulged ministers, and though he was menaced 
by judicial proceedings, he continued to preach and to enjoy his 
stipend, which was contrary to the law at that period, but was 
in some instances winked at. This eminent man, who was a 
great blessing not only to his parish, but to a widely extended dis- 
trict, and second to none in that age but his more celebrated bro- 
ther, died on his return from the Commission of the Assembly at 
Dalkeith, in December 1703. 

 It is proper to notice here, Mr Tlwinas Bell, a man the very opposite in charac- 
ter to the preceding, and who deserves not to be dragged from the obscurity in which 
his name is buried, but for his connection with, and influence over, the fate of Veitch. 
This unworthy person was born at Spottiswoode, as the historian says, " of the meaner 
sort of gentry," and was in his earlier years patronized by the minister of the parish, 
who gave him his education, brought him up with a view to the ministry, and took 
such an interest in his behalf as to procure money from Torwoodlce and other Christ- 
ian gentlemen, to carry on his preparatory course of studies. The countenance of 
these benefactors, however, was withdrawn on the recommendation of Mr Veitch, who 
got notice that their liberality liad been misapplied ; and Bell, seeing no means of re- 
gaining his respectability in Westruther, and reduced for a time to the greatest extre- 
mities, fled to liingland, where he succeeded in obtaining the curacy of Allcnton in 
Northumberland. No sooner was he settled in tliat jjlaee, than, burning with revenge 
for the affront that Veitch had put upon him, he omitted no means of injuring tlie 
reputation, and ruining the comfort, of his former benefactor. It was througli his 
instigation, and by his calumnious reports, that Veitch first fell under the suspicion 
of the court, and that the mind of Lauderdale, otherwise disposed to befriend him, 
was for a while poisoned against him. The lite and wretclicd dcatli of this Presby- 
terian renegade may be found detailed in Hutchison's Northumberland. 



WESTRUTHER. 71' 

Besides these persons, who were either natives of Westruther, 
or were established residents in it, the following persons spent the 
earlier part of their life, and received their education there : John 
Home, author of the Tragedy of Douglas ; Lord Kaimes, occa- 
sionally; the late James Ballantyne, Esq. printer, and the late 
George Bell, Esq. surgeon, both of Edinburgh; the present Dr 
Douglas of Kelso and others. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest entry in the parochial regis- 
ters is dated November 27, 1655, just seven years after the erec- 
tion of Westruther into a separate parish. This record commenced 
during the incumbency of Mr John Veitch. The registers are not 
voluminous, extending only to three small volumes ; and they seem 
to have been as regularly kept as appears to have been thought 
necessary in former times. Their greatest defect is the want of 
designations. There are many chasms, perhaps during vacancies, 
or when there was no schoolmaster. 

Antiquities. — There were anciently three rehgious houses in the 
parish, — one respectively at Wedderlie, Spottiswoode, and Bassen- 
dean. The chapel at Wedderlie is of great antiquity, as several 
charters relating to it still exist, which were framed in the thirteenth 
century. It has long been in ruins, and nothing remains to mark 
the place where it stood, except a vault belonging to it, into which, 
as tradition reports, the monks at the Reformation conveyed their 
most valuable effects, till a convenient opportunity occurred for 
their removal. That at Spottiswoode was built by the lord of 
the manor during the reign of David IL, for the benefit of his fa- 
mily and hamlet. It received the name of Whitechapel, and long 
stood in ruins, till these were entirely swept away when the ground 
was cleared for building the present offices at Spottiswoode. The 
only relic of it that has been preserved is a baptismal font. The 
chapel at Bassendean, the ruins of which still exist to the height 
of ten or twelve feet from the ground, was employed for religious 
purposes, and served by a vicar, long before the Reformation. The 
church lands, and mansion belonging to the vicarage, were con- 
veyed by the last incumbent to Sir James Home of Coldenknows, 
who obtained from James VI. a charter for the same in 1573. 
The person who thus built his house on church lands, and in the 
immediate neighbourhood of the chapel, was the ancestor of the 
Homes of Bassendean. The interior of the chapel is still used as 
a burying-place by that family.

There are said to be the remains of a Roman camp on the farm of 
Raecleugh, a httle above Bruntiburn, and another in Harelaw moor; 
but the mounds are now so indistinct, and have been so much injured 
by time and other causes, that it is impossible to judge with any ac- 
curacy, from their present appearance, whether or not they are to 
be considered as the vestiges of a Roman encampment. 

A place on the moors of the farm of Wedderlie has from time 
immemorial been called Gibb's cross, where tradition affirms 
that a person of that name suffered martyrdom for his attach- 
ment to the Protestant faith. But the writer of this, notwith- 
standing every inquiry, has not been able to ascertain the truth 
of the report. Among the relics of antiquity may be mention- 
ed also a triangular stone that belonged to the house of Arch- 
bishop Spottiswoode at Glasgow. It was brought hither when 
that house passed into other hands, and is inscribed with the 
Latin words, " Mihi vivere Christus et mori lucrum." It now 
forms the pediment of a window in the lodge-house of Spottis- 
woode. — Harit's dike, which extended from Berwick westward 
along the whole country, passed through this parish to the north 
of the village of Westruther. The tract is still visible. — There 
are no ruins of old houses now except Evelaw, or, as it is popularly 
called, Ively tower, which is still pretty entire, and was one of those 
castellated houses that were common on the borders before the 
union of the two kingdoms, in the reign of James VI. There were 
several of these in this parish formerly, which have all fallen beneath 
the wasting hand of time, but the one now mentioned. There 
were also connected with these what are called vaults, which were 
not subterranean cellars, but buildings erected for the preserva- 
tion of cattle, which were so closely and compactly built, that there 
was no crevice or opening in them, but small holes here and there 
interspersed along the wall, serving the double purpose of admitting 
air to the beasts within, and of allowing the owners to shoot at any 
who might threaten an attack on their property. Both these spe- 
cies of buildings were evidently suggested by the necessities of an 
unsettled period ; when the border reivers, suddenly crossing the 

• A few coins were found on the Flass farm, belonging to the age of David 1., 
and a great quantity of coins was discovered in a cave at the ruins of the chajel in 
Wedderlie. It is to be regretted that these were distribittcd tin'oughout the coun- 
try, or sold to people who cannot now be traced. But it is said thai none of them were 
of an ancient date ; and it is generally supposed that tliey had leen deposited there as 
a place of security by some of the inhabitants of Wedderlie during the religious wars 
of the seventeenth century.

march, carried ofl' whole herds of the neighbouring cattle, and 
when " the good old rule sufficed them, 

, the simple plan, 

That they should take who have the power, 
And they should keep who can."" 

Within the last few years, several stone coffins have been disco- 
vered by the ploughmen in fields which had long lain in pasture. 
The skeletons were in a good state of preservation, and the cof- 
fins constructed of large and broad stones, which were arranged in 
the most regular order. The situation of these graves, coupled 
with the fact, that many similar rehcs have been found in the 
adjoining parish of Lauder, seems to strengthen the tradition, 
that at some remote period, the date of which cannot now be 
ascertained, the cause of Scottish independence was maintained 
on the northern heights of Westruther. The well-known Twin- 
law-cairns, composed of two large piles of stones, and visible from 
a great distance, are the rude and uncemented memorials of the 
same contest, and are said to have been reared f with a special view 
to perpetuate the memory of two persons of the name of Edgar, 
twin-brothers, and leaders in the contending armies, who, ignorant 
of their mutual relationship, resolved to decide the matter by single 
combat. 1. 

 In one of these raids, when, though the attack was chiefly made on the castle of 
Blythe, the baronial residence of Sir Richard Maitland of Ledington, the whole of 
this parish was scoured, it is recorded that 5000 sheep, 200 nolt, 30 horses and mares, 
were taken away by the marauders. It was on this occasion that the poetical knight 
wrote his ballad called the " Blind Baron's Comfort." 

•f The traditionary accovmt of the mode of erecting these cairns is curious. The 
stones were procured from a brook at the northern base of the hill, and the soldiers 
on both sides, having suspended hostilities on the death of their leaders, ranged them- 
selves in a line from the bottom to the top of the declivity, and handed the stones 
from one to another, till their simple monument was completed. 

\ This contest has been celebrated in a poem, which, as it seems to have escaped 
the diligence of the collectors of ancient ballads, it may be proper to insert. It does 
not bear the marks of a very high antiquity, but it has been known here for at least 
a century and a half. I give it as taken down from the recital of an old inhabitant.

Modern Buildings. — The only modern mansion is the new house 
now in the course of being built at Spottiswoode. It is in the old 
English style. The public rooms are of the most splendid descrip- 
tion. It is surrounded by a very handsome terrace, 300 feet in 
length, ornamented by handsome balustrades, pedestals, and vases. 
The corridor is lighted by a well-proportioned tower in the centre 
of the building. The tower itself has a very striking effect when 
viewed from a distance overtopping the tall trees. The new house 
is connected with the old family mansion, which has undergone 
very important alterations, so that the whole will have a unique 
appearance. It is not yet completed, but was fitted up in a tem- 
porary, but very elegant style on a late auspicious occasion, — the 
marriage of Mr Spottiswoode's second daughter to Sir Hugh Camp- 
bell of Marchmont, M. P. for Berwickshire. 

The mansion-house at Bassendean, an old and plain building, 
has been recently repaired and modernized in a handsome style, 
and the adjacent grounds very tastefully laid out. 

The mansion-house at Wedderlie is an antique building, which

" Delay it not," young Edgar said. Old Edgar heard the Saxon's moan,

There are 12 thrashing-mills, 2 corn-mills, and a saw-mill. The

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish seems to have been anciently much 
greater than it has ever been found to be since the census was taken 
under the directions of Parliament,— the decrease being the conse- 
quence, partly, of emigration, and partly of the junction of farms. 
Some of the older inhabitants can enumerate more than thirty on- 
steads, on each of which four or five families were grouped to- 
gether, which are now entirely desolate, and have been converted 
into a ploughed field. Since the census began to be taken, no 
material alteration in the population has taken place.

Habits and Character of the People. — Formerly school-boys were 
accustomed to amuse themselves with cock-fighting on Fasten's eve, 
— each having a cock trained for the purpose, and the victor in the 
contest had, besides the honour of conquest, the burden imposed on 
him of paying for a foot-ball, which ended the sport of the day. This 
barbarous amusement, with which Fasten's eve was ushered in, was 
discontinued when the present schoolmaster came into office, who, 
greatly to his credit, used all his influence to abolish it; and the other 
more innocent game being so closely connected with it, was also gra- 
dually relinquished; the matches often consisted of more than 100 
persons on each side. Sometimes the whole parish turned out, but 
generally the battle was pitched by the unmarried against the mar- 
ried men. There used to be much sport and merriment also at the 
celebration of penny-weddings, but these, on the interference of the 
church courts, were prohibited, and since that period there have 
been no stated amusements of a pubhc kind among the people; — 
the fairs, which occur at various times in the course of the sum- 
mer, affording sufficient opportunity for the relaxation and diversion 



76 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



of the labouring-classes.— This, however, being a pastoral and hilly 
district, it must not be forgotten that there is plenty of amusement 
of a different description, and that the sports of the chace may be 
both enjoyed and witnessed here at almost all times during the sea- 
son. Notwithstanding the temptations presented by the character 
of the country, it is believed that poaching in game does not pre- 
vail to any great extent. — In consequence of the parish being long 
in a sort of insulated state, and the condition of the people exposed 
to no such fluctuations as affect that of a commercial or manufac- 
turing population, the character of the parishioners is distinguished 
by a primitive simplicity, which is not, however, thesimplicity of igno- 
rance, but which is more fitly expressed by open-heartedness, and 
by an absence of all chicanery and guile. In the earlier history of 
the parish, this simphcity was allied with much superstition ; and 
as the character of the country gave most of the people an interest 
in the pursuits of pastoral life, there was no way in which supersti- 
tion showed itself so much as in what related to the preservation of 
their cattle. In almost every stable, stones which had any natural 
hole in them were suspended as amulets; and it was not an uncom- 
mon thing to see a herd grazing in a field — with a piece of red tape 
and mountain-ash on the left horn of every beast to charm away dis- 
ease. Sometimes this spirit of superstition manifested a darker cha- 
racter; and an instance is recorded of a horse having been burnt 
alive at Flass in 1726, during a great mortality that prevailed 
among the cattle. Such remedies have been long ago explod- 
ed : and the mind of the people is evidently advancing; — one 
proof of which is, that formerly there seem to have been one or 
two individuals whom every body regarded as oracles, whereas at 
present there is no such monopoly of wisdom. Religious know- 
ledge, especially, is universally, diff'used, and it is hoped that 
not a few apply it to its practical ends. — The houses of the 
hinds and labourers consist generally but of one apartment, 
which is kept in good order, and would be in most respects com- 
fortable, were it not for the want of chimneys. The fire is lighted 
on the hearth, and there being no outlet for the smoke but a rude 
crevice made in the uncoiled roof, the houses are almost constantly 
filled with a dense cloud, which hovers at the height of 5 or 6 feet 
above the floor. This smoke, proceeding from peat, communi- 
cates a smell to the clothes which is strong and offensive to such 
as are not accustomed to it.

It may be said, however, with propriety and truth, that the people 
in general are cleanly in their habits, and show a becoming neat- 
ness in their dress. About fifty years ago, no man or woman wore 
any clothes but what were made in their own family. Women's 
gowns and petticoats were woollen stulFs of various colours, and 
men's clothes were spun by the women, and sent to the weaver and 
dyer. But now there is scarcely any home manufacture, — even 
blankets, which, till very lately, were made in each family, being pur- 
chased, and that, too, at a cheaper rate than they could be wrought 
at home. The weavers, who were once numerous in the parish, 
are reduced to a single individual ; and he, an old man, who can now, 
since the introduction of machinery, and the change in the market, 
find no other occupation in his way than the manufacture of coarse 
sheeting for sacks or other agricultural purposes. 

The food of the peasantry consists chiefly of the different pre- 
parations of oat-meal ; cakes are also very generally used of barley 
meal, baked to a great thickness, and called fudges. Pork also 
makes a constant item in their bill of fare.  Tea, now very ge- 
nerally used, at least by women, was not introduced here till 
the year 1800, oat-meal being then very high in price. In that 
year the harvest was late throughout the whole of Scotland, 
and the crop in Westruther never thoroughly ripened, in conse- 
quence of which there was a great dearth; meal sold at 8s. a stone; 
rice and foreign corn were bought by the session at Berwick, and 
sold out at a reduced price to those who were able to purchase it, 
and the rest, who were on the poors' roll, were supplied with it out 
of a fund belonging to the session, to be afterwards mentioned. 
Previously to the introduction of potatoes, the people used to pro- 
vide a sort of seasoning to their bread by laying up a stock of her- 
rings. The time for doing this was Lammas, at which season they 
were in the habit of going in bands to Dunbar, and making the 
purchase of as many of these fish as would serve their family dur- 
mg wmter. The introduction of potatoes made an important ad- 
dition to the livelihood of the peasantry. These were a consider- 
able time in the parish, however, before they were generally used. 

• Persons still living remember the time when in the farmers' houses there were 
only one knife and fork, and the jiractice was, for the master of tlie house to appor- 
tion the share of hutcher meat which each member of the family should receive, and, 
retamiiifr the knife and fork for his own use, to leave the rest to eat tlieir meat in the 
primitive oriental manner. Several individuals also remember the time when there 
were only three tea-kettles in the parish,— in Spottiswoodc, Wedderlic, and the manse 
It IS scarcely necessary to say, that the farmers of the present day enjoy, in a liberal 
measure, the ordinary comforts and luxuries of life.

They were at first confined to a small part of a field, which was dug 
with the spade for tRe purpose. But after their utility became known, 
every person in the parish who had a house was furnished with a 
piece of land as large as their manure would cover, on which to 
grow potatoes. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — It appears that a much greater 
part of the parish was in tillage in ancient times than now, as is evi- 
dent from various fields, which, though they have long lain in a 
state of pasture, bear the marks of the plough ; and even as far up 
as the Twinlaw vaults, the high ridges and low furrows of the an- 
cient system of ploughing are still visible ; heather is fast covering 
several places where good grain was wont to be reared. Notwith- 
standing this, however, the agriculture of the parish has been ad- 
vancing at a rapid rate of improvement for the last twenty-five 
years. 

The number of acres which are either cultivated or occasionally 
in tillage is 11,000. The land which is urtder wood may amount 
to about 850 acres, including both natural and planted wood, be- 
sides which, there are about 150 acres lying in a state of moss. 
The total number of acres in the parish will thus be 12,000. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is 12s. per acre. 
The average rent of grazing for an ox is L. 3 ; for a full-grown 
sheep in the low lands 10s.; in the high lands of the parish, 5s. 
The total rental of the parish is upwards of L. 5000. 

Rate of Wages. — The yearly wages of a man-servant is L. 9, with 
his victuals ; of a female who lives in the house, L. 7, with her vic- 
tuals ; of a hind, L. 25 ; of a herd, L. 28. Women, in summer, 
who are hondagers.,  receive lOd. a-day ; those who are not hon- 
dagers, Is., both without victuals; in winter they receive at the 
rate of Id. an hour. Tailors receive from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d., and 
their victuals ; wrights, 2s. 6d. ; smiths are paid L. 3 per yoke of 
horse; dikers are paid 2s. per rood, 5 feet high; labourers from 
Is. 6d. to 2s. 

Live-Stock. — The breed of cattle and sheep has been greatly im- 

• The class of servants here called hondagers are not less free and independent than 
other labourers, but they arc distinguished from others by being engaged by the hinds 
or ploughmen to perform upon their master's form the ordinary work of weeding, hoe- 
ing, barn-work, &amp;c. They receive a rate of wages for the lialf year similar to that of 
house-servants. The hind pays these half years' wages, with board to the bondager ; 
but receives the day-wages earned by the latter, wliich are generally equivalent to the 
wages and board. This arrangement is found convenient, and even necessary, to the 
various oiicrations of a farm in tiiinly peopled districts.

proved. Those whicli pasture on the soil which rests on a freestone 
bottom are generally better and fatter than those which pasture on 
a whinstone soil. The cattle are improved by the Teeswater bulls. 
The sheep are of three kinds, Cheviot and Leicester, and black- 
faced. The hogs here are rather of a coarse description, and those 
which have been brought from England, such as the Cleveland 
breed, have been found to degenerate. About seventy years ago, 
there were few or no pigs in the parish, as there were then no tur- 
nips nor potatoes for them to feed upon. The first pigs reared in 
the parish were at Bruntiburn, as kain to the Laird of Spottis- 
woode. 

The number of Hve-stock in the parish may be estimated as 
follows : — 220 horses ; 816 black cattle ; 6220 sheep. The num- 
ber of cattle of all kinds is greatly increased since the last Ac- 
count was published. The increase arises from various causes. 
In respect of horses, it proceeds chiefly from there being a large 
coach-proprietor in the parish, whose stud is seldom less than 40. 
In respect of other kinds of stock, it proceeds from the present 
high state of cultivation of the arable and pasture lands, and from 
the care taken from time to time to change and improve the breed. 
It may be mentioned as one instance of the rich pastures about 
Spottiswoode, that there was an ox reared there in 1802, which 
was publicly exhibited in all parts of the kingdom, weighing 320 
stones 14 lb. to the stone, and sold for 200 guineas. 

Husbandry. — The general character of the husbandry pursued 
is the four years' rotation. This has been considered fatiguing to a 
light soil, particularly injurious to oats, by bringing on grub, and to 
turnips, by xoAncAUg finger s-and-toes. In some farms, according- 
ly, the tenant is bound to the five years' rotation, that is, to keep 
the field in pasture every fifth year.  : 

With regard to the implements of husbandry, there are no pe- 
culiarities to be mentioned, save that the old Scotch plough con- 
tinued to be used here till a comparatively recent period. It was 
drawn by two horses in front, and two oxen behind; sometimes 

 Turnips were first introduced here in 1765; clover a little before that. The 
field in Wedderlie, where it was first sown, still goes by the name of the Clover park. 
Before the introduction of turnips, the farmers had little occupation for theu" horses 
during summer ; so that after the barley seed was over, they took off the shoes of 
their horses, and set them out to graze till hay time. But few carts were used for- 
merly here ; corn and every thing being carried on horses' backs. In this way the 
farmers drove their grain to Dalkeith market, and when there were several horses, 
the leading one had a hell attached to his neck, to warn the rest of the track through 
the moor.

without horses, and with as many as six or even eight oxen. This 
is now entirely superseded by the improved form of Small's plough, 
and two horses is the common strength applied to it in all parts of 
the parish. Deep-trenching has been tried with success on land 
just reclaimed from a state of waste. Of the manures, besides the 
common farm-yard dung, lime is in the greatest use, and, not- 
withstanding the distance from which it must be brought, which is 
twenty miles, the farmers find their advantage in the abundant ap - 
plication of this excellent and powerful manure. It is laid down 
on the field in dry heaps, and afterwards spread. This has been 
most successfully used on parts of the parish, where formerly the 
only attempt at improvement consisted in burning the heather. 
The fields where this manure is laid for the first time bear two 
successive crops of grain. Bone-dust has also been used. 

The pasture lands about Westruther, as in most other places 
of Berwickshire, anciently lay in a state of undivided common. 
But more than seventy years ago this promiscuous pasturage 
ceased, and the lands were appropriated and fences raised. Al- 
though in those times, when the pasture was enjoyed in common, 
there were certain i-egulations in force by which the tenants fed 
their flocks in various proportions, yet it cannot be doubted that 
the division of the pasture lands has conduced as well to order, and 
to the comfort of the occupiers, as it has done to the improvement 
of the pasture itself, and the consequent better breeding of the 
cattle. Such an appropriation, however, of what had for time im- 
memorial been regarded as common, was a work of no small diffi- 
culty ; and when at last it was, after much and lengthened agita- 
tion, brought to a termination, the scholars attending the school 
were brought out to be witnesses of the several boundaries agreed 
on, as those who in the course of nature would live to attest the 
distribution of the land long after the original promoters of the 
scheme were removed. It was at this time, and from this circum- 
stance, that the feuars of Westruther arose ; the small pieces of 
land which they occupy, and which till very lately were very nu- 
merous, being held of one or other of the large proprietors of the 
parish. 

Plantations. — Westruther was formerly overrun with forests of 
natural wood, which have been greatly diminished within the memory 
of many persons who are still alive, and the only remnant that is now 
to be found of them is the diminutive and straggling wood at Flass. 
In the boggier parts of the valley, on the north side of the parish, 



WESTRUTHER.

tlie stumps of these old trees are visible in dry weather, and not 
iinfrequently interpose unexpected obstacles to the work of the 
mower. This close and stinted wood, surrounded as it was with 
heather and bogs, gave the whole country an aspect of dreariness 
and gloom. If, however, the old natural wood has almost entirely 
disappeared, its place has been more than occupied by more thriv- 
ing and beautiful trees, planted by the hand of man. The sys- 
tem of planting began during the time of the grandfather of the 
present laird of Spottiswoode. It has been regularly carried on 
ever since ; and in consequence of the very spirited improvements 
which the last twenty-five years have witnessed, a very large propor- 
tion of the parish has been beautified and sheltered with wood. 
Formerly it was thought the coldness of the climate was pre- 
judicial to the growth of plantation ; and it was even said, in the 
Reports of the Agriculturists, that no trees would thrive on the 
brow of the Lammermoor. Experience has shown that this opi- 
nion was wrong, since one of the most thriving plantations on the 
whole of Spottiswoode estate is at Bruntiburn, one of the highest 
points in the parish. The failure and the stinted growth of trees 
formerly arose not from the climate so much as from the mode of 
planting on a wet soil, and in small belts, in which no shelter was 
afforded. A more judicious system is now adopted, by first drying 
the ground through drains, and by surrounding the more valuable 
with meaner wood, whose quicker and luxuriant growth mav defend 
the infant saphng, till it in turn rises to maturity, when it can bid 
defiance to the blast. It must not be supposed, from what has been 
said of a regular and extensive system of planting being compara- 
tively recent, that there are no old trees in the parish. There are 
some of a great age, some planes, in particular, which are com- 
puted to be about 500 years old. Larch may be said to be most 
adapted to the climate ; but trees of every kind, and of every name, 
have been planted, and are flourishing. 

Improvements.— It may be mentioned, that a great deal has been 
done here in the way of reclaiming waste lands, and of improving by 
drains in various parts of Westruther. On the Spottiswoode estate 
alone there is the astonishing number of thirty miles of drains inter- 
spersed, from 5, 7, to 13 feet in depth. Besides, there are some thou- 
sand roods of open cuts, averaging from 10 to 20 feet wide, and from 
5 to 7 feet deep, which discharge a large body of water on the 
eastern side into the Blackadder, and on the western side into one of

the tributaries of the Leader. The advantages of this extensive 
system of draining are incalculable ; it has brought into a state of 
tillage, pasture, and thriving plantation many hundred acres which 
were formerly overflowing with water, added much beauty to the 
place, and improved the salubrity of the climate, besides aflfording 
shelter to the cattle. It may be added, that the agreement between 
landlord and tenant in such matters is, that the landlord cuts the 
drains, while the tenant drives the stones, and fills the trenches.  
The general duration of leases is nineteen years; and perhaps in a 
country where so much requires to be done, it would be still more 
favourable for the tenant to have the lease extended to 21 years, as 
has sometimes been done. Subtenants are generally excluded. The 
entry to the possession of the houses and to the grass is at Whitsun- 
day, and to the arable lands at the gathering in of the crop of that 
year. The first half-year's rent is payable a twelvemonth after 
entry. The farms which were about fifty years ago generally very 
small, have been thrown together, and converted into large farms, 
which was certainly a good arrangement for the farmer, and in- 
deed absolutely necessary in a country where the chief dependence 
must always be on the stock. The rent of the largest farm at pre- 
sent is L. 465. Of course the diff'erence cannot be ascertamed 
from this circumstance between the rent of the present day, and 
the rate of land per acre at the period when the farms were of 
much smaller extent. But, in general, it may be stated, as a 
proof of the great improvement which enlargmg the farms has 
been the means of introducing, that a farm which thirty years 
ago was let at L. 30, is now rated at L. 105. The greater part 
of the parish is already enclosed with hedges and dikes, and 
progress is daily making in that department. The accommoda- 
tion afforded to the farmer may be described as m every way ex- 
cellent. The houses are of a superior description, there bemg 
few places where any farmers can boast of a better or more elegant 
and commodious style of building. The houses are generally two 
stories high, wide in proportion, and covered with slate. Ihe of- 
fices bear°generally a proportion in size and neatness to the house 
of the farmer. They are well apportioned, consisting of a stable, 
cow-house, shade for the cattle, a dairy, a piggery, a poultry-house, 
all the appurtenances, in short, necessary for a farm establishment, 
and formed into a rectangle, the size of which varies according to

the character, extent, and other ch'cumstances of the farm. In 
agreements as to buildings or repairs, the tenant engages to drive 
the materials, such as lime, sand, stone, slate, wood, &amp;c. ; and 
the landlord pays the building. The same happens in the build- 
ing or repairing of dikes. On the whole, the greatest encourage- 
ment is held out by every proprietor in the parish to the tenant 
to make improvements, and he who does so on the most liberal scale, 
not only finds his reward in the return made to him from the improv- 
ed state of his farm, but also in the greater readiness of the land- 
lord to accommodate him, and to satisfy his reasonable demands. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Oats, 1117 acres at L. 3, - . L.3351 0 0 

Barley, 183 acres at L. 4, - _ 732 0 0

Market-Towns, Src. — The nearest market-town is Lauder; and 
another market has been recently opened at Greenlaw,— neither of 
which are above seven miles from the farthest part of Westruther. 

The only villages now in the parish are those of Westruther 
and Hounslow. The former is of great antiquity ; the latter was 
erected within these fifty years. 

Means of Communication.—There is no post-office in the parish, 
but while the family of Spottiswoode reside in the country, a cou- 
rier is despatched daily to the post-office in Lauder, of which ar- 
rangement, the parish, as well as the family, receives the benefit. 
The mail-curricle runs every day, and the Edinburgh and Dunse 
coach six days a-week, along the great road from Edinburgh to 
Newcastle, which passes through Hounslow. This line of road 
extends about five miles through the parish. The parish, indeed, 
IS very well supplied with good roads. There were no roads, except 
such as were made by the track, in the year 1745 ; for a person re- 
cently dead remembers well to have seen Sir John Cope's troops 
m then- flight from Prestonpans, scouring the Harelaw-moor, and 
inquinng in what direction Coldstream lay. The road from White- 
burn to Kelso was made in 1800; that from Whiteburn to Dunse, 
durmg the subsequent year, by subscription. It may be estimated

that there are upwards of fifteen miles of turnpike roads, — on which 
there are three bridges, and all in excellent condition. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is nearly in the centre of the 
parish, about three miles distant from the extremities; and although 
it is three quarters of a mile from the manse, yet perhaps there is 
not another place in all respects so eligible for the site of the 
church, as where it now stands. It was built, as already noticed, 
in the year 1649,— a very plain building, covered with heather 
without, and unceiled within, but much larger and more com- 
modious than it now is. In the year 1752, it underwent import- 
ant alterations, as, besides the necessary repairs it received, 
it was reduced to its present small dimensions. The reason of 
this reduction in its size was, that the bodily infirmities of the mi- 
nister, together with the breaking out of the Secession, and the ap- 
pointment of one of that body to a place in Stitchel, who, to his 
other popular attractions, added the charm of preaching in the open 
air, had so greatly reduced the congregation, that it was agreed upon, 
for the comfort of the small remnant that frequented it, to reduce the 
church to one-third of its size; and, accordingly, the Wedderlie aisle, 
which fronted the pulpit, and which is said to have been ornament- 
ed with the family arms, and other carved work, and to have been 
altogether the best part of the church, was taken away. The roof 
alsovas lowered, while the steeple, uncurtailed of its length, re- 
mained the sole memorial of the ancient dignity of the building. 

Since that period, the church of Westruther has received no m- 
termediate repairs of consequence, and was so rapidly falling into 
decay, that the heritors in 1807, met, from time to time, to concert 
measures for a new building. But their consultations at that tmie 
ended in some repairs, which, though designed to be only temporary, 
have been considered sufficient to the present day. It is believed that 
the heritors, than whom none can be more attentive to the wants of 
a parish, have it in contemplation to improve the present condition 
of the church. The edifice, as it now stands, may accommodate 
from 350 to 400 people. There are free sittings in the centre, 
which will accommodate about thirty people. 

It may be mentioned among the many good effects produced by 
the ministry of Mr Veitch in Westruther, that, in consequence of 
the vast multitudes who repaired to him, especially on sacramental 
occasions, when persons of the first respectability came from all 
parts of the surrounding country, and some from as far as Edin- 
burgh, and even Fife, the collections for the poor were most libe- 
ral, and far exceeded the demand made by the greatest number

ever found at one time in the parish. They were allowed, there- 
fore, to accumulate, and were never encroached upon till the scar- 
city in 1800, already alluded to, together with other unfortunate 
circumstances, greatly reduced them. They still, however, amount 
to a considerable sum. 

There have been three manses since Westruther became a pa- 
rish. Of the first, the only relic that remains is the foundation-stone, 
a large shapeless block of whinstone, inscribed with the initials of 
John Veitch, 1649. These three manses have stood all nearly on 
the same site, although they have been successively withdrawn a few 
yards farther south from the road, — which is now felt to be an advan- 
tage, from its admitting a small plantation, that adds to the beauty 
and comfort of the place. The present one was built in 1819. The 
expense of the building, L. 584, 18s. It is a commodious and 
comfortable house, and is furnished with excellent offices. 

The glebe consists of rather more than twenty acres, of which 
there may be four that lie constantly in pasture ; the rest is good 
arable land, particularly the east part of it, on which excellent wheat 
is often raised. It varies much in the quality of the soil; but its 
general value, in the eyes of practical farmers, is estimated from 
■about L.25 to L. 30 a-year. Its extent, which is larger than the legal 
allotment, was probably occasioned by the state of the western 
part of it, which formed originally a branch of Westruther common : 
on that common the minister had, with others, the right of pasturage 
at his pleasure, and a large portion of it was assigned to him in 
heu of the extensive privilege he resigned. The stipend of West- 
ruther was fixed at 1000 merks by decreet of locahty dated 8th 
March 1693. In 1755 it was L.63, 12s. lOd. In 1798 it amount- 
ed to L. 105, 16s. 8d. Sterling. It was raised to L. 150 when the 
Government bounty was extended to Scotland, which, together 
with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, and L. 2, 10s. forgiving 
up the right of casting turf on Bassendean estate, makes the total 
amount of the minister's stipend L. 160, 16s. 8d. 

The number of dissenters is computed at 34, all of whom 
belong to what was originally called the Secession. The parish 
church itself is very well attended. The average number of com- 
municants is 420. The collection at the sacrament in 1833 was 
L. 2, 14s. 3d., and the total amount of contributions during that 
year was L. 17, 18s. 3 |d. 

Education. — There seems to have been a parish school here 
ever since there was a church. The school, however, was kept 
in the western gallery of the church till about the first quarter of 



86 



BEllWlCKSlilllE. 



the last century, when, by accident, the gallery took fire and was 
destroyed. This was the first occasion of the erection of a school- 
house in Westruther. The present school-house is a spacious 
apartment, well-ventilated, and heated by a stove recently erected 
at the expense of the heritors. The teacher, who has been qua- 
lified by the most liberal education, has the legal accommodations, 
but the minimum salary. The amount of school-fees he receives 
may be about L.IO a~year ; he has also L. 5 a-year for collecting 
poors' rate. Besides the parish school there are three private 
schools, which are supported by individual subscription. The 
branches taught at all of these are the same,' and the rate of 
school-fees is per quarter, 2s. 6d. for English reading; 3s. 6d. for 
reading and writing; 4s. 6d. for arithmetic; 7s. 6d. for Latin. 
There are no persons in the parish between six and fifteen years 
of age who cannot read or write. It may be added, that a Sabbath- 
school, which the writer instituted a few years ago, is well attended. 

Library. — The people are fond of reading, the means of indulg- 
ing in which are liberally afforded to the inhabitants of the west 
end of the parish, from a stock of small and popular works pur- 
chased, and furnished to them gratuitously, by the family of Spot- 
tiswoode. A library is on the eve of being established for the be- 
nefit of the parish at large. The family library at Spottiswoode 
is a valuable and extensive collection, containing a variety of works 
on law, history, and general literature, — many of them such as are 
not commonly to be met with. There are also some rare editions 
of well-known books. 

Savings Bank — A savings bank was established in 1815. From 
its commencement to November last, there was deposited the sum 
of L. 1286, and withdrawn L. 1077. The investments are chiefly 
made by servants and labourers. The average amount of deposits 
yearly for the last eighteen years, is L. 72 ; of withdrawals, L.60. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
on the poors' roll is 24, and the average expense L. 4, 13s. 4d. per 
annum. The assessment was L. 91, 16s. Id. The collections, 
L. 20, 5s. 4d. The total amount, L. 112, Is. 5d. in the year 1832. 
The assessment fluctuates between L. 70 and L. 90 per annum. 
This legal provision, though it is not without its attendant evils, 
has not produced such injurious eff'ects here as in some other places, 

the poor being in general satisfied with the allowance made to 

them, as well as reluctant to come upon the roll. Tliere are no 
benevolent societies for supplying the wants of the poor. Fortu- 
nately there is no occasion for these, since, in addition to the as-

sessment, the family of the principal resident proprietor are inde- 
fatigable and exemplary in attending to the wants of the poor ; and 
even during their periodical absence, they furnish the minister and 
others with the means of reheving the indigent and the distressed. 
We may say, indeed, that there are few parishes where the condi- 
tion of the poorer classes is better than in Westruther. 

This parish has long been peculiarly infested by sturdy beggars 
and vagrants. But by a regulation lately made on the threatened 
appearance of cholera, they were prohibited from being entertained 
in the parish ; in consequence of which, few or none are now to be 
seen. The same regulation adopted in other parishes, could not 
fail to be equally beneficial. The minds of the benevolent in this 
parish were reconciled to the measure by a subscription raised to 
provide lodging and necessaries for those houseless wanderers who 
might be overtaken here by night. 

Inns. — There are five alehouses in the parish, — more than are 
required for the convenience of the inhabitants. It is proper, how- 
ever, to add, that the working-classes of Westruther are generally 
a sober race. 

Fuel. — The nearest place whence coals can be procured is about 
twenty miles distant from this parish, in consequence of which 
numbers are precluded from the use of them. The fuel in 
general use is peat. The wages of a labourer employed in digging 
this fuel are 2s. 2d. per day ; and two days' work of a caster, with 
two assistants to hurl and spread out the peats as they are cast, 
are reckoned sufficient to meet the demand of a hind's or labour- 
er's family. The farmers, and others in better circumstances, take 
sometimes a much longer time. Coal is from lid. to Is. per cwt. 
Turf is now prohibited to be taken for fuel. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

This parish has been advancing for a long time in an almost 
geometrical progression, in everything that constitutes a " right 
moral, and a right economical;" state of a parish, — in its general 
appearance, — in the rank it holds among the agricultural parishes 
of the county, — in its means of communication with other parts of 
the country, — and in the intelligence of its inhabitants. Forty 
years ago more than a third of the land was waste and incapable of 
improvement, on a great proportion of which the yellow corn is now 
seen to wave ; and if a similar interval pass before a third Statis- 
tical Account be demanded, such an inroad shall have been made 
on the few, bogs and mosses that are still unimproved, as will leave 
little to tell of the ancient condition of Westruther beyond the name.

PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES RUTHERFORD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, c. — The ancient name of the parish was 
Childer-kirk, i. e. Children's Kirk, having been dedicated to the 
Innocents. More recently its name was Gingle-kirk. It is so 
written in our old parochial records ; and it is still commonly so 
pronounced. Its etymology is uncertain ; probably it may have 
had a reference to the nature of the soil, which is chiefly of a 
gravelly sort. This parish is of a circular figure, nearly six miles 
in diameter; consequentlyits extent in square miles is about twenty- 
eight. It is bounded on the east, and partly on the north and 
south, by Lauder ; by Stow on the west, and partly on the south ; 
and on the north by Fala and Humbie. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish consists of hills and 
valleys, with a small portion of flat land. The hills may be all 
considered as part of the Lammermoor range which terminates 
here. The greatest is Soutra, elevated about 1000 feet above 
the level of the sea. The vale of the Leader or Lauderdale com- 
mences here, stretching to the east, the Lammermoor hills being 
its northern boundary. On the south, this valley is bounded by 
the ridge of moors which separate it from that of Gala. 

The chmate is healthy, probably owing to the gravelly nature 
of the soil, its almost universal declivities, and the general prac- 
tice of draining, which frees it from stagnant water and marshy 
grounds, and to the prevalence of strong winds, which blow al- 
most incessantly. It is, however, subject to frequent and sudden 
changes of temperature, and the cold and snows of winter are 
often severely felt. Inflammations are the most common dis- 
tempers. 

Hydrography.— district is well watered by many streams 
of the purest water, which flow copiously from all the hills, and 
fall into the rivulet of the principal valley, which, about the centre 



CHANNELKIRK. 



89 



of the parish, first receives the name Leader. From this place, to 
where it meets the Tweed below Melrose, the length of the 
Leader is about 17 miles. 

Geology. — The hills all seem to consist of rocks of the trap 
formation, the strata having uniformly a dip to south. In the bot- 
tom of the Leader are found beds of red sandstone, which is used 
for building. Strata of very fine gravel and sand appear in many 
places, and are found at considerable elevations on the sides of 
the hills. A deep bed of peat is found on the hills, wherever 
there is any great extent of flat surface. 

IL — Civil History. 

Land-Owners. — The land belongs to eleven different proprie- 
tors, the chief of whom, as respects the value of their property, 
are, the Marquis of Tweeddale, John Borthwick, Esq. of Crookstou, 
James Sommerville, Esq. of Airhouse. 

Parochial Register. — The earliest date in the parochial registers 
is May 30, 1650. They consist of five volumes, and have been 
regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — There are but few vestiges of antiquity in the 
parish, — a holy well ; and a road with the ruins of a house which 
devotees used in their pilgrimage to the abbey at Melrose. There 
are also on the top of several hills very evident marks of ancient 
encampments. 

III. — Population. 



In 1755, the population was 531 

1801, - - 640 

1811, - - 707 

1821, - 730 

1831, - - 841 



The increase has been attributed chiefly to the improved modes 
of agriculture, which have given employment to more labourers. 

There is only one village, Oxton, or, as frequently written, 
Agston, in which reside 213 persons.

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards residing in the parish is two. 

There are only three insane or fatuous persons ; none deaf, or 
dumb, or blind.

BEIIWICKSIIIUE. 



There have been three illegitimate births during the last ihree 
years. 

Character of the People.— The general character of the people, 
intellectual, moral, and religious, is respectable ; they are desirous 
of useful information, peaceable, honest, industrious, and attentive 
to public worship. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres which 
are cultivated in this parish is about 5000. There may be nearly 
12,000 acres which never have been cultivated, remaining con- 
stantly in pasture. All the land seems at present in tillage that 
would repay the expense of cultivation. There is only one small 
piece of undivided common : it does not exceed ten acres, and is 
called the King's Inch. There is no wood here of natural growth. 
The plantations cover about 200 acres; the trees generally planted 
are larches and Scotch firs, mixed with elm and ash. They seem 
to be properly managed, and thriving. 

Rent of Zvawd— The average rent of arable land is 25s. an 
acre. The average rent of grazing for a cow or ox, is L.4; for a 
sheep, 15s. The real rent of the parish is L.5400. 

Rate of Wages.— The rate of wages for farm-servants, with 
victuals, is, in summer, for men, L. 5; women, L.4; in winter, 
men, L. 3; women, L.2. Most of the farm-servants are married, 
and have cottages on the farms. They are paid in a different way, 
with corn or meal and potatoes, their wages amounting to nearly 
the same value as those of single men. Day-labourers receive, in 
summer, weekly, about 12s., in winter, 9s. 

Live-Stock.—The common breed of sheep on the hills is the 
old Scotch black -faced sort. The Cheviot breed is common in 
the lower districts of the parish. On some farms the Leicester- 
shire has been tried, and found suitable. The plan of husbandry 
commonly followed is that of four courses, generally practised on 
soils fit for raising turnips. Neither the soil nor cHmate encourages 
the growth of wheat, which, accordingly, is not generally attempt- 
ed, or only in small quantities. 

Husbandry. — There were lately several farms held on leases of 
the duration of a life, and some for longer periods, extending even 
to several lives. These are all expired but two; and about twenty 
years is now the common term for the continuance of a lease. The 
arable land is nearly all enclosed with good hedges of thorn, or 
with thorn mixed with beech; some of the pasturage is enclosed 



CHANNELKIRK. 



9l5 



witli dry stone walls, but most of it is without any enclosure. The 
farm-buildings which have been recently erected are in good condi- 
tion, covered with slates, but most of them are old, thatched, and 
almost ruinous. 

Improvements.— The principal improvements of a general kind 
lately effected are in the roads. The Edinburgh and Newcastle 
road through the parish has just been finished on a new line, at great 
expense. The bye-roads also, supported by assessments on the pro- 
prietors of horses, have lately been kept in good condition. The 
improvements made by individuals consist chiefly of the general 
draining and enclosing of the land, and of the plantations on the 
estates of the Marquis of Tweeddale, Airhouse, Kirktonhill, and 
Gollielaw. 

Qitarries. — There are no quarries in the parish but those of 
whinstone, used for building and for making roads. The materials 
they supply are abundant, and of the best description. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The nearest post-office is at Lauder, 
five miles from the centre of the parish. Only one turnpike road 
passes through the parish : its length within the parish is about 
six miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated at the hamlet of 
Channelkirk, nearly in the middle of the parish, but not in the most 
central place for the population ; and, being on the top of a hill of 
considerable height, its situation is by many found to be very in- 
convenient. It was built in 1817, and is in good repair. It affords 
accommodation to 300 persons. The manse was built forty-five, 
and repaired two years ago. The glebe consists of nine acres, and 
may be worth L. 18 yearly. 

The stipend was fixed by the last decree of the Court of Teinds 
at 59 bolls of barley, 138 of oats, and L. 32 money; but, on ac- 
count of a deficiency of teinds, the whole has not been obtained 
hitherto. 

The Established church is the only place of worship in the pa- 
rish, and is well attended. The average number of communicants 
is 250. There is a considerable number of Dissenters, — about 34 
families, who attend chapels in the neighbourhood. The collec- 
tions yearly may amount to L. 8. 

Education. — There is only one school, and that the parochial. 
The schoolmaster's salary is L. 30, and the amount of fees probably 
L. 40. He has the legal accommodations. The general expense 



2 BERWICKSHIRE. 

of a child's education for a year is about 1 2s. If there be any who 
cannot read and write, the number must be very small. The people 
seem generally to appreciate the benefits of education. 

Library. — About forty years ago a parochial library was esta- 
blished ; it still continues and prospers. The number of books, 
most of them well chosen, is considerable. 

Friendly Society. — There is also a friendly society, the members 
of which, by contributing a small sum annually, are entitled to a 
weekly allowance when unable to work. It has existed thirty-one 
years, and seems to promote a desire of independence. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid is about 16; one shilling is nearly the average 
sum allowed to each weekly. The annual expense thus brought on 
the parish may be L. 50, raised, with the exception of a portion of 
the church collections, by an assessment on the heritors and farmers. 
The church collections amount to about L. 7 a-year. Parochial 
relief does not seem to be considered generally so degrading, or tt5 
be resorted to with so much reluctance, as might be desired or ex- 
pected. 

Inns. — We have five inns or alehouses, which seem hurtful to 
morality. 

Fuel. — The fuel formerly in general use was peat, which is not 
so much employed now, because coals can be got at as little ex- 
pense, being at the distance of only ten miles, and the road to them 
excellent. Peat is, however, very plentiful, and of the best kind, 
but the labour of digging and drying is considerable. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The present state of this parish differs from that which existed 
at the time of the last Statistical Account, chiefly because the land 
is generally better cultivated and enclosed ; the plantations made 
then or since have also given a more sheltered and fertile appear- 
ance to the district, and the roads have been greatly improved. 

What this parish chiefly wants to promote improvement, to en- 
courage industry, and to contribute to the comfort of the labour- 
ing-classes, is the residence of land-owners. Almost all the land 
belongs to absentees, who seldom or never see their property here, 
and, consequently, never think of making any alterations either for 
ornamenting or improving it.

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. HENRY RIDDELL, MINISTER. 


L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries. — The derivation of the name of Longforma- 
cus is obscure. Little more light can be thrown upon it than what 
arises from the spelling of the name at different periods. In 1384, 
in a charter by the Earl of Orkney to his cousin, " James de Santse 
Clairo," the name occurs in the form of "'Longfordmakehous." In 
1395, in a charter by the Earl of March to James Sinclair of Lochir- 
makehous, the lands of " Lochirmackehous" are conveyed. And 
the same spelling of " Lochirmakehous" is observed in the char- 
ters of that time. In 1505 the spelling varies to " Lochirmacus," 
and in 1556, and downwards, the name is usually spelt as it now 
is. It is worthy of remark, that at present the ordinary appella- 
tion corresponds with the old spelling of " Lochirmacus." The 
spelling of the name of the parish of Ellim often varies even in the 
same writings, — thus Ellim, Ellem, Elm. 

The parishes of Longformacus and Ellim were, on account of their 
general contiguity, united by decree of annexation, 18th February 
1712. At that time the relative proportion of the two parishes, 
so far as population is concerned, was as two to one, 200 examin- 
able persons being then in Longformacus, and 100 in Ellim. 

The parish touches the parishes of Whittingham and Inver- 
wick on the north; and extends southwards about eight miles, 
where it is bounded by the parishes of Langton, Greenlaw, and 
Westruther. On the east it is bounded by the parishes of Dunse 
and Abbey St Bathans ; and it extends westward in one part 
about twelve miles, where it is bounded by the parish of Lauder. 
The parish of Abbey St Bathans cuts off an isolated portion, 
which belonged to the old parish of Ellim, called Blackerstone. 
This portion lies about eight miles distant from the parish church, 
and is about two miles long, and a mile and a-half broad ; at 



94 



IJEIIWICKSHIRE. 



one part, this parish intersects that of Cranshaws. The boundaries 
of several contiguous parishes in this district are extremely in- 
volved. 

Topograjjldcal Ap-pearances. — The greatest elevation in the pa- 
rish is Meikle Cese or Sayrs Law, which lies in the line of division 
between Berwickshire and East Lothian. It is under 1500 feet 
high. Two conical hills of considerable beauty, the Dirringtons, 
also lie in this parish. The greater of these, great Dirrington 
Law, is 1145 feet high. 

Mineraloyy — Appearances of copper ore were noticed in the 
former Statistical Account of the parish. Various attempts have 
been made to work it ; but after a recent trial upon a considerable 
scale, by an English company, it was abandoned ; the ore, it is un- 
derstood, not being sufficiently rich and plentiful to cover the ex- 
pense of working it. These mining operations v/ere carried on 
near the spot where the old church of EUim stood. It is said 
that there are appearances of a richer vein, not far from this spot, 
on the opposite side of the river Whitadder, in the lands of Rig- 
foot, but no attempts have been made to work it. 

Botany. — The parish affords a good field for the botanist. 
Amongst other plants which are to be found here, there are the 
following: Arhutus uva-ursi Dirrington; Melampyrum sylvati- 
cum Banks of Dye; Orobus sylvaticus, Fumaria claviculata, 
Oscillatoria violacea, Flora of Berwick on Tweed, Vol. ii. and 
Jungermannia hyssacea Dirrington. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — There is a farm in the parish called Otter- 
burn. It is not likely that the contest between Douglas and 
Hotspur took place here ; but as the field of that contest has not 
been determined, and as it could not have been at a very great 
distance from this parish, the fact of there being a place of the 
name of Otterburn here, deserves to be stated. That there were 
several severe contests in this neighbourhood, may well be pre- 
sumed from its vicinity to the debateable land. Indeed, the name 
of an adjoining hill. Main, or Man- Slaughter Law, hands down 
the memory of a bloody conflict, supposed to be that which took 
place in 1402, between the Earl of Dunbar and Hepburn of Hailes ; 
and a large heap of stones at Byrecleugh, in this parish, 240 feet 
long, of irregular breadth and height, but where broadest and 
highest, 75 feet broad and 18 feet high, appears to attest a simi- 
lar conflict. The stones composing this heap have been carried 



LONGFORMACUS AND ELLIM. 



95 



to their present place from a crag half a-mile distant. They have 
received the name of the " mutiny stones ;" but there is no au- 
thentic account of the occasion which led to their accumula- 
tion. 

III. — Population. 
In 1712, there were 300 examinable persons, which may give 
a population of 450. When the last Statistical Account was 
drawn up, there were computed to be 100 families containing 452 
individuals. Since the beginning of this century the numbers have 
been accurately ascertained every ten years as follows: There 
were in 

1801, 94 families, containing 207 males, and 199 females. Total 406 
1811, 90, - - 215, - 229, - 444 
1821, 81, - - 191, - 211, - 402 
1831, 81, - - 216, - - 209, - 425 

The families are fewer in number than they used to be, omng 
to several smaller farms being now thrown into one. The system 
of large sheep-farms prevails more than it used to do, in conse- 
quence of which there is less ground cultivated, and fewer fami- 
lies maintained.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The extent of this parish is 
about thirty-three square miles, or rather more than 21000 acres 
imperial.

It may be doubted whether capital could be profitably employed 
in cultivating more of the parish than has already been cultivated. 

In the vicinity of the village of Longformacus, there is a good 
deal of planting, especially surrounding the mansion-house of 
Longformacus, where there are some elm and ash trees of con- 
siderable age and height. There are also extensive plantations 
at the Retreat, on the lands of Blackerstone. 

HusbandrT/. — Barley, oats, turnips, potatoes, rye-grass and 
clover, are the usual crops cultivated. There are about 450 score 
of sheep pastured. Of this number there are about 300 score 



96 



BERWICKSIIIKK. 



Cheviot, 100 score black-faced, aiui 50 score half ieicester. A 
few horses are bred by the fanners, chiefly for their own use : 
and a considerable number of calves are reared. The cattle are 
of the common Berwickshire breed, coarser than those in the low- 
er part of the county. 

It is not the practice in this district to take in cows or sheep to 
graze; when this is occasionally done, the average rent of keeping 
a milk cow for the year is L. 5, 5s., and a sheep, 5s. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of herds by the year are usually as 
follows : 10 bolls oats, 3 bolls barley, or one boll of peas for one 
of the bolls of barley, the keep of from 30 to 36 sheep, the keep 
of a cow, half a boll of potatoes planted, and the carriage of firing. 
They receive a house, but are obliged to shear for it in harvest, 
and to keep a servant called a hondager. This bondager works 
for the master when he requires him, at the rate of lOd. a-day, 
payable to the herd; and he shears at harvest for the house rent 
for a period, which is often fixed at three weeks endurance,— at 
which time, food only is allowed. 

The wages of hinds are much the same with those of herds; in- 
stead of the keep of sheep, L. 8 or L. 9 is paid. They hold their 
house under the same conditions as the herds. Women-servants 
receive from L. 4, 10s. to L.5 for the summer half year, and L.2 
for the winter half. Able-bodied labourers receive 9s. a-week hi 
winter, and from 10s. 6d. to 12s. in summer, according to their skill 
and activity. 

22e_The present rentalof the parish amounts nearly to L.4000; 
about L. 800 of this rental arises from grass parks let for pasture 
from year to year; the remainder from lands let on lease for various 
terms, but usually for nineteen years. There are nine heritors, 
none of whom are resident. Several large farms are led, that is 
left to the charge of herds or stewards for the tenants,— who live on 
arable farms in the lower district. John Home Home, Esq. of 
Longformacus, is the patron and largest heritor of the parish. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— T\\q farm-houses and roads and en- 
closures in this parish are generally in bad repair. The road from 
Haddington to Coldstream goes through this parish, and also 
another road from East Lothian to Dunse,-botli of which are but 
indifferently maintained out of the statute-labour money. Ihis 
money is collected upon twenty ploughs, the estimated number kept, 
and is totally inadequate to the maintenance of the parish roads. In 



LONGFORMACUS AND ELLIM. 



,97 



consequence of this, the cross roads are left in a wretched state, 
and thus a formidable bar lies in the way of improvements. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently enough 
situated, considering the extreme irregularity of the boundaries of 
the parish. In this neighbourhood one parish so shoots into an- 
other, that the congregations are often found to be composed of the 
inhabitants of several parishes. The church was built upwards of 
a century ago. It has been lately repaired, and is in good order. 
It is seated for 200 persons ; the sittings are appropriated to the 
different properties, so that there are no free sittings ; the feuars 
in the village occupy the sittings which are unemployed, merely 
through tolerance. The manse was built sixteen years ago. It is 
three quarters of a mile distant from the church. The glebe con- 
sists of fully eleven acres of good land; it is perhaps the best land 
in the parish, and may be valued at not less than L.2 an acre. A 
right of pasturage has been assigned to the minister in place of a 
glebe for the old parish of Ellim. This right gives the minister 
the privilege of pasturing forty sheep on the farm adjoining the old 
church of Ellim. It has of late years, by agreement between the 
minister and tenant, been commuted into the annual payment of 
L. 10. The stipend was modified for crop 1831 at fifteen chalders, 
half meal and half barley, converted at the highest fiar prices of 
Berwickshire ; and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

Out of 81 families, 16 are Dissenters, and attend meeting-houses 
chiefly at Dunse, 

The church is usually well attended. The number of commu- 
nicants is about 135. 

A branch association in connection with the Dunse Auxiliary 
Bible Society was lately established. 

Education. — There is one parish school, where the usual branches 
of education are taught. The schoolmaster's salary is the maxi- 
mum. He has the legal accommodations. The amount of school 
fees received by him may be L. 10 a-year. The means of educa- 
tion are accessible to all, and there are none of a proper age who 
cannot read. The minister meets such children as may be sent by 
their parents, at the church on Sundays, before and after the usual 
services, and the number of those who then regularly attend upon 
his instruction exceeds 30. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The funds provided for the poor are 
derived from the collections at the church doors, theinterestof L.lOO 
mortified, and, when these fail, from assessments. Owing to tlie non- 

BERVVICK. CJ

residence of the heritors and of some of the principal tenants, and 
the non-attendance of others, the collections are small ; they may 
be stated at L. 8 per annum. There are at present two old women 
who receive regular, and four individuals who receive occasional, 
charity from the kirk-session. Five shillings a month, with house 
rent and firing, has been the usual allowance for a pauper receiv- 
ing regular assistance. The disposition to refrain from seeking pa- 
rochial relief may still be seen in this parish, but it is fast wearing 
away. 

Imi.— There is an inn in the small village of Longformacus. 
The people are generally sober, and no injurious effects are per- 
ceptible from the existence of this inn. 

Fuel — The fuel of the country, here generally called eldin, con- 
sists of dried turf, peats, and cuttings from the plantations. Coal is 
brought from England at considerable expense. When delivered 
at Longformacus, it costs, at an average, lOd. per cwt. The best 
peats are got from one of the moors towards the southern part of 
the parish. In a favourable year, such as 1831, when well dried, 
they make good firing ; but the expense of cutting, winding, drying, 
and leading, together with the rapidity with which they burn, makes 
the cost of them little inferior to that of coals.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. J. H. SIBBALD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
]ame — Boundaries. — The name is supposed by some persons 
to be derived from tbe Cranes or Herons, which were formerly nu- 
merous in this district; by others it is alleged that Cran in the 
name of this parish refers to the cranberry, which is a native of 
our hills and mosses. These derivations, however, are quite con- 
jectural. 

The parish is intersected by a part of Longformacus ; and the 
part of it on which the church stands is a five-sided figure or pen- 
tagon, measuring nearly two miles in every direction, and conse- 
quently giving a surface of about six square miles. It is bounded 
generally by the Whitadder on the north and east, and a part 
of Longformacus on the south and west. The other part of the 
parish is an irregular figure, extending more than five miles in 
length by about two of mean breadth. The small river Dye 
divides it from Longformacus for four miles on the north side, and 
gives its margin an undulating form ; the same parish encloses it 
on the east and partly on the south, after which the parish of 
Westruther completes the southern border, and that of Lauder 
the western. 

Topographical Appearances. — The highest land on this side of 
the parish is called Man-Slaughter Law, and, according to tradi- 
tion, receives its name from having been the scene of a very seri- 
ous engagement. There is some reason for believing this report, 
as some pieces of warlike weapons have been found in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood, and a tumulus, such as was generally used 
to commemorate important events, is still remaining upon the 
north side of it. 

Meteorology. — Fogs are here sometimes so dense and so regu- 
larly spread over all the lower grounds, both in spring and au-

tiimn, as to mark a certain elevation over the whole country. Tlie 
density of this vapour may be imagined from the fact, that a per- 
son descending from one of the neighbouring heights is seen from 
above, as if stepping deeper and deeper into water. So correctly 
is the surface line marked upon his person, and so complete is the 
deception, that the spectator is not without some degree of anxiety 
about his companion, whom he has seen walk over head into the 
abyss. When such fogs are partial, there is sometimes the ap- 
pearance of a lake, with one or more streams connected with it. 

Hydrography. — This inland parish abounds with perennial 
springs, and there is one in the neighbourhood which may yet im- 
part health, as a chalybeate to the inhabitants of more wealthy 
districts. There are only two streams draining this district, the 
Whitadder and Dye, which unite a little to the south-east of this 
parish. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There are no rocks of the primitive 
class, although boulders of granite, sienite, and porphyry are wash- 
ed down from rocks of conglomerate in the parishes of Stenton 
and Whittingham. The rocks of the transition class are grey- 
wacke and greywacke-slate : and these rocks are the principal ones 
in the parish. In Cranshaws-hill there is a very fine conglome- 
rated rock, in which are disseminated particles of red iron-ore, from 
the size of a pea to that of a walnut. The surface of this rock is 
much broken by the action of the atmosphere and water. Near 
to it is one of sandstone of the secondary formation, coloured by 
grains of iron ; this stone might be useful in buildings. The yel- 
low ochre issuing from this hill is used by the people in painting the 
walls of their houses, and completely answers the purpose. 

11. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — There are only three landed proprietors, Charles 
Watson, Esq. of Saughton; the Honourable Charles Stuart; and 
Duke of Roxburghe. The last having but a small property in the 
parish bears a very trifling proportion of all public burdens. 

Parochial Register.— The parochial register begins with 1731. 
It contains births, deaths, and marriages, and has been regularly 
kept. 

Antiquities. — A sword had been found to the west of the Man- 
Slaughter-Law a considerable time ago. Upon inquiry I find it was 
converted into some other instrument at the parish smithy. To 
the east of the field where it was discovered there is a burrow 
which probably covers more; and there are two similar collec-

tions of stones in the other half of this parish, which, tradition says, 
commemorate the death of two twin brothers of the name of Edgar, 
who both fell while commanding different portions of an army that 
had mutinied. They are still known by the name of the Twinlaw- 
cairns.  Cranshaws castle belongs to Charles Watson, Esq. of 
Saughton ; it is an oblong square of forty feet by twenty-four. The 
walls are forty-five feet high. The battlement on the top is mo- 
dern ; otherwise the date of the building might have been pretty 
nearly ascertained, as the water conduits are in the form of cannon. 
Before the union of the two kingdoms, it had been used by the in- 
habitants on this side of the parish as a place of refuge from the 
English borderers, as the old castle at Scarlaw of which very lit- 
tle now remains had probably been by the inhabitants of the 
other division.

No nobility or persons of independent fortune reside in this

There are two proprietors in the parish who hold lands to the 
amount of L. 50 per annum and upwards. 

The people generally marry early, and in consequence, we have 
neither male nor female unmarried above the ages of 50 and 45. 
They are generally very poor, but contented with their situation 
and circumstances, frugal, sober and industrious, generally regular 
in their attendance on religious ordinances, and, I am happy to add, 
that the form of godliness is observed in most of their families. I 
have been told that discussions have sometimes taken place on a 
Sabbath morning as to who should enjoy the privilege of going to 
church.

pairs of work-horses in the parish. The number of acres, there- 
fore, under tillage, allowing fifty acres to each plough, will be 350, 
which, considering the nature of the land and climate, can scarcely 
be expected to furnish much produce for the market. More had 
been cultivated at one period, but was allowed to return to its ori- 
ginal state, with the exception of a few patches, which are turned 
over occasionally, to renew the pasture. It is very doubtful whe- 
ther the farmer would gain by keeping much more land under the 
plough, while the market prices are so low, all the roads in such a 
neglected state, and the distances to places of sale so great. 

Live-Stock. — The sheep are of the Cheviot breed, and amount 
to about 4400 in number ; and the black-cattle a mixture of several 
kinds, in number from 70 to 80, average price L. 6, 10s. at two 
years' old. 

Rate of Wages. — Wages of men and women hired by the half 
year are about L. 7 per annum. Those of hinds or farm-servants 
average L.28 per annum, inclusive of the value upon their cow's 
grass, meal and potatoes. The practice of giving these servants grass 
for so many sheep is now abandoned, and L. 3 or L. 4 given in lieu 
of it. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce cannot be 
exactly ascertained; but the following statement not including 
pasture must be pretty near the truth. 

Oats, barley and pease, 800 bolls at the Lammermoor fiar prices, L. 770 9 44 

Turnip, 70 acres at L. 2 per acre, - 140 0 0 

Potatoes, 10 acres, allowing 20 bolls per acre, at 6s. per boll, - 60 0 0 
Sown grass 2000 stone at 6d. per stone, - - - - 50 0 0 

Natural hay 3000 stones at 3d. per stone, - - - 62 10 0 

L. 1082 19 44 

Manufactures.— li may be mentioned under this head, that two 
ingenious young men of the name of Bertram, both blacksmiths, 
have lately invented an instrument, by which their labour in form- 
ing hoops, for carriage wheels of every diameter is wonderfully 
abridged, and the fuel generally used completely saved. They 
can produce twelve cart hoops in this way in one hour, without the 
use of fire, except in joining the two points, and without the use of 
the hammer at any other part of the process. This instrument 
must soon come into general use : indeed, drawings of it have been 
sought, and one of these little machines is already at work at In- 
nerwick in East Lothian. It is intended to make an effort to se- 
cure a patent for these young men, who, for character and genius, 
are highly deserving of patronage.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is rather 
inconvenient for the one-half of the parishioners, being about five 
miles from several of their houses, and yet it would be impossible 
to find a site for it equidistant from the two inhabited portions of 
this parish, without removing it out of the parish entirely, it being 
intersected, as already stated, by a part of Longformacus parish. 
It was built in 1739, and is probably in a worse state of repair than 
any Estabhshed church in the south of Scotland. The present 
manse was built in 1811, and wants the necessary accommodation, 
having only one room on the ground-floor. Both it and the church 
are about to undergo repairs at present, and do certainly require 
them, being in a much worse state than most hunting stables in the 
county. The church accommodates 120 persons. The extent of 
the glebe is fifteen acres, and when in good order might be let at 
L. 1, 10s. per acre. The stipend is upon the Government bounty 
list, and is all paid in money, amounting to L. 150, with L.8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements. 

Every family in this parish attends the Established church. The 
number of hearers may be about 100 or upwards. They are regular 
in their attendance, and very attentive during divine service. The 
number of communicants inclusive of those from other parishes 
varies from 80 to 100. 

There is a Bible Society in this parish, but contributions have 
not been pressed for a few years in consequence of the circum- 
stances of the district. When first instituted, the annual receipts 
were about L. 15 per annum, but the decrease was rapid, as was 
to be expected among such a poor population. Occasional col- 
lections are made at the church for the Scottish Missionary So- 
ciety, the General Assembly schools, and the Edinburgh Infirmary, 
the whole amount obtained for these institutions being under L. 5 
per annum. 

Education. — We have no school but the parochial, in which all 
the usual branches of education are taught. The salary is the 
maximum, and the school fees amount to L. 10 per annum. The 
expense of education is from 10s. to 16s. per annum, according to 
the respective attainments of the scholars. The schoolmaster's 
house is a good one of two stories, and the garden of the legal ex- 
tent. There is not an individual in the parish who has reached 
the age of 15 but can both read and write. 

Library. — Wc have a parochial Hbrary under the patronage of 



104 



BERWICKSUIUE, 



George Biicluin, Esq. of Kelloe, wlio very generously presented 
to it L. 5. The number of volumes at present amounts to 200, 
and a large addition is expected when our own heritors shall favour 
us with their subscriptions. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are at present three persons 
all aged and infirm, receiving parochial aid, and the sum given to 
each is Is. 6d. per week. The minister proposed to the heritors 
of this parish several years ago, that the regular assessment for the 
maintenance of the poor should be dispensed with, and something 
in the name of donation substituted when the kirk-session should 
require it. This proposal was thankfully accepted by the heritors, 
and is still acted upon. For several years the contribution of the 
heritors in this way has amounted to L. 12 per annum. The ave- 
rage amount of church collections is L. 6 a-year. 

Fuel. — The fuel in general use is peat and turf, which may cost 
about Is. 6d. per cart, when ready for using, and Is. more when 
brought home. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
To improve this parish, a good road is indispensable from three 
miles to the east of the manse to the head of Whitadder. There 
is a very level line for the purpose. The materials are at hand 
throughout that distance, and some miles would be saved to the 
traveller. Plantations also are much wanted,

PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN WALLACE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sc. — The name of this parish has been va- 
riously written ; St Boythans, St Bothans, and St Bathans. St 
Boythans occurs in the more ancient writings. St Bothans was the 
usual form till the early part of the last century ; and St Bathans, 
which was then introduced, has continued to be the name ever 
since. The prefix abbey was first made use of at an earlier pe- 
riod, and was probably employed to distinguish this parish where 
there was formerly a convent, from that of GifFord, or Yester, in 
East Lothian, anciently called St Bothans, where there was a 
collegiate church, but no monastic establishment. 

The mean length of the parish of Abbey St Bathans from 
east to west is about 3 miles, and its mean breadth from north 
to south about 2 miles ; the whole extent of the surface falls 
somewhat short of 8 square miles. It is of an irregular figure, 
and is divided into two portions by a detached part of the pa- 
rish of Longformacus. It is bounded on the north by Codiburns- 
path, Oldhamstocks and Innerwick, on the west by Longformacus, 
on the south by Dunse, and on the east by Coldingham and 
Buncle. The church and manse, which lie nearly in the centre 
of the parish, are about fourteen miles southward of Dunbar, and 
about seven miles northward of Dunse ; their latitude being about 
55° 52' N., and their longitude about 2° 23' W. 

Topograjihical Appearances. — Though the parish is situated 
among the Lammermoor hills, none of the more remarkable eleva- 
tions of that range lie within its bounds. The high grounds rise to 
a height varying from 300 to 400 feet above the intervening vales, 
and then spread out into extensive flats. On the sides of the streams 
which drain the hills are flats or haughs of considerable fertihty — 
the slopes are also in many cases fertile ; but the greater part of the 
higher grounds is barren and covered with heath.

Hydrography — The river Whitadder winds in a sinuous course 
through the parish, its general direction being from west to 
east. It is here a beautiful stream, upwards of eighty feet in 
breadth. Before it enters the parish, it has run about twelve 
miles from its source, and has received the river Dye, with many 
smaller streams. In its progress through the parish it receives a 
number of streamlets from the dells and vales that occur among the 
hills ; but its two principal tributaries are the Monyuut and the 
Ware, flowing in a south-easterly direction. 

Mineralogy. — Veins of copper-ore having been discovered on 
the estate of St Bathans, an English mining company obtained 
right by lease in the year 1828 to work this mineral ; but after 
driving in a single mine, they abandoned the undertaking. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Notices. — Small as this parish now is, it consisted be- 
fore the Reformation of two parishes. These were St Bathans 
and Strafontane. We will trace the history of each separately. 

With regard to St Bathans, it appears that soon after the in- 
troduction of Christianity into this part of the country, an event 
which took place in the early part of the seventh century, a church 
was founded here, and dedicated to the saint whose name the pa- 
rish now bears.  Like that of Coldingham, it was, during the 

• Chalmers' Caledonia, Vol. ii. p. 212, 344 — There is reason to believe that this 
holy person was St Baithen, cousin to the celebrated St Columba, and his successor 
as Abbot of lona, St Baithen employed much of his time in propagating the doc- 
trines of Christianity in the country now called Scotland, and in establishing churches 
there. He died on 9th June 598. 

That it may be seen on what grounds the writer of this article conjectures that this 
parish derived its name from St Baithen, he shall add a short explanation. There 
are four saints whose names bear a close resemblance to that of this parish. Tliese 
are the following : 1st, St Bothan. According to Chahners, St Bothan was the pa- 
tron of this parish, Caledonia, Vol. ii. p. 344. But this saint was a bishop of Dun- 
blane, Camerarius de pietate Scotorum, and must therefore have lived after the erec- 
tion of that bishopric ly David I. The church of St Bathans, however, was dedi- 
cated to its saint many centuries before. If it be said that St Bothan, who is not 
mentioned in Keith's Catalogue of the Bishops, may have been a member of the con- 
vent of Culdees, which was established at Dunblane before the erection of the bishop- 
ric, this circumstance would not increase the probability of his being the patron sjiint 
of this parish, because in that case he must have flourished subsequent to the time of 
St Blaan, from whom Dunblane derived its name; and, as St Blaan lived in the reign 
of Kenneth III. Keith's Catalogue, St Bothan could not have been the person to 
whom the church of St Bathans was dedicated some ages before. 2d, St Bathan. 
He is said to have been a bishop or teacher and confessor throughout tlic wliolc of 
Scotland, but cliiefly in Orkney and Shetland,  Camerarius.  It is not likely that a 
church would be dedicated to him in tlic Saxon kingdom of Nortlnnnberland, in which 
kingdom this parish was then situated. Camerarius confounds this saint with lie 
following : 3d, St Baithan. He was one of the persons lo whom a celebrated letter 
from Tope .John was addressed in 640, preserved in Bede. He was Bishop o Clon- 
maenois in Ireland, Jameson's History of the Culdees, p. 104, and it is not there- 
fore probable that he was the saiiU to whom the cluu ch of St Bathans was ledicaled.

incursions of the Danes, destroyed more than once by fire ; a cala- 
mity to which such edifices were in those days pecuharly hable 
from their having been constructed of wood. In a subsequent age 
it became a hving of considerable value,  but at the Reformation 
its revenues were reduced to a very small amount. 

At the church of St Bathans a convent of Cistertian nuns, with 
the title of a Priory, was founded between the years 1184 and 1200 
by Ada, daughter to King William the Lion, and wife to Patrick 
Earl of Dunbar. From this lady and her husband, and from sub- 
sequent benefactors, the institution received various grants in lands 
and revenues, and among other benefactions the patronage of the 
church, a grant which enabled the nuns, by appointing a vicar, to 
appropriate to themselves the large revenues of the hving. The 
property thus acquired consisted of a considerable estate in the 
immediate neighbourhood of the convent, various detached sub- 
jects lying in the counties of East Lothian and Berwick, and a 
large revenue in tithes, f About the time of the Reformation the 
lands were alienated by the prioress and nuns, principally to Lord 
Home, for payment of annual feu-duties ; and, on the final suppres- 
sion of monasteries, the benefice itself was gifted to Elizabeth Home, 
a relative of the same nobleman, and wife to Adam Cuming, Com- 
mendator of Beauly ; and, by a transaction with her, and through 
the favour of the crown, it was subsequently acquired by David, son 
to Patrick Lindsay, Bishop of Ross, afterwards Archbishop of Glas- 
gow, who seems to have disposed of it in parcels to various indivi- 
duals. Elizabeth Home took the title of Prioress, and David 
Lindsay that of Prior of St Bathans.  

Besides the church and priory of St Bathans, a chapel was 
founded in this parish, but by whom, or at what time, does not ap- 
pear. 

itJi, St Baithen. Besides the circumstance that none of his competitors seem to have 
any claim, there are various reasons for supposing that St Baithen is entitled to be 
considered as the patron saint of this parish. 1 . About the time at which the church 
was founded, a constant intercourse subsisted between this part of the country and 
lona, where St Baithen was abbot. 2. Like his relation, St Columba, St Baithen 
preached in this part of the country ; and, 3. the name of this saint and the most an- 
cient name of this parish  St Boythan are very similar in sound. 
 See Taxatio in Chalmers' Caledonia, ii. 322. 

•|- The estate in the neighbourhood of the convent consisted of the farms of St Ba- 
thans, Frampath, and Hardhissells, with their corn and waulk-mills, Blackerston, and 
the lialf of Quixwood. The other properties of the priory were situated in Stenton, 
Pople, Bclbaven, Cockburnspath, Butterdean, Billie, Dunse, Ninewar, Kimmerghani, 
and Edinlurgh ; and its tithes consisted of those of Waugliton and Craijuha, of the 
town and mains of Cockburnspath and llieir steadings, including Fulfordlees and the 
two Iloprigs, the two Shiells, Kauchcnside and Cloves, and those of the farms be- 
longing to the convent itself— Title-deeds of the Benefice.

The history of the parish of Strafontane commences in the 
reign of David II., in which reign an hospital was founded here; 
but the name of the founder is forgotten. This house seems at, 
one time to have been dependent on the abbey of Alnwick. It 
was in 1437 transferred by the abbot of that place to the monas- 
tery of Dryburgh ;  and it came ultimately into the possession of 
the collegiate church of Dunglass, and gave a title to one of the 
prebends. Its original destination as an hospital was changed to 
that of a church; but public worship ceased to be performed 
in it at the Reformation. Its cure was then united to that of St 
Bathans. f 

Eminent Men. — As a remarkable person conrtected with this 
parish, David Hume of Godscroft may be mentioned. This ac- 
complished gentleman, who was the son of Sir David Hume of 
Wedderburn, held a conspicuous place among the miscellaneous 
writers of the seventeenth century, and was one of the early and 
most intimate friends of the celebrated Andrew Melville. He 
was extensively acquainted with the ancient and modern languages, 
theology, politics, and history ; and among those who at that pe- 
riod were distinguished for their skill in the composition of Latin 
poetry, which was then enthusiastically cultivated, there were 
few who showed a mind more deeply imbued with its genuine 
spirit. X 

Antiquities. — The church of St Bathans is a very ancient build- 
ing. The north and east walls still bear marks of antiquity. In

the former is to be seen an arched door, now built up, which com- 
nnmicated with the residence of the nuns. The ancient Gothic 
architecture of the east window is still in some measure preserved ; 
and in the wall near the altar was a stone font with a leaden 
pipe in the bottom. The building was formerly large, measuring 
58 feet by 26 ; but about the end of last century it was greatly 
contracted by the removal of the west wall to a position nearer the 
centre. 

Adjoining the church, and between it and the Whitadder, the 
remains of the priory were visible a few years ago, but they have 
now entirely disappeared, — the stones having been carried away 
for various purposes. From the vestiges, however, which could 
then be traced, the buildings seem to have been of considerable 
extent. The house was supplied with water from a spring in the 
rising ground to the south by means of leaden pipes, parts of which 
have at different times been dug up. To the south and east of 
the church lay the gardens of the priory, thence called the pre- 
cincts yards, and round the whole was a walk composed of three 
tiers of stones. On the east side of these gardens was another 
walk of considerable breadth, bearing the name of the Bishop's 
Loan. 

At some distance east from the church, in a woody nook, issues 
a spring named St Bathan's well, which, according to the super- 
stition of ancient times, had the power of healing diseases ; and 
which still, as is the belief in the neighbourhood, neither fogs nor 
freezes, and even prevents a mill-lead into which it flows from being 
locked up with ice in the winter. 

. Farther east, and about a quarter of a mile from the church, 
were to be seen some years ago the foundations of the chapel, and 
of a wall enclosing a small space around it. This space bore no 
marks of having been used as a place of interment. These foun- 
dations have now been removed on account of the obstruction they 
presented to the operations of agriculture, but the field that con- 
tained them is still called Chapel-Jield. 

Like most of the other ancient buildings in the district, the re- 
mains of the church of Strafontane, which was situated about a 
mile west of St Bathans, on the south side of the Monynut, have 
disappeared before the encroachments of the plough. It is, how- 
ever, but a few years since the foundations of this church were ex- 
tant, with the mouldering tombstones around it ; and it is said that 



110

within a century, /. e. that is since 1730, burials have taken 
place here. 

It is a favourite article of belief in this quarter, that a subterra- 
nean passage exists leading from the nunnery of St Bathans, be- 
\oyf the Whitadder, to the church of Strafontane, by which the 
nuns went, unseen, to be confessed by the clergy there. 

III. — Population. 

The parish is thinly inhabited, the whole population by the 
census of 1831 amounting to no more than 121 souls, of whom 66 
are males, and 55 females. As compared with the number of in- 
habitants in 1821, there is a decrease of 29 souls in the popula- 
tion ; but this diminution is accounted for by the circumstance of 
young unmarried men being preferred to married men as servants, 
by some of the tenants who now occupy the farms. It appears, 
however, that the population of this parish, though subject to tem- 
porary fluctuation, has gradually decreased in numbers for two cen- 
turies past. This seems chiefly to have arisen from the enlarge- 
ment of farms, two or three being now united into one. Thus the 
farm of Abbey St Bathans consists of lands which, till within these 
last hundred years, were divided into three separate farms, viz. St 
Bathans, Frampath, and Hardhissells ; and besides a corn-mill, 
there was a waulk-mill on the same estate, till within these fifty 
years. 

There is in the parish one resident proprietor of land of the 
yearly value of about L. 50. The number of unmarried men up- 
wards of fifty years of age is 4, and of unmarried women upwards 
of forty-five, 3. 

The whole number of houses in the parish is 29, of which 23 
are inhabited ; and the number of families also 23. 

The inhabitants are in general sober, frugal, and industrious in 
their habits, and are contented with their situation and circumstan- 
ces, which are such as to aff'ord them, in a reasonable degree, the 
comforts and advantages of society. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish consists of six farms, containing in all about 5000 
acres of land. Of this surface about 2600 acres are hill pasture, 
never cultivated; about 100 acres are covered with wood; and the 
remainder, about 2300 acres, are arable. 

Husbandry. —T\\e lands, like other parts of Lammermoor, are 
in general more adapted to the breeding of cattle and sheep than 
to the raising of corn; but on the several farms there is a consider- 



ABBEY ST BATHANS. 



Ill 



able part of the grounds under cultivation, and different kinds of 
grain, particularly early oats and barley, are produced, little infe- 
rior in quality to those raised in the lower parts of Berwickshire. 
The five break rotation of crops is generally employed, namely, 
turnips, barley, grass, and oats, the grass being allowed to lie for 
two years ; but a crop of pease is sometimes introduced, in which 
case the grass is allowed to lie for only one year. 

The chief object, however, that the skilful farmer has in view 
in making use of the plough, is not so much the immediate return 
from the corn that he raises, as the amelioration of the pasture for 
his cattle and sheep, by sowing his fields with artificial grass seeds, 
particularly rye-grass and white clover, which thrive well on all the 
dry grounds that have been improved with lime, and also the pro- 
curing of hay, turnips, and straw, as food and litter for his stock 
during the winter. This method of husbandry enables the farmer 
not only to keep a much greater quantity of stock, but also greatly 
to improve the breed both of his cattle and sheep. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of grazing on out-field pas- 
ture is at the rate of from 25s. to 35s. per ox or cow, and at the 
rate of about 3s. per ewe or full-grown sheep pastured for the year. 
But the summer pasture of a cow, if she is grazed on sown grass, 
is at least L. 3. 

The expense of furnishing a pair of horses with harness, &amp;c. to 
fit them for draught in the cart and plough, is about L. 10. The 
smith work necessary to keep a plough in repair, and a pair of hors- 
es properly shod, costs about L. 3. 

Price of Labour, — The wages of male servants who get their 
board in the house are about L. 8 a-year ; of female servants about 
L, 5 for the summer half year, field labour being then required, 
and from L. 1, 10s. to L.2 for the winter half year. Servants who 
have families and keep a house are paid in grain, have a cow grazed, 
and other perquisites, which altogether amount to about L. 25 
yearly. The wages of a day-labourer are about Is. 8d. or 2s. a-day 
in summer, and about Is. 6d. in winter. In hay time and harvest 
they are considerably more. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The breeds of sheep commonly kept on 
the farms are the black-faced and the Cheviot, but chiefly the lat- 
ter ; and to improve the stock, the black-faced and Cheviot ewe is 
often crossed with the Leicester tup. 

Improvements. — On one farm in the parish the present tenant 
lias, in the space of six years, improved, out of heath, upwards of 



112 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



100 acres of land, at the expense of about L.5 per acre. Tlie ad- 
vantage derived from the improvement of the pasture is found to 
afford a sufficient return upon the capital thus employed. 

Surface draining is found to be a great improvement on the stock 
farms in Lammermoor, and has been carried to a considerable ex- 
tent. By cutting a trench about 24 inches wide and 14 inches 
deep in a proper direction, the water is allowed to escape from the 
surface of boggy land ; and instead of the rushes, &amp;c. produced in 
swampy situations, there rises a natural grass mixed with white 
clover. 

Great advantage would result to the tenant from more accom- 
modation in the way of houses for cattle, &amp;c. than is at present 
found on some of the farms; and generally from more extensive 
enclosing ; strips of plantation judiciously situated for shelter would 
also be very conducive to his interest. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish may be estimated as follows : 

Average produce of grain of all kinds, about 1200 quarters, at the average price of 
22s. per quarter, - - - - L- 1320 0 0 

Potatoes and turnips, about 130 acres, at the average price of L.4, 

10s. per acre, - - - - - 585 0 0 

Pasture, with straw and hay, cut principally to be consumed on the 

farms, ... - - 650 0 0 

Total, - L.2555 0 0 
The yearly value of raw produce may be assumed, therefore, as 
between L. 2000 and L. 3000 Sterling. In point of soil and cli- 
mate, this parish is perhaps preferable to any other part of Lam- 
mermoor, and on this account the returns from corn, turnips, and 
pasture, may be taken somewhat above the average for the hill dis- 
trict. 

The leases of the several farms are for nineteen years, and do 
not seem to present any obstacle to improvement. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication— The parish roads are kept in tole- 
rably good repair, though their occasional steepness is felt an in- 
convenience. 

There is, properly speaking, no village in the parish ; but in a 
delightful little vale through which the Whitadder glides, lie the 
farm-house and steading of Abbey St Bathans with its adjoining 
smilhy; a neat cottage, a corn-mill, the decent parish church, 
the manse which, topping a little eminence, is embosomed among 
trees, and the school-house ; so that there are here to be seen with- 
in a small space a cluster of objects connected with the improve- 



ABBEY ST BATHANS. 113 

ment and well-being of man. The interest awakened by these ob- 
jects is at the same time heightened by the natural scenery amidst 
which they occur.  

A substantial foot bridge has lately been erected over the Whit- 
adder, which is a great convenience to the neighbourhood, a boat 
having been formerly the only means of crossing the stream. To 
the eye of the traveller, whose way lies through this romantic spot, 
nothing can be more striking than the contrast between it and the 
barren heaths, which on one side or other he must pass to reach it. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated convenient- 
ly for the population, its distance from the remotest part of the 
parish not exceeding two miles. It is at present in a good state 
of repair, and affords accommodation for 140 persons. The seats 
are apportioned to the several heritors according to their valued 
rents, and are occupied by the tenants and their servants. 

The manse was built in 1822, The extent of the glebe is 
about fourteen acres of arable land, worth about L. 1 per acre 
yearly rent. The stipend is one of those augmented by Govern- 
ment to L. 150, besides an allowance of L. 8, 6s. 8d. for commu- 
nion elements. The sum received annually from the Exchequer 
is L. 93, 16s. 4d. As the larger part of the stipend, namely, 
L. 137, lis. 5d., is payable in money, the whole amount from 
year to year is not much affected by the variation in the fiars. 

With the exception of four or five families, the inhabitants at- 
tend the Established church. But besides the parishioners, a number 
of individuals from the outskirts of the surrounding parishes find it 
more convenient to attend public worship at this place than at their 
several parish churches, on account of the distance. From this cause, 
not only are the numbers increased of those who attend the ordina- 
ry service of the Sabbath, but also the number of communicants 
exceeds what the parish itself would naturally furnish, the num- 
ber being usually above eighty. There is no dissenting meeting- 
house or chapel within the bounds of the parish.

Education.— The parish school, which is the only place of edu- 
cation in the parish, is situated at a convenient distance from the 
several farm-steadings. The outskirts of the surrounding parishes 
also furnish some scholars. All the usual branches of instruction 
are taught at the following rates : Reading, 2s. per quarter; read- 
ing and writing, 3s per do.; reading, writing, and arithmetic, 4s 6d. 
per do.; Latin and Greek languages, 7s. per quarter; mathema- 
tics, 7s. 6d. per do. The salary of the schoolmaster including 
a mortification is L. 30 yearly ; and the amount of the school 
-fees may be about L. 10 more. 

The people in general appear to be sufficiently alive to the be- 
nefits of education, but the progress of the children at school is 
much impeded during the summer and autumn, by their being so 
frequently called out to work in the fields. 

Friendly Society.— The only friendly society that exists in the 
parish is one instituted in the year 1828, and having for its ob- 
ject the procuring of medical assistance for the members and their 
"famihes in case of sickness. Each member pays a small sum 
quarterly into the hands of the treasurer, and thus a fund is form- 
ed, out of which, when sickness occurs, the expense of calling in a 
medical practitioner and of procuring medicines is defrayed. There 
are at present forty-three members; and the amount of disburse- 
ments made by the treasurer during the four years that the so- 
ciety has existed is about L. 15. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— Theve are at present only two in- 
dividuals who receive parochial aid ; the one a widow advanced in 
years, the other a woman of middle age. The annual contribu- 
tions for their relief amount to L.7, 18s., of which sum about 
L. 3 arise from church collections ; the remainder is raised by legal 
assessment. 

It is to be regretted that the poor in this neighbourhood, so 
far from regarding it as degrading to receive parochial aid, apply 
for it without hesitation, and consider it as a legal provision made for 
them, to which they have as good a title as to the wages of labour. 

Pad.— The fuel commonly used in the parish is turf and peat, 
but more generally the former. Coals cannot be obtained for less 
than 20s. per ton, on account of the distance from which they 

must be brought. . , , , 

/s_There is no alehouse in the parish, but there is one in 
the immediate neighbourhood. It does not appear, however, that 
any bad eflects on the morals of the inhabitants arise from this 

cause.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDAIJE. 

THE REV. ARCHIBALD M'CONECHY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The name of this parish has at diffe- 
rent times been variously written. The more ancient orthography 
was Bonkile on Bonkle, which has for more than half a century been 
changed into Bunkle or Buncle. Some derive the name Bunkle from 
the Latin bo7ia cella, while others refer it to the Celtic origin, hon or 
bmi signifying the foot or base, and cell or kill, a cell or chapel; 
which etymology is quite descriptive of the place. The word 
Preston, the name of the annexed parish, is supposed by some to 
come from the Saxon, signifying the town of the priests ; by others 
from the Gaelic Preas, signifying a thicket or copsewood, djiditun, 
a town or farm. 

The form of this united parish is very, irregular. The greatest 
distance between the farthest points may be 5 or 6 miles ; yet the 
mean length is only 4 miles, and the mean breadth 3|. It is 
bounded on the N. and E. by Abbey St Bathans and Coldingham ; 
on the S, E. by Chirnside ; on the S. and W. by the river Whit- 
adder, which separates it from Edrom and Dunse. This beauti- 
ful river, abounding with salmon and trout, is often visited by the 
angler. 

Topographical Appearances. — The lower district of the parish 
is nearly level, gently inclining, with small undulations, to the 
south-east. The Lammermoor hills traverse the northern divi- 
sion,— the southern ridge of which, called Bunkle Edge, is more 
than 700 feet above the level of the sea, but scarcely the half of 
that height above its own base. These hills commence at St 
Abbs' Head, in the parish of Coldingham, and extend in a westerly 
direction through the whole of Berwickshire, occasionally assuming 
m their progress a grand and picturesque appearance. 

Meteorology. — The atmosphere in this neighbourhood is gene- 
rally clear and salubrious, though sometimes, especially in spring 
and autumn, subject to a thick haze or mist, which always happens 



116 



BERWICKSHIRK. 



with an easterly wind, and continues for several days together. 
This watery vapour, floating in the atmosphere, appears to come 
from the sea, and is probably occasioned by exhalation from that 
element,— being carried by easterly winds over the adjacent land, 
and gradually falling in the form of dense mists. 

Geology.— li\ this parish three distinct rock formations may be 
traced. These are the transition rocks, the old red and the new 
red sandstone formations. The first of these forms the northern 
hilly boundary of the parish, consisting of greywacke and grey- 
wacke-slate, with occasionally subordinate beds and dikes of trap. 
The strata of the greywacke and its accompanying slate appear 
in general to have a direction from N. E. to S. W. as may be seen 
at the cleugh above Preston. Resting on this formation we meet 
with the old red sandstone, which seems to occupy the space be- 
tween the heights and the Whitadder,— the western boundary 
from Preston-bridge to Hoardweel. This formation is seen most 
distinctly on the western side of Stenshiel-hill, opposite to Cock- 
burn mill, lying in successive strata, in general very coarse-grained 
or conglomerate. The great mass of Stenshiel-hill is itself a fine- 
grained granite, or sienitic greenstone, as some have chosen to call 
it. It is perfectly unstratified, enveloped at its base by the red 
sandstone, and seems to be subordinate to the old red sandstone. 
Looking, therefore, at the different inchnation of the sandstone 
strata on each side of this mountain-mass of granite, the conclu- 
sion can hardly be avoided, that this vast granitic mass has, at a 
later period, and in a fluid state, pushed through these previously 
existing strata bf old red sandstone, and occupied its present po- 
sition. , . , -J 

Following the course of the river from this to Preston bridge, 
very few opportunities are afforded of examining the fundamental 
rocks, which, however, appear evidently to be of the same old red 
sandstone, the earhest of the secondary rocks. In several different 
places, trap-dikes are seen crossing the bed of the river. One of 
these is a great dike of basalt, half a mile above the bridge, m im- 
perfect columnar masses; a little below is another of a kind of 
coarse greenstone; a third occurs at Preston-bridge, and is the 
rock on which the south end of the bridge is built. A very little 
below this, and apparently resting on the old red sandstone, the 
new red or variegated sandstone formation, which is the charac- 
terizing one along the course of the Whitadcler, from this to its 
iunction with the Tweed, seems to commence. The principal rocks 
of this formation, as seen in this parish, and through the lower di- 



BUNKLE AND PRESTON. 



117 



vision of the county are beds of sandstone-slate, of indurated marl, 
gypsum, and conglomerate. These occur irregularly, frequently 
alternating with each other. Along both sides of the river, w.herever 
these strata are exposed to the action of the weather, we meet 
with abundance of clay marl, evidently occasioned by the decom- 
position of the beds of indurated marl and soft sandstone, which 
latter frequently contain a considerable portion of calcareous mat- 
ter; and, therefore, as a natural consequence, the soil on the 
lower lands, particularly along the course of the river, is rich and 
loamy, while on the higher grounds it is generally hght and poor. 

There is a copper mine, on the property of Lord Douglas, at 
the farm of Hoardweel, close by the river. About sixty years ago 
it was worked by an English company to a considerable extent. 
As the ore was at first rich, the work was for some years carried 
on with advantage ; but the vein afterwards ceasing to yield a suf- 
ficient quantity of ore, it was given up. In 1825, however, the 
work was again resumed by another company, likewise from Eng- 
land, and though for several months it was prosecuted with appa- 
rent success, it was a second time abandoned without any reason 
being assigned for such a step. 

Botany. — Bunkle wood affords considerable scope for the bo- 
tanist. It appears especially rich in cryptogamic plants. Among 
the rarer kinds observed in it, we may notice the Listeia cordata, 
Trollius Europceus globe-flower, and a variety of the Lonicera, 
honey-suckle,  with the leaves very deeply cut towards the extre- 
mities, — a variety, we presume, hitherto unnoticed by botanists. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — Two individuals, distinguished in literature and 
science, belonged to this parish. Dr James Hutton, author of a 
Theory of the Earth, was born at Edinburgh in 1726. He was 
bred to medicine, but afterwards turning his attention to agricul- 
ture, he came to reside in this parish on his small estate of Slighs- 
houses, and was the first who introduced the improved mode of hus- 
bandry into this part of the country. To acquire a competent know- 
ledge of this science, he went to Norfolk, where he staid for some- 
time ; and when he returned in 1754, he brought with him a plough- 
man from that county, whom he employed in improving his own 
property, and thus set the first example of good farming which had 
been seen in this district. 

• His celebrated Theory of the Earth might have been more worthy of notice, 
had he not seemed too much to overlook the agency and providence of the Deity, by 



118 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



In this parish also was born, in the year 1735, the celebrated me- 
dical theorist, Dr John Browne, author of the system .called from 
him the Brunonian system. Of the merits of this extraordinary in- 
dividual as an author and philosopher, it is not for us to speak. It 
seems to be agreed that his temper led him rather to aspire to the 
honour of an inventor in his science, at the risk of incurring the 
imputation of dogmatism, than to be content with the soUd but 
slower praise which is the reward of the severe observer and inter- 
preter of nature. But, however this be, enough of merit will still 
be his, in having stirred the depths of speculation at a time when 
the spirit of inquiry was not so prevalent as at present; and, whether 
his doctrines have stood or fallen, they excited an intense interest 
in their day, and have no doubt still their influence in the present 
state of medical knowledge. 

Land-oioners. — There are nine proprietors of land in this parish. 
Baronies ofBunkle and Preston. — The ancient baronies of Bunkle 
and Preston, comprehending 4774 acres of arable land, 1600 of 
moor or heath, and 350 of wood, which are more than two-thirds 
of the whole parish, belong to the noble family of Douglas. As 
far back as can be traced from ancient records, the former of these 
manors was possessed by Sir Alexander de Bonkle, and appears to 
have been transferred from him in 1288 to Sir John Stewart, se- 
cond son of Alexander, the Steward of Scotland, by his marrying 
the only child and heiress of said Sir Alexander de Bonkle. From 
Sir John Stewart it passed likewise by an heiress to a different 
branch of the Stewarts, whose grandson was created Earl of Angus 
and Lord de Bonkle ; and a grand-daughter of this Earl, by marry- 
ing William Earl of Douglas, carried the property from the race 
of'' the Stewarts to the family of Douglas, with whom it remains. 
It may not be improper to notice, that one of the descendants of 
this ancient family of Stewart, having married the sister of King 
Robert Bruce, the son of this marriage, in right of his mother, the 
male line of Bruce being extinct, ascended the Scottish throne ui 
1371. This was Robert the Second, and first of the Stewarts. Of the 
ancient castle of Bunkle, once the residence of the Stewarts, only 
small vestiges remain. It seems to have been a place of consi- 
derable strength, surrounded with a moat, which is now greatly 
filled up. The estate of Blenerne, containing 960 arable acres, 
and 45 of wood, among which are some very aged trees, belongs 

' , d-e.rrin£r cUirclv to the opcvatio.i of second causes the continual tendency to decay 
;uuVtl"e\wces of renovition, which he in.agined he discovered the uuuulane 
system.

to the Rev. Edward Sandys Lumsdaine. This beautiful proper- 
ty, lying along the course of the river, has been in the possession 
of the family of Lumsdaine for many centuries. It still shows the 
ruins of an ancient castle, near the present mansion-house. 

The lands of Billie, measuring 900 arable acres, and 20 of wood, 
are the property of William Forman Home, Esq. of Billie and Pax- 
ton, on which are the ruins of an old castle. The other properties 
in this parish are of small extent. 

Antiquities. — Along the southern verge of the Lammermoor- 
hills, immediately above the ruins of the old castle, are vestiges 
of several ancient encampments, at short distances from each 
other, forming a line along the southern verge of the hill, of 
three or four miles extent from east to west. These camps 
are for the most part of a circular form, each enclosing about 
two acres of ground. Of their antiquity or origin, tradition fur- 
nishes no account. Their appearance would seem to carry them" 
back to the times of the Picts ; to an era at least anterior to the 
overthrow of their kingdom, in the year of our faith 839. But to 
whatever period their origin may be assigned, it appears sufficiently 
obvious, that they were intended as a barrier against the incursions 
of a southern foe, as they lie along the verge of the hill, at places 
where the ascent from the south is more gradual and easy, and 
therefore requires the strongest defence. One of the most entire 
of these camps is at the head of the cleugh near Preston. It is 
surrounded with a line of double ramparts or mounds of earth, with 
corresponding ditches, even yet ten or twelve feet deep, leaving an 
opening on the east and west sides, as gateways to the interior.

None of the greater heritors reside at present in the parish. 
Most of the tenants have neat and commodious houses, maintain 
a respectable rank in society, and live comfortably. The other 
inhabitants are chiefly employed in agricultural labour. Their 
houses consist in general of one apartment only, which, in cases 
of family affliction, are found to be extremely inconvenient. In 
other respects, they enjoy a fair share of the comforts of life, and 
are quite contented with their condition. Living in a district where 
scarcely any manufactures are carried on, they are not given to poli-

tics, but are sober and industrious in their habits, decent in their ex- 
ternal deportment, and respectful to their superiors. Before the 
practice of draining the marshy lands was introduced, and when 
the lower orders were neither so well fed nor so comfortably 
lodged, the ague was prevalent in this part of the country, which 
malady is now scarcely known. During the last eight or nine 
years, several old men died in this parish between 80 and 90 years 
of age, and one last autumn, at the advanced age of 108. This 
man had been for many years blind, but he was comfortably 
provided for by the family of Blenerne, in whose service he 
had long been, and enjoyed good health and good spirits till his 
death. 

There has been only one illegitimate birth in the parish for 
several years. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — This parish contains 9300 
acres, of which 7280 are arable, 1600 moorland or heath, and 420 
are covered with wood, chiefly Scotch fir, for the most part re- 
cently planted. Of the 7280 acres of arable land, one-half is us- 
ually in tillage, the other half in pasture. Of the former kind, 
two-thirds, or 2426 acres, are on an average in white crop, and the 
remaining third in potatoes, turnips, and bare fallow. 

Improvements. — Though this is principally a grazing district, 
yet, during the last thirty years, it has undergone great melioration 
in the soil; in consequence of which high advances have been 
made in the rents. Some farms which were let for L. 500 during 
the previous leases are at present as high as L. 1600 ; others that 
brought little more than L.200 bring under the running leases above 
L. 1000. Under the previous leases, the rental of the whole pa- 
rish amounted only to L. 3200 : it is at present above L. 8000. 
To this extraordinary advance, which some think is in a higher 
ratio than in most other districts, several causes may have contri- 
buted. The former leases in this barony were mostly for a pe- 
riod of thirty years, and many of the tenants, possessed of conside- 
rable capital as well as skill and enterprise, spared no expense in 
reclaiming waste and barren lands, expecting from such long leases 
ample and adequate returns. By such speculations, some have 
improved their circumstances, but others have sustained pecuniary 
loss, in consequence of the fall on the price of grain since the 
termination of the war, and of the great, advance of the rents, dur-

ing the present leases, induced by the high state of improvement, 
to which they had brought their farms. 

Husbandry. — The general mode of cultivation is by a rotation of 
crops, consisting of two or three years of pasture, followed by three 
years of tillage. There are upwards of fifty ploughs in the pa- 
rish, but the farmers give their chief attention to the rearing of 
sheep, of which there are on some of the greater farms no less than 
1500 or 1600. These are mostly of the Leicester breed, to the 
improvement of which great attention is paid. Nearly all the 
waste land that was capable of cultivation has been brought un- 
der tillage, and so great had been the quantity of this, that one- 
half of the land now under the plough has been reclaimed from 
marshy bogs and barren hills, by draining, liming, and enclosing 
mostly at the expense of the tenant. The extent of the farms is 
various, being from 50 to 1300 acres, and the rents from L. 80 to 
L. 1600. For sometime back no leases have been given for a longer 
period than nineteen or twenty-one years. The houses on the 
farms are upheld by the tenants, but at the commencement of a 
lease, a small sum is usually allowed by the landlord to put them 
in a state of repair. The fences are good or indifferent, accord- 
ing to the quality and situation of the land ; great part of the soil 
lying on a moorland, is unfavourable to the growth of thorn-hedges, 
and the dikes, being built of round smooth stones without lime, 
stand in need of frequent repairs. 

The roads are entirely supported by the statute -labour con- 
version money, and are kept in good repair, the materials for this 
purpose being easily obtained. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as far as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Grain of all kinds, cultivated for food of man or domestic animals, L. 10,114 0 0 
Potatoes, turnips, hay, also pasture, 6051 0 0 

L. 16165 0 0 

B. — The land in white crop, before noticed, is supposed to 
yield about four quarters of barley or oats per acre, at a medium 
price, per quarter, of L. 1, Is. 8d. Beef and mutton are calcu- 
lated at 5d. per pound, wool at L. 1, 4s. per stone. There is but 
little wheat raised in the parish, and no more hay than supplies 
the farmers. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — There is no market-town in this pa-

BEIIWICKSIIIUE. 



rish ; Dunse, which is five miles distant, is the nearest. There 
is no village, nor post-office, nor inn, nor public-house of any kind. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parishes of Bunkle and Preston, ori- 
ginally separate charges, were about 120 years ago united as one 
cure, and for several years after this union public worship was per- 
formed in each alternately. This continued for several years; but 
both churches coming to need repair, that of Bunkle being most 
centrical, was sufficiently fitted up to accommodate the whole po- 
pulation, and the other left in a ruinous state. The church of 
Bunkle was rebuilt in 1820. It is a plain and neat edifice, built 
on the old site, at the southern base of the Lammermoor hills, ca- 
pable of containing 400 sitters, which is more than the half of the 
entire population. The manse, which is close by the church, was 
built at three different periods ; the oldest part in 1718. It was 
enlarged in 1764, — and a farther addition was made in 1801. 
The situation is somewhat remote, there being no other habitation 
in the immediate vicinity. The glebe consists of forty-four acres, 
all arable, worth about L. 40 per annum. The stipend since last 
augmentation in 1821 is sixteen chalders, half-meal half-barley, 
payable in money, at the rate of the fiars prices of the county. In 
this is included nearly L. 28 of money, not affected by the price of 
grain, one of the heritors having surrendered his teinds. On an 
average of the last seven years, the stipend has been L. 240 Ster- 
hng, besides L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The living is 
in the gift of Lord Douglas. 

There is no dissenting place of worship in this parish, but a 
number of families, amounting to about 50, have been for many 
years in the practice of going to dissenting houses in Dunse. The 
church is well attended, as by far the greater number, and nearly 
all the respectable families, come to the parish church. The ave- 
rao-e number of communicants is about 230. 

Education.— The parochial school-house, which is the only one 
in the parish, was lately rebuilt. It is neat and commodious 
enough, and has a good garden attached to it. The usual branches 
are taught ; the salary is the maximum ; and the school fees are. 
moderate. The schoolmaster's income, including the emoluments 
arising from the offices of session-clerk and heritor's clerk, may 
amount to upwards of L. 70 per annum. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The collections in the church are 
inconsiderable, scarcely adequate to pay the church-officers, viz. 
the precentor, session-clerk, and beadle, &amp;c. They may amount 



BUNKLE AND PRESTON. 



123 



to L. 6 per annum ; but there is a regular half-yearly assessment for 
the poor, amounting to upwards of L. 70 yearly ; one half-paid by 
the heritors, the other by the tenants. The average number of 
poor on the roll is about 18 or 20 persons ; the allowance to each 
may average Is. 6d. per week. There is no other regular fund for 
support of the poor. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It is to be regretted that little attention, till very lately, has 
been paid to the planting of wood in the northerly and more 
hilly parts of the parish. Plantations, however small, are high- 
ly ornamental to a country, tend to improve the climate, and af- 
ford shelter to the crops as well as to the cattle ; and though at 
first attended with expense, yet they ultimately become profitable, 
especially on waste lands, which are fit for nothing else. Of this, 
the following fact is sufficient evidence. About sixty years ago, 
upwards of 100 acres of waste and marshy ground, on the estate 
of Lord Douglas, were planted chiefly with Scotch firs, inter- 
spersed with larch and spruce trees. Part of this plantation has 
been cut down, and the produce has been found to yield a great- 
er profit, after deducting the expenses of planting and making 
fences around it, than the best land of the same extent. Acting 
on the same enlightened views, his Lordship has, for some years 
past, planted to a considerable extent on his property on the 
Lammermoor, which, at no distant period, will prove highly be- 
neficial to his estate, and ornamental to the neighbourhood.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. THOMAS LOGAN, M. D. MINISTER 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, Extent, -c— The boundaries of this parish are 
now well defined. At the time of the last Statistical Account, 
written by Dr Anderson, the river Whitadder, which runs on 
the south and south-west sides of the parish, was but an uncer- 
tain boundary, as its course was often changed by floods ; but now 
its course, by means of embankments, is kept uniform and regular. 
The boundaries are now also distinctly marked by means of a deep 
ditch that runs between the conterminous lands of this parish and 
those of Bunkle and Coldingham. 

That river forms the boundary of the parish for an extent of 
about five miles. It is observed to be now subject to floods higher 
but of shorter duration than formerly,— in consequence, probably, 
of the draining of the lands in its course, especially of the nume- 
rous sheep-drains which have lately been cut on the Lammermoor- 

hills. Mj 1, -1 

The temperature of the atmosphere is generally mild, the soil 

dry, and the climate healthy. 

11. — Civil History. 

Eminent Mew.— Under this head we have to mention the cele- 
brated historian and philosopher David Hume, who was brought 
up in this parish from his infancy ; and the Rev. Henry Erskme, 
who was ordained minister soon after the Revolution, succeedmg 
Lawtie, the Episcopal clergyman, and who was the father of Ebe- 
nezer and Ralph Erskines, the leaders of the Secession. To the 
memory of that Henry Erskine, a monument has lately been erect- 
ed in the churchyard at a considerable expense. 

Land-owners.— chief land-owners are Sir John Hall, Bart, 
of Dunglass, the patron ; William Hay, Esq. of Dunse Castle; Dad 
Hume, Esq. of Ninewells, one of the Barons of the Court of Ex- 

. This account has been drawn up by Mr Charles Hcriot.

chequer in Scotland ; Thomas Begby, Esq. of Mains ; and Sir 
William Grant Keir, of Blackburn. 

Parochial Registers. — The registers of this parish commence in 
the year 1660. They are on the whole regularly kept, — though 
the Dissenters do not always record the births of their children. 

Modern Buildings. — A mansion-house is proposed to be built 
at Mains next season. It may be mentioned, that since the last 
Statistical Account eleven farm-houses have been built, all two sto- 
ries high, and all, except two, covered with slate. A correspond- 
ing improvement has taken place in the farm-offices. 

III. — Population.

1811, - - - 1239 

1821, - - 1189

In 1834 the number has fallen to 1169, whereof 462 reside in 

the country, and 707 in villages.

The number of proprietors of land in the parish of the yearly 
value of L. 50 and upwards is 8. 

The number of persons in different trades or professions is as fol- 
lows : merchants, 5 ; surgeons, 2 ; midwife, 1 ; millwrights, 2 masters, 
3 journeymen, and 4 apprentices ; common wrights, 4 masters, 7 
journeymen, and 3 apprentices; smiths, 8; weavers, 10. 

During the last three years, there have been two illegitimate 
births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of English acres 
in the parish is computed at 5000 or rather more. There is no 



120 BKIlMaCKSIIlRE. 

waste land in the parish. Tiie whole parish, indeed, may be said 
to be in a high state of cultivation. The number of acres planted 
is about 371. 

All the plantations are in a very thriving state, — particularly 
those on the banks of the Whitadder at Ninewells. They are 
also well managed. For some years past, the periodical fellings 
at Whitehall have been considerable, — insomuch that a quantity 
of oaks of superior quality was cut down there four or five years 
ago, which must have brought about L. 800 Sterling. 

Prices of Timber. — The comparative prices of wood grown here 
during the late war, and at the present time, are as follows : Dur- 
ing the late war, for fir of a superior quality, per cubic foot, from 
2s. 6d. to 3s. ; oak, 4s. 6d. to 5s. ; ash and elm, 3s. ;— at present, 
fir. Is.; oak, 2s. 6d.; ash and elm, Is. 6d. 

Rent of Land. — It was matter of astonishment to the writer of 
the last Statistical Account, that the rents of land in this parish 
should have risen from 3s. to 12s., and from 5s. to L. 1 per acre. 
How much more astonishing to find that these rents have now risen 
to L. 1, 16s., L.2, L. 2, 10s., L.3, 15s. L.4, L. 4, 4s., and some- 
times even more per acre  

Of late years, the practice has been introduced of letting land 
upon a corn-rent,— that is, for a certain number of bushels of oats 
■per acre, to be estimated at the average fiars of the five crops im- 
mediately preceding. This scheme, however, though apparently 
an equitable one for both parties, has its difficulties, from the fluc- 
tuations in prices, and in the quantities of produce in different years. 
To remedy this, the parties have agreed upon both a maximum 
rent, which shall never be surpassed, and a minimum, below which 
it must never fall. 

The rental of the parish is as follows : 

Of farm lands, - - - "S n n 

Of houses, Ninewells and Whitehall, -  X 

Of plantations at Whitehall, - - J n 

Other plantations, - - " n n 

Of houses in Chirnside, - ■ 4/ uu 

L. 8504 0 0 

Rate of //Tttyes.— Farm-servants, or hinds, are generally hired 
for one year, from Whitsunday to Whitsunday, and receive ten 
bolls of oats, three of barley, and one of pease,— also their food in 
harvest, the keep of a cow, an allowance when they take the corn 
to market, about 1200 or 1400 yards in length of a drill of twenty- 
eight inches wide for potatoes, three or four double-horse cart- 



CHIRNSIDE. 



127 



loads of coals driven home, a pig- kept by themselves, and a piece 
of land for a garden. 

The comparative rate of wages here during the late war and 
at present are as follows: 

During the war, a common labourer per day, 2s. 6d. ; wrights 
and masons, 3s. ; shearers in harvest, 2s. 6d. or 3s. with victuals. 
At present, — a common labourer per day, Is. 8d. ; wrights and 
masons, Is. 8d. without victuals ; shearers in harvest, 2s. 2d. and 
their victuals. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The sheep are chiefly of the large Lei- 
cester kind, which, when well fed, weigh at two years old from 
23 to 25 or 28 lbs. per quarter. The total number of sheep 
in the parish is generally about 120 scores; — but even these are 
not sufficient to consume the turnips that are grown in the parish, 
and sometimes considerable numbers are brought from different 
parts of the county, and even from Northumberland, for that pur- 
pose. The cattle are generally of the short-horned breed. 

Implements of Husbandry. — The ploughs generally used are 
Small's, mostly made of iron, with cast-metal heads and mould- 
boards. They cost generally L. 3 ; and their number in the pa- 
rish is 50, — all drawn by two horses. 

Husbandry. — One-half of the land is generally kept in tillage, 
— the other half in grass. The common rotation is, 1. oats after 
grass ; 2. Turnips or fallow ; 3. Wheat, barley, or oats, with grass 
seeds ; 4. Hay or pasture ; 5. Pasture. The common manure is 
farm-yard dung ; but of late bone-dust has been used for turnips, 
— about two quarters of which are commonly applied to an Eng- 
lish acre, and sown in drills with a machine. It costs about L. 1 
per quarter, and is found highly beneficial on light soils. 

Draining has been practised to a great extent ; but there has 
been little or no opportunity for practising irrigation. Consider- 
able sums of money have lately been expended in embankments on 
the river Whitadder. The duration of leases is generally for nine- 
teen years. 

It may be remarked, that while at the time of the last Statisti- 
cal Account there were only two or three tenants who had changed 
their possessions for twenty years, — the case is now quite altered, — 
as there have been twelve or thirteen tenants who have left their 
possessions before the expiry of their leases. 

At the time of the last Statistical Account there were no thrash- 
ing-machines in the parish ; there are now fourteen, and the baris 



128 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



necessary for these machines are built in the most substantial man- 
ner. The mills which existed at that time have been greatly im- 
proved. 

There are five gardens in the parish, called sale gardens, well 
stocked with fruit trees in a good state of bearing. The posses- 
sions in the village, which are mostly held of Sir John Hall on 
leases of ten times three nineteen years, or 570 years, have all 
small gardens attached to them. • 

Quarries. — There are several wrought quarries of freestone in 
the parish,— and it is supposed there are others that might be 
wrought if necessary. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Oats, - L. 3081 0 0 

Turnips, - 2750 0 0  

Barley, - 2730 0 0 

Wheat, - 1753 0 0 

Grass, - 1467 0 0 

Grass hay, - 1000 0 0 

Other grass, - 427 0 0 

Gardens, - 200 0 0 

Potatoes, - 480 0 0 

Cows, - 690 0 0 

L. 14,380 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— There are in the parish about 6 1 miles 
of turnpike road,— all in good repair : so also are the cross roads. 
An act of Parliament has lately been obtained for building a bridge 
over the Whitadder at the Bluestone Ford, in the southern part 
of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State.— 'o part of the parish lies farther from the 
church than 2| miles. It is at present in pretty good repair : pro- 
bably it was built several hundred years ago,— for in one part of 
the wall, which was evidently a later addition, there is a tablet dated 
1572, with the inscription " helpe the pvr." When the body of 
the church was rebuilt, the western door, of Saxon architecture, 
with a small part of the wall belonging to the ancient fabric, was 
with good taste preserved, and the new wall built upon it. There 
have been many complaints of the insufficiency of the accommo- 
dation to the persons belonging to the Establishment. 

The manse was built in 1757. It is small, but in good repair. 

The extent of the glebe is 8 English acres of excellent land, 
with half an acre more for the site of houses.

The stipend, as modified on 19th May 1830, is 17 chalders, half- 
meal, half barley, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

The church is attended by about 200 families ; and there are 
about 400 communicants. The number of families attending the 
chapels of Dissenters and Seceders is 74. 

Education. — There is one parochial and two unendowed schools, 
— the first attended by about 70 scholars, the others by about 88. 
The parochial schoolmaster's salary is L. 34 : fees probably L. 30, 
and he has the legal accommodations, — besides 5 per cent, on the 
poors' funds, for his trouble in collecting and disbursing thereof. 
He teaches, besides the ordinary branches, Latin, Greek, French, 
and practical mathematics. 

Library — A circulating library, consisting of upwards of 500 
volumes, well chosen, was established in the parish about thirty 
years ago. 

Friendly Societies. — Of these there are two : one of which is 
without capital, — the money being collected when necessary. It 
was established in June 1808, and consists of 180 members. L. 6 
are allowed for the funeral of a member, — and L. 3 for that of his 
wife. The other society was established in September 1817, and 
consists of about 60. The quarterly payment . to it by each mem- 
ber is Is. 6d. ; and each member, when sick or superannuated, re- 
ceives a small stated allowance. 

It may be proper to add, that, a few years ago, another society 
was formed, which is now dissolved. It was called the Coio Society. 
Those persons who kept a cow entered into a mutual agreement, 
to contribute a small sum to assist any member who might lose his 
cow by disease or accident, — that sum being always under the 
value of the cow lost. It is proper to state, that the reason of this 
was to prevent carelessness or wilful injury to the cow. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of enrolled poor is 
55; weekly payment to all, L. 5, 5s. ; amount of yearly assessment 
on heritors and tenants, L. 270 ; monthly cess of the parish, L. 68, 
18s. 4d. Scotch. There are no other funds applicable to the poor. 

Inns or Alehouses. — Of these there are five in the parish. 

Fuel. — The fuel used consists for the most part of coal from 
Northumberland, with which there is now a ready communication.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE TOUGH, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 4;c.~The parish of Ayton, like that of Eye- 
mouth, obviously derives its name from the water of Eye, on whose 
banks the village of the same name is situated. In the ancient re- 
cords, it is usually written Eitun or Eitoii ; and it is said to be com- 
pounded of two Saxon words. Ex, a water or stream, and tun, a 
villa or town. The parish is nearly four miles in length, and as 
many in breadth, and contains probably twelve or thirteen square 
miles. It is bounded on the north by Eyemouth and Colding- 
ham; on the south by Foulden and Mordington ; on the west 
by Coldingham and Chirnside ; and on the east by the sea. In 
figure, it somewhat resembles the flat side of a battle axe without 
the handle, having the edge turned towards the south and east. 

Topographical Appearances.— the south there is a beautifully 
sloping range of high land, tastefully adorned with copses of plan- 
tation to the summit. At its highest elevation, it is 660 feet above 
the level of the sea. The highest point of the sea banks, known 
by the name of Blaiky's, is 350 feet, precipitous towards the sea, 
sloping gently towards the land, and irregularly down to the water's 
edge at Eyemouth. On the northern side of the parish the ground 
is lower and flatter than on the southern, but still of considerable 
elevation, and finely undulating in all directions. The whole line 
of coast for many miles both north and south is splendidly bold and 
rocky. Its extent within the parish is two miles, forming almost 
a continued precipice, with innumerable indentations. The stra- 
tification of the rocks is distinctly visible, and in all possible incli- 
nations, curvatures, and fantastic shapes, evidently thrown into the 
wildest confusion by some great convulsion of nature. There are 
one or two caves which present themselves to the eye of the man- 
ner, accessible only by sea; they were distinguished probably m for- 
.ner times as smuggling concealments, but are now only a sheUei

The parish line of coast is terminated on the south by a rocky bay 
accessible from the land by a steep ravine, at the bottom of which 
stands the romantic fishing village of Burnmouth, and a remark- 
able rock called the Maiden Stone, isolated at high water. It has 
probably been separated from the precipice above by the under- 
mining influence of the sea. At the northern extremity of the par 
rish line of coast are two or three small islets, called the Harker 
rocks, over which the sea washes, and when impelled by strong- 
easterly winds, ascends in beautiful sheets of foam to the height of 
seventy or a hundred feet. 

Hydrography. — There are two principal streams in this parish, 
the Eye and the Ale. The former, the largest of the two, takes 
its rise in the Lammermoors, and after flowing in a south-easterly 
direction for ten or twelve miles, turns nearly at right angles on 
entering the western side of the parish, traversing the parish in the 
line of the great central valley in a north-easterly direction, when, for 
another mile, it skirts the parish in the same direction, separating it 
from that of Eyemouth, and then falls into the sea. On entering the 
parish, its velocity is accelerated by the increasing declivity of the 
land towards the sea, just to such a degree as to convert it into a 
beautifully interesting stream during the remainder of its course. 
Its windings and sloping banks render the grounds on either side 
most desirable for country 'seats. The scenery of the valley through 
which it flows, especially when viewed from Millerton-hill on the 
west, presents a magnificent picture, having Ayton House with all 
its fine plantations, the picturesque village of Ayton, the manse, 
and the church, the beautiful new mansion-house and grounds of 
Peelwalls, all in sight, and various mansions and farm-houses in 
the distant horizon, with the hill country on the right, and the 
mighty ocean, forming the back scene towards the north-east. But 
that view is now seldom enjoyed by the traveller, the western ap- 
proach to Ayton over Millerton-hill having been changed some 
years ago. 

The quantity of water flowing in the Eye may be estimated by 
Its being able to drive common flour-mills, and even a paper-milf, 
except in very dry seasons, when there is a scarcity for these pur- 
poses. The other stream, the Ale, has its rise in Coldingham pa- 
rish, takes also a south-easterly course for two or three miles, and 
at the northern extremity of the parish, continuing in the same direc- 
tion. It forms the north-eastern boundary, which separates Ayton pa 
rish from those of Coldingham and Eyemouth to the extent of two 
niiles, and then it falls into the Eye at a very romantic spot, dis- 



132 BERWICKSHIRE. 

tinguished by a remarkable elevation, called the Kip-rock. A very 
little way above this spot, there is a beautiful haugh or valley, of 
late years planted, through which the Ale has a serpentine course. 
This valley must formerly have been the bed of a lake, whose lower 
barrier has been cut down by the stream. As the opening or exit 
of the stream from the bed of the lake is narrow, the barrier might 
again be restored at a small expense. This would not only em- 
bellish the scenery in a very high degree, but might even indem- 
nify for the loss of the land, which here being gravelly, is not very 
valuable, by raising the surface of the lake to a sufficient elevation 
to admit a canal from it to assist the work of the paper-mill. This 
mill has been injudiciously set down above rather than below the 
confluence of the streams, and would be greatly profited by this 
accession of water, of which it stands much in need. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— B.y\ng already noticed the form 
and infinitely diversified stratification of the rocks, it is here only 
necessary to remark that, along the whole range of the coast 
within the parish, they consist of greywacke and greywacke 
slate, commencing at the northern extremity, after having been 
interrupted by an extraordinary mass of conglomerate immedi- 
ately to the north of Eyemouth bay. This greywacke again ter- 
minates, or rather disappears for a httle at the southern extre- 
mity, being there covered with a superincumbent formation of 
sandstone. Probably the estate of Greystonlees, comprehendmg 
the commencement of this formation of sandstone, owes its name 
to this peculiarity,— being the only land in the parish where 
freestone is to be found. It is a little remarkable, that both 
the northern and southern extremities of the coast within the 
parish should happen to coincide with the points at which the 
greywacke rock becomes invisible, as if the parochial division had 
been regulated by the geological. The same coincidence of 
limit, however, does not take place to any distance inland, for the 
sandstone on the south, and the conglomerate on the north, are 
both of very limited extent. The rocks within the parish where- 
ever quarried partake of the same whinstone quality as those 
UDon the shore, and form excellent materials both for build- 
ing and road purposes. Just where the sandstone commences at 
Burnmouth, it has been occasionally quarried, and very lately to 
a considerable extent, for the erection of a harbour to the fisher- 
men. Lately also, masses of coarse alabaster or gypsum, of a 
reddish colour, have been dug out of the same banks, by the pro- 
prietor of Greystonlees, but it has not as yet been converted into

any important use. There are immense quantities of coarse gravel, 
boulders and rolled blocks under the soil, in the neighbourhood 
of the Eye, evidently rounded during ages of exposure to the ac- 
tion of water, and deposited by the strength of the same element. 
The soil in general is good, and not much, if at all, inferior to any 
in the county ; light and gravelly in the northern, and more loamy 
in the southern parts of the parish. It does not appear to have 
been shifted by any process of nature, except by the watery depo- 
sits above-mentioned. 

Zoology. — All sorts of white fish, equal to any on the eastern 
coast, which are the best in the kingdom, are caught by the Burn- 
mouth fishermen in great abundance; and occasionally red fish. 
Cod, ling, and herrings are here cured for distant markets. Lob- 
sters also are occasionally sent hence to London ; and lately an 
attempt has been made to convert even periwinkles, of which 
there are immense quantities among the rocks, into an article of 
trade. They are in some request in London with the fish- 
mongers, for making fish sauce. 

Botany.— The only rare plants discovered in this parish are, Ist 
the Veronica Jiliformis, discovered by Dr Johnston, author of the 
Berwick Flora, an engraving of which forms the frontispiece of his 
work. He found it about four years since, upon the farm of 
Whiterig, the second known station for it in Britain. 2c, iheScilla 
verna, discovered by the Rev. A. Baird of Cockburnspath. It 
was growing upon the sea banks at Gunsgreen. Before the dis- 
covery of this habitat, it was believed to be a native exclusively of 
the western shores of the island. 3c, the Astragalus glycyphyllos 
discovered for the first time in Berwickshire, by Mr A. Carr, sur- 
geon, Ayton, in the dean above Burnmouth. This dean is said 
to be one of the most interesting botanical resorts in the neigh- 
bourhood. The Hyoscyamus niger, or henbane, grows wild on 
the sea coast, as discovered on the lands of Fairneyside, by Mr 
E. Colville, surgeon, Ayton. 

All sorts of hard and soft wood grow well in this parish. Perhaps 
the Scotch and spruce firs thrive best. There are some very fine 
old hard-wood trees, of various kinds, surrounding Ayton House. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — There is no direct history, ancient or modern, of 
this parish, but from old charters of Coldingham priory and other 
sources, a few gleanings have been collected. From these it ap- 
pears that Ayton was formerly a dependency on the monastery of 
Coldingham, When a colony of Benedictine monks settled at 



134 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



Coldingham, between the years 1098 and 1107, under the auspices, 
of King Edgar, that monarch, with many other endowments, bestow- 
ed upon them two places called Eytun Eytun et aliam Eytun be- 
ing the village of Ayton, and another small dependency on the oppo- 
site side of the river, called Nether Ayton, — which were confirmed to 
them by the charters of his successors. Ayton being thus bestowed 
on the Coldingham monks, it is probable that its church whose old 
walls are still extant, built of square hewn-stones, not closely joint- 
ed, and evidently very ancient was founded about this time. Till 
the Reformation, it seems to have been a cell or chapel of the 
neighbouring priory. After the arrangement of the parishes in Scot- 
land, the present parishes of Ayton and Coldingham formed the 
then parish of Coldingham. At the Reformation, Ayton was dis- 
joined from Coldingham, and united with Lamberton on the south- 
east ; but not long after, it became, as it now is, a parish -per se. 

Independently of all written records, the first object of histo- 
rical antiquity or interest which presents itself to the eye is the 
round camp of Drumaw or Habchester, on the highest point of 
the southern extremity, now half-ploughed down, and reduced to 
the form of a semicircle. Some modern antiquarians have la- 
mented that so perfect a specimen of the ancient British encamp- 
ments has not escaped the mutilation of the plough, especially as 
no ancient relics have been discovered by the process of ploughing 
it down, to compensate for the deed. Enough, however, remains 
to mark the judgment and the industry with which such places had 
been selected and constructed, both with a view to observation 
and defence. Situated on the highest elevation of a lofty emi- 
nence, and commanding a most extensive prospect both of sea and 
land, no spot could be better chosen for watching the movements 
of an enemy; andformedof twoconcentric mounds with adeep trench 
between, and another outside, it was capable of making a vigorous 
resistance. As it stands on the northern side of the hill, it is probable 
that it was constructed by South Britons, to repel the assaults of their 
northern neighbours; at all events, it was not constructed by the Ro- 
mans, as has been erroneously conjectured, for its form is circular. 
Near this spot must have passed the Roman road, which extended 
from the wall of Severus which crosses the country at Newcastle 
io the Roman camp in the vicinity of St Abb's Head, where it 
terminated. This road also must have passed close to the rising 
ground, on which has since stood, and since disappeared, the 
castle of Ayton, and which is now the site of Ayton House. Pos- 
sibly the situations both of the camp and of the castle were cho- 



AYTON. 135 

sen, in part at least, on account of their contiguity to the Roman 
road, for long subsequently to the retiring of the Romans it would 
be the best, if not the only great, thoroughfare of the country. 
Cairnchester, another camp hard by, of which there are now no 
vestiges but the name, and Chesterdale and Chesterbank, all m- 
dicate that this hill had been often selected for encampments on 
account of the fitness of its locality for that purpose.  These, 
however, in process of time, gave place to castles, of which there 
are many remains in all the border counties, and which proved 
strono-er and more permanent places of defence than camps. 

Castle of A2/ton.—Amoug these the Castle of Ayton seems to 
have held a distinguished place, as we learn from a siege to which 
it was subjected by Surry, the renowned general of Henry VII. in 
1497, when, as Ford in his dramatic chronicle sayeth or singe th, 

" This strongest of their forts 

Old Ayton Castle was yielded and demolished." 

It seems to have been founded long after the conquest, by a Nor- 
man of the name of De Vescie, who having formed a settlement 
on the banks of the Eye, erected a castle and collected his vassals 
around him. The village of Ayton sprang up under the castle 
walls for mutual protection. The family name of De Vescie was af- 
terwards changed into that of De Eitun : and the Aytons of Inch- 
darney in Fife are supposed to be the Hneal descendants of this 
ancient family. 

Estate of Ji/ton. — About the commencement of the fifteenth cen- 
tury, the estate of Ayton fell into the possession of the Homes, who 
about that period had acquired great sway in Berwickshire. In 1 7 1 5 
it passed from the Homes, when the sentence of forfeiture was in- 
curred by James Home, the last proprietor of that name, who had 
abetted the Earl of Mar in his vain attempt to reinstate the Stew- 
arts upon the throne. After remaining a few years vested in the 

• It may he proper to mention here an occurrence which happened in regard to 
the signal station erected during the late war, close by the ancient camp of Habches- 
ter ; which eventually proved an experiment on the spirit of the country. The man 
at the station mistaking some whins blazing in the west for an inland alarm of the 
French landing, quickly lighted his beacon fire. This being observed from the 
manse windows by the former incumbent, was instantly communicated to the villa- 
gers, many of whom being volunteers were at their posts in a moment, and ready to 
march to reiel the foe. The alarm sjiread in all directions. Both horse and foot 
volunteers, from all parts of Berwickshire, were immediately on their route to the 
place of rendezvous at Dunbar. The news soon reached Edinburgh, and botli town 
and country were all in commotion. Some serious and distressing alarms were un- 
avoidably the consequence, and might have leen aggravated tenfold, had not tlie of- 
ficer commanding the first of the shore stations at St Alb's Head, irnlently ab- 
stained from repeating the signal, although he saw it distinctly. But being a tliorongh 
bred navy officer, he understood liis duty better than to depart a liair's breaihh 
from the line of his instructions, which were lo connnunicale by signal only whiil 
he observed at sea.

crown, this estate was purchased by an ancestor of the present 
proprietor. Since that time it has undergone successive improve- 
ments and embelHshments, by large plantations and otherwise, 
more congenial with peaceful times, and all of them done with 
much judgment and taste. The castle or mansion-house, stand- 
ing on a beautiful acclivity, near the great London road, with its 
fine grounds full in view, is the first object of attraction and admi- 
ration in Scotland, to all strangers passing to the nortli. But alas, 
for the vicissitude of human affairs  Although neither turmoil nor 
feuds disturb the peaceful habitations of this once agitated district, 
a devouring conflagration has within these few weeks, and in the 
short period of as many hours, reduced that delightful mansion 
to a heap of. ruins. Providentially, the whole family, assembled 
from different quarters, as if to witness the sad catastrophe, and to 
render mutual aid, although scarcely in time warned of their dan- 
ger, and some of them in the greatest jeopardy, escaped unhurt. 
They must remove for a season. May they soon return to retrieve 
the damage, and to enliven the scene, which is now desolate in the 
extreme. 

Prendergueatand Whiterig. — The next place in this parish respect- 
ing which there are any historical fragments is Prenderguest. In 
the reign of David I., the half of this estate belonged to Swain, priest 
of the ancient parish of Fishwick, on the banks of the Tweed ', and 
there is a document extant whereby this individual renounced his 
claim to it in favour of the monks of Coldingham. Many of the Cold- 
ingham charters are witnessed by members of an Anglo-Norman fa- 
mily, who once possessed Prenderguest, and seem to have imparted 
their name to the land. From the records of Lindisfern monastery, we 
learn that, in 1326, William de Prenderguest, possessing somewhat 
of the qualifications of a border reiver rendered himself notorious 
by plundering the brewhouse and bakehouse of that religious esta- 
blishment, — this being the only instance on record of its having suf- 
fered skaith at the hands of a freebooter. About the middle of the 
fifteenth century it passed to the Homes. The mansion-house of 
Prenderguest is an excellent modern building. It has been occu- 
pied by the present tenant for about thirty years. The farm-house 
was taken down many years ago, and has never been rebuilt. — The 
same is the case with the mansion and farm-house of Whiterig, an 
adjoining property of rather smaller extent than the former. The 
latter is now in tlie possession of a gentleman who lately repre- 
sented the city of Edinburgh in Parliament. 

Pechvalls and Bastkridge.— During the fifteenth and sixteenth 



AYTON. 



137 



centuries, the estates of Peelvvalls and Bastleridge, to the eastward 
of the former two, had each a distinct proprietor as they have still 
named Home ; and there is a deed extant in which Home of Bastle- 
ridge is styled bailiff of the barony of Peelwalk. The latter place, 
within the last three or four years, has undergone an extraordinary 
metamorphosis under the judicious management of a new proprie- 
tor. An elegant new mansion-house has been built of beautiful 
hewn stone, brought from the far-famed quarries of Killala, in Fife- 
shire ; and the grounds and public roads have been so completely 
changed and improved, that any one who has not seen the place 
during that short period would be utterly at a loss to recognize it 
as the same. It may here be mentioned, to the honour of a for- 
mer proprietor of this place, whose name might otherwise never 
have come down to our day, that there is the following inscription 
on one of the silver communion cups. " This cup, originally given 
by Magdalen Rule of Peelwalls, to the church of Ayton in 1677, 
was renewed and enlarged in 1780." 

Flemingtons. — There are three places, all contiguous to each 
other, of the name of Flemington, — concerning which there is a tra- 
dition or conjecture that a colony of Flemish merchants had esta- 
blished themselves here, and imparted their name to their new 
settlement. As it is well known that the wool marts of these 
enterprising people went by the name of Redhalls, the existence 
of a place of that name in the immediate neighbourhood is corro- 
borative of the tradition. One of these Redhalls likewise stood 
at the bottom of the street called Woolmarket, in Berwick. From 
the circumstance of the three Flemingtons lying on the side of the 
great hilly range on the south border of the parish, it is likewise 
probable that this tract was chosen by them on account of its being 
well adapted to sheep pasture, although now it is under tillage to 
the very top of the hill. There is still an extensive sheep walk 
on the other side of the hill, called Lamberton Moor, which be- 
longs to the neighbouring parish of Mordington. The Flemings 
had probably chosen the north side of the hill, on account of its 
vicinity to the port of Eyemouth. 

Gunsgreen. — Gunsgreen House, close by the sea side and har- 
bour of Eyemouth, is an excellent mansion. The principal pecu- 
liarity of this house is, that it was built by a wealthy smuggler. 
For the purpose of carrying on his contraband traffic, he construct- 
ed it with many concealments within the house, and with others 
attached to it. These, it is supposed, have not all been discovered 
to this day; and if stored with valuable commodities, which, by any 



138 BERWICKSHIRE. 



accident, have as yet been left untouched, they may enrich some 
future possessor with unexpected treasure hid either in the house 
or in the field. To these there is now no clew. It is only a few 
years since the carriage-horses of the present proprietor were nearly 
swallowed up while ploughing in a field near the house, — owing to 
the roof of an unknown but empty concealment giving way. Of 
course not much treasure was found there.  

Netherhyres. — Immediately adjoining to Gunsgreen is the estate 
of Netherbyres, which, after having been in the possession of one 
family and their descendants for more than two hundred years, has 
lately been purchased by a gentleman well known to the world for 
his valuable and extraordinary manufacture and construction of chain- 
cables and suspension-bridges. By the latter, he has effected a se- 
cond union of the sister kingdoms, in the beautiful chain-bridge over 
the Tweed at Paxton, which, it is hoped, will soon lead to the erection 
of others in this county, as it has already done in diflferent parts of 
the kingdom. Of this most necessary means of communication, there 
is as yet a great deficiency in Berwickshire, over the larger streams. 
This enterprising gentleman has already commenced improvements 
on his newly-acquired property, where he intends to erect a splen- 
did mansion-house, with an approach to it from the north side, by 
means of a suspension-bridge over the Eye; f and to form other em- 
belhshments, all which will furnish employment to many industrious 
individuals, and will contribute to ornament a parish already dis- 
tinguished for its many beauties. 

Fairneyside, Greystonelees, and ChesterbanL— The next place 
to be noticed is Fairneyside, a good property extending along the 
sea-coast, with an ancient mansion and farm-house, both, however, 
scarcely habitable. The former has been occupied by the farming 
tenants for many years, and the latter by the farm-servants. Here 
also smugghng concealments have lately been discovered,— mdicat- 
ing a twofold traffic carried on by a former tenant, the history of which 
is sufficiently recent to be pretty well known to the parishioners even 
at this day.— Adjoining to the foregoing property is that of Greyston- 

• It was ih allusion to this mansion-house that a member once observed in the Se- 
nate that smucelinff was carried on to such an alarming extent on the east coast of 
Scotland, that one man had been enabled, from its gains, to erect a splendid palace. 
It now bdongs to a very different proprietor lately tlie venerable pastor of th,s par.sh, 
u. hor of thebrmer sLtistical Account, and father-ni-law of the present ncumben . 

t The operations are even now far in advance, and have already produced a m ag - 
...1 h-'uisforniation on the place. The particular form of suspension bridge now erccl- 
,1 is C pt in 13 rn, inven.ioli, and which he calls . Tcusion Bridge, being 
J,m. ortcd V insteacl of being suspended from, the chains. This, in the opinion of

lees. Here there is neither mansion nor farm-house, but a pretty 
good set of offices, and a thrashing-mill driven by water. Here, 
too, there is reason to suspect that smuggling had been carried on 
in former times. There is on this property a place called Catch-a- 
penny, well adapted for that purpose by its retired situation on the 
edge of the adjoining moor, and immediately above Burnmouth. 
It was probably so named or nick-named for its receiving a share 
of the booty.  

Ascending the hill from Greystonlees, we come next to Chester-: 
bank, a smaller property, with a good, but rather ancient farm-house 
and with offices. The view from this spot is very grand, present- 
ing another aspect of the valley beneath, which was formerly de- 
scribed; and in the distance, the Lammermoor hills, with St Abb's 
rearing its venerable head above the ocean. 

Besides the camps already noticed, there appears to have been 
another on the high grounds above Chesterbank; and one is stated 
in the former Statistical Account to have stood on the north side 
of the parish. Spear heads are said to have been dug up at Red- 
hall and other parts of the parish ; and not many years ago there 
was turned up during the operation of trench-ploughing, on the 
farm of Prenderguest, a small millstone, supposed to have belong- 
ed to the hand-mills of the Romans. — A curious stone with an in- 
scription was also discovered at Gunsgreen, and a drawing thereof 
was sent to the Edinburgh Antiquarian Society, but no explanation 
has yet been obtained. 

Parochial Registers. — The history of the parochial registers is 
very imperfect. Those of births and baptisms, the only ones for- 
merly kept, go no farther back than 1743, and even after that pe 
riod they seem not to have been regularly kept until about 1770, 
They are by no means voluminous even at this day. No other 
register has been regularly kept. 

HI. — Population. 
In 1741, the population did not exceed 640. This number wa." 
divided equally between the village of Ayton and the landward part 
of the parish. In 1821, it had arisen to 1481 ; and in 1831, when 
the last census was taken, to 1680, viz. 663 in the village, and 
1017 in the rest of the parish. It is believed that the yearly ave- 
rage of births bears the usual proportion to the above numbers : 
but it cannot be easily or precisely ascertained from documents, 

• There was a common sayiiif; al Eyemouth, when any slrangc sail was seen in Uur

as the baptisms are dispensed in three different congregations, and 
no means have been employed to enforce regular parochial registra- 
tions. There are not at present more than five or six families of 
independent fortune residing in the parish. All the proprietors, 
except one, hold lands above the yearly value of L. 50. 

Number of families in the parish, including Ay ton Common, - 352

There are six boats' crews of fishermen in the parish, consisting 
each of six men ; and one boat's crew of the Preventive Service, 
consisting of one officer and six men. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — This parish contains nearly 
6000 English acres of arable land, 800 in plantations, and between 
200 and 300 in pasture. There are no lands waste; all are in the 
highest state of cultivation. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land is somewhat 
under L. 2. Horses and cows may be grazed for L. 5. 

Rate of raes.— Labourers' wages are Is. 6d. per day, artisans' 
2s. and 2s. 6d. Farm-servants called hinds have L.4 per annum, 
with a cow's grass, 10 bolls of oats, 3 bolls of barley, a boll of 
pease or beans, with a proportional quantity of potatoe land, and a 
house and garden,— for which last two articles they supply a reaper 
in harvest to their masters. 

Husbandr/. —Eyery branch of husbandry is here conducted on 
the best principles. The turnip husbandry for many years has 
been a very important branch, and by the introduction of bone-dust, 
now in universal use, is brought to the greatest perfection. The 
general duration of leases is for nineteen or twenty-one years, a pe- 
riod equally agreeable to both landlord and tenant. Farm-buildings 
and enclosures are no where more complete than they are here in 
general. Iron ploughs and harrows have been long in common 
use. Nothing has contributed more to agricultural improvements 
than the complete system of draining which has now prevailed for 
many years. In this respect there is really httle or nothing more 
left to be done. Grass fields are here sometimes irrigated. Of 
agricultural produce, some idea may be formed from the fact, that 
an acre of land in the parish will yield four bolls and a-half of wheat, 

or six bolls of barley. 

Produce.— The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows :

Manufactures. — There are four grain mills in the parish, as for- 
merly noticed, in which wheaten flour, oat-meal, barley and pease 
meal, and pearl barley, are manufactured. Of the latter article 
particularly, a considerable quantity is prepared for the London 
market. There are also in use here on every farm thrashing-mills 
driven by horses, wind, water, or steam. One farmer has a bone- 
mill, where 160 tons of bones, chiefly brought from Hamburgh, 
are ground yearly, and after providing himself with what bone-dust 
he requires, he supplies his neighbours with the surplus, to the 
amount of L. 700 or L. 800 worth per annum. 

Paper- Mill — There is here a paper-mill, lately much improved 
by the introduction of the new machinery, by which the operations 
are wonderfully facilitated, and the number of hands formerly em- 
ployed, greatly reduced. The following statement by the proprietor 
will give an idea of the magnitude and value, &amp;c. of this estabhsh- 
raent. " The sorts of paper chiefly manufactured at Millbank 
paper-mill are pasteboards and coloured papers. Eight years ago 
a machine was erected by which paper is made into webs, and after- 
wards cut into such sizes as are wanted. And recently, a new plan 
has been adopted for drying it, by applying steam to the inside of 
large cylinders, round which the paper passes and comes off" quite 
dry. The bleachfield at Ayton is given up, and is now employed in 
bleaching rags, and reducing them into what is called in the trade 
half stuff, and from thence taken down to the mill at Millbank, to 
be prepared and made into paper. The wages paid to the work 
people amount to nearly L. 800 a-year, and the excise duties to 
upwards of L. 3000 a-year." 

Distiller/. — A distillery was erected ten or twelve years ago at 
Gunsgreen, upon the site and ruins of a former distillery, which 
had been discontinued for many years. It is now in active operation, 
and the following particulars respecting it have been communicated 
by one of the partners : " Gunsgreen distillery is capable of making 
1500 gallons of aqua weekly, which is mostly all sold in London. In 
the spring of 1832, when potatoes were nearly unsaleable, and sel- 
ling so low as Is. 3d. per cwt, the distillers here, having a large 
quantity on hand, were induced to enter their work for distilling

from potatoes, and to attempt the manufacture of aqua from them, 
which they found to answer well. Besides using their own, they 
bought all that were in their neighbourhood, and continued work- 
ing from them for two months, during which time they consumed 
upwards of 6000 cwt. By the present distillery law distillers can work 
from potatoes at pleasure, but they must continue one month, or 
rather they cannot work from any other thing till the expiry of the 
month." 

Tannery. — There was lately attempted in the village of Ayton, 
and with sufficient prospect of success, a small tannery. It be- 
longs to, and is conducted by, a respectable shoemaker, who 
commenced it at first for the supply of his own professional de- 
mands, and now he is able to supply the trade to a considerable 
extent. He manufactures annually about L. 200 worth of as good 
leather as any that is made, and bids fair to form as good an es- 
tablishment as any in the country. 

There has been occasionally a manufacture of kelp on the shore 
at Burnmouth ; but it is not very productive, else it would be more 
regularly prosecuted. 

None of the manufactories of this parish have been complained 
of, as injurious to the health or morals of the people employed-, 
and there is now less cause of such complaints, owing to the num- 
ber of hands being reduced. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Village. — A fair has long been held twice a year in the vil- 
lage of Ayton. But since regular merchants and shopkeepers 
have established themselves in every town and village through- 
out the country, these fairs have often dwindled into mere erec- 
tions of a few hucksters' stalls. Where this is the case, they 
yield little or no advantage to any one, are not frequented for pur- 
poses of traffic, and ought to be discontinued, especially as they 
not unfrequently lead to unnecessary or excessive drinking, and to 
unprofitable and hurtful associations among the youth of both sexes. 
There are no prevailing trades or handicrafts here, except such as 
are necessary in all agricultural districts. Blacksmiths are in greater 
demand than formerly, owing to farming implements being now 
made chiefly of iron. Of late years there has been a greater 
number than usual of wrights and masons, from the following 
cause : Since the great London road which passes through this 
parish was altered, the proprietor of Ayton estate has wisely 
availed himself of the circumstance, to grant feus for building on 
the new line of road. This arrangement has put it in his power to 



AYTONi 



143 



oet rill of the old bouses at the upper eud of the village, which 
trenched close upon the mansion-house. It has also led to the 
formation of an almost entirely new village, distinguished alike by 
the superiority, regularity, and general cleanliness of the new dwell- 
ings. Nor is it unlikely that it will eventually lead to the reduction 
of the number of paupers, many of whom occupied the old hovels 
which have been recently pulled down, and some of whom still linger 
in those which remain. A few handsome villas have lately been, 
and more are likely to be, erected in the extremities of the village. 
These already seem to have the effect of drawing respectable in- 
habitants to the place. As a useful substitute for the fairs, a 
monthly cattk market has very recently been established in Ayton, 
and is likely to succeed remarkably well, — this being a good central 
situation for the purpose. 

Mea7is of Communication. — The means of communication are 
here ample. There is a post-office in Ayton, and a daily post. The 
London road, always in the highest state of repair, passes through 
the village, the centre of the parish ; and another road, not inferior 
in quality, leads from Eyemouth to Ayton, and into the interior of 
the county, — each bisecting the parish nearly at right angles to the 
other. On the former road two London coaches ply daily, viz. the 
Mail and the Union, each with four horses, — and another with two 
horses, also daily, betwixt Edinburgh and Newcastle. There are 
four good stone bridges, one within, and the other three leading 
into the parish. The first is at Ayton over the Eye, upon the 
London road, handsomely ornamented with embrasures. The next 
is near Eyemouth, over the same stream. The other two cross the 
Ale Water, one near the junction of the two streams, leading to 
Eyemouth, and the other on the road leading from Ayton to Cold- 
ingham. A ruinous bridge over the Eye, which formed part of a 
very old road to London, and in the use of which as a kirk road, 
the parishioners every Sabbath day ran the risk of losing their 
lives, fell down a few years ago, fortunately without doing hurt. 

A boat-harbour has been erected lately at Burnmouth, strong 
enough to resist the heavy seas of the German ocean. The ex- 
pense of erection was L. 1600, three-fourths of which were supplied 
by the commissioners for the fisheries, and the other fourth was 
contributed by the fishermen and others. It seems to afford good 
security to the boats; but the fishermen are of opinion, that an 
additional land pier also is necessary to complete the security, by 
contracting the mouth of the harbour, and breaking the swell of 
the sea.

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, although nearly lialf a mile 
from the village, and a quarter from the manse, is quite central for 
the parish, and is scarcely three miles distant from the remotest 
habitation. It stands on a romantic spot on the banks of the Eye, 
nearly opposite to Ayton House, in a situation of sweet seclusion. 
As already noticed, it is supposed to have been founded in the 12th 
century. Besides the present place of worship, consisting in part of 
the ancient walls, there still remain entire those of the south transept, 
all beautifully mantled with ivy, and now consecrated a second time, 
by the place having been converted into the burying-ground of the 
Ayton family, and adorned with appropriate shrubs and flowers by 
the pious care of the surviving relatives. In this portion of the 
ruins there is a stone window, with circular, and not pointed arches, 
which may be a guide to the antiquarian as to the age of the erec- 
tion. There is likewise remaining, the gable of the chancel, the side- 
walls of which have been assisted in their decay, by the sacrilegious 
hands of plunderers, for the sake of the sandstone. In the gable 
of the present church, there is a large circular arch, nearly the whole 
width of the wall, but now built up, which must have formed the 
spacious communication with the chancel, and of course wide enough 
to admit the grand processions to and from the altar in Catholic 
times. The hewn stone of the walls, appears, from its quahty, to 
have been brought from the sandstone quarry by the sea side at 
Greystonlees ; and this perhaps may account for the church being 
built on the south side of the river. Its original dimensions compre- 
hending the external ruins, had afterwards been contracted within 
narrower limits, corresponding with the actual population, — proba- 
bly at the time when it was converted into a Protestant church. Up- 
wards of twenty years ago, it underwent repairs and an enlargement, 
by the addition of a northern aisle and steeple. Its capacity was thus 
better adapted to the increased population, but it would even then, 
and still more now, have been too small, were it not for the accom- 
modation supphed to the redundant population by the two meeting- 
houses in the village. These latter have also aff'orded similar ac- 
commodation to the growing population of the surrounding parishes. 
It would have been ultimately a saving to the . heritors to have 
built a new church at the time of the last enlargement. The pre- 
sent although still in pretty good repair, will not last so long as a 
new one, and when repairs are next called for, it will probably re- 
quire to be rebuilt and further enlarged. In its present state, it 
may contain nearly 500 sitters. None of the seats are free, except 
the communion benches, one or two of which are left for use in the

middle passcOg'e, but seldom required. The pews are the property 
of the heritors for themselves, their tenants, and servants. A few 
seats were given by the heritors to the kirk-session, to be let for 
the benefit of the poor ; but for these little or no rent is received. 
The feuars and others who have no legal accommodation would, 
no doubt, obtain liberty to erect a gallery for themselves in the 
west end of the church, but they have hitherto preferred being in- 
debted to the indulgence of such seat-holders as have spare room, 
or they occupy the seats of such tenants and farm-servants as at- 
tend the meeting-houses. 

The manse was rebuilt nearly forty years ago, and is agree- 
ably situated on the banks of the Eye. It has since at intervals 
undergone a few repairs, by the last of which, further accommo- 
dation has been secured, by dividing the attic story into apart- 
ments, which had been left unfinished at the time of building. 
Good new offices were lately erected of sufficient extent for the 
present incumbent, who has no farming operations. They would 
have been further enlarged if required. The garden and grounds 
were laid out with great taste by the former incumbent, and water 
has been brought into the house by the present. 

The glebe contains 1 acres, and has been let, till lately, at 
a yearly rent of L. 38.— The stipend consists of sixteen chalders, 
half meal and half barley, convertible at the fiars prices of the 
county, which, as a matter of equity, ought to be struck twice in 
the year, instead of once. On an average of the last seven years 
it has amounted to L. 241, 4s. lO-d. There are also L. 10 for 
communion elements, and a small fish tithe ; the latter is ill paid, 
owing to the alleged poverty of the fishermen, who are otherwise' 
an unusually respectable body of men, partly belonging to the Es- 
tablished church and partly Dissenters, and both in their dress and 
domestic equipments, betraying no symptoms of poverty. 

The dissenting chapels were formerly Burgher and Antiburgher, 
but are now in the New Associate communion. Their ministers' 
stipends arise from the seat rents.- Neither of them are said to 
exceed L. 100. The ministers have also a free house and garden. 
The number of families attending the Established church is 180; 
of families in the parish attending the chapels of Dissenters and 
Seceders, 145. The average number of communicants in the Es- 
tablished church is 360. The yearly average of the ordinary 
chuuch collections is upwards of L. 20. The average of occasional 
church collections for religious purposes is between L. 3 and L.4, 
perhaps once or twice in the vcar.

There is a small auxiliary to the county Bible Society in this 
parish, consisting of individuals belonging to the Established church 
and Dissenters. The average of their yearly contributions is about 
L. 6 or L. 7. 

Education.— There is one parish school,— the teacher of which 
has the maximum allowance, and an excellent dwelling-house and 
garden. There are likewise five private schools, depending on 
school fees, and one supported by an allowance from the lady of the 
chief landed proprietor. The branches generally taught are Eng- 
lish, reading, writing, and arithmetic. But some in the parish school 
are taught the higher branches, as Latin, French, geography, &amp;c. 
Every branch in the parish school is well taught, as indicated by 
the recent enlargement of the school-room, and a great accession 
to the number of scholars, rendering it needful to have an assistant. 
There are a few boarders residing in the schoolmaster's house, and a 
likelihood of more, when the superior quahfications of the teacher, 
the fitness of the house, and the healthiness of the situation are bet- 
ter known. The school fees are much on a par with those of other 
parishes, varying according to the nature of the branches taught. 
On an average of the last three years they amount to L. 84 a-year. 
The teacher has also L. 30 a-year as clerk to the heritors and session. 
In the private schools, the fees are generally somewhat lower than 
in the parochial. There are very few in the parish, either old or 
voung, who cannot read and write; and as the children are kept 
pretty regularly at school, and the fees, with few exceptions, readily 
paid, it may be inferred that the people in general are alive to the 
benefits of education. , . 

Literature.— There are two small subscription libraries in Ay- 
ton, which commenced within these ten or twelve years. One 
consists of 500 volumes, which, although suited to general read- 
ers is not very extensively resorted to, but would be more so, it 
it had not excluded religious books. The other consists of more 
than 300 volumes, and is calculated to supply the defect of the 
former, being better adapted to the entertainment and instruction 
of the labouring classes and rising generation. It was toundert 
somewhat later than the former, by a benevolent gentleman m the 
neighbourhood, and assisted by the donations of others : it is 
thus more accessible to the poor, and although intended as an iti- 
nerating library with others founded in neighbouring parishes by 
thetme gentleman, no interchange of books has as yet taken place 

-Sllciet,, c._.There is a .iendly society in Ayton,

supported chiefly by the older people, but not very flourishing, as 
the younger generation are losing the spirit of independence, be- 
coming less saving in their habits, and relying more on parochial 
aid for supplying the wants of old age. — There is also a tempe- 
rance society lately established here, consisting almost exclusively 
of people who were previously sober in their habits. There is no 
evidence as yet of its having had the effect of converting a single 
drunkard. But it must not be denied, that it may have given a 
further improvement to the sober habits of the former class ; and 
possibly, it may have prevented some of them from acquiring con- 
trary habits. — A savings' bank was established some years ago in 
Eyemouth, of which it was expected that many in the neighbour- 
ing parishes would have availed themselves ; but the same cause 
has prevented the success of this estabhshment, which has already 
been assigned for the falling off" of the friendly society. — There is 
no Dispensary here, but the poor receive medical advice at home, 
at the expense of the parish. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons receiving 
parochial aid is between 50 and 60. The average weekly al- 
lowance to each is 2s. 6d. The parish, including heritors and their 
tenants, is regularly assessed for the support of the poor. The 
average amount of yearly assessments is L. 400. The heritors have 
long allowed the whole of the church collections, together with the 
money arising from the use of the mortcloth, and from proclama- 
tions of marriage, to be laid out by the kirk-session in giving tem- 
porary aid to poor not upon the roll, and in paying a small fee to 
the clerks and officers of synod, presbytery, and kirk-session. If 
any money remains at the end of the year, it is laid out in 
coals to the poor, generally after new year; and sometimes, 
when there is a deficit for this latter purpose, an extraordinary col- 
lection is appointed in the church to make it up. The farmers 
and others are occasionally so kind as to drive the coals. There 
is no mortified or endowed money in this parish for the benefit of 
the poor; but occasionally small donations have been given or be- 
queathed for distribution. 

This parish labours under a singular disadvantage, owing to the 
village of Ayton being the first town in Scotland on the great Lon- 
don road. Crowds of poor families and individuals, originally belong- 
mg to Scotland, having acquired no parish settlementin England,are 
daily sent down through the English parishes, in cart loads, many 
of them unable to walk, and thrown into Ayton, as though it were 
the limit of their destination. When they happen to have regular 



148 BEllWICKSHlllE. 

passes to any of the eastern counties of Scotland, they are moved 
forward at the expense of this county. But when, as often hap- 
pens, either from carelessness, or the intentional mistake of people 
interested in transporting them, they are sent down by the east 
instead of the west road, this county refuses to be at any expense 
in their further conveyance. So, from pure humanity and du-e ne- 
cessity, the parish of Ayton must remove the most helpless of them, 
else they might lie and die in our streets. Besides these, there is 
now a vast number of travelling poor, a great proportion of whom 
are Irish, passing north and south daily and hourly on this road, 
who beset the manse and schoolmaster's house sometimes m for- 
midable bands, conceiving they have a legal claim for aid by 
the way Many of these are evidently labouring under disease, 
sickness, and want,-requiring both rehef and medical assist- 
ance. Such persons occasionally die here, ana are buried at 
the expense of the parish, and sometimes leave to it as a legacy a 
destitute orphan, whose proper parish cannot be found. There 
ought to be a joint fund among all the parishes of each county, more 
especially of this border county, where the evil is greatest, to detray 
such expenses, and not to suffer the burden to lie upon those pa- 
rishes whose particular locality exposes them to such a hardship 
This multitude of travelling poor indicates the depressed state ot 
the country at large, and it need scarcely be asked, " whether there 
is any disposition among the poor to refrain from seeking parochial 
rehef, and whether they consider it degrading." In this neigh- 
bourhood, as well as in most other parts of the low country at least, 
the pride of independence has become almost extinct. 

Lock-up-house, Sfc.-Some years ago a lock-up-house was built 
in the village, which is occasionally occupied for a night by unruly 
vagrants and others. They are generally dismissed m the morn- 
ing. But there would be fewer calls for this accommodation if 
thie were fewer accommodations of a different description for the 
thoughtless and intemperate. In this parish there are no less 
than nine public houses, whereas at most, one or two respectable 
inns would be quite sufficient for all the purposes of travelhng or 
business The combined effects of so many facilities for drinking 
are anything but favourable to the morals of the people. 

Fuel-Coah are supphed to this parish in abundance both by 
sea and land. Forth and Newcastle coals come in at Eyemouth, 
Td are 1 out of the ship at 10s. and 12s. per ton, and may be 
Ited to Ayten for a couple of shillings more They may a so be

same price. There was a prospect renewed lately of coals being 
wrought along the coast, about a few miles to the south-east of this, 
but the stratum not being found of sufficient thickness to encourage 
the erection of machinery, the project has again, for the present, 
been abandoned. About eight miles northward peats may be pro- 
cured, but they are here in very little demand. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The great depression in the price of agricultural produce has, 
of late years, materially retarded improvements, which the landlord 
and tenants have shewn a laudable ambition to promote, if the 
times afforded encouragement. Some years ago the chief proprietor 
invited a few individuals, with their families, to settle on a moorish land 
belonging to him, about eight miles to the north, called Ayton com- 
mon, said to be a part of this parish, although surrounded by that of 
Coldingham. With a view to improve the land, he gave them a grant 
of it for a very small acknowledgment. But it does not appear as yet 
to have been turned to any very good account. The principal im- 
provements in the parish consist in the alteration of the London road, 
to avoid the long ascents at Ayton-hill on the south, and at Pease 
Bridge on the north ; and the consequent new-modelling of the 
village of Ayton ; — the alteration of the road leading from Eye- 
mouth to the interior of the country by the south of Ayton, to 
avoid the steep ascent at Millerton-hill, — and the alteration of 
another road in the parish leading from Berwick to Eyemouth, by 
which the great descent at Blaikies has been avoided. It was at 
one time in agitation to extend this latter road along the coast, as 
forming a better line for the London road, and less liable to ob- 
structions from snow, than one more inland. — A moral improve- 
ment has been wrought by the complete suppression of foreign 
smuggling, through the estabhshment of the Preventive Service along 
the coast. There is, however, a system of smuggling more de- 
moralizing, if not also more hurtful to the revenue, still carried on, 
all along the English border, in which Ayton has borne a share, — 
namely, the illicit traffic in Scotch whisky. This traffic, on ac- 
count of the high duty paid for Scotch whisky in England, holds 
out a strong temptation to carry it over the borders at all points, 
and by all sorts of artful conveyances, — a practice which has not 
hitherto been prevented by all the vigilance of the excise. — Per- 
haps the only and the most equitable way to put. an effectual stop 
to it, is to equalize the duties on both sides of the Tweed,

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN EDGAR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, -c— The parish of Fishwick was united to 
Hutton in 1614; and these two now form one parish. In this 
district, the parishes must have been originally very small, as 
most of the present ones formed two, and still are by no means 
large either in extent or population. Fishwick is situated on the 
north bank of the Tweed, and the ruins of the church and church- 
yard yet remain. The site is very picturesque and solitary, Fish- 
wick probably derives its name from having been fishing village. 
From its proximity to the Tweed, it is not improbable that its in- 
habitants in olden times were chiefly fishermen. Hutton, which 
hes to the north of Fishwick, and is bounded on the north by the 
river Whitadder, it has been conjectured, owes its name to its low 
situation— being originally How town, which in process of time be- 
came Hutton. It is now the name used to designate the united pa- 
rishes. Contiguous to this parish, on the north side of the Whitad- 
der, are the parishes of Chirnside, Foulden, and Mordington on the 
N W N andN.E.— Edrom bounds it on the W.—Whitsome and 
Ldykirk on the S. W.-the Tweed on the S. : and the parisli 
of Berwick on the E. In extent it is about four miles long, and 
upwards of three broad ; and its figure is a sort of irregular triangle. 

Topographical Appearances.— general aspect of the parish 
is flat, presenting no elevated grounds deserving notice. On 
the banks of the Tweed and Whitadder, however, the ground is 
diversified by gentle elevations, which contrast well with the tame 
scenery of the other parts of the parish. The medium height above 
the level of the sea does not exceed 150 feet. The banks of the 
Whitadder are rather deficient in sylvan scenery. Were they 
planted, the proprietors would soon be remunerated, and the sce- 
nery, which possesses great capabilities for picturesque effect, would

extremely fertile, and well adapted for producing luxuriant crops 
of all kinds of grain, clover, turnips, and potatoes. It is a rich 
deep loam, generally resting upon freestone. Some of it is fine 
sharp land, excellently calculated for raising turnips ; but it is in 
general better fitted for wheat. In the middle of the parish the 
soil is by no means so good, but is thin, wet, and moorish, and has 
for its substratum a strong tenacious clay. A tract of land of this 
description, in breadth about a mile, commences here, and runs 
from east to west to the upper part of the county, while on each 
side of this stripe the soil is valuable and productive. The inhabit- 
ants are not hable to any particular diseases, arising from peculi- 
arity of climate ; and the parish upon the whole may be pronoun- 
ced healthy. Fevers seldom make their appearance here. The 
ague, which used to be here a periodical scourge, has entirely disap- 
peared, and instances of considerable longevity are by no means 
uncommon. 

Sandstone is found after digging to any considerable depth in 
almost every part of the parish. On the banks of the Whitadder, 
upon the estate of Hutton Hall, there is a stratum of gypsum. 
Some casts were made of it by Mr O'Neil, of Edinburgh, who found 
it to be of excellent quality, and well adapted to the purposes to 
which this mineral is generally applied. But whether there is suf- 
ficient quantity to repay the expense of working it, or whether it is 
practicable to do so from the steepness of the banks where it is 
found, is doubtful. 

II. — Civil History. 
The only circumstance worthy of notice, under this head, is, 
that it appears probable that the army of Edward I. encamped here 
on the 29th of March 1296, being the day preceding that on 
which he took the town of Berwick. From a diary of his pro- 
gress through Scotland, it appears that Hatton or Hauden was 
the place  where he and his army lay the day after he left Cold- 
stream. And as Hutton lies almost in the direct line of his march 
to Berwick from Coldstream, where he crossed the Tweed on 
the 28th of March, it seems almost certain that it was visited en 
passant by this arch foe of Scotland. 

Eminent Men. — It deserves also to be recorded that Andrew 
Foreman, Bishop of Moray, Archbishop of Bourges in France, 
and afterwards Archbishop of St Andrew's, who flourished about 
the beginning of the sixteenth century, was a native of this pa-

rish. He is said to have been of the family of the Foremans 
of Hutton in the Merse. The uncommon pohtical talents, and 
the acute understanding which distinguished this prelate, gained 
for him most powerful patronage. He was a favourite of two suc- 
cessive Scottish monarchs, James HI. and IV., two successive 
popes, Juhus n. and Leo X., and of Louis XH. of France. By 
those high personages he was loaded with honours and bene- 
fices. Though opposed by powerful competitors, he was elevated 
to the first See in Scotland. He was likewise employed as an am- 
bassador from the court of Scotland to that of France. Histo- 
rians have given opposite portraits of his character, of the real 
features of which it is difficult to form an opinion. Of the family 
of this distinguished individual, the only trace that is left is a small 
field, which, as if in mockery of mortal ambition, still retains the 
name of " Foreman's Land.'" 

The late Mr Phihp Redpath, minister of this parish, was edi- 
tor of the Border History, which was chiefly written by his bro- 
ther Mr George Redpath, minister of Stitchell. The work is 
creditable to his talents and industry, and is generally considered 
as extremely accurate with regard to facts, and valuable as a book 
of reference. Mr Philip Redpath was also the author of an 
English translation of Boethius' Consolations of Philosophy, which 
met with a favourable reception from the public. 

The late George Home, Esq. of Wedderburn, resided for 
many years in this parish at his seat of Paxton. He was a gentle- 
man of extensive information, refined taste, and considerable lite- 
rary attainments,— having been a member of that distinguished 
club of literati who adorned Edinburgh at the period when the 
• Mirror and Lounger were given to the public. Several of his pa- 
pers in these periodical works remain as monuments of his taste 
and talents. He was an intimate friend of the late Mr Henry 
Mackenzie, author of the Man of Feehng, of the late Lord Craig, 
and of other learned and talented individuals of the same school. 
These eminent characters frequently visited him during the sum- 
mer recess at his elegant retreat on the banks of the Tweed. Mr 
Home was also distinguished by his practical knowledge of busi- 
ness, and took a leading part in the management of the public af- 
fairs of the county, f

Land-owners. — The chief land -owners of this parish are, John 
Joseph Macbraire, Esq. of Broadmeadows and Fishwick ; Wilham 
Foreman Home, Esq. of Billie and Paxton ; John Maclean Mac- 
kenzie Grieve, Esq. of Hutton Hall ; the Rev. William Stow Lun- 
die of Spittal and Clarabad ; Captain Jeffreys of Sunwick ; Hugh 
Scott, Esq. of Harden ; and Henry Trotter, Esq. of Morton- 
Hall. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the parochial re- 
cords is 1649. They consist of five volumes, and with a chasm 
of twenty-eight years, viz. from 1672 to 1700, they have been re- 
gularly kept. 

Antiquities. — There are no antiquities in the parish deserving of 
much notice. From the ruins of the church of Fishwick which 
still remain, it appears to have been a very plain building, long 
and narrow, and of small dimensions. The mansion-house of 
Hutton Hall is rather a curious specimen of an ancient border 
keep, and almost the only one which is still inhabited in this dis- 
trict. It seems evidently to have been constructed as a place of 
strength, and for purposes of defence; and to have been built 
at several different periods. The date of its erection, how- 
ever, cannot be ascertained. The original building appears to 
have been a square tower, to which at different times a long nar- 
row dwelling-house has been added. It is situated on the brink 
of an eminence not far distant from the Whitadder, and overlook- 
ing that stream. The site is striking and uncommon, and the 
tout ensemble of the building, as well as its internal arrangements, 
forcibly recall to the mind the days when it was necessary, in the 
construction of houses, especially on the borders, to consult strength 
and security, rather than the graces of ornament, or the decora- 
tions of art. 

Modern Buildings. — There are several large and excellent man- 
sion-houses in the parish. Of these Paxton and Broadmeadows 
are the most remarkable. The former was built upwards of sixty 
years ago, after a design of the celebrated Adams. The material 
employed is dark freestone ; and the front is remarkably handsome 
and massive, though perhaps rather heavy. It is a very substantial 
building, and contains several spacious and elegant apartments. 
In one of them, which is uncommonly large, and which was added 

cacy was frequently hurt by the intrusion of curious individuals; and witli an ex- 
treme but cxcusalle sensitiveness, he shrunk from the idea of being considered as 
a spectacle. Notwithstanding the apparent vigour of his frame, Providence had 
not blessed him with a robust constitution. He died at an early jioriod of life, and 
liis remains were interred in the ciuirch-yard here.

some years ago to the original building, there is a very numerous 
and valuable collection of paintings, which are much admired, and 
have a very imposing effect. The Tweed flows close past the 
house on the south-east. Broadmeadows House is a more modern 
building, in the Grecian style of architecture. The stone employ- 
ed in its construction is a very fine white freestone. The apart- 
ments are elegant, and the accommodation extensive. Spittal 
House and Tweed-hill are neat country residences. The latter is 
situated on the Tweed, at a short distance from the Union Chain 
Bridge, and the whole scenery connected with this villa, as well as 
with Paxton, which is immediately contiguous, presents features of 
considerable beauty. The trees at both these places seem to 
thrive admirably. 

in. — Population. 
There are no records by which we can trace the ancient state of 
the population. That it was numerically less than at present is 
certain. It appears to have been gradually rising, until within the 
last ten or twelve years, when a slight decrease took place.

Language, Habits, Sfc. of the People.— The language generally 
spoken is the Berwickshire dialect of the Scots, intermixed occa- 
sionally with the Northumbrian burr. The most remarkable pe- 
culiarities which distinguish this dialect are observable in the fol- 
lowing words : fire, pronounced/eyre ; water, wagtcr ; chair, shire ; 
two, tioae ; church, surch ; cheese, sheese, &amp;c. There is no rea- 
son to suppose that any very material alteration in this respect has 
occurred within the last forty years. 



HUTTON.

The cottage of a Berwickshire ploughman or labourer may vie 
in cleanliness with that of any of the same class either in England 
or Scotland. Seldom is there any of that squalor to be observed, 
which is so offensive in other districts of Scotland. The same 
regard to cleanliness and comfort is displayed in the article of 
dress. Where these habits prevail, it will be generally found, 
that they are the accompaniments of sobriety, industry, morality, 
and religion, and that opposite habits are commonly associated 
with irreligion and profligacy. 

That the people enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts and 
advantages of society cannot be doubted. They themselves feel 
that they do so, and are thankful for these advantages. Employ- 
ed entirely in agricultural labours, they are not overworked, but 
have sufficient leisure to attend to their families, and to cultivate the 
moral, religious, and domestic affections. Not being huddled to- 
gether in dense masses, they are not exposed to those temptations 
with which the manufacturing population of large and crowded 
towns is beset, but maintain that independence of mind, simplicity 
of character, sobriety of thought, and decency of conduct, which 
are generally associated with rural life. Many of them bring up 
large families upon slender means, and it rarely happens that the 
education of their children is neglected. Few of them intermeddle 
with the irritating subject of politics, or with the controversial dis- 
putations of theology. Knowing that their superiors are interested 
in their welfare, they pay them that respect to which they are en- 
titled. The higher classes, in their turn, are charitable and atten- 
tive to the poor; and thus a bond of union is formed betwixt them, 
which is productive of the best effects. 

The peasantry are intelligent and acute, and few of them are 
without a small collection of books, and of these, the majority gene- 
rally consists of those old manuals of divinity, which have by pre- 
scriptive right long been the favourites of the Scottish peasantry. 
The frequent perusal of these books, though homely in their garb, 
and perhaps not very polished in style, has a tendency to keep 
alive their reasoning faculties, as well as to foster and confirm their 
religious principles. With them also a taste for reading is gain- 
ing ground; and, with their moral habits, and sound modes of 
thinking, it is to be hoped that the influence produced may prove 
salutary. 

In all the practical processes of agricultural and rural economy, 
they are in general well informed, and in the management of the 
plough, or the use of the spade, a Berwickshire hind or labourer 



156 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



is not to be excelled. Spade work is done with neatness, exact- 
ness, and celerity. 

Crimes are seldom heard of amongst them, and there is not an 
instance, within the memory of any now living, of an inhabitant of 
this parish having been tried before our supreme criminal courts. 

Convictions for poaching game and salmon indeed sometimes 
occur, but these are by no means frequent. As inhabiting a bor- 
der parish, the lower classes are also exposed to the tem.ptation of 
evading the excise laws, by smuggling whisky into England. This 
is a crying evil, and loudly demands the interference of the legis- 
lature. 

The great majority are attached to the Established church, and 
regular in their attendance on the means of grace, and the ordi- 
nances of religion. The Sabbath is observed with reverence, and 
the cases are rare of any desecration of that sacred day by idleness 
or dissipation. They are generally well acquainted with their Bibles, 
and habitually accustomed to peruse them. Deriving their religious 
knowledge from this pure and holy source, they are for the most part 
well informed concerning the doctrines and duties of Christianity : 
and in all the leading doctrines of our church, with regard to the 
fall of man, the consequent corruption and depravity of our nature, 
the inability of man to save himself, the method of restoration by 
the death of Christ, the divinity of our Saviour, the sanctification 
and divine work of the Spirit, justification by faith, and the great 
object and design of the Gospel to promote purity of heart, and 
holiness of life,— their notions are sound and correct. Their reli- 
gious faith is practical and salutary in its effects, and demonstrates 
its excellence by its influence on their hves. Many of them stdl 
attend to the ancient and wholesome, but too much neglected duty 
of family worship, and devote the Sabbath evenings to the instruction 
of their children in the elements of Christian truth and moral duty. 
Their religion affords them support and consolation amidst the 
hardships of a laborious condition, and under the trying vicissitudes 
and afflictions of life. They feel that it is their best friend, and 
the only source of true happiness. A familiar intercourse with the 
people of this parish, for nearly fourteen years, in his ministerial 
capacity, entitles the writer to speak thus of their character. Nor 
is he partial to those of his own religious persuasion ; for what he 
has said applies not more to them than to the Dissenters of the 
parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Jlnral Economi/.-WMh the exception of about 



HUTTON. 157 

thirty or forty tradesmen, twenty fishermen, and a few persons em- 
ployed in a brick manufactory, the whole parochial population is 
agricultural. In the prosperity of agriculture, therefore, the people 
of this parish have a direct interest. 

The whole number of acres cultivated, or occasionally in tillage, 
is 4950 : and the banks of the Whitadder and Tweed, which are 
too steep for the plough, and which embrace about 61 acres, are 
the only parts of the parish which have never been under culture. 
Some of these, however, produce excellent natural pasture. About 
250 acres are under wood, which thrives remarkably well, and has 
a healthy appearance. 

The trees planted are generally oak, ash, elm, plane, beech, and 
the various sorts of fir. To this branch of rural economy consider- 
able attention is paid by the proprietors. The trees planted are suit- 
able to the soil, and for the most part are thinned and pruned at pro- 
per seasons. Sales of wood frequently take place, and it is readily 
purchased at fair prices, and found useful for country purposes. 
There is a considerable quantity of wood upon the estates of Broad- 
meadows, Paxton, and Fishwick, and it is rapidly improving. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of land varies from 10s. to L. 4 per 
English acre, and the average rent of the land of the whole parish 
is L. 1, 15s. per acre. For grazing an ox or cow the average rent 
is L. 4. 

Rate of Wages. — Labourers employed in agricultural operations, 
such as ditching, cutting drains, and filling them up, receive for 
wages, at the rate of 9s. per week, winter and summer : masons 
and carpenters, from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per day : mep employed as 
shearers during harvest have, for some years past, received 2s. 6d. 
per day, and women 2s. 2d., with their victuals. A hind, or mar- 
ried farm-servant's gains, as they are called, are, a cow's keep, 
10 bolls of oats or meal, 3 bolls of barley, 1 boll of pease or 
beans, and about a quarter of an acre of potatoes, — besides what is 
called sheep-money, amounting to L.3 or L.4. His coals are also 
driven by his master. A cottage is provided for him, in return for 
which he must find a person to shear during harvest, and to carry 
stacks, &amp;c. He must also keep a hondager to work at field work for his 
master throughout the year, at the rate of 1 Od. per day. The system 
of employing hindsas agricultural labourers is excellent, andgeneral- 
ly adopted in this parish, and indeed in the county at large. To the 
practice of the north of Scotland, where farm labour is chiefly exe- 
cuted by unmarried men, who herd- together in a bothy, it is cer- 
tainly far superior. The hind has a house and small garden of his

own, and is never separated from his family. His gains raise him 
above penury, and with good management, and an industrious and 
frugal wife, he can never be in want of the necessaries of life. 
Being paid chiefly in grain, he has an interest in the produce of 
the farm, which stimulates his industry ; and while he is attending 
to his master's interests, he is also promoting his own. He is gene- 
rally treated with kindness, as a proof of which many continue for 
a number of years in the service of the same master. 

Husbandry. — Of late years there has been a failure of clover 
even on lands of good quality, which have been long under a sys- 
tem of judicious management, and to which every justice has been 
done. For this failure various causes have been assigned. Most 
persons are of opinion that it proceeds from the too great severity 
of the four-shift husbandry, and from the land under it not being 
allowed to remain long enough in grass. The depressed state of 
agriculture has caused a considerable decrease in the use of lime. 
One gentleman, who has one of his farms in his own possession, 
has given it a complete liming within these two years, and the ad- 
ditional quantity of corn in the stack-yard is the best proof of the 
effect produced. Draining is practised with great success, and to 
a considerable extent. In one field of 15 acres, upon a farm cul- 
tivated by a landed proprietor during last summer, 393 roods of 
drains were cut, and 1082 cart loads of stones used for filling them 
up, at an expense amounting to L. 78, 14s. By a judicious system 
of draining, a striking improvement has been effected both by pro- 
prietors and tenants of late years. 

The condition of farm-buildings is good on most of the proper- 
ties. The dwelling-houses of the tenants are substantial and com- 
fortable, suitable to the size of the farm, and with convenient ac- 
commodation for a family. The offices are well laid out for the 
various purposes of rural economy. Slates are generally used for 
the roofs of modern farm-houses and offices. There are fourteen 
thrashing-machines in the parish, of which one has a steam power, 
one is driven by wind, two by water, and the rest by horses. 

The whole land is enclosed chiefly by thorn-hedges, and much 
care is employed to keep the fences in proper order. Persons are 
still alive who remember the time when a considerable portion of 
the parish was unenclosed, and when the grain was carried to Ber- 
wick on horses, the state of the roads not admitting the use of 

Improvements.—The principal improvements which have taken 
place within the last thirty years, in as far as agriculture is con-

cerned, maybe thus enumerated, — better parish and turnpike roads, 

superior accommodation in farm-buildings, — more attention given 

to the culture and cleaning of the land, — agriculture more syste- 
matically pursued, — a more extensive and more skilful style of 
draining, — a more useful kind of farm-horses, — greater facihties 
afforded for thrashing and marketing grain,— a wider breadth of 
turnips sown, and heavier crops raised, and, as a consequence of 
this, a greater quantity of stock fed, and fitted in a shorter time 
for the butcher. 

It is much to be regretted, however, that this interest is at pre- 
sent, and has been for some years, in such a depressed state, from 
the low price of agricultural produce, especially grain. No man 
who has at heart the welfare of his country, and who is acquainted 
with the character of our farmers for skill, industry, and enterprise, 
but must lament that a state of things should have occurred to de- 
teriorate the condition of such a respectable and useful class of the 
community. They have undoubtedly fallen upon evil days, and 
their prospects are far from encouraging. They are not much in 
the habit of complaining, and -for this they deserve credit; yet to 
any person who compares the low price of grain for some years with 
the rents they are under engagement to pay, and the other expen- 
ses necessarily attendant upon agriculture, it must be evident that 
their condition is the very reverse of prosperous. 

Quarries. — There are several freestone quarries of beautiful co- 
lour and fine quality in this parish; but none of them are at present 
worked for sale. 

Fishings. — Upon that part of the Tweed which forms the boun - 
dary of the parish, there are four or five fishing stations, where up- 
wards of twenty men are employed. They are a robust, healthy, 
and industrious class. When employed in their vocation, they are 
much in the open air ; and the nature of their employment requir- 
ing considerable activity, without being oppressively fatiguing, has 
a tendency to brace and invigorate the bodily frame. Trout, sal- 
mon, and grilses are caught sometimes in great abundance. The 
method of fishing is with boats and nets. Men are stationed at par- 
ticular places of the river, where the water is shallow, to watch the 
fish coming up; and so habituated are they to this, that they can dis- 
cover, by a ripple on the surface of the water, even a solitary fish 
making his progress upwards. When a fish is thus discovered, an 
alarm is instantly given to the men at the shiel or house where the 
fishermen lodge, and immediately a boat is rowed off" by one man 
with great celerity, having a net attached to it, and ready prepared 



160 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



lor dropping gradually into the water, — one end of which is tied to 
the boat, and the other is dragged with a rope by the men on shore : 
and by taking a considerable sweep, an endeavour is made to sur- 
round the fish. When thus discovered coming up, they seldom es- 
cape. The fish caught on the Tweed are sent from Berwick by sea to 
the London market, packed in boxes with ice. The fisheries are 
chiefly rented by salmon coopers in Berwick, who carry on this 
trade. For some years past, there have been general complaints 
of the want of fish. No adequate cause has been assigned for this, 
but the fact is well known, and has been severely felt. Much pe- 
cuniary loss has been sustained by the proprietors and tacksmen, 
and the value of this kind of property has been deteriorated to a 
great extent. Some waters do not let now at above a third of their 
former value. A new act of Parliament has lately been obtained 
for regulating the fisheries of the Tweed. It is hoped that the 
provisions of this statute may contribute to prevent the fish from 
being destroyed in an illegal manner, and at improper seasons. 
The yearly close time now commences on the 15th of October, 
and terminates on the 15th of February. The weekly close time 
begins on Saturday evening at six o'clock, and ends on Monday 
morning at the same hour. These are considered as improvements 
upon the old act, and it is expected that this useful branch of in- 
dustry, which gives employment to so many persons, and provides 
a supply of such wholesome and excellent food, may yet recover 
from its present state of depression, and afford ample remuneration 
to all concerned in it. The proprietors of fishing waters in this 
parish are Mr Wilson of Whitsome-hill, and Mr Home of Pax- 
ton. Their value cannot be ascertained, as the waters which be- 
long to Mr Wilson are not let, but are in his own possession. The 
rent of Mr Home's water has been very much reduced. 

Manufactories.— There is a manufactory on the estate of Pax- 
'~ ton of bricks and tiles, which meet with a ready sale in the adjacent 
district. Tiles for drains are also made, and much used. Business 
to a considerable extent is transacted by three corn-mills in the 
parish. Large quantities of corn are purchased from the farmers 
in the neighbourhood, which is manufactured into flour, meal, and 
pot-barley, and exported from Berwick to London. Flour is also 
sent to Berwick for home consumption. 

Agricultural Association.— kn association was lately formed by 
the proprietors and tenants in the parish for the purpose of en- 
couraging and rewarding skill in the management of the plough. 
A competition took place, and prizes were awarded to the most ex-

pert performers, after an examination of the work done. It is 
thought that an institution of this nature will stimulate young men 
to attain proficiency in an art so essential to an agricultural district. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows :

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages. — Berwick-upon-Tweed is the nearest market-town, and 
is distant about six miles from the village of Hutton. From it the 
inhabitants of the parish are chiefly supplied with butcher meat, 
groceries, wearing apparel, &amp;c. Berwick can boast of very excel- 
lent markets. Hutton and Paxton are the only two villages, — at 
each of which there is a post-office, where letters are received, and 
despatched daily by means of a runner to and from Berwick. 

Means of Communication. — Ample means of communication are 
enjoyed by the inhabitants with the surrounding country. A bridge 
across the Whitadder connecting this parish with that of Foulden 
or Chirnside, would be one of the most useful local improvements 
that could be executed. The roads in every direction are excel- 
lent, and much care is used to keep them in repair. Two turn- 
pike roads pass through the parish, one leading from Dunse to 
Berwick, and the other from Berwick to Kelso by Swinton. 
On both of these roads there is a considerable passage by carts. 
There are ten miles of parish roads, and the same number of turn- 
pike. Formerly great inconvenience was experienced from the want 
of a bridge across the Tweed. Many serious accidents, and frequent 
instances of loss of human life, occurred. In the year 1820, however, 
a remedy was applied to this evil by the erection of an iron suspen- 
sion-bridge, under the superintendence of Captain Samuel Brown of 
the Royal Navy. The bridge is distant about two miles and a- 
half from Hutton, and is about six miles up the Tweed from Ber- 
wick. The structure is an admirable specimen of this kind of 
bridge, and completely answers the purpose for which it was intend- 
ed. It is made of malleable iron. Its Icngtli is 361 feet, and its 
weight 100 tons. A very substantial and elegant arch of freestone

masonry stands on the Scots side, through which carriages enter up- 
on the platform of the bridge, which is made of wood plated with 
iron, and which is connected with the principal chains by upright iron 
rods. It is to be regretted that the nature of the ground on the Eng- 
lish side did not admit of a similar arch being there erected, which 
would have communicated to the whole structure greater symme- 
try and beauty. The structure, however, is extremely light and 
elegant, and highly creditable to the ingenuity and taste of Cap- 
tain Brown. The whole expense was from L. 7000 to L. 8000. 
As all the coals and lime used in this and the adjoining pa- 
rishes are brought from the south of the Tweed, the passage of 
carts by the bridge is considerable. In the summer season it is 
much visited by strangers and generally admired. The most 
commanding view of it is obtained from the English side, about 
halfway up the hill on the road which leads from the bridge to 
the village of Hornchffe. There, on a summer evening, the still 
and pellucid waters of the silver Tweed, which assume here the 
quietude and smoothness of a lake; the light and fragile form of 
the bridge floating in the air, with its shadow reflected from the 
stream beneath; the tasteful clumps of planting which adorn the 
banks; the trees and woods of Paxton and Tweedhill, in all the 
pride of vegetative luxuriance; and the fishermen in their boats 
plying at their vocation on the unruffled waters,— present a scene 
highly beautiful and imposing. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The church is situated on the north side 
of the village of Hutton, and about a quarter of a mile south of the 
Whitadder, which forms the northern boundary of the parish. 
It has been placed rather too near the extremity of the parish. 
The church was built in 1765. Originally it must have been 
a mean structure, and, from the effects of time, it is now al- 
most in a state of ruin. It is so damp that persons of delicate 
health are prevented from attending it. It aflfords accommoda- 
tion for 400 sitters. As there is now, however, the prospect of a 
new church being built, larger accommodation will be provided, 
and there is little doubt that the heritors will erect a structure ot 
iome taste and beauty,-qualities much wanted in the parish 
churches of this county,-most of them, with the exception of 
Ladykirk, being very poor and shabby erections. 

The manse was built about forty years ago; and in 1822 con- 
siderable repairs and an addition were made to it.-There are two 
tZlr.. in Hutton, the other in Fishwick parish. They amount 
f abolt thirteen acres, and are worth about L.30 per annum. 



HUTTON.

The amount of the stipend is sixteen chalders; the one-half meal 
the other harley, with L. 10 for communion elements. The sti- 
pend this year, from the low price of grain, amounted to little more 
than L. 200. 

There are no dissenting or seceding chapels in the parish. The 
individuals belonging to the various sects of dissenters, viz. Burghers, 
Cameronians, Relief church, &amp;c. do not exceed one hundred. Three 
families are attached to the Episcopalian, and one to the Roman 
Catholic persuasion. Divine worship is generally well attended 
If there was a comfortable church and larger accommodation, the 
numbers attending public worship would be increased, as many fa- 
milies have at present no seats. The number of communicants 
for the last seven years has varied from 400 to 450. The church 
collections for the benefit of the poor amount annually to about 
L. 20, independently of collections on extraordinary occasions, or 
for objects unconnected with the parish. 

Education. — There is one parochial school : and three others, 
the teachers of which are paid by the school fees. One of them 
is in the village of Paxton, where a house for the teacher and a 
school-room were built at the expense of the late Mr Home, and 
by him left for the benefit of the village. The branches of edu- 
cation taught in the parochial school, and in that of Paxton, are, 
reading English, English grammar, Latin, arithmetic, geometry, 
writing, &amp;c. In all the schools the scriptures are read daily ; and 
the Shorter Catechism taught. The salary of the parish teacher is 
the maximum — the situation altogether may be worth from L. 70 
to L. 80 per annum. Latin seems almost banished from our pa- 
rish schools in this county. The fees paid per quarter are, Latin, 
7s. 6d., English grammar, 5s., arithmetic, 3s. 6d., writing, 3s. read- 
ing, 2s. 6d. 

There are few children above eight who cannot read, and, with 
two or three exceptions, all the adults in the parish are able to do 
so. Most of them also can write, except a few of the more aged fe- 
males, in whose younger days this accomplishment was not so com- 
mon as it is at present. The benefits of education the people ful- 
ly appreciate, and are anxious to educate their children in a man- 
ner suitable to their circumstances. Times must go very hard with 
them when they neglect this duty. Children of paupers, and those 
of very circumscribed means, are educated gratuitously by the pa- 
rish. Ample means of education are provided, and none of the 
children are at an inconvenient distance from school. 

There are two Sabbath schools, attended by young persons of

both sexes, in which they are taught the elements of religious 
knowledge. The children of one of these schools come regularly 
to church, and seats are provided for them. They are thus pre- 
vented from spending the Lord's day in idleness ; and are accus- 
tomed to the solemnities of public worship. 

, Libraries. — There are two small libraries in the parish, the one 
consisting of miscellaneous books, and the other of books of a re- 
ligiouscharacter. 

Friendly Society. — A friendly society was instituted in the pa- 
rish in 1812, the object of which is to afford pecuniary aid to sick 
and aged members. The annual payment of each member is 7s. 6d. 
Funeral expenses are also allowed to members and their widows. 
There are seventy-four persons who now contribute to it, and its 
funds, which are laid out at interest, amount to L. 400. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of persons at present 
receiving parochial aid is 34,— who receive at an average 2s. per 
week. There are at present several heavy cases on the parish roll, 
of persons having numerous families, and, of course, receiving more 
than the ordinary allowance,— thus increasing the average sum. 
Nineteen on the roll receive from Is. to Is. 6d. per week; but there 
•are other families, such as those just mentioned, who receive as 
high as 4s. 5s. and 6s. per week. The sum required for the main- 
tenance of the poor is raised by assessment on the landlords and 
tenants, according to the valued rent, with the addition of the 
church collections. For this purpose, meetings of the heritors 
and kirk-session are held twice a-year. This parish is not ex- 
empted from the peculiar disadvantages with respect to the poor, 
to which border parishes are exposed. From the difficulty of ac- 
quiring a legal settlement in England, many poor persons, after 
having spent the greater part of their lives on the other side of 
the Tweed, return, after an absence of twenty, thirty, or forty years, 
and claim relief from the Scotch parish, where they resided for the 
last three years before their removal to England. Instances of this 
kind are of frequent occurrence. The English parishes are very 
alert in removing persons to Scotland who may probably become 
burdensome ; but the Scots parishes have no such legal right of re- 
moving paupers to England. The vicinity to England, where pau- 
pers receive a more hberal allowance than in Scotland, has a bad 
effect upon the poor,-rendering them dissatisfied with their al ot- 
ted pittance. They are continually referring to the more profuse 
system of the former country, and hinting at what persons m their 
condition would receive there. That virtuous pride, which m for- 



HUTTON. 



165 



mer times shrunk IVom accepting parish rehef, is gradually expiring. 
The people do not consider it as any disgrace to be on the poors roll ; 
but, in imitation of their southern neighbours, claim the allowance 
as a right. Instances still occur, however, where the good old teel- 
incr is visible, and where aged and infirm persons are averse to have 
recourse to the parish for relief, till reduced to do so by extreme 
necessity. Aged unmarried females and widows form the great 
proportion of the persons receiving parochial aid. Some of these 
last have numerous families. The sick, aged, and infirm, are the 
only persons who are admitted on the roll. The heritors, m ge- 
neral, are very liberal to the poor. Their wants are carefully at- 
tended to ; and here, at least, the system of poor rates has not 
dried up the springs of private charity. 

Inns.—Theve. are eight inns or alehouses in the parish, none of 
which are mucb frequented, and one-half of which would be more 
than sufficient. 

FzieL— The fuel used is coal, which is all brought from the other 
side of the Tweed, from about three or four miles distance, and at 
an expense of about 5s. per one horse cart-load, besides driving. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the last Statistical Account, rents have been more than 
doubled; a taste for reading, and a desire of acquiring useful m- 
formation, have been more generally diffused ; the people are bet- 
ter dressed, and live more comfortably ; the salutary influence of 
education is more extensively. felt; ahd attention to the outward 
ordinances of religion has not declined. 

■ . w • . r- ' 

Since this Statistical Report was .written, the building of a new 
parish church has commenced, and is "now proceeding, after a 
handsome design by an architect of taste, and of sufficient size to 
afford ample accommodation for the parishioners. , 

There is also almost a certain prospect of a bridge being soon 
constructed across the Whitadder, near Hutton mill, -conne'Cting' 
this parish with that of Foulden, and opening up greater facilities 
of communication with the internal parts of the county, and its 
on\y sea-po7't, that. of Eyemouth. A beautiful plan of a bridge 
has been' furnished by Mr Jardine of Edinburgh, civil-engineer, 
— for the carrying of which into execution, a subscription has been 
entered into, and the requisite amount almost obtained. The 
liberal sum of L. 600 has been subscribed by a considerable heri- 
tor of this parish, and several other handsome sums by neighbour- 
ing gentlemen. No public improvement was more needed.

THE REV. ADAM LANDELS, MINISTER. 

 
  

1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Src. — The ancient name of Whitsome is va- 
riously written, — Whytslioom, Whitsum, Quitsum, and Huitsum. It 
is derived from Wiite or Huite, and Ham or Home. Huite appears 
as one of the witnesses in Edgar's charter granting the adjoining 
Swinton to the monks of St Cuthbert. When the charter was 
confirmed in 1392, the chancery clerk of Robert III. wrote Qhuite 
for Huite. The circumstantial evidence is therefore pretty strong, 
that the parish is indebted for its present designation to the resi- 
dence of White ; and thus its origin may be traced to a period an- 
terior to the conquest. The etymology of Hilton, indicating a 
town on or near an eminence, is obvious. The two parishes were 
united in 1735. Of course, whenever the term " parish " or " Whit- 
some" occurs in the sequel, it will be understood to include Hil- 
ton, except when differently explained. 

The extent of the parish in length from east to west is about 
41 miles, and in medial breadth 1 1. The whole contains 7| square 
miles. It presents the figure of an irregular parallelogram, bound- 
ed on the east by Hutton; on the south by Ladykirk and Swinton; 
and on the west and north by Edrom. 

The easterly and northerly parts of the parish are generally 
flat ; a belt of low land also stretches along the course of the 
Leet, while an undulating surface diversifies the remainder. The 
exact elevation of the highest ground above the level of the sea has 
not been ascertained, but it is conjectured not to exceed 350 feet. " 

Geology.— Tlxe direction of the strata in this part of the coun- 
try is always found to be east and south-east, the angle of their 
dip varying from 15 to 25 degrees. Sandstone is everywhere

abundant, and generally forms a bed of 40 feet in thickness, im- 
mediately beneath the surface. In the years- 1824 and 1825, an 
attempt was made, by boring, at Myreside quarry, on the estate 
of Blackadder, to determine whether there existed a coal seam of 
sufficient quality and magnitude to warrant an expenditure of ca- 
pital. The result was deemed unfavourable. The information 
obtained from the person who conducted the experiment on that 
occasion, enables us to compile the following tabular statement.

The alluvial soil, to a considerable depth, is replete with vege- 
table remains, such as oak copsewood, hazel nuts, and the various 
plants indigenous to the country. On penetrating farther, a species 
of marl, composed chiefly of shells and plants, is thrown up, — thus 
demonstrating that the whole track was at an early period under 
water. 

Fir on the inferior soils, and the different kinds of hard wood 

on the richer, are grown, principally on the estates of Wynnefield, 

Blackadder, and Laws. They are all in a thriving condition, and, 

while forming an agreeable ornament to the landscape, will amply 

remunerate the proprietors.

and Hilton were rectories. Rauf de Hawden, the parson of Whit- 
some, and David, the parson of Hilton, among others of the clergy, 
swore fealty to Edward I. of England at Berwick, on the 24th of 
August 1296, when their parsonages were restored. In Bagimont's 
Rolls, the tenth of Whitsome rectory was rated at L. 6, 13s, 4d, ; and 
the taxatio at 45 merks. Hilton taxatio was set down at 18 merks. 

The advowson of Whitsome church has always been annexed to 

the manor which belonged to the Earls of March and Dunbar ; 
and, after passing through several hands, it is now vested in John 
Wilson, Esq. of Whitsome Hill. 

Together with " Ederham et Nesbitt," Whitsome was granted 
to the monks of Coldingham by that " sore saint for the crown," 
David I. of Scotland, and afterwards confirmed to them by William. 

Robert I. granted to Roger Pringle half of the lands of Whit- 
some, the whole of which, valued at 200s. of old extent, had been 
forfeited by John de Yle. 

Thomas Hop Pringle of Smailholm and Galashiels died about 
the close of the fourteenth century. He was succeeded by his 
son, Adam Pringle of Whitsome, who married, during his father's 
lifetime, Marjory Keith, daughter of William Keith, grand Mar- 
shal of Scotland. By his marriage he obtained an important ac- 
cession to his estate, as appears by a charter under the Great Seal 
from King David Bruce, dated 25th January 1362. This Adam, 
and many of his successors, attached themselves to the powerful 
family of Douglas, and shared in the enterprises of the period, 
doino- essential service to that illustrious house, and earning a rich 
harvest of martial fame. Adam left a son and successor in Robert 
Pringle of Whitsome, afterwards of Smailholm and Gala. He 
was a warm patriot, and stood high, while a young man, in favour 
with the heroic James Earl of Douglas, to whom he acted m the 
capacity of scutifer or shield-hearer at Otterburn, the last of his 
fields. There are still preserved several charters, to the aforesaid 
Robert, of the diflFerent parts of the lands and barony of Smail- 
holm, viz. TERRAS DOMicALES DE Smailholm, Smailkohn Crag, 
the tower of Smailholm, &amp;c. which were long enjoyed by his poste- 
rity • and, as he preferred the designation of Smailholm to that of 
Whitsome, the former became one of the chief titles of the family.

In the same year, 1362, David II. also granted to William de 
Wardlaw two carrucates of land in the manor of Hilton ; which, 
like many other properties in that age, h'ad fallen to the crown by 
the forfeitm-e of Adam de Hilton, in consequence of his adherence 
to the English interest. The remaining half of the lands of Whit- 
some was conferred by the same monarch on William Colville. 

In the month of July 1482, Whitsome was burned and destroyed 
by the celebrated Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard III. of 
England. The following places in Berwickshire suffered a simi- 
lar fate, viz. Edrington, Fishwick, Paxton, Hutton, Mordington with 
its bastel, Edrom, East Nesbitt, Kellaw, Kimarghame, the two 
Syntons and bastel, Simprin, Crossrig, and many others. 

To convey some idea of Whitsome as it was, it may be noticed, 
that the range of land on the north side of the village was divided 
into several small portions, still denominated " lands." Hence, 
the possessors or occupiers were styled " portioners." " The ten 
lands " formed the southern part of the present farm of Ravelaw ; 
and "the nine" and " the eight" lay east from the preceding, and 
are included in the farm of Leetside. The southern side was par- 
celled out in like manner. The space between the two ranges, of 
considerable breadth, and upwards of half a mile in length, was 
enjoyed in common. The portioners were retainers of the Lord 
of the Manor, to whom, according to custom, they were bound to 
render military service. — The only vestiges of common, the right 
of the villagers to which is undisputed, consist of two small patches, 
— the one at the east end of the village, and the other on the' north 
side near the centre. Both are used for bleaching, — a purpose to 
which they are well adapted by the plentiful supply of water on 
the grounds. The water proceeds from an excellent spring in the 
middle of each patch. The former spring derives its name, " The 
Blind Well," from an obvious casualty which befel a blind man : 
the latter, designated " Reed's Well," is reported to be so called 
in consequence of one Reed having lost his life near the spot, in a 
scuffle which arose at a fair then holding; and tradition adds, that, 
owing to this tragical event, the people were deprived of the privi- 
lege of holding a fair, nor has it been resumed since the fatal pe- 
riod. — In connection with the origin of names, it may be recorded, 
that the Blackadder plantations are vulgarly called " The Pistol 
plantings," on account of a gentleman of the neighbourhood, on 
his way home at an advanced hour of the night, having been fired 
at from one of the thickets.

Ravelaw is distinguished by having been the temporary residence 
of the Rev. Henry Erskine after his ejection from Cornhill. Dur- 
ing his stay here, he frequently preached at Old Newton, where 
his ministrations, under the Divine blessing, produced the first se- 
rious impressions on the youthful mind of Boston. 

It is another incident worthy of note, that when Boston himself 
once officiated in Whitsome church, which was then thatched, 
such a multitude flocked from all quarters, that many, in their 
eagerness to hear him, mounted the roof of the humble edifice, 
tore off portions of the straw, and thus contrived to gratify both 
eye and ear.  

The communion cups of silver for the service of Whitsome 

bear that they were — " Gifted by Countess of Home, to the kirk 

of Whitsome, 1704." 

Hilton bell, which had been rung by the hand, is preserved. 

It has on its rim, in legible characters, — " For Hiltoun, 1718." 

It may be regarded as an apt memorial of the kirk to which it 

ministered, for it has lost the tongue. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners, according to their 

valued cess, are, John Wilson, Esq. of Whitsome-Hill ; David 
Low, Esq. of Laws, Professor of Agriculture in the University of 
Edinburgh; Miss Boswall of Blackadder, Dykegatehead Leet- 

side, &amp;c.; the most noble the Marquis of Tweeddale, Ravelaw; 

of Wynnefield ; Robert Brown, Esq. of Old Newton ; 

Henry Trotter, Esq. of Morton-Hall, Hilton; Forster, 

Esq. of Jardinefield ; John Allan, Esq. of New Newton; James 
Herriot, Esq of Herriot Bank; George Taitt, Esq. of Longridge; 
and Henry Seymour Ker, Esq. of Moriston, Stridlins. 

• When the tide of persecution ran high, Daniel Douglas was minister of Hilton. 
There is a popular tradition to the effect, that one day during public worship an in- 
dividual of the dominant party, offended at certain words which fell from the preacher, 
laid violent hands upon him, and dragged him from the pulpit. A slight effusion of 
blood was the consequence, on which the maltreated pastor predicted, in heanng of 
the congregation, that the cowardly assailant's own blood would yet stain the floor ot 
the sanctuary, and be licked by dogs. It happened soon after, that the person from 
whom Mr D. suffered such ill usage, received a mortal wound from an enemy. A 
crowd of attendants proceeded homewards with the corse, but on their way they were 
overtaken by a storm, which forced them to the nearest shelter,— the kirk of Hilton. 
Thev had not long remained beneath the sacred roof, when the dead man's wound 
broke out afresh, dripped through the bandages, and was actually lapped by some 
hounds that had accompanied the procession. The truth of the tradition we do not 
vouch After the Revolution, previously to which he had taken refuge in Holland, 
Mr Dniio-las returned to Hilton, and there continued to exercise the pastoral tunc- 
tons tin h's decease He died on the 24th July 1705, at the age of 86. His re- 
mains are deposited in Hilton churchyard. Numberless singular stones are current, 
which, if veritable, stamp him as eccentric in beneficence.- I o h.m succeeded M. 
William Wilson, the Inst of the Hilton clerpymcn.

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the parochial regis- 
ters is 1724. Till a recent period, births, marriages, and deaths, 
had never been enrolled in a regular shape. Even now, owing 
to the absence of an express law on the subject, a complete regis- 
tration is impracticable. An important desideratum would be 
supplied by a uniform set of books. 

Antiquities. — In a field still known by the name of the Battle- 
knoices, on the farm of Leetside, there are discernible the out- 
lines of a camp. The form is square, and each side measures 42 
yards. Its position in the middle of a marsh proves, that in its 
entire state it has been surrounded with water, and very difficult 
of access. The entrance or gateway was on the south-east, to 
which a raised pavement of rough stones led. These were lately 
dug up and removed. It is supposed to be of Roman origin. — 
In 1827, on draining some well-springs in an adjoining field, not 
more than 300 yards distant from the site of the camp, the work- 
men found a copper kettle, which, judging from its shape, in all 
likelihood belonged to the Roman belligerents. It was conveyed 
to Blackadder House, where it remains. — In the same vicinity, on 
the farms of Leethead and Frenchlaw, several stone chests, 4 
feet in length internally, and rudely put together, have been dis- 
covered within the last three years. Each chest was composed of 
six flags, which have since been identified with a natural quarry 
at Todheugh, five miles distant on the banks of the Whitadder, 
and on the lid being removed, there were seen the various por- 
tions of a human skeleton. The body, when first placed in the 
coffin, had evidently been doubled, as the skull, with the fore part 
downwards, lay beside the bones of the feet, and the position of 
the rest corresponded. From this circumstance it appears, either 
that the funeral rites had been performed as expeditiously as pos- 
sible, or that tools for cutting, and means for conveying larger 
flags, had been wanting ; although in one case, at least, the upper 
and under flags projected over those at the ends and sides. The 
size of the bones, which were examined by Mr Purvis, surgeon in 
Whitsome, indicated a stature upwards of six feet. Each chest 
had also its urn, of unglazed earthenware, and of a triangular 
shape, the original contents of which had been converted into a 
quantity of black dust. This vessel stood on the left of the body 
for an intelligible reason ; but it is somewhat strange, that the 
rude coffin, or rather the corpse within it, lay in a direction of 
south and north, the urn standing on the west.

So late as 1832, in course of a draining process near the head 
of a spring on Leetside, a well built round with hewn stone, was 
laid bare considerably below the surface. It was little more than 
three feet deep from the mouth. The oldest person living in 
the parish knew nothing of its existence. It is handed down, 
however, from the preceding generation, that a row of houses 
occupied an elevated site close by the well. These houses went 
by the name of Temple-Hall, in consequence, probably, of their 
connection with some more ancient religious edifice. The sjjring too, 
had all along been called The Temple-Well — Numerous querns, 
as in different parts in Scotland, have been met with on the farm 
of Laws. — It only remains to be here noticed, that till the middle 
of last century, there was visible on the east of the present school- 
house a kind of mound — the Birlie-Knowe or Justice- Court of 
by-gone days. Thither the villagers usually repaired, to submit 
their petty grievances, and ask redress ; and there the Birliemen, 
after hearing parties, pronounced their cheap and sapient deci- 
sions.

The: increase, on the whole, can only be ascribed to the rapid 
and extensive improvements in agriculture, since a large portion 
of the land, which is now in a high state of cultivation, was for- 
merly marshy or otherwise unproductive. The population, during 
the current year 1833, is ascertained to be 636,— the deficiency, as 
compared with 1831, being accounted for by the emigration of a 
f€w families to Canada,— of which number, 220 reside in the 
village of Whitsome, and 416 at the various farm home-steads.

During- the last three years there have not been more than two 
illegitimate births in the parish. 

There are only three families of independent fortune resident in 
the parish ; of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 and 
upwards, the number is 11 ; and of resident electors, 18. 

Character of tlie People. — The people enjoy, in a reasonable de- 
gree, the comforts and advantages of society; and though they have 
an impression that their circumstances might be bettered, they are, 
meanwhile, contented with their situation. Many of them evince 
an ardent thirst for sound and practical knowledge. Newspapers 
and other periodicals are extensively read, nor is there any want of 
literary, and particularly of theological works, in the cottages of the 
poorest. Sobriety and industry constitute prominent features in 
their character : and all, with a few exceptions, are regular in the 
outward observance of religious duty. Intelligence and Christian 
sentiment, in short, so generally prevail, that there has been no con- 
viction for capital crime within memory. Poaching and smuggling, 
those symptoms of a debased and distempered morality, are un- 
known. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The superficial extent of the 
parish has been already stated. It may here be added, however, 
that the total amount of acres, inclusive of roads, fences, and all 
kinds of land, is 4900. Of these 4520 are either cultivated or oc- 
casionally in tillage; 200 are occupied by roads, fences, and water- 
courses ; and plantations of wood, comprising the different sorts of 
forest trees, and kept under excellent management, cover the re- 
maining 180. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land per acre is 
L. 1, 13s. 3d. ; and of grazing an ox or cow for the season, at the 
rate of L. 3, 12s.; a ewe or full-grown sheep pastured for the year, 
at the rate of 16s. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of labour may be estimated by the 
following description of the various classes of labourers, and of the 
manner in which they are paid. First, the farm-servant, usually 
hired for the year, is furnished with a cottage, to which is attached 
a small piece of garden ground. In addition, his gains consist of 
10 bolls, equal 60 bushels, of oats; 4 bolls, equal 24 bushels, of 
pease and barley; the potatoe produce of 1000 lineal or drill yards,

and of 500 more given in place of lint, where that is no longer al- 
lowed to be grown ; a cow's grass ; the carriage of coal ; and L.3. 
of sheep money, as it is called. Till lately, a considerable emo- 
lument was derived from poultry, for which advantage a sum of 
10s., and that only in certain cases, has been substituted. The 
farm-servant is hkewise bound to provide a " bondager," for whose 
labour, when the latter is employed, he receives from 8d. to lOd. 
a-day. If any member of his own family is able to do the work, 
or if the bondager is often required, the circumstance turns out pro- 
fitably ; but it is otherwise, when a person must be engaged for the 
express purpose, at an expense of L.6, lOs. or L.7 a-year, besides 
victuals, &amp;c. and the remuneration for whose labour, supposing it 
to be interrupted and limited, falls short of the expense incurred. 
Secondly, the cottar, instead of paying rent for the house and " kail- . 
yard," engages to do harvest work ; at every other season, a pay- 
ment in money, of from 8d. to lOd. per day, is received for each 
day employed ; the cottar also reaps the benefit of as much ground 
as two bushels of potatoes will plant, together with the carriage of 
coal. Thirdhj, the day labourer is paid at the rate of Is. 6d., ex- 
cept during harvest, when he can realize about 2s. 6d. daily.— The 
rate of other labour is, for joiners, 2s. 4d., for masons, 2s. 6d., for 
tailors, Is. 6d., with victuals, per day, respectively. The smith is 
paid 5d. per pound of wrought-iron, and the road-maker Is. 4d. 
per cubic yard of stones broken to size. 

Husbandry.— Yery few sheep or cattle are bred in the district, 
almost all of them being purchased at the different markets. In 
husbandry both the four and five-shift systems are pursued. Owing 
to the high price of stock, the latter is gaining ground, and indeed 
it is recommended by practical agriculturists as the better system 
for general adoption. The interests of agriculture have been vastly 
promoted by the introduction of thrashing-mills, of which there 
are twelve, four driven by steam, one by water, one by wind, and 
six by horse-power; and within the last twenty years, immense mi- 
provements have been effected in reclaiming waste land, &amp;c. Some 
intelligent men are of opinion, that draining might be carried to a 
greater extent with much advantage, if facilities were afforded by 
the erection of a tile and brick kiln in the neighbourhood, as it is 
now difficult to obtain a sufficient quantity of stones for the pur- 
pose. Little more than a quarter of a century ago, a considerable 
portion of the now fertile farms of Dykegatehead, Wynnefield, 
Leetside, and others, was overflowed. Much praise is due to the 



i

present tenants and their immediate predecessors for the skilful ma- 
nagement and persevering zeal with which they have prosecuted the 
work of amelioration. And it ought not to pass unnoticed, that the 
most remarkable results have ensued, when the leases, the general 
duration of which is nineteen or twenty-one years, have been framed 
on liberal principles. But nothing can more clearly demonstrate 
the rapid advance of agriculture in the parish of Whitsome, than 
a comparison of the gross rental at two given periods. At the date 
of the former Statistical Account, it amounted to L. 3080, whereas 
at present it is L. 7526, exclusive of about L. 80, the valued rental 
of feued houses in the village, and of the sums realized by 180 
acres of wood. 

Improvements. — To illustrate the progress of cultivation by an 
example, and to prove the expediency of accommodating the seve- 
ral grades of capitalists, it may be mentioned, that South Laws, 
the property of Professor Low, from being a continuous moor, not 
worth 2s. 6d. an acre, is now a flourishing tract, yielding a rent of 
18s. per acre. The whole, containing only eighty acres, is divided 
into three portions ; and these, in the hands of the same number 
of tenants, present, with their numerous hedge-rows and thriving 
plantations, a garden-like aspect. — During the current season, 
George Taitt, Esq. of Longridge, has tried an experiment alto- 
gether new in this part of the country ; on the more extensive 
adoption and ultimate success of which may depend important con- 
sequences both to proprietors and to the labouring classes. By 
trenching a small field, at a cost of L. 4, 10s. an acre, and then 
sowing it in barley, instead of leaving it fallow, as it must have been, 
according to the usual rotation, above an average crop of good qua- 
lity was the produce. 

The farm-houses are neat and commodious, and many of them 
finished in a superior style. — The cottages, more recently erected, 
are convenient and comfortable ; while the rest are cold, damp, and 
in a miserable state of repair. This may be ascribed to two causes, 
—the non-residence of landlords, and the mode in which an in- 
coming tenant takes all the buildings off" his predecessor's hand, 
who is merely under the obligation to leave the cottages habitahley 
a term which needs no comment. As suitable plans have been 
submitted to the Highland Society, it is to be hoped that the hum- 
ble dwellings of our rural population will ere long be constructed 
on a somewhat uniform principle, and with such a regard to inter- 
nal comfort, if not to outward ornament, as to place them more

nearly on a level with those of England.— The enclosures are laul 
out with taste, and afford evidence that practical farmnig in this 
part of the country keeps pace with modern improvement. 

Quarries.-Sexevsl quarries of freestone are found in the parish. 
The principal is that of Whitsome Old Newton, situate at the 
southern extremity of the parish. Its stone is of the best quality, 
and can be raised to any si/e. Out of it the chief edifices in Ber- 
wickshire have been built, and its excellence is duly appreciated in 
the neighbouring counties. • i i

The village, for there is but one, lies in a direction of east and 
west, and, exclusive of the farm-houses and cottages of Hernot B 

and Leetside, consists of seventeen houses, feued from the Black- 
adder estate, seven cottages on the property of Whitsome- nll,-the 
school-hous;, on the highest part of Hardie's-hill,-the church on 
the western declivity of the same eminence,-and the manse at a 
short distance, also situated on a gently rismg ground 

The nearest market-towns are Dunse, seven mdes dis ant towards 
the west, Coldstream eight miles south, and Berwick ten miles 
noi-th-ea t. At all of these places, monthly markets are held for 
Zip and cattle, and weekly for corn. Berwick, however, being a 

sea-iDort, is the chief grain-mart.

Small bridges and conduits have been thrown over all the water- 
courses, whtch formerly crossed the public roads at numerous points, 
and often rendered them impassable during heavy rains, and in win- 
ter. The fences are formed of quickset hedges, those bemg m 
the best order, which are maintained at the joint expense of land- 
lord and tenant. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The situation of the present church is con- 
venient for all the inhabitants. It stands at the west end of the 
village, almost exactly in the centre, and about 2 miles from either 
extremity of the parish. It was built in 1803 on Hardie's-hill, 
and fronts the south-east. From the recent date of its erection, no 
repairs of importance have yet been required. It is matter of regret, 
however, that on the renewal of the church in the above year, suf- 
ficient accominodation was not provided for the whole body of the 
people. The entire number of hneal feet of seating is 344, which, 
at a moderate calculation, affords room for only 250 persons. Ac- 
cording to custom, too, the seats, besides being limited, were divided 
amongst the several heritors in proportion to their valued cess. By 
this means, it happens that the largest space is not always allotted 
to the proprietor who has the greatest number of residents on his 
estates. — The original walls of the manse have stood from time 
immemorial; at least neither verbal intelligence nor written record 
can be procured, from which to determine the period of its erection. 
It must be observed, however, that numerous alterations and addi- 
tions have imparted to the structure a good deal of the air of a 
modern house. — The glebe ofWhitsome alone contains 11 acres, 
and that of Hilton 19, estimated at L. 2 per acre. The stipend, as 
augmented in 1820, is 16 chalders of barley and oatmeal, 2 bolls 
of wheat, and L. 8, 7s. 4d. in money. 

There are 85 families, comprising 422 persons of all ages, in 
connection with the Established church ; while 40 families, com- 
prising 214 persons of all ages, attach themselves to chapels of 
Presbyterian Dissenters and Seceders in neighbouring parishes. 
From this statement it appears, that the adherents of the kirk have 
decreased, since the date of last Statistical Account, from eleven- 
twelfths to two-thirds, or thereabouts, of the whole population. 

• Since last year, 183.3, when the above statement was drawn up, and a census of 
the population taken, the following changes have been ascertained ;

Still of late years, there has been a gradual and sensible return to 
the Establishment. The average number of church communi- 
cants may be reckoned at 200, more or less. 

A branch of the Berwickshire Bible Society was instituted in 
1816, under the auspices of the late Thomas Boswall, Esq. of 
Blackadder. Its annual contributions average L. 5. A Temper- 
ance Society also originated in 1831 ; it counts thirty members. The 
collections in church for religious and charitable purposes have not 
exceeded L. 20 during the last seven years ; and they were made in 
aid of the Assembly's Highland Schools, the Assembly's India Mis- 
sion, the Scottish Missionary Society, and the Royal Infirmary of 
Edinburgh. 

Educatio7i. — There are two schools in Whitsome, one parochial, 
and one unendowed. In both, English, writing, arithmetic, and 
practical mathematics are taught ; and in the former, the Latin, 
Greek, and French languages, with the principles of general know- 
ledge, form additional branches. The Scriptures and Shorter Cate- 
chism hold a prominent place in the course of Instruction, which 
in its character is the Intellectual system, modified to suit circum- 
stances. The salary annexed to the Estabhshed school is the 
maximum, viz. 2 ch alders of oatmeal, valued at L. 34, 4s. 4|d. and 
the fees amount to L. 26, 10s. The children of poor families are 
tmght gratis. The teacher has all the legal accommodations, the 
ground connected with which was presented to the heritors by the 
Earl of Wemyss. The master of the other school is dependent 
solely on the fees, which amount to L. 29, 15s. The expense of 
education is, for reading, 3s. ; for writing, 4s. ; for arithmetic, 5s. ; 
and for Latin, &amp;c. 8s. 6d. per quarter. Not more than three quar- 
ters and a-half in the year can be reckoned on. As the people 
are keenly alive to the benefits of education, there is no instance 
of any, whether young or old, who are destitute of elementary in- 
struction. The more rapid and extensive diffusion of useful know- 
ledge, however, might be facilitated, were it not that the humbler 
families find it extremely difficult to procure the necessary books; 
and the most estimable boon which an enlightened beneficence 
could confer, would arise from an addition to the parochial endow- 
ments with a special reference to the wants noiiced, and with a 
security, that those wants should be supplied. Certain it is, that 
the most intelligent, well-informed, and religious individuals, are

at the same time the most industrious, orderly, and loyal sub- 
jects. This remark is the result of personal and daily obser- 
vation. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — In 1775, the legal assessment for 
the poor was L. 13. It varied little till 1800, when, owing to 
the deficiency of crop, and the consequent rise in the price of 
provisions, it was L. 78, 12s. Before the shock of that year had 
subsided, the pressure of 1816 commenced, and another rise in 
the assessment ensued, which in 1818 was L. 201, 6s. From 
that date it gradually diminished, and in the present year, ending 
at Martinmas 1833, it is L. 115, 19s. Out of this sum various 
expenses, including an item of L. 8 for enabhng a pauper to emi- 
grate to Canada, are paid, so that the gross amount remaining 
for the poor regularly on the roll is L. 88, 12s. The number of 
persons now receiving parochial aid is 18; and therefore the ave- 
rage sum allotted to each, L. 4, 18s. 5jd. annually, or Is. lOfd. 
weekly. The church collections furnish yearly about L. 6, which 
by courtesy are left at the disposal of the minister and session 
for the relief of incident cases. The poor here enjoy the advan- 
tage of a soup-kitchen maintained at Allanton by the liberality of 
Mrs Boswall, who also distributes amongst them every winter a 
quantity of coal and clothing. Nor should we omit to mention, 
that in 1829 the sum of L. 20 was left by the late Mrs Hogarth 
of Hilton, the interest of which, agreeably to the wishes of the 
donor, is expended in the purchase of Bibles for children, whose 
parents are in necessitous circumstances. The heritors, in their 
collective capacity, kindly allow five per cent, for the principal. 
It is, moreover, worthy of being recorded, that, on the occurrence 
of casual distress in families, arising out of loss of property or do- 
mestic bereavements, all classes in the parish are distinguished for 
the cordial sympathy which they evince, and the liberal benefac- 
tions which they make, in behalf of the sufferers. And this, too, 
seems to be done in approval, and for the nurture, of that inde- 
pendent feeling which operates almost universally as a preventive 
to their applying for parochial aid. Where ignorance and habits 
subversive of economy prevail, recourse is had to any available 
quarter for pecuniary means; but with us the disposition to refrain 
from seeking relief in the sources provided by law, is strong as it 
is honourable. But often, when old age or unavoidable infirmities 
generate the necessity of securing a regular and continued suste- 
nance, an application is reluctantly made.

Inns. — Two inns have sprung up in the course of the last seven 
years, previous to which there had been none for a long period. 
Their existence cannot but be deprecated. 

Fuel. — Coal constitutes the common fuel. It is brought from 
Northumberland, the distance to the nearest colliery being about 
nine miles, and costs from 7d. to 8d. a cwt. A few cart-loads of 
cuttings, &amp;c. from the adjoining plantations prove very serviceable. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count are, — the demolition of the houses and cottages on the farms 
of Deadrigg, Cartrigg, Myreside, and Leethead ; the first and se- 
cond being annexed to Whitsome-hill, the third to Dykegatehead, 
and the fourth to Blackadder Bank : — a wider spread of knowledge, 
and a higher degree of refinement amongst all ranks : — a great ad- 
dition to the quantity of arable land : — the rise of flourishing plan- 
tations and hedge-rows : — the leveUing and Macadamizing of the 
public roads : — the introduction of more powerful thrashing-ma- 
chinery : — an improved mode of husbandry : — and the erection of 
a new church. 

A change from the four to the five-shift system, — a facility of 
obtaining tiles for drains, — and an extension of liberal policy on 
the part of landlords, would tend to promote the interests of agri- 
culture ; while a stricter regard to cottage accommodations,. — the 
removal of every thing that depresses the remuneration of labour 
below a reasonable standard, — the allotment of small pieces of land 
to deserving householders, to be cultivated by the spade, — and a 
provision for effectually supplyiflg the schools with appropriate sets 
of books, — are means which appear to us well calculated to encou- 
rage and advance industry, and to increase the comfort, inde- 
pendence, and happiness of the labouring-classes.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE H. ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries. — The ancient name of this parish was Up- 
sethngton. " The parish of Upsethngton took its name," says 
Chalmers, Caledonia, Vol. ii. p. 361, "from the Kirktown, which 
stands on the northern margin of the Tweed, somewhat higher 
than Norham, on the opposite bank." The origin of the name 
is obscure. In 1500, James IV. erected a new church for this 
parish, which he dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and hence, in 
after times, the parish became known by the name of Lady- 
kirk, although part of it still retains the ancient appellation of 
Upsethngton. Ladykirk comprehends the parishes of Horn- 
dene and Upsethngton, which were united at the Reforma- 
tion for the enlargement of the minister's stipend. " The name 
of the parish of Horndene," says Chalmers,  Caledonia, Vol. ii. 
p. 361, « is pecuharly Saxon. Horn in the Anglo-Saxon tongue 
signifies a corner, and dene, a vale," — an appellation remarkably 
descriptive of the site of that part of the parish, lying in a corner, 
and in a valley sloping towards the Tweed. 

The parish is bounded on the south by the river Tweed ; on 
the north, by the parish of Whitsome ; on the east, by that of 
Hutton ; and on the west, by that of Swinton. It is three miles 
long, and one broad, and contains about 3100 Enghsh acres. The 
country is flat, with a few rising-grounds. 

Climate.— This parish, lying along the banks of the Tweed, and 
sloping to the south, is considerably milder in climate than the 
country to the north and east, the frost being less severe than on 
the higher grounds, and the parching east winds which prevail in 
the spring moderated by its distance from the coast. There is no 
prevailing disease pecuHar to the parish ; and itis generally healthy, 
— many of its inhabitants attaining to an advanced age. 

Geohc/y and Miner ahf/i/.—T\\e parish is marked, along the  



182 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



banks of the Tweed to the east and westward, by nearly horizontal 
strata of white compact micaceous sandstone, containing impres- 
sions of fossil monocotyledonous and apparently dicotyledonous 
vegetables, which alternate with schistose marls, and a dark-co- 
loured impure hmestone ; towards the western extremity of the 
parish, a red-coloured variety of sandstone occurs, forming a con- 
tinuation of the strata of a similar rock which is quarried in the ad- 
joining parish of Swinton. 

Botani/.— There are three rare Scottish plants found on Holy- 
well-haugh, viz. Cichorium intyhus wild succory; Lactuca virosa 
strong-scented lettuce ; and Inula dysenterica common flea-bane.  

The trees which appear most congenial to the soil are the oak 
and the plane. In many places, after forty years' growth, the tops 
of the elm and the ash begin to decay, in consequence of the roots 
reaching the subsoil, which is of a cold till. 

II. — Civil History. 
Mention is made of this parish in Chalmers' Caledonia, in Rid- 
path's Border History, and in manuscripts in possession of the 
Dean and Chapter of Durham. The supplemental treaty to that 
of Chateau Cambreses between the Enghsh and Scotch was con- 
cluded within the church. On the 2d of June 1291, eight of the 
competitors for the Crown, with several of the prelates, nobles, 
and community of Scotland, assembled on Holywell-haugh, oppo- 
site to Norham Castle, to settle with Edward I. the dispute rela- 
tive to the succession. {Vide, Border History, p. 174. 

Land-owners.— The principal land-owner is Miss Robertson of 
Ladykirk, who succeeded her grandfather, Mr Robertson, m 1830, 

and is still a minor. _ 

Parochial Beyisters.— The greater part of the parish records 
has been destroyed. One book, however, remains, the first entry 
in which is dated 1697; at that period, these records appear to 
have been kept very confusedly,— births, marriages, and deaths 
being intermingled with meetings of kirk-sessions. The records 
have been kept regularly only since the induction of the late 
schoolmaster in 1817. ,  , ■ , 

Antiquities, Sfc.-ln what is called the Chapel Park, a little 
lower down the river than Upsethngton, a few large stones, and 
the superior richness of the soil, mark where the ancient monas- 
tery stood. Near the spot are three springs of excellent water, over 
which the late proprietor of the grounds erected pillars, "scribing 
on them the appellation of the Nun's, the Monk's, and St Mary s 



LADYKIRK.

Well. In a field opposite to Norham Castle, numerous cannon- 
balls have been found. 

Modem Buildings. — The only mansion-house in the parish is 
Ladykirk House, — a modern building. Within the grounds there 
is a mausoleum erected by the late proprietor ; but he afterwards 
requested to be entombed within the walls of the church, where 
others of his family have been buried, and the mausoleum remains 
unoccupied. 

III. — Population. 

By return to Dr Webster in 1 755, the population was - 386 

By census in 1811, - - - 335 

1821, - - - 327 

1831, - - - 485 

By a census taken by the present incumbent in 1834, - 455 

This diminution of population since the year 1821 is to be at- 
tributed to the death of the late Mr Robertson of Ladykirk, who 
gave employment to numerous labourers, in improving and beauti- 
fying his property, and also to the numbers who have emigrated 
to Canada. 

There are residing in the village of Horndene, 1 28 ; in Upset- 
lington. 111. 

The only family of independent fortune residing in the parish

Habits and Character of the People. — The inhabitants of the 
parish are honourably distinguished by those habits and characte- 
ristics which generally prevail throughout the agricultural districts 
of Scotland. They are cleanly, sober, industrious, and contented. 
They live comfortably, and in friendly intercourse with each other, 
and are anxious to afford a good education to their children.

Agriculture.— There are 3100 acres of imperial measure in the 
parish ; about fifty of which are under plantation. 

Rent of Land. — The average value of the arable land is L. 1, 
13s. per acre. The average rate of grazing is L. 4 per ox or cow 
grazed, and 12s. per ewe. 

Rate of Wages — The rate of wages for farm-labourers is 9s.

a-week in winter, and averages lis. in summer; 15s. for masons 
and carpenters. 

Hushandrij.—GeneW speaking, the rotation of crop is to have 
two years' pasture, and to sow down with the crop succeeding the 
fallow or turnips. There is, however, a pecuharity in this parish 
very unusual in the low districts in Scotland, viz. that nearly one- 
fourth part of the whole land is in perennial pasture, generally 
speaking of the finest quality, and capable of fattening oxen of the 
largest size ; and, by a deed of entail by the late Mr Robertson of 
Ladykirk, it cannot be ploughed up. 

In the year 1788, this gentleman, remarking the superior qua- 
lities of a beautiful description of cattle in the possession of a few 
yeomen and farmers in the county of Durham, particularly the late 
Messrs CoUings, purchased seventeen of them, which were consi- 
dered to be the best of the breed, and fixed an extra price on this 
kind of cattle now so celebrated. One of the cows thus brought 
to Ladykirk appears to have possessed extraordniary properties ; 
and from her the whole existing race of short-horns have descend- 
ed. Her name was Strawberry, bought from a Mr Mainard by C. 
Colling. She produced the famous bull Bohngbroke, and was sis- 
ter to old Phoenix, from whence sprung Favourite, Comet, &amp;c. 
The latter bull sold at 1000 guineas, and the blood is now univer- 
sally diflfused throughout the kingdom. The sheep are of the Lei- 
cester breed, and great attention is paid to this description of stock. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen or twenty-one years. 
The farm-buildings are generally commodious, and the enclosures 
well preserved. 

Fisheries.— Thexe are three stations for salmon-fishing, and the 
rent of the whole at present is L. 100 per annum, which is about 
one-half the former rent, the quantity of the fish having greatly 
decreased.

market-town. The parish is, however, chiefly supplied with ar- 
ticles of consumption from Berwick, nine miles distant, by a carrier 
weekly. There is a branch penny post every day from Cold- 
stream to Ladykirk, obtained in consequence of a petition got up by 
the present incumbent. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated nearly in the centre 
of the parish, about 1 g mile from each extremity. It is built in 
the form of a cross, is a handsome and substantial structure, of 
Gothic architecture, and is composed of lofty freestone arches in 
the interior, and is covered with a stone roof. It has, however, 
been as much as possible disfigured by modern bad taste. As 
notified by a Latin inscription in the interior of the church, it 
was repaired by Mr Robertson of Ladykirk in 1743; and a belfry 
was then added, which is not at all in unison with the building. 
From the interior of the church a school-room has been portioned 
off, much to the injury of its appearance. Although situated on a 
rising ground, which commands an extensive view, instead of being 
permitted to stand alone as an ornament to the country, it is closely 
surrounded by a ruinous farm-stead. It is seated for 300 persons, 
and affords ample accommodation for the parishioners. It is also 
rendered comfortable in winter by two stoves. 

The manse was built about sixty years ago. After the acces- 
sion of the present incumbent in 1819, the heritors and minister 
repaired and added to it. Like most manses, especially old ones, 
having been wretchedly finished at first, doubtless according to the 
cheapest estimate, it has been and ever will be, a continual oc- 
casion of expense to both. More has been already expended on 
repairs than would have built a commodious new house j and it 
shakes from the foundation with every blast. 

The glebe contains eleven acres of land, of very good quality, 
has been lately drained and improved, and would let at present for 
about L. 2, 10s. per acre. The amount of the stipend is six chal- 
ders in grain, and L. 88, 2s. 8d. in money, and averages about 
L. 170 per annum. All the teinds are valued and exhausted. 

There is one dissenting chapel in the parish, belonging to the 
Burghers. The minister is paid from seat rents, and the salary 
amounts to L. 118 per annum, with a house and garden. There 
are 63 families, or 272 individuals children included who at- 
tend the Estabhshed church. There are 45 families, or 183 in- 
dividuals children included who attend the dissenting chapel. 
Divine service is well and regularly attended. The average num-

ber of communicants at the Established church, for the last five 
years, is 170 ; for the five years preceding, 160. The average 
amount of the church collections is from L. 5 to L. 6 per an- 
num, the greater part of which is expended in the payment of 
church officers. 

Education.— Theve is only one school in the parish, viz. the 
parochial school, where Greek, Latin, French, and the more usual 
branches of education, are taught. The salary of the schoolmaster, 
unfortunately, is the minimum, amounting to L. 25, 13s. 3d. ; the 
school fees average about the same sum, to which may be added 
L. 15 arising from other sources. The rate of school fees was 
fixed by the heritors in 1817, and is the same as in the neighbour- 
ing parishes. There are four or five persons upwards of 6 years 
of age who cannot read; none, upwards of 15. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid, for the last five years, is 18, and the average 
sum allotted to each is 2s. per week, which, together with occa- 
sional supplies, amounts to about L. 100 per annum. This is de- 
rived from a cess paid by the heritors and tenants. There ap- 
pears to be little or no feeling of degradation among the poor in 
soliciting parochial aid : nearly all apply as soon as they think it 
will be granted. 

Pairs. There is a fair held on the 5th of April, where linen 

and lintseed are the principal articles of sale. 

Alehouses. — There are three alehouses in the parish; two would 
be amply sufficient ; but the people being generally of sober habits, 
any evil effects from them are scarcely perceptible. 

uel.—Coal is the only description of fuel used in the parish ; 
it is brought from North Durham, five miles distant, and is pur- 
chased at the rate of 7s. a ton at the coal-pit.

 <p>
PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES LOGAN, MINISTER. 

 
 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The parishes of Swinton and Simprin 
were united by the annexation of Simprin in 1761, The word 
" Swinton" seems to have undergone no change since the earhest 
periods of Scottish history ; and hke Swine-wood, the ancient name 
of an adjacent tract of land, it may have been connected with 
the prevalence in this district of wild boars, with which the whole 
of the country is understood to have been formerly infested. Sim- 
prin, there is sufficient evidence, is not a modern name ; but neither 
tradition nor any historical notice throw light upon its etymology. 

The united parishes form a sort of trailing oblong figure,  the 
boundary lines of which are very irregularly indented of about 4 
miles in length from east to west, by 3 or .3 miles in breadth. 
The surface, neither perfectly level, nor yet at all hilly, consists 
of a succession of low, parallel, wave-like ridges ; ranging from east 
to west, with interjacent level spaces of considerable extent. 

Climate. — The climate of Swinton may perhaps be character- 
ized as rather humid ; but scarcely, if at all, more so now, than 
that of the contiguous parishes. A considerable improvement in 
this respect seems to have taken place since the period of the 
last Statistical Account. Ague, which is mentioned by Mr Cup- 
pies as being a very prevalent disorder then, owing to the ex- 
cessive dampness of both earth and air, is now almost unknown, — 
one instance only having occurred during the last seventeen years. 

Hydrography. — There are no peculiar, and but few good, springs 
in the parish. They flow through a deep bed of tenacious clay, 
lying upon sandstone ; and, as there is nowhere any considerable 
elevation, are apt to be impure, and, unless where sunk to a great 
depth, to fail in summer during a drought. A loch of consider- 
able extent, called " Stvinton Loch" has been drained since 1700. 



188 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



There is only one stream, and that inconsiderable, — the Leet, 
which rises in the neighbouring parish of Whitsome, and passes 
through Swinton in a westerly direction, to fall, after a course of 
ten or eleven miles, into thd Tweed at Coldstream. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— "The whole parish forms part of the 
new red sandstone formation, which may be traced throughout a 
considerable portion of the Merse or lower district of Berwickshire. 
The rocks, disposed in strata which dip to the south, consist of white 
sandstone and a dark sandstone slate, with alternating beds of indu- 
rated marl. This arrangement appears to extend to the Tweed, and 
to rest immediately upon the coal formation of Northumberland ; 
it is interrupted, however, on the eastern boundary, by rocks, ap- 
parently of the coal formation, white sandstone disposed in hori- 
zontal strata, and containing calamite with impressions of salices. 
A coarse red micaceous sandstone, accompanied with a white va- 
riety, is quarried in several parts of the parish. The lower surface 
of this rock has not been reached, though it has been bored to the 
depth of thirty fathoms. 

The boulders, or loose minerals which occur in the fields, be- 
sides sandstone, are of greywacke and transition granite and green- 
stone, which appear to have been conveyed from the hills to the 
north of Dunse, a distance of about eight miles. 

The soil is in general deep and very productive; but as it lies 
upon a strong impervious clay, it is liable, where drains do not 
prevent, to be wet or almost miry during long-continued rains in 
winter, and in dry summers it has sometimes suffered severely from 

want of moisture. 

j5oto/.— Though not rich in a botanical sense, the parish pos- 
sesses several interesting plants. Among the rarer and more 
beautiful are the Senecio tenuifolius,  the AUsma rammculoides, 
the Cerastium arvense, Lytlirum salicaria, Hyoscyamus niger, Lac- 
tuca virosa, Solanum dulcamara, Trollius Europa;us, Typha lati- 
folia, Cnidium Solaris, Spergula nodosa, Arum maculatum, Berberis 
vulgaris, Rumcx sanguineus, Tormentilla reptans, Plantago mari- 
tima. Ranunculus arvensis, Parnassia palustris, Leontodon palxis- 
tre, Lysimachia vulgaris, and Galium horeale. 

Of the mosses the Brywn ligulatum has been collected on fine 
fruit, and the felices are the common Aspidium fclix mas. 

No natural wood is to be found in the parish; but the planted wood, 

• This plant, gathered in this parish, added to the British Hor,, a few years 
ago, by the Rev. Mr Baird of Cockburnspath.

which is of oak, ash, or elm, with a few firs, appears to be well 
adapted to the soil. There are some fine trees near Swinton- 
House, but the great proportion of the wood over the parish is not 
more than fifty or sixty years old. At the Restoration the whole 
of this property, forfeited to the Crown, came into the possession 
of the Duke of Lauderdale by a grant of Charles 11. and conti- 
nued in his hands until the Revolution in 16S8. Among other 
measures of spoliation he is said to have caused the whole of the 
wood upon the lands to be cut, excepting one tree, a beautiful and 
very large ash, which was blown down, between twenty and thirty 
years ago. As the most of the wood now growing has been planted 
along the hedge-rows, it shelters and adorns the fields, and gives 
a wooded appearance to the district greatly beyond the 'reality. 

II. — Civil History. 
Brief notices respecting the parish are met with in the border his- 
tories ; and from these, it would seem to have participated fully in 
the condition, both political and moral, of the tract of country in which 
it lies, during the long period of hostilities which extended with few 
interruptions from the time of its separation from the Saxon kingdom 
of Northumberland until its reunion with England.  The parish 
presents no natural impediment to an invading force, and it does 
not appear to have been ever protected by any considerable strong- 
hold, f The inhabitants, afflicted, therefore, by the precariousness 
which such an exposure implies, would soon become unsettled in 
their habits, disinclined to, as well as prevented from, the avoca- 
tions of regular industry, until they came, as a matter of course, 
to study not more retaliation than the means of support, in visit- 
ing upon their enemies evils which had blasted to themselves 
the hopes of autumn, or had otherwise deprived them of advan- 
tages to which they might feel that they had a rightful claim. If. 

' In one of the earliest notices which we have of Swinton, it seems to have lapsed 
from a state of culture, the condition probably in which it was under its last Nor- 
thumbrian monarch into a waste and desert state, — for which Edgar, son of Malcolm 
Canmore, presents it to Coldingham Abbey. He presents along with it twenty- 
four beasts to till it anew. 

f The remains of a fosse, which can still be traced in the church-yard, are the only 
vestige now extant, of a state of warlike operations. 

 The last time that we hear of its having formed the scene of a hostile encoun- 
ter was on Whitsunday of 1558. Sir Henry Percy, brother to the Earl of Nor- 
thumberland, and the JMarshal of Berwick, overran the Merse with 8000 foot, and 
200 horse, burnt Dunse and Langton, and were overtaken at Swinton on their re- 
turn by the Scottisli forces under the Lord Keith, son of the Earl Mareschal and by 
the French troops, who were lying at Kelso and Eyemouth, for the defence of the 
inarches. After an obstinate engagement, the English made good their retreat 
with all tlieir plunder — the Scottish troops being almost wliolly slain, or made pri- 
soners.

Such habits, when fully formed among a people, do not pass away 
immediately upon the removal of their causes, and it was not, 
therefore, until long after the union of the crowns, that the pro- 
ductive energies of this fine portion of Scotland appear to have 
begun to be adequately cultivated by a skilful and settled hus- 
bandry. 

Family of Swinton. — But the most interesting fact connected 
with the civil history of this parish is that of its having formed, 
with only two very brief interruptions, the property of one family 
since the days of the Heptarchy, till the present time. Authentic his- 
tory furnishes us with no account of the origin of the family of Swin- 
ton of Swinton. It is found in this place, and appears to have been in 
prior possession of it shortly after the incorporation of this district 
with the kingdom of Scotland. About 1060, Edulf de Swinton, who 
had assisted Malcolm Canmore to recover the Scottish throne, 
obtained from that monarch a confirmation of the property of the 
whole parish of Swinton, by one of the first charters granted in 
Scotland, and which is still preserved in the Archives of Durham. 
The estate seems after this to have been alienated from the fa- 
mily during the period of the reigns of Edgar and Alexander, his 
sons, as each of these sovereigns present the lands of Swinton to 
Coldingham priory.  It was restored to them, however, by the 
youngest son of Malcolm— David, who grants two charters in 
their favour of the lands of Swinton, " to be held as freely as 
any baron held theirs." f 

Of the succeeding members of the family, several are mention- 
ed with distinction by the English and Scottish chroniclers. To 
the valour of  Sir John Swinton in particular, Fordun chiefly

+ Anderson's Inquiry, Chart. Durham. A stone statue of Allan Swinton, the 
fifth baron, lies in an arched open niche of the south wall of the parish church, on 
the right hand of the pulpit with this inscription : " Hie jacct Alanus Swmton miles 
de Eodera." This Allan is witness to a deed by Patrick Earl of March, to Nisbet 
of Dirleton, and to several by William the Lion. ■ , . . , 

± There is in Rymer, 1400 a safe conduct to this Sir John and his retinue for 
coding to the presence of Henry II., then in the north. He seems to have been 
disgusted at the undue power which Douglas enjoyed, and to have intended to join 
in The defection of the Earl of March, who had transferred his allegiance to the Lng- 
"si king, in consequence of the breaking off of the match between his daughter and 
t e Duke of Rothsay, in order to prefer the daughter of his rival, Douglas. Sn J. 
Swinton had either not effected this journey, or he had speedily withdrawn his ho- 
mage—for his death at Hamilton took place two years atter.

attributes the victory at Otterburn ; and his heroic death at the 
battle of Hamildon, after having vainly endeavoured to restore 
order among the Scottish troops, has furnished Sir W. Scott, 
himself a relation of the family, with the subject of his drama- 
tic sketch of " Halidon Hill." This Sir John married a daugh- 
ter of King Robert II., and his son by that lady appears to have 
signalized his prowess in the wars of France. He is mentioned 
as having unhorsed the Duke of Clarence, brother to Henry V. 
at the battle of Berranger. 

In Rymer, there is the bond of a Sir John Swinton, who, with 
many others, engages at Edinburgh to assist the king James VI. 
against the Earls of Bothwell and Hume, and all who aided and 
abetted their rebellion. 

During the reign of Charles L, the proprietor of Swinton sup- 
ported the side of the Parliament, and enjoyed subsequently the 
favour and confidence of Cromwell, having been appointed by him, 
upon the arrangement of Scottish affairs, a privy- councillor and 
a commissioner for the administration of justice. At the restora- 
tion, he was accused of having borne arms against the king in the 
battle of Worcester, and on this charge, though unsupported by 
evidence, his estate was forfeited, and he was driven, with his fa- 
mily, into exile. His son returned at the Revolution in 1688, and 
obtained shortly afterwards an act of Parliament rescinding his for- 
feiture, and restoring to him the lands of Swinton " j»gr modum 
justicice," — of which his descendants have since enjoyed the un- 
disturbed possession. 

Among the modern proprietors of the estate of Swinton, we are 
called upon to notice particularly the grandfather of the late pos- 
sessor, John Swinton, Esq. for some time sheriff of Perthshire, and 
afterwards one of the Senators of the College of Justice. The 
country is indebted to Lord Swinton's suggestion for the divi- 
sion of the Court of Session into two separate chambers. He was 
a zealous and influential advocate for the introduction into Scot- 
land of trial by jury in civil causes ; he was the originator of the 
small debt court ; he gave to the world an accurate and useful 
abridgement of British statutes since the Union ; and it is the cu- 
rious and valuable information on weights and measures, which he 
published in his elaborate treatise upon that subject, which forms 
the basis of the late act of Parliament for effecting their uniformity 
throughout the kingdom. To his professional and literary attain- 



192 BERWICKSHIRE. 

ments, Lord Swinton added a thorough knowledge of country busi- 
ness, and was distinguished by activity and benevolence of character. 

It is a remarkable fact, especially when we keep m mmd the in- 
secure state of this portion of the country for many ages, that the 
estate of Swinton has descended Imeally from father to son for not 
less than 27 generations, comprising a period of almost 800 years. 

It is now in the possession of Samuel Swinton, Esq. a nephew 
of the late Lord Swinton, who, by draining to a large extent, and 
other judicious measures, has greatly improved the property, while 
he has shown himself most solicitous to promote the comfort and 
well-being of the labouring poor. 

Other Land-owners.-T\e parish of Simprm also appears, unti 
very lately, to have been in the possession of an old and powerful 
family, Cockburn of Langton; but as they do not seem ever to have 
had a place of residence within its bounds, it may be improper to 
enter upon their history in this statement. The lands of Simprin 
were sold, in consequence of their affairs havmg fallen mto disorder 
in 1755, to Lord Elibank, and are now the property of Patrick 
Murray, Esq. of Simprin. There are two f Pf  f

III. — Population. . . 

Mr Boston found 88 examinable persons in Simprin upon his 
induction to that parish in 1699. In 1751, the population of the

parish of Svvinton amounted to 351, and of Simprin to 143. Since 
that time, the population of Simprin has decreased considerably 
and IS now hmited to the number which is required for the cultiva' 
tion of the soil. In 1791, the population of the conjoined parishes 
amounted to 898, shewing an increase, since 1755, of 404. Dur- 
ing this, or rather the latter half of this period, the land was regu- 
larly subdivided, and its present agricultural system entered upon. 
1 o this important change in the state and management of the soil, 
and the wants which it created, the extraordinary increase in the 
population is to be attributed. In 1811, the population amounted 
to 866; in 1821, 919; in 1831, 971, of whom 460 were males, 
and 511 females. 

 The increase of the population since 1791 is inconsiderable, and 
may be accounted for partly by the enlargement of the village of 
Swinton, which affords accommodation to coal-carters and others 
not strictly dependent for their support upon the land of the parish' 
and partly by the additional labourers required for a more careful 
husbandry. 

The number of inhabitants in the village of Swinton is 450 the 
remaming 520 being in all respects a country and agricultural po- 
pulation.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — There are about eight miles of turn- 
pike road in the parish, but not travelled by any pubHc carriages; 
and there are three bridges. The roads are excellent, and com- 
pletely fenced, and the bridges, one of which has been lately built, 
are in a good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State. — From the small extent of the parish, the 
church, though placed rather too near to its north-east corner, is 
quite convenient for the whole of the inhabitants. It was built in 
1729, — an aisle was added to it by the feuars of the village, for their 
own accommodation, in 1782, — and it is still in tolerable repair. It 
is seated to accommodate 400 persons, and there are no free sit- 
tings. It holds, however, considerably more than that number, 
and from fifty to seventy persons are regularly supplied with seats 
in the passage. 

The manse was built in 1771, and has been several times re- 
paired. In 1815, when it was last repaired, a considerable addi- 
tion also was made to it. 



196 BERWICKSHIRE. 

The united glebe of Swinton and Simprin extends to twenty-one 
acres, of the annual value of I.. 63, or thereby.— The stipend of the 
parish amounts to sixteen chalders, half barley and half oats. 

There are no Dissenting, or Seceding, or Episcopalian, or Ro- 
man Catholic chapels in this parish. 

A very few famiUes, twenty-five in number, are connected with 
the Secession; but the great body of the parishioners attend the 
Estabhshed church,— the number of communicants at which varies 

from 440 to 470. . , , . 

Educatio7i.— There are two schools in the parish,— the one the 
parochial school, and the other unendowed. The usual branches 
of education may be obtained at the parochial school ; and it 
may be noticed, that the teacher is Mr Strahan, the joint editor, 
with Mr Dickinson and Dr Smith, of Sleusner's Greek Lexicon. 
Reading, writing, arithmetic, and mathematics are taught at the 

unendowed schools. 

The schoolmaster of the parochial school has the maximum sa- 
lary, and his school-fees may amount to L. 20 or L. 30. He is in 
the enioyment of all the legal accommodations. 

The charge for education per month is,— English reading. Is.; 
reading and writing, Is. 4d.; arithmetic, 2s.; Latin, 2s. lOd. ; 
Greek and Latin, 3s. 8d.; book-keeping, 3 sets, L. 1, 10s.; Na- 
vigation, L. 1, 10s. ; Algebra, L. 2, 2s. None of the children who 
have reached the age of 15 are unable to write. Parents, in gene- 
ral, are sensible of the advantages of education; and as there are 
no parts of the parish so distant from the school as to prevent the 
attendance of healthy children at any season of the year, the young 
m-e, as a matter of course, instructed regularly to read and write, 
and commonly also in arithmetic. ,  . „ • , t,

b7 protecting and encouraging habits of sobriety ahd mdustry, a.d 
fostering, therefore, a spirit of independence, as well as by the di- 
rect reef which it occasionally affords, it has contributed more than 
any thing else to keep down the amount of paupers on our poors 
roll For the last five years, the income of this society has 
con'siderably exceeded its expenditure the fonner bemg L.4o

money, upon becoming a member is 5s., and the contribution 
Is. 6d. per quarter. The sick or lame, if they have been four 
years in the society, draw 5s. per week for the first three 

months, 2s. 6d. for the second three months, and afterwards, 

while they may need support, Is. 6d. Upon the death of a 
member, L. 3 are allowed for funeral expenses, and upon his 
wife's decease, if she has remained a widow, L. 2. If sickness 
&amp;c. can be proved to have originated in irregular conduct, the 
individual is excluded from the benefit of the society. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 38, and the average sum per week al- 
lotted to each is about 2s. It varies, according to their circum- 
stances, from Is. to 2s. 6d., and in a few instances to 3s. The 
average annual amount of regular church collections is L. 34, 
and the only other means of providing for the poor is by a re- 
gular assessment, which has long obtained in this, as in all the con- 
tiguous parishes. The amount of the assessment for the last year 
in this parish was greater than usual, — being L. 227, 18s. 4|d. 

There is an unwillingness manifested by some of the poor to 
make application for parochial relief ; but this is not the common 
feeling. As in other places, when there has long been a com- 
pulsory provision for paupers, this resource has ceased to be regard- 
ed generally as degrading. 

Fail's. — There are two fairs held annually in the village of Swin- 
ton, — the one in June, and the other in October. Originally 
these fairs formed a market for cattle and agricultural produce, 
but they do not now answer that end. 

Inn. — There is only one inn in the parish. It is in the vil- 
lage. The accommodations are superior, and it is required as 
a place of stay and refreshment on the public road from Berwick, 
which passes through the village. 

Fuel. — Coal is almost the only description of fuel used. It 
is procured in Northumberland, from a distance of ten miles, and 
sells in Swinton at the rate of about 18s. per ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Though no important improvement, not then commenced, 
seems to have been effected in this parish since the period of the 
last Statistical Account, there are perhaps few parishes which have

experienced in so short a time a more complete or more gratifying- 
change. The subdivision of the land, indeed, was completed by 
that time, and the population located as at present ; but the science 
of husbandry, then only in its infancy, has now been matured, — 
the fences and the trees planted along them have grown up, and are 
highly ornamental, — drains have rendered the land firm and pro- 
ductive in places where they were then only beginning to take effect, 
— the roads, which are mentioned in the last Account as being 
" deep, miry, and almost impassable," are now of the very best de- 
scription. To no class of individuals could the warm terms in 
which the intelligence and general worth of the farmers of that day 
are mentioned, be applied with greater justice than to those who 
now occupy their places. Nor is there any where to be found a 
more intelligent, moral, and well ordered peasantry than our own 
agricultural population.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. THOMAS SMITH GOLDIE, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries. — The original name of the parish of Cold- 
stream was Lennal. It is found in ancient charters writteri in the 
various forms of Leinhall, Lenhal, Leinal, Lennal, and Lennel. 
The kirk-town of Lennel stood on the north bank of the Tweed, 
which at that place forms a pool, or Llyn, as it is termed in the 
Cambro- British dialect. When the Saxon settlers took posses- 
sien of the vale of the Tweed, they added to the original name 
their own term Hal, which signifies a large house, and thus was 
formed the name Leinhall, which is to be met with in deeds as early 
as 1147. The church of Leinhall continued in the possession of 
the Prioress of Coldstream, till the period of the Reformation, and 
retained its original name for a century and a-half after that epoch. 
The original village was destroyed by the English in their preda- 
tory incursions ; and in 171 6 a new parish church was built at Cold- 
stream, which was then becoming the most populous district of 
the parish. 

The parish extends 7| miles in length, and somewhat more 
than 4 in breadth ; it is of an irregular rectangular shape, and has 
the parish of Ladykirk for its boundary on the east ; Simprin, now 
united to Swinton, on the north; Eccles on the west; while Tweed 
separates it from England on the south. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general appearance of the 
parish is flat, and there is no rising ground that deserves the name 
of hill. Five-burn-mill toll-bar is 108 feet above Berwick pier, 
Coldstream bridge is 61 feet, and Hatchednize 188 feet above the 
same level. Dovecotamins is considerably higher than any of these 
places. 

Meteorologtj.— T\iG quantity of rain that ftills in this parish is 
comparatively inconsiderable. The situation of the parish, in re- 
ference to the direction and distance of the neighbouring hills, may 



200 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



account for this circumstance : for as the Lammermoor and Che- 
viot ranges towards their eastern extremities are equally distant 
from Coldstream on the north and south, but converge and unite 
towards the west, the clouds, attracted by these several mountains, 
frequently separate, and either discharge their moisture on them, or 
follow their respective ranges, leaving the intervening districts dry. 
Accordingly, when the barometer in this district falls, indicating 
the presence or approach of rainy weather, the result often is, not 
showers of long continuance, but floods in the rivers, which flow 
from the adjoining hills. 

Although this parish is not very subject to thunder storms, yet 
on several occasions the peculiar phenomenon of ascending light- 
ning has been observed. The prevailing winds are the south-wes- 
terly; but that which is generally accompanied by bad weather 
blows from Lamberton-hill, or from the north-easterly direction. 
From the lowness of its level, Coldstream is in a considerable de- 
gree exempt from rain and cold, while its distance from the coast is 
so great, that it does not suffer much from the scourging influence 
of the easterly blast ; and hence the climate is milder than that of 
most other parishes. 

Climate. — The improvements in agriculture, particularly the 
very extensive and efficient system of draining that has been car- 
ried on, have done much to ameliorate the climate, so that ague, 
which at one time was very prevalent, is now unknown in the parish, 
except at the farm of Hatchednize, which is in the vicinity of Lith- 
tillum Loch, and where there is a dirty, stagnant pool, the level of 
which is above that of the neighbouring cottages. 

Hydrograiiliy. — With the exception of a lake almost entirely 
artificial in the grounds of Hirsel, there is no sheet of water deserv- 
ing the name, — several which are referred to in the titles of the 
Snook Barony having entirely disappeared. The temperature of 
springs in the month of October is about 48 Fahrenheit. 

The only streams which take tlieir rise in the parish are Gra- 
den-burn and the Shiells-burn, which join the Tweed near the 
eastern extremity. The Leet, another tributary of the same river, 
flows in a southerly direction for more than half its course through 
the parish, while the Tweed forms its southern boundary. From 
its liability to great and sudden floods, the Tweed seldom remains

markable thunder storm which occurred in 1785; and in wliich n man driving his

long frozen ; but ol'ten great damage is done to the banks, as well 
as to bridges and trees, by the sudden breaking up of its icy barrier. 
The accumulation of alluvial soil being greater towards its mouth, 
the rapidity of the river is of course there not so great as in Cold- 
stream parish, where, for the same reason, it is less than nearer its 
source. To this circumstance may probably be ascribed the fact, 
that there are no water-mills to be found lower down the river than 
Tweed-mill, about three miles below the town of Coldstream ; for 
on account of the constant liability of the Tweed itself to rise and 
fall by floods, mill-leads are absolutely necessary, which, to give 
a proper fall, must be longer and more expensive, wherever the 
slope of the main channel is inconsiderable. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The particular formation to which 
the strata of this as well as of the neighbouring parishes belong 
is still a subject of doubt and farther inquiry. The mineralogical 
characters of its marls and soft red variegated sandstones, contain- 
ing, as they do in several parts, imbedded nodules and veins of 
gypsum, have led some to refer them to the new red sandstone se- 
ries, which is known to lie in other places considerably above the 
coal-field. Whilst, on the other hand, the apparent geological 
position of these rocks, and the occurrence of extensive fossil re- 
mains both in the sandstones and clay beds of the district, have 
induced others to consider them as subordinate to the carboniferous 
limestone, which is far below the coal-field. 

The strata which are prevalent in this parish are the following, 
and we name them in the order in which they seem to be most 
abundant: 1. White sandstone; 2. Clay marl; 3. Reddish sand- 
stone; 4. Limestone; 5. Gypsum. 

1. White sandstone is visible, and may be found chiefly, in the 
south parts of the parish. It runs in an E. N. E. and W. S. W. 
direction, crossing the Tweed a little below Fireburn-mill, and 
running down the north side of the Tweed towards Milne Graden. 
The line may be traced for many miles farther; and it forms a 
high cliff" on the banks of the Whitadder, below Claribad-mill. 
This white sandstone, being an excellent building stone, is worked 
in several parts of its course through Coldstream parish. It is 
quarried immediately to the north of the town of Colstream, as 
well as on Leet water on the west side of the town, and also on 
the Tweed, between the town and Coldstream-bridge. It is work- 
ed also near Lennel church, and again on Sir D. Milne's property, 
at the eastern extremity of the parish. The colour of the stone 



202 



HRRWICKSIIIUE. 



is a dusky-white. In texture it is compact, and does not readil}- 
yield to the weather. Of this stone, Sir D. Mihie built his man- 
sion-house on his estate of Milne Graden. The clergyman's 
manse, and several other neat dwelling-houses in the town of Cold- 
stream, are built of the same material. 

2. Perhaps, of the whole strata visible at the surface of Cold- 
stream parish, three-fourths are composed of clay and marl. The 
thickness of the beds is generally inconsiderable, though in 
some places it may be twenty or thirty feet. It is used in some 
parts, where it is more calcareous than in others, for spreading 
over the soil ; but the quantity of carbonate of lime in it is so 
trifling that very little benefit can be derived from the practice. 

3. The reddish sandstone, which, after the white sandstone and 
marl strata, is the most abundant rock in the parish, lies to the 
north of the white sandstone, and parallel with it and under it. The 
line probably runs through the Leet, about a mile above Cold- 
stream, Hirsel Law, and Simprin. It is quarried on the banks 
of the Leet, on the south side of Simprin farm, and still farther 
to the east ; but at the intermediate points it does not seem to 
have been sought for. 

There is another stratum of the same reddish sandstone still 
farther north, and running in the same direction as the former. 
To the east of Balchristie it may be seen crossing the Leet, where 
it is worked ; and again at Hawkslaw. This last kind of stone is 
used chiefly for drains, walls, and other farm purposes. 

4. The limestone which occurs in the district is rather an in- 
durated marl than the compact calcareous rock, which is worked 
as such in the coal measures and carboniferous limestone forma- 
tion. It consists of beds, which seldom exceed two feet, and are 
usually only three or four inches in thickness, alternating with 
the clay and marl. We have not heard of its ever having been 
burnt for economical purposes, though the same kind of rock was 
burnt a good many years ago at Marchmont in Polwarth parish. 

The whole of the strata above-described dip towards the S. E. 
under an angle not greater than 10°. Nearer the Lammermoor 
hills, the strata begin to rise with a greater angle, till at last, 
at the base of the hills, they are seen to rest on the greywacke 
series. 

5. The gypsum has been found in this parish only in small 

quantities. On tlic banks of the Leet, about half a-mife below 

the house of the Hirsel, it occurs in red nodules imbedded in the 

4 



COLDSTREAM. 



203 



blue clay ; and at Milne Graden, where coal was bored for some 
years since by Sir D. Milne, seams or thin veins of white gypsum 
were discovered in a similar situation. 

A considerable variety of fossil organic remains has been found 
buried and preserved among the strata of this district. These fos- 
sils consist both of vegetable impressions and entire stems. The 
former are found both in the sandstone, chiefly the yellowish or 
reddish kind, and sometimes in the thin beds of limestone or m- 
durated marl. The species to which these vegetable impressions 
belong are generally the same as those found in the coal-field 
and mountain limestone groups, such as equiseta, calamites, and 
lycopodites ; but the impressions hitherto observed appear to be 
smaller and less frequent than in the other formations alluded to. 
The discovery of the other and more interesting fossil remains, 
is in a great measure due to Henry Witham, Esq. of Lartington, 
whose zealous exertions in the cause of geology cannot be too 
highly commended, or too generally followed as an example. 
Though known to a few of the natives of the parish, who were 
accustomed to frequent the banks of the river seeking pebbles, 
these trees were never properly examined, till Mr Witham under- 
took the task.— But before stating the result of his investigations, 
we may mention the locality and position in which they are found. 
About half a-mile above Tweed-mill, on the north bank of the river, 
and near the water's edge, is a stratum of blue clay, which rises 
with an angle of about 5° towards the N. W. This stratum, near 
the river's edge, is surmounted by a bank probably 80 or 100 feet 
high, composed of alluvial soil, and various seams of sandstone, 
marl, and coarse limestone. Below the stratum is a thin seam of 
limestone. The stratum of clay in which the fossils are imbedded 
may be five or six feet in depth. Some of the stems are about 
the thickness of a man's body, but generally they are one-half of 
this size. No fragment has been found exceeding four or five feet 
in length. They are all lying disjointed and parallel with the bed, 
showing that they must have originally been deposited in a hori- 
zontal position. ' No small twigs or branches far less leaves 
are preserved. 

These trees are encrusted almost always with a black carbona- 
ceous matter resembling coal, which is of no greater thickness 
than what may have been that of the original bark. In short, 
this black envelope of coal seems to be the bark mineralized. 
When thrown into the fire, it burns clearly and rapidly. So 



204 



BEKWICKSIIIRE. 



far as we know there has been no chemical analysis of this coaly 
envelope. The following is the analysis of a tree found at the 
place now spoken of, taken from Mr Witham's paper : Carbo- 
nate of hme, 78; peroxide of iron, 17; protoxide of iron, 13; 
loss, 2 = 100 parts. 

The prevalence of lime in these petrifactions is usually ac- 
counted for by the gradual introduction of calcareous matter into 
the tree, from the calcareous clay enveloping it, as the internal 
parts decayed ; and we know that, on account of the greater dura- 
bility of the bark, the interior of a tree generally decays first. 
To such an extent have the decay and destruction of the ligneous 
parts taken place, and so complete has been the intrusion of cal- 
careous matter, that these fossil trees consist almost entirely of 
carbonate of lime, and very little of the woody fibre remains. 

It is of course chiefly by the examination of the remanent fibres 
that any hopes could be entertained of detecting the nature of 
these fossils. Recent investigations, for the commencement of 
which we are also in this respect indebted to Mr Witham, have 
proved that they belong to the genus Coniferae, to which class our 
Scotch firs belong. It was for a long time supposed that the larger 
fossil vegetables, now and then discovered in our coal-fields, were 
palms. But a transverse section of the palm tree shows no appear- 
ance of small reticulated fibres, or pith, or medullary rays, or concen- 
tricrings, denoting the annual growths such as those observed in 
sections of the Tweed-mill fossils. The interior of a palm consists 
only of a cellular tissue, with vascular fibres, having neither medullary 
rays nor concentricrings. And in the appearances thusexhibited by 
these fossils, there is a complete resemblance to various species of 
Coniferae now existing. There is only one point of difference, viz. 
the greater size in the fossils of the fibrous cells and extent of the 
annual growths, — facts attributable to the more favourable combi- 
nation of heat and moisture, which operated on the Flora of a for- 
mer period. 

This result of an internal examination of these fossils is fully 
confirmed by their external appearance. For, besides that many 
of the stems appear twisted and otherwise irregular in their shape, 
hke the Coniferae of the present epoch many of them bear the 
remains of branches, such as are never met with in palms. 

It has not yet been positively determined whether these trees have 
grown originally in the district where they are now deposited. In 

• Transactions of Newcastle Pliil. Soc. i. 



COLDSTREAM.

Other cases, this point can be determined by the presence of small 
twigs and leaves, which could not have been transported by water 
or otherwise without being destroyed. So far, therefore, as the 
non-appearance of these more delicate remains is any warrantable 
ground of inference, it is probable that the fossil trees at Tweed- 
mill may have been transported to their present site by water, 
beino- much in the same state as those immense accumulations 
of trees deposited at the mouths of the great American rivers. 

The extent of this fossil deposit has not been yet fully as- 
certained. It is only at the bank of the river where it is worn 
down by the action of the floods that they have been observed ; 
but it may be observed, that similar fossils have been noticed in 
other parts of the Tweed, both below Coldstream Bridge, and 
about Fireburn-mill, as well as in more distant parts of the 
county. 

The simple minerals are few in number Quartz crystals, cal- 
careous crystals, prehnite, in rolled pebbles in the channels of the 
Tweed, selenite, or sulphate of lime, the latter daily forming in 
the marl beds, are all that need here be noticed. 

There seem to be in this parish two kinds of alluvial deposit, 
covering the strata wherever a proper section can be seen. The 
lower and thicker deposit, which is composed of clay, is farther 
characterized by large boulders imbedded in it, which are gene- 
rally greenstone, basalt, or old red sandstone. This deposit is 
probably of diluvian origin. The upper alluvion, which is gene- 
rally not more than two or three feet deep, consists principally 
of small-grained gravel intermixed with sand. That both of 
these deposits have been formed by water there can be no doubt ; 
and as little doubt, that the violence of the currents which tran- 
sported the boulders, and formed the lower deposit, must have 
been much greater than that by which the upper subsoil was 
formed. 

It may be observed as a curious fact, that wherever the soil is 
turned up beyond a depth of three or four feet, immense quan- 
tities of thistles immediately spring up, and flourish in wild 
luxuriance. It is natural to suppose, though the fact has not 
been positively ascertained, that these plants can spring only 
from seed long since buried in the soil. But the question comes 
to be, how they could have been buried at such  a depth The 
seed, as they fall from their capsules, could not have sunk to that 
depth in the soil. How then can the fact be explained  The

only explanation which has occurred to us is the following : The 
natural effect of rains on the surface of a country is to wash down 
soil from the hills, and thus gradually fill the vallies and ele- 
vate the plains. May not the seed of plants have in this man- 
ner often been overwhelmed and buried so deeply in the soil as to 
be prevented from vegetating  This effect, we can see, might be 
easily produced by sudden Hoods, at a period when the rivers had 
not yet furrowed their way deeply into the earth's surface. Let 
us suppose that the low plains of the Pampas in South America, 
which are a wilderness of thistles, were to be overwhelmed with 
occasional floods, which should deposit a stratum of mud over 
them. The effect would of course be to bury the seeds to 
such a depth, as to render the process of vegetation, for which the 
influence of the air is needed, impossible. At a future period, 
when cultivation begins to adorn these dreary regioiis, posterity 
will perhaps wonder, on digging into the soil, to-see myriads of 
thistles immediately rush into existence. 

Zoology. — Many species of wild-fowl, which formerly frequented 
the Tweed, have entirely disappeared, — such as the coot, wild- 
duck, diver, and teal. This is to be accounted for, partly from the 
greater population on the banks of the river, partly from the fre- 
quency of poaching in the river for salmon, and partly from 
the drainage of those marshy lands in which these birds used to 
breed. Swallows, likewise, are by no means so numerous as they 
once were, which may be referred to the same cause, as insects, 
such as those on which they feed, are much more plentiful in 
marshy or fenny districts. Wild-swans have been shot in the pa- 
rish ; and a gentleman some years ago succeeded in killing a great 
northern diver from Hudson's Bay. A very fine specimen of night 
heron {Ardea nycticorax, was shot a few years ago by the Earl 
of Home, by whom it was presented to the Museum of the Edin- 
burgh University. Pike of a very large size, sometimes weighing 
upwards of 32 lbs. are caught in the lake at Hirsel ; and the Earl 
of Home killed a salmon which weighed 50 lbs. 

Botany. — In a district so highly cultivated, it is not to be ex- 
pected that the botanist will find much to interest him, or engage 
his attention. Indeed, were it not for the Tweed and the Leet, 
the lakes of Hirsel and Lithtillum, — with some at present un- 
cultivated ground in the north of the parish, we should be afraid 
that the few plants that we have left would disappear. Lactuca 
virosa, which has of late got much into repute for medicinal pur- 
poses, is found in abundance on the steep banks of the Tweed, 



COLDSTREAM.

below the old church of Lennel. Iberis amara and Senecio tenui- 
folius, have likewise been found, although not mentioned in any 
Flora of the district. Tragopagon majus, which has been only re- 
cently noticed as a native of this country, is found in the Hirsel 
grounds, and near Lennel-hill. It is distinguished from the com- 
mon species T. pratense, by the calyx being longer than the ray 
of the corolla,— by the peduncles, in place of tapering, becoming 
thicker above, — and by the smaller and more delicate habit of the 
plant. 

I have been furnished, by a very skilful and enthusiastic bota- 
nist, Dr John Hutton Balfour, with a list of the Phenogamic 
and Cryptogamic plants, of which he enumerates 697 different 
species.  

From the retentive nature of the soil, the larch does not thrive 
so well as in other districts ; but the oak, birch, and elm, thrive 
-well, — some being found on the estate of Milne Graden above 
eleven feet in circumference. There are extensive plantations of 
very thriving timber on the estate of Hirsel, a large proportion of 
which has been planted by the present Earl of Home. 

H. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — Stone coffins have been found in different parts 
of the parish, and likewise great quantities of human bones, par- 
ticularly in the grounds of Hirsel, and at the junction of the Tweed 
and Leet, where the Abbey was situate. These are, in all proba- 
bility, the ashes of men who wer-e distinguished for noble birth 
and for military prowess, as it is matter of historical record, that 
the Lady Abbess had the bodies of the most distinguished warriors 
who fell on the disastrous field of Flodden conveyed to Coldstream, 
and interred in the burial-ground of the abbey. There are still to 
be found on the barony of Snook the remains of a fortification, 
which was probably constructed after the use of cannon. Tradition 
speaks of Maxwell's Cross, which stood about a century ago, be- 
tween Lennel church and Tweed-mill, f 

It is well known that General Monk, before the restoration of 
Charles H., raised here the regiment of foot-guards which still 
bears the name of the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish records, the earliest of which 
is dated 1690, and which have been all along kept with accuracy, 
prove the existence of villages, of which not ii vestige now remains. 

■ The list is inserted in the MS. 

A few years ago, several old coins were discovered at Milne Graden, chiefly 
Scotch, struck in the reign of the Jiinies'. They are now in Mr Milne's possession.

BERWICKSHIRE. 



Mention is made of Graden, situate in the N. E. part of the pa- 
rish, which probably contained about forty families. There was 
also the village of Parkend, hardly less considerable in size, about 
half a century ago; and it is well known that there was once a consi - 
derable village beside the old church of Lennel, although nothing 
but the ruins of the church remain to mark the site of the village. 

Eminent Men. — Within the walls of that church is the burying- 
place of Patrick Brydone, Esq. author of a Tour in Sicily and 
Malta, who resided for many years in Lennel House, the seat of 
the Earl of Haddington. 

Modern Buildings. — After Mr Brydone's death, a new mansion 
was erected by the noble proprietor; besides which, there are the 
seats of the Earl of Home at the Hirsel ; Sir William Marjori- 
banks at the Lees ; Sir David Milne at Milne Graden ; and Pro- 
fessor Russell at Castlelaw ; — all built of freestone, of which there 
are quarries of excellent quality in different parts of the parish.

Population in 1801, - - - 2269

While the villages of Graden, Snook, and Parlend existed, the 
population was much more diffused over the parish than at present. 
By a list of the population, taken with great care in 1830, it ap- 
pears, that in the landward part there were 192 families, and in the 
town 504; while in 1786, there were 189 and 305 families in these 
respectively. By that hst, the whole population of the parish was 
3003, which is upwards of 100 more than appears by the census of 
1831. The number resident in the town was found to be 2020, 
and in the country 983. 

It is impossible to give any correct statement of the average 
number of births in the parish each year, as scarcely any of the 
dissenters think of inserting the births of their children in the pa- 
rish register,— though the fees of registration are very trifling, 
and in cases of poverty, not exacted. But the average number of 
births that have been registered during the last seven years is 40 ; 
of marriages in the same time, 21 ; of deaths, 54.

In the parish there are six persons insane, 3 blind, and 2 deaf 
and dumb. 

Land-owners.— ThQxe are no noblemen or gentlemen of inde- 
pendent fortune resident in the parish except those already men- 
tioned. The other principal landed proprietors are. Sir Hugh

ter; Mr Mason; and Mr Williamson. 

Character and Habits of the People. — Education may be said to 
be universal in the parish, — at least I believe that very few have 
attained the age of fifteen who are unable to read. This, of course, 
serves to raise both the intellectual and moral powers of the peo- 
ple, — although, from the local situation of Coldstream, vice in some 
of its worst shapes exists to a considerable extent. The greater 
part of the immorality of the people may be traced to smuggling, 
for which there are great facilities, and temptations too strong to 
be easily resisted. The difference of duty on each gallon of whisky 
in England is 4. While this continues, the severity of legal pe- 
nalties, and the power of moral and religious instruction, may mi- 
tigate, as they have done of late, but they will not be able com- 
pletely to eradicate this demoralizing practice. Poaching, the 
concomitant of smuggling, is also prevalent, both in game and in 
the salmon fisheries : it is very hurtful to the industrious habits of 
the people, and trains them to the commission of other crimes. 

From the session-records it appears there have been eight ille- 
gitimate births during the last three years in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The number of acres in the parish unoccupied 
by wood is 8100; all of which are under cultivation. It is not 
easy to specify the number of acres under wood, but the value of 
the timber has been estimated at about L. 18,000. The greater 
part of the wood is on the Hirsel estate, and it is managed with 
veiy great care by the noble proprietor. The principal kinds of 
trees planted are, ash, beech, elm, larch, oak, plane, Scotch fir, and 
spruce, most of which grow to a large size. 

RentofLand.~The rental of the parish being within a trifle of 
L. 12,000, the average rent of land may be taken at L. 1, 10s., 
which, from the present low prices of most kinds of agricultural 
produce, must certainly be reckoned its full value. Unless some 
change, indeed, shall take place, more favourable to the interests 
of the farmer, it is not likely that land will bring such a high rent 
upon the expiry of the present leases. 

Hushandry.~li cannot be said with truth that there is any de- 
fect m the management of land ; for the farmers are almost all 
men of capital and enterprise, and possess great skill in their 
calhng : The land is therefore in a high state of cultivation, and 
great improvements have been introduced of late years, particu- 
larly ni draining and enriching the soil. Turnip husbandry is car-

vied on to a great extent, and bone-dust has been applied with most 
beneficial results. But, as all kinds of soil are to be found in the 
parish, the attention of the farmer has been directed to the cultiva- 
tion of all sorts of grain. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen or twenty-one years, 
and the rents are, I believe, in almost every instance paid in money. 
The lands are all well-enclosed, and the farm-offices are for the 
most part substantial and convenient, particularly those on the Hir- 
sel estate, which are very commodious and suitable. 

Breeds of Live-StocL— The short-horn or Tees-water breed of 
cattle is that which is most admired in this district, and as the 
greatest care is taken to have the stock as pure as possible, they 
often reach a great weight. Highland cattle are likewise purchased 
at the great annual fairs, and fattened for the market. Very few 
sheep are to be found except the Leicester and Cheviot breeds; 
the former of which, in particular, are selected with great care, not 
only as regards the weight of the carcase, but also the fineness o£ 
the wool. The exertions of the late WiUiam Robertson, Esq. of 
Ladykirk, contributed most essentially to the improvement of all 
kinds of stock, and gave to this quarter of Berwickshire its present 
high reputation for breeding and grazing. 

Bate of Wages.— The \ysiges of common labourers are 9s. a-week; 
but farm-servants are paid in kind, receiving 10 bolls of oats, 3 of 
barley, and 1 of beans or pease, with L. 3 in money, with leave to 
keep poultry, or an allowance in money ; also land for hnt and po- 
tatoes, and the grazing of a cow throughout the year. Carpenters 
and other mechanics receive, upon an average, 12s. a-week. 
. Quarries and Mines. -Qntxvvies of freestone have been opened 
in different parts of the parish; but none of these are worked at 
present, except on the estates of Hirsel, Milne Graden, and 
Lees, besides one in the immediate vicinity of the town. The stone 
is of most excellent quality, and beautifully white, so that the 
houses have a neat, clean, and comfortable appearance. 

Fisheries.— The salmon fisheries were formerly very productive; 
but of late they have afforded a very small recompense to the dif- 
ferent tacksmen. This is partly owing to the prevalence of poach- 
in-, and partly, it is alleged, to the means that are adopted at the 
mouth of the river to prevent the passage of the fish upwards ; at 
least complaints on this subject are very general. The rent of the 
thlL may be stated at L. 100 a-year. Bailiffs are appointed to 
prevent the fish from being disturbed at improper times. 
 ProduccThe average gross amount andvaUie of raw produce

raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, on an averao-e 
of the seven years preceding Martinmas 1 833, was L.28,182 a-year. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — There is a weekly corn-market in Coldstream; and 
likewise a monthly market for the sale of sheep and cattle, which 
is well attended, and where a great deal of first rate stock is an- 
nually exposed for sale. The only village in the parish is the New- 
town of Lennel, so called in opposition to the original village of 
Lennel, where the church formerly stood. 

Means of Communication. — The mail-curricle to London and 
Edinburgh passes through the town every day; besides which, 
there is a daily post to all the towns in the neighbouring counties. 
There are twenty-two miles of parish roads, and eight miles of turn- 
pike roads, which are travelled by three coaches from Edinburgh 
to Newcastle, and two between Kelso and Berwick. There is a 
very handsome bridge of five arches across the Tweed, and one of 
one arch across the Leet, at the south and west entrances to the 
town. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is conveniently situate for 
the greater part of the parish, although it is nearly 5 miles from 
the eastern, 3 miles from the northern, and 1 miles from the 
western extremity of the parish. It was built in 1795, is in good 
repau', and was intended to accommodate upwards of 1100 sitters. 
Being built by the heritors alone, it is their property, and conse- 
quently no rent is paid by any of the people. 

Upon the death of the late incumbent in 1830, the heritors re- 
solved to build a new manse, according to a plan furnished by Mr 
Hamdton of Edinburgh; it was completed in 1832, and is acknow- 
ledged to be the neatest and most commodious manse in Berwick- 
shire. Nothing, indeed, could exceed the kindness of the heritors, 
or their anxiety to secure the comfort of the clergyman. Includ- 
ing the site of the manse and garden, the extent of the glebe is 
about 1 1 i acres, and its annual value may be stated at L. 50. The 
stipend is 16 chalders, in equal proportions of meal and barley, 
with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There are two meeting-houses in the town, one belonging to the 
United Associate Synod of the Secession church, the other to the 
Relief synod. The stipend given to the clergyman of the former 
denomination is L. 150, with a house and garden ; to the other 
L. 1 1 5. ' 

There are 242 families in the parish that attend the Established 
church, besides a few from England; 155 families attend the Se- 



212 BERWICKSHIRE. 

cession meeting-house ; and 55 the Rehef. Many from other pa- 
rishes, and also from England, attend the dissentmg placesot wor- 
ship. Divine service is attended with great regularity both at the 
Established church and at the two chapels. During the last three 
years, the average number of communicants at the Established 

church has been 560. , . , • i at f 

Educatio7i.- There are seven schools m the pansh. Most 
of them are well attended, and the ordinary branches are taught, 
except at the grammar-school and a private academy, where the 
pupils are prepared for the University. Of late the number of 
children at the parish school has greatly increased ; they now ave- 
rage upwards of 120 during the year. The salary is the maxi- 
mum ; and the fees for reading, writing, and arithmetic, are 3s. a 
quarter, with a proportional increase for other branches,-being 
considerably less than the fees of most of the other schools. The 
school-house has been recently enlarged, whereby the comfojt of 
the teacher and pupils has been greatly promoted. The school- 
fees average between L. 70 and L. 80 a-year.  . , , 
A sum of L. 500 was left nearly thirty years ago by the late 
Mr John Bell of Berwick, the interest of which is apphed for the 
education of poor children in the town of Coldstream ; and the in- 
terest of L. 300, also left by the same charitable mdmdual, is ex- 
pended in furnishing the children of the poor with cbthes when 
Cleave schooh There is a Sabbath school connected with every 
place of worship ; and the effects of this increased facility of acquir- 
ing el g-us insUction are visible in the orderly conduct of the 
young, and their respect for the ordinances of rehgion. There i

any of tlie people deposit money in the bank at Dunse, which is

A female Society was established some years ago for affording 
relief to the sick, and to the poor during winter. It is hberally 
supported, and has been productive of great benefit to the class of 
the community in whose behalf it was founded. The annual amount 
of contributions is upwards of L. 60. A Religious Society in con- 
nection with the Estabhshed church has been lately formed. It 
is well supported, and promises to be very beneficial in supplying 
Bibles, &amp;c. to the poor. There are likewise two Societies con- 
nected with the dissenting meeting-house, for religious and chari- 
table purposes ; of the success of which I have no means of furnish- 
ing any accurate or satisfactory information. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — It is a peculiar feature in the his- 
tory of our country, that the nearer we approach to England, we 
invariably find the poor rates increase, and the people louder in 
their demands for parochial rehef ; so that, while in some districts 
of the Highlands it is reckoned almost a disgrace to receive assist- 
ance from the parish, on the borders, the poor insist upon it as a 
right, and never regard it as a degradation. Hence, in Coldstream, 
the assessment for the poor is very heavy, amounting to nearly L. 700 
a year, including incidental expenses. For the last seven years, the 
average number on the poor's roll has been 109; but at present it 
is rather decreasing, and there is reason to hope that, by a proper 
system of management, a great diminution may take place, without 
treating the paupers with less kindness, but by exercising proper 
watchfulness, and endeavouring to prevent strangers who are likely 
to become paupers from acquiring a settlement ; for it is a remark- 
able fact, that there are at present only thirty-eight of those who re- 
ceive relief, natives of the parish, and sixteen were born in England. 
The average weekly allowance may be stated at Is. 6d. to each 
person, and in very few cases does it exceed 2s. The whole sum 
requisite for supporting the poor is raised by assessment in equal 
proportions upon the landlord and tenant. The collections at the 
church door average 12s. a-week, and are left by the heritors under 
the management of the kirk-session, who are thus enabled to relieve 
many who are thrown into temporary difficulties. By this arrange- 
ment the legal assessment is prevented from becoming higher. It 
is to be regretted, that the same praiseworthy practice is not uni- 
versally followed; for it is very short-sighted pohcy to insist upon 
half of the church collections being applied to the relief of regu- 
lar paupers, with the view of diminishing the assessment.

Prisons. — There is a lock-up-house in the town, in which the 
baron baillie has power to confine for a short time persons who 
have been guilty of small offences, and where those charged with 
greater crimes are kept previous to their being sent to the county jail. 

Inns, 8fc. — The number of inns, public-houses, and shops where 
spirits are sold in the parish is thirty-two, — which certainly far ex- 
ceeds what is requisite, and is by no means favourable to the morals 
of the people, especially under the present very low price of whisky. 

Fuel. — Coal is the only kind of fuel used in the parish, of which 
it was calculated, when a railway was proposed between Kelso and 
Berwick, that 5667 tons are annually consumed. It is brought 
from the English colUeries, which are distant from seven to ten 
miles, and costs about 6d. per cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It may be remarked in general, that the system of agriculture 
pursued in this parish is not inferior to that of the best districts of 
Scotland, and that, if farm produce brought a remunerating price, 
which of late years it has not done, the present spirited tenantry 
would be enabled to carry on draining and liming to a greater ex- 
tent : and improvements would be greatly facilitated, were the rail- 
way executed, which was projected a few years ago between Ber- 
wick and Kelso. 

Three things seem requisite for promoting the happiness and 
morals of the people : \st, A complete change in the excise laws, 
regarding the price of whisky, whereby the duty may be equa- 
lized in Scotland and England : 2c, A change in the present 
system of game laws, by which a check may be put to poaching : 
3f, A change in the law of marriage in Scotland ; for, as the law 
at present stands, a declaration of the parties before two witnesses, 
constitutes a marriage. Hence persons in England, where marriage 
is regarded as a religious ceremony, which must be performed by 
a clergyman of the Established church, very frequently come to 
Coldstream and other border parishes, and are married by persons 
of the lowest and most worthless character, who, it is said, perform 
a religious ceremony in mockery of every thing sacred, and give 
the parties a certificate that they had declared themselves married 
persons. This led to the custom of persons in Scotland getting 
themselves married in the same irregular way ; and although few 
comparatively belonging to Coldstream are now guilty of this 
breach of church law, yet many from other parishes are married at 
Coldstream bridge.

PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN GIFFORD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — Nenthorn was anciently called Nai- 
thansthirn ; a word which the writer' of the former Statistical Ac- 
count derives from some remarkable thorn trees formerly existing in 
the parish. It has a more probable connection with two singular 
ranges of rock called the Meikle and Little Thairn, about half-a 
mile from the church on the banks of the Eden, — places once noted 
in the district as haunts of superstition. The prefix appears to 
be the name of some person or object; but the etymology is quite 
uncertain. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is of an irregular out- 
line, somewhat resembling a sand-glass, or the figure 8, being 
nearly divided in the middle by Roxburghshire on the east and 
west : and tracing a line from one extremity to the other, it extends 
to about four and a-half miles in length, by not more than two at 
the widest part. Owing to the peculiar form, however, the ac- 
tual area is but 5 square miles, or 3400 English acres. It is 
bounded on the north by Earlstoun ; on the east by Stitchel and 
Ednam; Kelso on the south; and Smailholm on the west, on which 
side it has the small stream of the Eden as its boundary for three 
miles. The position lengthwise, is from north-west to south-east, 
with a gradual but undulating declivity from a rocky ridge of hill 
across the northern part to within a mile and a-half of the town 
of Kelso. These undulations, six or seven in number, at distances 
of less than half a-mile, stretch from east to west parallel with 
the Tweed, till they are lost in the flat of the river. Through the 
first and largest of the series, the stream of the Eden has forced 
its way, leaving the eastern bank a wall of bare and precipitous 
rocks a hundred feet high ; while, on the western side, the ground 
slopes with easy ascent to its original elevation. 

Meteorology. — The mean temperature of the atmosphere for

Marcli, . 42 June, . 61 

Geology. — The ridge referred to, and rocks, which in a few 
places protrude through the soil, are whinstone or trap, and 
coarse red sandstone. The latter is to be met with only at two 
or three points; but from its showing itself on the north and south 
sides of the hill of Blinkbonny near the base, and on the same 
level, it is probable that the masses of trap along the whole ridge 
are superincumbent on freestone. The trap rocks are green- 
stone intermixed with trap tufa and basalt. The basalt is beau- 
tifully arranged in pentagonal and hexagonal columns, nearly ver- 
tical, and very similar to those on Arthur's Seat. 

Botany. — This department presents nothing very interesting ; 
but among the more or less common plants may be mentioned, — 
Dianthus deltoides, Orchis Morio, Orchis latifolia, Fedia olitoria, 
Echium vulgare, Saxifraga granulata, Comarum palustre Malva 
moschata, Malva rotundijblia, Teucrium Scorodonia, Convolvulus ar~

Historical Notices. — At a remote period, the parish appears to 
have been the property of the De Morvilles, constables of Scotland. 

Previous to 1316, it had passed into the hands of William De 
Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrew's, including the chapel of Little 
Newton, the site of which is now occupied as a burial-place by the 
Newton Don family. On the 6th March of that year, the Abbot 
of- Kelso obtained possession of these properties in exchange for 
the church of Cranston in Mid-Lothian, due regard being had in 
the transaction to the losses which Naithansthirn had sustained by 
the wars. A pendicle of the parish was given about the end of the 
same century to the monks of Kelso, to pray for the souls of the 
Earls of Douglas. The village was again burnt by the Duke of 
Norfolk in October 1542. 

Land-owners. — The landed properties in the order of their valu- 
ation, are, Newton Don, the property of Sir William Don, Bart. ; 
Nenthorn, belonging to James Roy, Esq.; a portion belonging to 
George Baillie, Esq. of Jerviswood ; another to His Grace the ' 
Duke of Roxburghe; and a small part to Sir John Pringle of Stit- 
chel, Bart.

Family Seats.— In the south-east angle of the parish is situated 
the fine mansion of Newton Don, and the extensive and richly or- 
namented policy connected with it, commanding one of the loveliest 
prospects on the Tweed,— near to which, the Eden is suddenly 
precipitated over a ledge of rock, from thirty to forty feet perpen- 
dicular. Here are preserved some ancient rehcs of the Earls of 
Glencairn, noticed in the early history of the church, of which 
noble house Sir William Don is now the representative. The 
only other mansion in the parish is that of Mr Roy, formerly the 
residence of the Kerrs of Littledean, a branch of the family of 
Roxburghe. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of proclamations of marriage 
begins in 1702, and of baptisms in 1715. The deaths of every 
tenth year are marked from 1740 to 1780, and after that regular- 
ly every year till 1800. 

III. — Population. 
From the register of baptisms, the population in 1720 and 1730 
appears to have been at least double its present amount, the bap- 
tisms of these two years being equal in number to those of the 
seven years ending with 1833. The population was 



In 1755, according to Dr Webster, - 497 

1 790, ascertained to be - - 376 

1801, by the Government Census, - 395 

1811, - - - - 398 

1821, 393 

1831, 380 



The causes of the decline of the population since the middle of 
last century have been, — the decay and ultimate extinction of the 
villages at Nenthorn and Newton, as also the junction of small 



farms, and more lately, emigration to Canada.

Character and Habits of the People. — There being no village 
now, with the exception of a few cottages on Mr Baillie's proper- 
ty, the population is almost wholly agricultural, and partakes of 
the general habits of that class ; but the local attachments are not 
strong. Not a single farmer in the parish is a native of it. The 



218 



BEllWICKSIIIllE. 



majority of the people are migratory, — the farm-servants, or hinds, 
as they are called, frequently changing masters, and passing from 
one parish to another. Their morals are generally good. There 
is no prevailing disease ; and the people are healthy, — the climate 
salubrious. The parish schoolmaster has done the duty of his de- 
partment, with but little interruption, for fifty-four years ; and the 
late incumbent who died in January last was only the third in suc- 
cession since 1696.

About one-half of the wood is full-grown, and the rest in a 
thriving condition. The kinds are, Scotch fir, larch, ash, beech, 
lime, oak, chesnut, sycamore, elm, poplar, maple, &amp;c. The larch 
is an increasing favourite, but on heavy soils it is liable to rot in 
the heart after it has attained a height of forty feet. 

Description of Soil, Src. — The northern part consists chiefly of 
a wet reddish clay on a retentive bottom, interspersed with con- 
siderable portions of good dry turnip soil. The southern section is 
more in the vale of the Tweed, and partakes of the richer qualities 
of that neighbourhood, being a mixture of clay and gravelly loam. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry is the ordinary rotation 
observed in the counties of Berwick and Roxburgh, viz.  in wheat 
and barley, | in oats, j in turnips and potatoes, or fallow, and | 
in hay and pasture. The farmers, however, labour under great 
disadvantage in point of locality, there being neither coal nor 
lime within fifteen or twenty miles, and the distance being still 
greater to the nearest sea-port, with an uunavigable river, — and no 
rail-road or canal. The drawback, therefore, on the produce 
sent to market is very considerable. Nevertheless, several of the 
farms are in a high state of improvement, and all of them nearly 
as well improved as circumstances will admit Bone manure has 
been applied to the turnip-soils with complete success. The rule is 
to lay two quarters on an English acre, — the article being pur- 
chased at Berwick, twenty-two miles distant, for L. 1 or L. 1, Is. 
per quarter. 

Jle7it. — The rental is L. 4100, inclusive of the returns of the 
valuable grass parks of Nenthorn and Newton Don, annually let 
by public roup. Eight hundred acres are rented at L. 2 per acre ; 



NENTHORN. 219 

and the rest vary from L. 1, 10s. to 15s. 6d. The farms are let 
on leases of twenty-one years, at fixed rents, usually of L. 400 or 
L. 500 each, and in no instance depending on the fiar prices. 

Waes.— The farm-servants occupy houses provided for them 
on the farm by their employer, with a small patch of garden-ground 
attached to each. They receive their wages, partly in money, de- 
signated sheep-money, and partly in oatmeal, barley, pease, and 
potatoes. A cow's grass is allowed in summer, and straw for fod- 
der in winter. A sufficient quantity of coals also is carried at the 
farmer's expense, but the servant pays the original price at the 
coal-pit. The annual income of the hind, including all his pri- 
vileges, is about L. 25, or, in years when grain is high priced, 
L. 30. But, on the other hand, he is obliged at his own cost to 
keep a female servant, who is liable to be called for by the farmer 
at a busy season, or in cases of emergency, to aid in forwarding 
the field-labour. This person has to shear in harvest for the 
house-rent; at other times she is paid lOd. a-day when employed. 
This species of service is denominated the Bondage, and the indi- 
vidual appointed to it the Bondager. 

The hind's privileges are thus specified : — house and yard ; 
coals driven ; cow's grass in summer, and fodder in winter ; ten 
bolls of oats or oatmeal ; ten firlots of barley ; four to six firlots of 
pease; 1000 to 1500 yards of potato-drill; a peck's sowing of 
lint, or L. 1 in heu ; L. 3 to L. 4 of money. Ordinary maid- 
servants have L. 5 wages in summer, and L. 2 in winter. Men 
engaged at day-labour receive Is. 8d. per diem. 

Before the harvest sets in, Irish shearers arrive annually in great 
numbers, by whom chiefly the crops are cut down. Formerly 
hands were obtained from the Highlands of Scotland ; but these, 
unable to cope with those of the sister island in lowness of wages, 
or from some other cause, have disappeared for many years past, 
and left the others in undisputed possession. They usually work 
for 10s., 12s., and 14s. a-week, with victuals, — the materials of 
dinner being invariably, all over the district, a good wheaten loaf 
of 16 oz. or 18 oz. weight, and an ordinary-sized bottle of beer. 
Ten hours a-day is the specified time for labour. 

Fences and Di'ains. — There are stone walls around some of the 
old grass enclosures, but hedges are almost universally in use. 
They are planted with a ditch about three feet deep and five feet 
wide ; cost 3s. per rood, including the temporary paling for protec- 
tion ; and are never, when properly attended to, suffered to grow

more than four feet high. Drains leading to the fence-ditch arc 
rapidly spreading in every direction where they are needed, and 
promise to add greatly to the value of the soil. These are cut 
three feet deep, filled two-thirds with broken stones, and cost a 
shilling per rood. 

Progress of Improvement. — Forty years ago the rental was just 
'a half of what it is at present. Considerable tracts of ground, which 
were then unenclosed and disfigured with furze and heath, are now 
under the ordinary routine of crop-bearing with the rest of the 
lands. An aged person, who lived in the parish as a farm-servant 
seventy-two years since, informs the writer of this account that there 
was then scarcely a fence to be seen. On an eligible spot sheep 
were penned for a sufficient time to prepare the ground for crop, 
when it was torn up by a ponderous plough drawn by four horses 
and as many oxen, yoked two and two a-breast. Grey oats were 
sown on the same place two or three years successively ; then pease 
and beans, or barley ; after which, it was left a prey to weeds, or 
lay naked and barren, till restored in some measure by the lapse 
of time. There was no such thing as a turnip or potatoe heard of 
except in gardens. A considerable part of the Nenthorn estate 
was let at 2s. 6d. per acre. Men-servant's wages were L. 2, 10s. 
the half year; women's, L. 1. Day-labourers got 6d. to 8d. per 
day. A good horse brought a price of L. 5 or L. 6 ; a cow, L. 5. 
Good rough sheep were worth 10s. 7s. and 5s. each.

Live-Stoch — At Martinmas, the cattle of one year old and up- 
wards may be reckoned at 260, chiefly the short-horned breed. 
At Whitsunday there are about 2000 sheep and lambs, chiefly of 
the Leicester breed. Besides these, 60 scores of sheep, or there- 
by, are fed on turnips for a month or two in winter at 4d. per liead 
per week, or L. 4 per acre. A cow's pasturage for the summer is 
L. 5, and a sheep's for the year 7s. There are 110 horses of all 
descriptions ; and, upon an average, 220 pigs, half and full-grown,

the improved breed. The caverage value of a good draught-horse 
is L. 30. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, and Means of Communication.— The nearest market 
and post-town is Kelso, four miles distant from the church, which 
is in the centre ; but much of the farm produce is sold at Dalkeith 
or Berwick, to which places there are good roads, whence the carts 
return with coals, lime, or bone-dust. Within the last forty years 
the roads have been greatly improved. Two bridges have been 
thrown over the Eden, which had formerly to be forded on foot or 
horseback, often at much risk. Old parishioners remember well 
when there was scarcely any passage for wheel-carriages from Nen- 
thorn to Kelso in wet weather, whereas the same course is now 
travelled over daily by a stage-coach at the rate of eight or nine 
miles per hour. A private post delivers letters and newspapers 
every day, — the former at the charge of Id. ; the latter, free. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which was built in 1802 on 
a very contracted scale, is disgracefully situated at a place where 
two roads meet, without enclosure of any sort, and without a bell. 
It inconveniently accommodates 140 sitters, including the private 
galleries of Sir W. Don and Mr Roy of Nenthorn. The church- 
yard, where the old church stood, is at a considerable distance, em- 
bosomed among trees in a sequestered spot by the side of the Eden. 
The teinds are valued and exhausted ; and the living, all derived 
from the teinds, has varied from L. 220 to L. 135. Of late years 
the average is barely the minimum. It is paid, one-half in money, 
and the other in wheat, barley, oats, and pease, according to the 
fiar prices. The glebe consists of rather more than 7 acres, and 
is worth L. 22 a year of rent. A suitable new manse is in the 
course of erection ; the old one, built more than a century ago, and 
which had undergone various mutations, having become unfit for 
use or repair. This, with the office-houses and garden attached, 
occupies half an acre more, apart from the glebe. 

Till 1776 this parish belonged to the presbytery of Lauder or 
Earlstoun, but at that date it was detached by act of Assembly, and 
annexed to that of Kelso, as being more convenient. 

Of the population, 49 famihes belong to the Established church, 
and 19 to the Secession and Relief bodies. There are also 1 Ca- 
meronian and 1 Episcopalian. The communicants in the parish 
church average from 90 to 100. By the great majority of the 
people Christian ordinances are duly appreciated, and the public 



BERWICKSHIRE. 

iorms of religion are rarely neglected, even in those cases where its 
power is little felt. 

Education. — There is one parish-school, in which are taught 
reading, writing, and accounts. The average number attending for 
the year is 30. The schoolmaster's salary is L. 25, with house 
and garden. The probable yearly amount of fees actually paid to 
the teacher is L. 7, 10s. and his other emoluments do not exceed 
L. 2. All above six years of age can read. 

Poor. — The regular poor average about 7 in number, most of 
whom reside in other parishes, but have their claim here. Provi- 
sion on a small scale is made for their relief by collections in the 
church after public worship on the Lord's day ; but they are chiefly 
aided by a compulsory poor-rate, amounting to L. 20 a year. One 
shilling per week is the usual allowance to a pauper. 

Inns. — Ale and ardent spirits are sold at a toll-house ; other- 
wise there is no inn in the parish. 

Fuel. — Half a century ago, peat from the Lurgie Loch and the 
•moors of Gordon was the principal fuel, and many of the cottagers 
had their stacks of dried whins for winter use. At present every 
one is furnished with coals, brought from Lothian or Northumber- 
berland, a distance of twenty miles, at a cost of lOd. per cwt. in- 
cluding purchase, draught, and other expenses. Li addition to 
coal many use wood for convenience or comfort, which may be had 
at from 3s. to 6s. per cart-load, according to quality and distance.

PRESBYTERY OE DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE ilEV. GEORGE M'LEAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish extends from E. N. E. to W. 
S. W., 5 miles in length by 1 in breadth on an average ; and is 
nearly rectangular. Of course, its superficial extent may be about 
7 square miles or 4800 acres. It is bounded by the parish of 
Greenlaw on the west ; Polwarth on the north-west ; Edrom on 
the north and east ; Swinton on the south-east ; and Eccles on 
south and south-west. The small river of Blackadder, which en- 
ters the parish from the west, intersects it for about half its length, 
and then becomes the boundary between it and Edrom. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish may be 
described as consisting of two long parallel ridges of small eleva- 
tion, separated by the river, — the northmost commencing at a small 
rivulet which runs through a. narrow marsh and separates it from 
Polwarth, — the south ridge sloping gradually into a level of consi- 
derable breadth. The higher ground, which is a deep black loam, 
is considered most valuable and productive ; the low and flat ground 
being thinner and having a tilly and stiff bottom. The highest 
ground may be 100 feet above the sea. 

Meteorology. — On this head it may be only mentioned that, as 
the parish lies about two miles south of Langton-edge, which is the 
commencement of the Lammermoor range, there are frequent 
showers upon that range, while there are none in this parish; but, 
from the nature of the soil, which is retentive of moisture, the pa- 
rish is less injured by summer's drought than many other places. It 
suffers more from a wet than a dry season. It may be also mention- 
ed, that the winds which prevail here are chiefly from the north 
and east in the spring, with cold and chilling fogs or rain ; during 
the rest of the year, the winds generally range from south to north- 
west. A violent gale from the south-west is almost always accom- 



224 BERWICKSIirilE. 

panied with a flood in Tweed, though there be not a drop of rain 
here ; but in a few days after, rain frequently succeeds. 

Hydrography and Geology. — The water in the springs of this 
parish is of a hard quality, and does not readily dissolve soap. 
The people, therefore, endeavour to obtain rain-water for washing. 
Some of these springs taste a little of sulphur or iron. — The only 
river in the parish is the Blackadder. The dark colour of the water 
of this river is owing to the marshy ground in the parishes of Long- 
formacus, Westruther, and Greenlaw, where this river and the small 
streams that feed it take their rise ; and it may be owing to this 
that salmon never enter it ; or if they do, die, it is said, in a few 
days. It produces, however, eels and excellent trout, red and firm- 
fleshed, resembling those of Eden-water, which joins the' Tweed 
three miles below Kelso. The Eden rises also in a marshy dis- 
trict, which may be the cause of this similarity of the fish. The 
river Blackadder, after leaving Fogo, joins the Whitadder, about 
six miles to the east, at Allanton, in the parish of Edrom, and the 
united streams enter the Tweed three miles above Berwick. 

The Blackadder flows over a bed of coarse gravel and large 
stones, and in many places over strata of bastard whin and lime- 
stone, which are raised from two to six inches thick, and make 
excellent covers for open drains and conduits. As there are 
many perpendicular fissures in these strata, they are easily raised 
by wedges and sledge -hammers. 

The banks of the river are seldom steep ; and are ploughed to 
within a few yards of the stream ; but, where they are steep and 
nearly perpendicular, there appear alternate beds of the bastard 
whin and till, or of till mixed with clay or marl, — the strata in- 
clining towards the east or south-east. There are found under 
these perpendicular projections large pieces of petrified moss in- 
dicating lime, — but there are no quarries or mines of any descrip- 
tion wrought at present in the parish. The only one of freestone 
is exhausted, and the upper part of it was of bad quality. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — The history of the pai-ish is little known, 
and furnishes nothing of importance. Redpath, in his Border 
History, says, that in a charter of confirmation given at Rox- 
burgh, anno 1159, by Malcolm IV. to the convent of Kelso, 
are included nine or ten churches granted by subjects, — among 
which churches there are Fogo, with one ploughgate of land, and 
Hume, with two ploughgates of land, and a meadow by Cospa- 



FOGO.

trick, Earl of March. The farm of Sisterpath, to the west of 
the church, may probably have taken its name from the religieuses 
having their soHtary walks in that direction. 

An old farm-stead, now converted to a cottage, stands on the 
bank of the river, a quarter of a mile west of the church ; it is called 
Corbiehall. A gentleman, versed in Berwickshire antiquities, says, 
that its proper name should be Corbetshall, from a person of that 
name who came to this country with William the Conqueror. 
The bridge over the Blackadder, near the church, like all old 
bridges, is narrow, but being founded upon rock, it has stood 
without repair, except in' the parapet, ever since it was built. Sir 
James Cockburn of Langton and Riselaw built it at his own ex- 
pense, in consequence of a dispute with a neighbouring proprietor 
as to the ground on which it is placed ; and he caused the follow- 
ing inscription to be put upon it : " Sir James Cockburn of Lang- 
ton and Rislaw did this brig." His descendants still inherit the 
title ; but the property has passed into other hands. 

Land-owners. — There are only four land-owners in the parish, 
viz. Henry Trotter of Mortonhall, proprietor of two-thirds ; Miss 
Robertson, heir of William Robertson of Ladykirk ; Sir William 
Purves Hume Campbell, Bart, of Marchmont; John Foreman 
Home, of Wedderburn and Caldra. None of them reside in the 
parish. Caldra-House is let. Mr Trotter lately rebuilt a small 
country house at Charter- Hall, which he visits for a few days on 
business. The other two proprietors have no mansions in the 
parish. All the other houses are occupied by tenants and ser- 
vants, except the manse and schoolhouse. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest entry in the parochial regis- 
ters is dated A. d. 1660. The Episcopal clergy, when turned out, 
generally carried off the records. The registers have not been so 
complete as could be wished, — the mother's name being omitted, 
which is sometimes as essential to her descendants as the father's. 
The registers have been lately new-modelled, and a register of 
burials added to those of births and marriages. 

Antiquities. — The only vestige of antiquity in the parish is an 
old Roman camp at Chesters, in the west end of the parish ; the 
stones of which have been mostly removed to make way for the 
plough. The situation shows how careful the Romans were of the 
health of their armies, — the soil being light and dry, — and the si- 
tuation being near water, and by its elevation, commanding an

extensive view of the surrounding country. There was lately 
trenched up what appeared to have been a Roman causeway, pas- 
sing through a marsh adjoining this parish on the south, and pro- 
bably leading to this camp. 

III. — Population. 
The population of the parish, which, according to Dr Web- 
ster's Account in 1755, was 566, has decreased about one-fourth. 
This evidently arises from the common custom in this country 
of uniting farms, one tenant possessing what was formerly occu- 
pied by three or four. A few straggling ash-trees still point out 
the seat of the former dwellings. If this change has diminished 
the population, it has certainly improved and increased the produce 
of the soil, which is now occupied by persons of capital and enter- 
prise. The village of Fogo, the only one in the parish, scarcely 
deserves the name, as it only consists of the manse and school- 
house, and of six cottages attached to two farms. The population 
at present may be considered as nearly stationary, varying a little, 
according to the annual ingress or egress of farm-servants, with 
their families.

There is only one family of independent fortune, residing in 
the parish. The yearly value of the four landed estates is from 
L. 150 to upwards of L. 3000. 

It may be added, that the tenants have comfortable houses, and 
live in a style superior to what was known among the same class 
sixty years ago. 

There have been no illegitimate births in the parish during the 
last three years. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres in the 
parish, as before stated, is about 4800; and the whole, since 
the time when the last Statistical Account was written, have been

brouoht under the plough or planted; so that there is no waste land 
except what lies along the banks of the river, which may extend to 
twenty or thirty acres, and even that may be pastured or cut to the 
water's edge. There is no undivided common, but a patch of four or 
five acres near the church, bounded by the water, and the lands of 
two proprietors. The acres under wood may be about 305, planted 
within these sixty years by the late and by the present proprietor at 
Charter- Hall; five acres on the bank of the river in front of Caldra- 
House, planted by the late General Home, as before noticed ; and 
about five acres at Harcarse. These plantations consist mostly 
of fir, with some beech, birch, and other hard-wood, and are 
thriving well. The fir of Charter-Hall is used by the fish-curers 
to make barrel staves. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of day-labourers are Is. 6d. a-day, 
summer and winter. Hinds or yearly servants working a pair of 
horses receive 14 bolls of grain, a cow summered and wintered, 
ground for planting half a boll of potatoes, producing ten or twelve 
bolls; L.4in money; four double carts of coals 48 bolls driven, 
and a dwelling-house and small garden for vegetables, of the value 
of L. 2, — for which last they find a shearer in harvest, the tenant 
furnishing victuals, as he does to all his labourers in harvest. A 
hind's gains are estimated at L. 30. If he has children above ten, 
they are employed and paid for working in the fields, which adds 
to the income of the family. The hind is also bound to keep a 
bondager for out-of-door work at the master's call, who pays for 
the bondager, when employed, lOd. a-day. 

Unmarried men-servants within the house, besides board, receive, 
half yearly, from L.3, 10s. to L.4, 10s.; boys, from L.l, 10s. to 
L. 2 ; women, L. 5 in summer, and L. 2 in winter, — the cause of 
which difference is, that in summer they are employed in hoeing 
and out-door work. Reapers' wages in ordinary seasons are 14s. 
a-week for men, and 12s. for women, with victuals. 

Prices of Agricultural Implements. — Wood and iron, — the princi- 
pal articles of raw produce in use for husbandry, — are brought 
from Berwick at market-price ; the iron, when wrought, is charged 
by the pound, or according to the time occupied in working. Smiths 
generally agree to keep in repair the iron work at L. 3 a-year for 
each pair of work horses; carpenters charge about L. 12 for a cart, 
L. 3 for a plough. Paling costs Is. 8d. per rood of two rails, and 
2s. fid. per rood of three rails. Masons receive 2s. 6d. a-day, ;md 
sometimes work by estimate.

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The breed of sheep is Leicester and Che- 
viot, but chiefly the latter ; they are reared upon the land, though 
many purchase Cheviot lambs at Yetholm and the west country fairs 
in summer, winter them on turnips, and sell them after a year's 
keeping, so as to procure a return of from 20s. to 25s. a-head. 
The cattle are also of a mixed breed. Those reared on the land 
are of the improved short-horned kind. The others, kyloes,  High- 
land cattle, are bought at the end of the season for the straw yard, 
or fed on turnips, and sold in the following autumn at a profit of 
from L. 6 to L. 8 a-head for keeping. Mr Thomson of Earnslaw 
has been long noted as a breeder of both cattle and sheep of great 
weight and symmetry. 

Husbandly. — The management of the land is good, and what is 
called the five-break rotation is commonly followed Bone-dust has 
of late been used as a turnip manure, and seems to answer well in dry 
seasons. All the land in the parish being reclaimed, inclosed with 
hedge and ditch fences, and mostly drained, there remains little 
for further improvement. The farm-buildings are in general well 
planned and convenient. Leases are granted for nineteen or twenty- 
one years. There are no obstacles to improvement on the part of 
either heritors or tenants, or from other causes, — except the dis- 
tance of lime and coal, which is fifteen or sixteen miles at least, 
and of a market for the produce, Berwick, which is equally distant. 
The grain is all sold by sample. A small portion of it is bought 
and manufactured by the west country millers for the Dalkeith 
market. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Taking the area of the parish at . - - - - 4800 acres, 

And deducting for wood, water, roads, and waste land, - 400

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Mea7is of Communication, Sfc. — The only village is Fogo, — which 
has a population of thirty-five persons. There are two turnpike 
roads passing through the parish ; the one from the west is the 
great road to Berwick and the Chain or Suspension bridge, which 
serves as a communication with Northumberland, for the importa- 
tion of lime and coal: it joins the Edinburgh road 1 miles east 
from Greenlaw, and its length is four miles. The other, from 
Coldstream to Dunse, two miles long, crosses the parish in the 
east end. Both roads are Macadamized, and the tolls are with- 
out the parish. The length of the whole roads within the parish 
is about sixteen miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is the only place of pub- 
lic worship, and is situate nearly in the centre of the parish. At 
what time it was built is unknown. The walls and roof were re- 
paired in 1755, and having been re-seated and plastered in 1817, 
the church is now in a good condition. It contains about 200 per- 
sons, and the seats are all free. 

The last two Episcopal ministers were Messrs Methven, father 
and son, whose monuments are still remaining in the churchyard, 
with the inscriptions legible. They were succeeded by John Pringle, 
in 1659; William Home, in 1722; John Todd, in 1785; George 
Moodie, in 1693 ; William Home, in 1757 ; George M'Lean, in 
1814. 

The only benefactions are, a mortification of about L. 6 a-year, 
paid out of the lands of Charter- Hall and Harcarse, for the poor; 
and a bursary to St Andrews, in the gift of Mortonhall. 

The manse and offices were built in 1787, and repaired in 1814 
and 1822. They are in good condition. 

The glebe contains eleven acres five perches Enghsh, exclusive 
of fences, but including the garden and site of the buildings. The 
soil is a deep loam of excellent quality, and might let from L. 25 
to L.30. The stipend, which was a trifle above eleven chalders, was 
augmented to fifteen chalders, half meal, half barley, in 1830, with 



230 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



the old allowance of L. 8, 6s, 8d for communion elements, and 
there is still a considerable surplus of free teind. 

About two-thirds of the families belong to the church, and are 
in general punctual in their attendance ; and one-third are dissen- 
ters of the United Secession or Relief. These go to Dunse or 
Greenlaw, in the first of which there are three, and in the last, 
two congregations. 

The average number of church communicants is from 140 to 150. 
The church collections for the poor are trifling,— not more than 
L. 4 or L. 5 per annum. The tenants give little, as they are as- 
sessed, and the working-classes can afford and give still less. Col- 
lections for other purposes are rare. There have been only three 
or four within these twenty years, for extra-parochial objects. 

Education. — The only school in the parish is the parochial, — in 
which are taught, besides the ordinary branches, mensuration and 
Latin. The teacher has the minimum salary, being by conversion 
L. 25, 13s. 3d., also about L. 8 as heritors' clerk and as precentor : 
and the whole emoluments, with school fees and other perquisites, 
may average L. 45 per annum, besides a house and garden. 

All children in the parish are early taught to read, and there 
are no persons of any age above six, unable to read. 

The average number of persons receiving parochial aid for the 
last seven years is 10 ; they have received from Is. to 3s. per week. 
The average assessment for the same period, paid by the heritors 
and tenants, each one-half, was L. 54,— giving L. 6, 8s. to each 
pauper per annum. Paupers are at first reluctant to apply for as- 
sistance, buti when once enrolled, they become less so. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It will appear from the above facts, that, since the time of the 
last Statistical Account, a considerable extent of waste land 
1200 acres has been enclosed and planted, or brought under 
cultivation ; that the land has been much improved by draining; 
and that the roads are in good repair, as a proof of which, it may 
be mentioned, that grain, and even lime and coals, which it for- 
merly required six horses to carry, may now be easily carted by a 
single horse. There is not a farm in the parish but has a thrash- 
ing-machine. And, except a little occasional draining, it does not 
appear that much more can be done in this parish in the way of 
improvement.

THE REV. ROBERT HOME, l txtttprs 

THE REV. WALTER HOME, A. &amp; §. | MINISTERS. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, Sc. — The parish of Polwarth lies nearly in the 
middle of the county of Berwick, forming part of the boundary 
between its upland and low districts. It is in the form of a 
triangle, the base of which is bounded by the parish of Langton ; 
the east and west sides are bounded respectively by the two pa- 
rishes of Fogo and Greenlaw. The parish is about three miles in 
length ; its greatest breadth does not exceed two ; and it occupies 
a space of 4.767 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface presents nothing 
very remarkable in character; from Kyles-hill, which rises to a 
moderate elevation in the western extremity, the ground gra- 
dually slopes in gentle undulations to the east. These eminen- 
ces extend also into the southern angle of the parish, and, being 
covered with plantations and groups of trees, give the whole 
a very pleasing and romantic appearance. 

Geology. — The southern district is the most fertile ; it belongs 
to the new red sandstone formation. The northern belongs to 
the old red sandstone formation ; and is poor arid barren. The 
rock in the first of these is a dark marly stone, sometimes run- 
ning into a white variety ; in the se.cond, the old red sandstone, 
which is continued from the adjoining parish of Greenlaw, is ge- 
nerally coarse and often conglomerate. Kyles-hill consists of a 
hard reddish porphyry ; the basis of which is clay containing 
crystals of felspar interspersed through it. The soil of the dis- 
trict is for the most part clay, but beds of sand and gravel here 
and there intervene. 

Botany. — The Flora of the parish is, from its small extent, very 
limited. Campanula latifolia, Acer campestre, and Spircea salici- 
folia, occur in Marchmont woods. Agaricus muscarius and Alec- 
f.oriajuhata, on Kyles-hill. 



BERWICKSHIRE. 

« 

II. — Civil History. 

Polwarth forms part of the Marchmont estates, and now be- 
longs to Sir Hugh Purves Hume Campbell, Bart., who is sole 
proprietor. Marchmont House, built by Hugh the last earl, 
about eighty years ago, is his residence. 

Antiquities. — The church stands on the edge of a beautiful 
glade in the grounds of Marchmont, half concealed by aged trees. 
It is a plain substantial building. From an inscription on the 
walls, it appears to have been first built prior to the year 900, 
when it was endowed as a rectory ; and subsequently repaired in 
1378. From the date of this inscription 1703 the church 
appears to have been then rebuilt upon its ancient foundation 
walls, these bearing evident marks of a much greater age than 
the superstructure. Beneath the church is a vault, the cemetery 
of the Marchmont family, in which Sir Patrick Hume lay con- 
cealed during the times of religious intolerance. To this noble- 
man, who is known to history as a statesman and patriot, and also 
as a man of a large and enlightened mind, a brief remembrance 
is due in a Statistical Account of his native place. The tomb 
which the necessities of the times had thus converted into the 
abode of the living, afforded for some time a refuge to its unfor- 
tunate inmate. He was here attended by his daughter Lady 
Grizel Baillie, a person also of historical celebrity from the 
proofs she has left of a masculine mind and exalted virtue. 
Chiefly through her means Sir Patrick escaped to Holland ; he 
returned to Scotland at the Revolution, after which he was suc- 
cessively advanced to the honours of Lord Polwarth and Earl of 
Marchmont. 

Parochial Registers. — More light might perhaps have been 
thrown on the biography and antiquities of this parish, had its 
parochial registers been in existence ; but these were unfortu- 
nately destroyed about forty-five years ago ; the schoolmaster's 
house where they were kept having been accidentally burned to 
the ground. It is proper to add, that the parochial registers 
have been regularly kept ever since. 

 This inscription appearing worthy of preservation is here subjoined.

III. — Population. 
The number of inhabitants, as reported by Dr Webster in 1755, 
was 251. In 1793, the number was 288, "divided among 72 fami- 
hes, of whom 55 resided in the village of Polwarth. In the years 
1801, 1811, 1821, and 1831, the numbers returned were respec- 
tively 291, 307, 298, 288, according to the census. 

Number of families in tlie parish, _ - - - 64 

of families chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 

chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, io 

The population, as appears from what is said above, is princi- 
pally gathered into the village of Polwarth. The trades in the 
village are : wrights, 3 ; masons, 6 ; smiths, 1 ; weavers, 3 ; shoe- 
makers, 2 ; carters, 2. 

The village itself is situated on very wet and swampy ground, 
yet the place is healthy i and neither rheumatic nor aguish com- 
plaints prevail in any remarkable degree. The houses are much 
scattered, — seldom more than two or three being situated together. 
It is probably owing to this circumstance that epidemic distem- 
pers are not very apt to spread. 

Character and Habits of the People. — From the secluded situa- 
tion of Polwarth, and the unvarying nature of the occupations of 
the inhabitants in agriculture, a considerable degree of simplicity 
prevails in the character and manners of the people. They are 
attached to their native place, and seldom think of removing from 
it. Most of the families in the village have been resident for seve- 
ral generations. Within these few years, however, a few persons 
have emigrated to North America, — chiefly to Upper Canada. 
This may, perhaps, account for the fact, that there has been no 
increase in the population since 1793 j the number at present be- 
ing the same as then. 

The manner of living among the people is such as to keep them 
orderly in their habits, and comfortable for their condition in life. 
Almost every householder, along with his house, rents from one 
to two acres of land ; these are locally denominated an acre. With 
this and the aid of a garden, and the use of a considerable extent 
of moor from the indulgence of the proprietor, they are enabled 
to keep a cow, and most of them also to rear a calf. As the rents 
of fheir little possessions are very moderate, there are always 
several competitors for every house which may become empty. The 
two carters have a larger portion of land, and keep two horses, 
with which they plough their neighbours' acres and bring home the 
turf, which is their principal fuel. 

A custom once prevailed in this parish which is not unworthy of 



234 



BEUWICKSHlllE. 



notice here. In the midst of the village are two thorn trees near 
to each other; round these every newly married pair were expect- 
ed to dance with all their friends ; from hence arose the old song 
of " Polwarth on the Green." 

Instances of longevity are not uncommon. The present incum- 
bent, who has been sixty-four years minister, is eighty-nine years 
of age, and is the oldest clergyman in the Church of Scotland. 
Several of the parish paupers have also attained to a great age. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The agriculture of this parish 
is of the most approved kind. The soil is various. But the greatest 
part of it is clay, some of which is on a tilly bed, and is best adapt- 
ed for grass ; other parts of it are gravellish, and some sandy. On 
the north-west is a considerable extent of moor. 

The whole parish is enclosed except a small farm, and the moor 
which is allotted by the proprietor to the use of the village for 
pasture and fuel. A great deal of land is in old grass, which is 
subdivided into enclosures of from ten to thirty acres, all suffi- 
ciently watered. These are let annually, and bring very high rents, 
for the accommodation of those farmers who breed more stock than 
they can maintain at home. 

The principal crops are oats, barley, turnips, a httle wheat, and 
occasionally a few pease and beans. There is a considerable quan- 
tity of old timber of good size, besides extensive young plantations, 
which are in general very thriving. 

We here give a tabular statement of the manner in which the 
whole land of the parish is occupied.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication, c— Polwarth has no market; for this 
it is dependent on Dunse, which is four miles distant, and on Green- 
law, which is three. The parish is intersected by the road from 
Dunse to Edinburgh, and a stage-coach between these places pas- 
ses the village daily. There are parish and private roads, which 
are all kept in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is centrally situated, and is 
regularly attended by all the people, except two or three, who are 
Dissenters. There is no dissenting place of worship. The ave- 
rage number of communicants is about 120. 

The stipend, which received an augmentation in 1814, consists 
of 64 bolls oats, 80 barley, 80 oatmeal, with L. 5, lis. ld. Ster- 
Ung in money. The manse is an old house with additions, part 
of which were made at the expense of the present incumbent. The 
glebe is about fourteen English acres. 

Education. — There is a sufficient school-house, with a residence 
for the teacher. The salary is L. 28, with about an acre of land. 
The school is attended, on an average, by forty-five scholars. The 
probable yearly amount of fees actually paid to the teacher is L. 19. 

Poor. — The poor on the roll of the parish amount to 9 ; and 
the present annual assessment for their support is L. 50. The 
reason of the largeness of this sum is, that the parish has to sup- 
port a lunatic in an asylum, at an expense of L. 23, 10s. per an- 
num. All the poor on the roll that reside in the parish have a free 
house and garden from the late Sir W. P. H. Campbell of March- 
mont. His benevolence extended also to others, particularly to 
the widows of those connected with the estate. At his demise in 
the beginning of 1833, he farther, by an heritable bond of annuity 
executed by him, bequeathed L.25 Sterling per annum for the 
use and behoof of the poor of Polwarth. 

Besides the enrolled poor, there are others who receive occa- 
sional relief. This is afforded partly from a fund of mortified 
money L. Ill, the interest of which is distributed by the kirk- 
session, and partly from the collections at the church-doors, which 
may amount to L. 5 annually.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN BROWN, D. D.' MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 6fc. — The name of this parish is derived 
from the village of Langton or Lang-tun, which was probably so 
called from its long straggling figure. It extended at one time 
from the immediate neighbourhood of Langton House almost to 
the eastern limits of the parish. But, as it interfered with some 
improvements which Mr Gavin, a former proprietor, wished to in- 
troduce, he offered to the inhabitants, on advantageous terms, 
another situation about half a mile distant. They accepted his 
offer, — removed in 1760, — and, in honour of its founder, named 
the new village Gavinton. 

The figure of the parish is irregularly triangular, about 4 miles 
in mean length, and 2 in breadth. It contains 11; square miles, 
lying partly in the Merse and partly among the Lammermoors, 
which, under the name of Langton- Edge, run from east to west. 
Their height may be about 900 feet above the level of the sea. 
Langton- Burn, almost the only stream in the parish, is so small 
as scarcely to deserve notice. It runs eastward, and joins the 
Blackadder. The air, like that of the surrounding district, has 
always been reckoned pure, and the situation healthy. 

Botany. — That part of the parish which lies among the Lam- 
mermoors is almost completely covered with heath and some of the 
coarser grasses. By the sides of its streams, and in marshy situa- 
tions, may be found Myosotis repens of Don, Veronica scutellata 
with its flowers sometimes white, and the beautiful Sedum villosum. 
Viola lutea grows sparingly on the hills ; Saxifraga hiradiis has 
been lately discovered ; and, for the last two sulnmers, Hypnum 
stramineum has been noticed in fruit in a boggy situation, wliichdoes 
not seem to have been elsewhere observed. Its fruit is perfect in 
June. Near Langton-Lees there is a small stream, the steep banks 
of which are covered with natural wood. Its most interesting plants 



LANGTON. 



237 



are Ruhus saxatilis, Cnicus heterophyllus, Gymnostomum tenue, and 
Hookeria lucens. A little farther down, the same stream enters 
and passes through Langton- Wood, a scene of much natural 
beauty. Among its banks are found, more or less plentifully, Ve- 
ronica montana, Rumex sanguineus, variety with red veins, Chry- 
sosplenium alternifolium, Hieracium molle, Hypnum alopecurum, 
in fruit, and Orthotrichum diaphanum. In the lower, and culti- 
vated parts of the parish, Cerastium arvense, Tragopogon major, 
lately added to the British Flora, Anthoceros punctatus, andPe_ 
ziza Macropus, are the most remarkable plants. 

The following species are not rare, but may deserve notice, as 
not having been observed elsewhere in Berwickshire : — Bidens 
cemua, Myosotis sylvatica, Gymnostomum fasciculare, Rryum mar- 
ginatum, Hypnum piliferum, H. murale, Jungermannia reptans, 
J. tomentilla, Sticta fuliginosa. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Notices. — From its situation, the village of Langton 
was exposed to all the misfortunes of Border warfare. It was 
burned in 1558 by Sir Henry Percy and Sir George Bowes, and 
at other times pillaged by marauding parties from England. 

During the reign of David I. the manor of Langton, with the 
advowson of the church, belonged to Roger de Ow, a Northum- 
brian follower of Prince Henry. Roger de Ow granted to the 
monks of Kelso the church of Langton, which was accordingly 
held by Henry the Parson. From him the estate passed to Wil- 
liam de Vetereponte, or Vipont, who continued to these monks the 
church with its tithes and lands, adding also those of Coleman's 
Flat. 

In 1296, John Vicar of Langton swore fealty to Edward I. at 
Berwick, and, in return, obtained a writ for the restitution of his 
vicarage. 

The first Vipont was succeeded by his eldest son by his first 
wife, Emma de St Hilary, and this family continued Lords .of 
Langton till Sir William Vipont was killed at Bannockburn in 1314. 
Immediately after this, the estate passed into the family of Cock- 
burn by marriage with the heiress of Vipont. Alexander Cockburn 
of Langton was keeper of the great seal to Roberts II. and III. 
He was made hereditary Ostiarius Parliamcnti, and this office was 
annexed to the barony of Langton by charter of James IV. Fe- 
bruary 20, 1504. 

William Cockburn of Langton was created a baronet by 
Charles I. in 1627. Sir Alexander Cockburn was killed in the

when it was sold to David Gavin, Esq. 

Antiquities. — On the hill near Raecleugh-head, the traces of 
two military stations still remain. The ditches are very entire, and 
belonged, it is thought, to a Danish encampment. The traces of 
another encampment are also to be seen on the moor near Choice- 
Lee, where a regiment was stationed after the rebellion of 1715 to 
keep the Jacobites in awe. The place is still called Camp-Muir. 

In 1792, when removing a large cairn from the top of the Crum- 
stane-hill, close to the site of the present church, several earthen 
urns of various sizes were discovered. They contained human bones, 
but bore no inscription. Stone coffins were also found on the farms 
of Middlefield and Crease, one of which was 3 feet long, 2 deep, 
and 2\ broad. In 1813, a bracelet of gold was found in a small 
stream at the Battle- Muir, It measured nine inches in circum- 
ference, and was sold for L. 36.

Some extensive improvements on the grounds at Langton House, 
begun since the census of 1831, by aflFording occupation for more 
workmen, may in part account for the increased population of 1833. 

The average number of births for the last seven years, as en- 
tered in the parish register, is 9f. Dissenters do not commonly 
register the births of their children. 

The village of Gavinton contains 243 inhabitants. The rest of 
the population live on the various farms.

The parish, with one or two trifling exceptions, belongs to the 
Marchioness of Breadalbane, who usually resides here during part 
of the year, and has of late made great improvements on the grounds 
around Langton House.

rish, containing about 4000 imperial acres, lies among the Lam- 
mermoors, and is fit only for sheep-pasture. The rest is arable, 
consisting of about 3000 acres, 900 of which are annually let as 
grass parks. About 200 acres are covered by wood. Oak, ash, 
elm, beech, birch, plane, Scotch fir, spruce, and larch, are the 
kinds grown, and they are all in a thriving condition. The recent 
plantations, which amount to about 100 acres, will soon afford im- 
portant shelter to the various farms. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of arable land varies from 17s. to about 
L. 3 per English acre. It may average L. 1, 7s. The average 
rent of grass lately has been L, 3, 17s. 6d. per cow, L.2, 10s. per 
ox, and 12s. per sheep. The cattle are chiefly of the Tees-water 
breed, the sheep Leicester and Cheviot, with a few black-faced. 

Rate of Wages. — The yearly wages of a farm-servant are 10 
bolls of oats, 3 of barley, 1 of pease, L. 3 in cash, and he has a 
cow kept, which is equal to L. 6 more. While he is cutting and 
carrying in the crop, his food is provided by the farmer. He has, 
besides, a house, a small garden, and half a rood of land for pota- 
toes, for all which he furnishes a labourer in time of harvest. He 
also provides a labourer for hoeing turnips, &amp;c. and for this he is 
allowed lOd. per day. 

The wages of an unmarried servant, besides board, are L. 8 per 
annum ; those of a female-servant from L. 6 to L. 7, 7s. The 
wages of shepherds are the same with those of farm-servants, ex- 
cept that, instead of L. 3 in cash, they have a few sheep grazed, 
varying in number according to the nature of the pasture. 

Day-labourers on farms receive from 8s. to 9s. per week. They 
work ten hours in summer, and in winter as long as day-hght lasts. 
While the corn is carrying in, farm-servants are ready to w'ork at 
all times, labouring sometimes the greater part of the night. 
Scarcely any class of men is more respectable than the farm-ser- 
vants of Berwickshire. They are intelligent, industrious, and sober. 

Masons, in summer, work ten hours, in winter about seven and 
a-half or eight. During the summer of 1833, they had 14s. per 
week, and for the three preceding seasons 13s. For a short time 
last winter they had lis., but afterwards 10s., which had been the 
rate of their wages for three preceding years. Wrights work the 
same number of hours with masons, and their wages are nearly the 
same. 

Smiths are allowed L. 2, 10s., with the driving of a cart of 
coals valued at 8s. for keeping up the iron work required for a 
pair of farm-horses. This includes shoes, the iron work of a 



240

plough, harrows, and cart, exclusively of wheels and axletree. 
Other work, as that connected with gates or machinery, is charg- 
ed at 5d. per lb. The shoe of a riding-horse costs 8d. 

Husbandry. — The arable farms are managed in five divisions, 
or breaks, as they are called, viz. 1. oats; 2. turnips or fallow, 
according to the nature of the soil ; 3. barley or wheat ; 4 and 5. 
grass for two years. This system is prescribed by all the leases 
on the Langton estate. The turnips are generally eaten on the 
ground by sheep confined by nets or hurdles. In sowing grain 
some of the farmers use machines, — a practice which seems rapidly 
extending. 

The kinds of grain commonly sown are wheat, barley, oats, 
beans, and pease, of which the average produce is towards six bolls 
per English acre ; potatoes yield from 30 to 40 bolls ; hay, from 
150 to 250 stones, or a little more ; turnips, when led off the land, 
sell at from L. 6 to L. 9 ; when eaten on the ground, from L. 3, 
10s. to L. 5 per acre. 

The quantity of grain of all kinds amounts to about 3500 bolls. 
Two hundred and fifty acres of turnips, and about 150 of hay, are 
usually grown. 

The rental of the parish is a little above L. 4000. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Village. — Gavinton is the only village in the parish, and Dunse, 
which is two miles distant, is both our market and post-town. 

Ecclesiastical State, Sfc — The present church was erected in 
1798 at the west end of the village of Gavinton. Till that time 
the old church, which stood near Langton- House, had continued 
to be used. It is impossible to ascertain when the latter was built. 
It must, however, have been at a very rembte period, for no notice 
of its erection occurs in the books of the presbytery, and there 
are tombstones in the churchyard bearing the date of 1620. It 
seems to have required no repairs at the parochial visitation called 
in 1684 by order of the Bishop of Edinburgh, while Mr Patrick 
Walker was minister. At the next visitation in 1700, the pres- 
bytery are said to have iougd " several things necessary to com- 
pleat y same ;" and the moderator, by their appointment, " re- 
commended y' persons concerned to see to y= repair y''of." At 
a third visitation in 1721, they discovered that " the roof was in 
ill condition," and in 1727 it fell to the ground. It then under- 
went a thorough repair, and stood till the present church was 
erected. 

At the visitation in 1 684, the manse and offices were condemn- 



LANGTON. 



241 



etl by the presbytery, after liearing' the evidence on oath of 
Messrs William Moscript and James Walkinshaw, wrights, and 
John, Daniel, and Alexander Gilkie, masons. A new manse 
and offices were then built on a different site ; and an excambion 
of the glebe took place, with the consent of Sir Alexander Cock- 
burn of Langton, and Alexander Cockburn of Blacksmiln, who 
were present at the meeting. The manse then built was occupied 
till 1766, when the present was erected by Mr Gavin. Another 
excambion of the glebe was then also agreed to, but subsequently 
amended, as being less advantageous to the living. In the year 
1819, an important addition to the manse was made by the late 
Marquis of Breadalbane. 

The minister of Langton before the Restoration was Mr John 
Burn, who retained his charge till the time of his death in 1677. 
He seems to have been an exceedingly pious and amiable man. 
More zealously attached to Presbyterian principles than many of 
his brethren, he attended the presbytery only twice after the es- 
tablishment of Episcopacy, and yet he remained unmolested till 
the year 1670, when he allowed some of the ejected ministers to 
assist him at a communion. He experienced much kindness and 
countenance from the Cockburns of Langton. Like the Humes 
of Polwarth and Redbraes, and the Kerrs of Nisbet, this distin- 
guished family was eminent for piety, and suffered in the cause of 
civil and religious hberty. In 1679 they established a meeting 
in one of the houses attached to Langton Castle, where they had 
regularly preaching from Mr Luke Ogle,t the friend of Mr Gil- 
bert Rule, afterwards Principal of the University of Edinburgh, 
Mr John Veitch of Westruther, and Mr Daniel Douglas. This 
meeting must have been connived at by the bishop and the Duke 
of Lauderdale, for none of the parishioners were molested for at- 
tending it, except John Galloway, the beadle, whom the presby- 
tery appointed to be " put out of his office." There is reason to 
believe that practical religion flourished greatly in the parish, and 
that the preaching of Mr Ogle was eagerly resorted to by serious 

• The last three were ancestors of some of the present inhabitants of Gavinton. 

t Alexander Cockburn resided at that time in Langton Castle, which stood 
in what IS now called the Little Byres Park. A chapel was soon afterwards erected 
in Langton-wood, opposite Haining-Rigg, which was occujiicd by Mr Ogle, and 
where Jolm Veitch is reported to have preached occasionally, and baptized the chil- 
dren ot some of the parishioners. The Duke of Lauderdale, tiiough apjilied to by 
some ot tlio Episcopalians, refused to institute proceedings agahist Mr Veitch for 
preachmg in the cha]el. After the Revolution, wlien the parisli church was acain 
hlled by a 1 resbyterian minister, it is probable that tlie chapel was granted to the 
liandful ot Episcopalians who resided in the nciglihourliood ; and froni this circuin 
stance it was erroneously supposed to have been an Episcopal cliapel.

individuals from tlic neighbouring districts. Two Episcopalian 
ministers held the living before the Revolution, — Mr Robert Hoop- 
er from 1677 to 1683, and Mr Patrick Walker from 1683 to 1688. 
The first seems to have been a peaceable man ; the second was a 
bigotted prelatist. Mr Dysart, who was afterwards translated to 
Coldingham, was the first minister after the Revolution. The next 
was Mr Dawson, a highly respectable clergyman. He was suc- 
ceeded in 1727 by his son, Mr James Dawson, who in 1733 was 
translated to the parish of St Cuthberts. Since that time the 
living has been held by Mr James Lawrie, who was removed to 
Hawick in 1757 ; Dr David Johnston promoted to North Leith 
in 1765 ; Mr Andrew Smith, who died in 1789 ; Mr Alexander 
Girvan, formerly minister of Lunan, who died in 1809; and the 
present incumbent. 

The recoi'ds of session reach no farther back than 10th Sep- 
tember 1727 : but there was a more ancient book, which was regu- 
larly presented to the presbytery both before the re-establishment 
of Episcopacy and after the Revolution. It seems to have been 
the only session-book within their bounds which, except in a single 
instance, was never transmitted while they were under the govern- 
ment of bishops. The minutes of presbytery for December 6, 1659, 
state, that " the session-book of Lantoune had been delivered;" and 
it is mentioned in the account of the visitation of the parish in 1700, 
that "the presbytery having caled for y church Bible, Confession of 
Faith," — of which every session was required to have a copy, as well 
as of the formula to be subscribed by the elders before they entered 
on the exercise of their office,—" the acts of y'= General Assembly, 
session-register, and poor's-box, they were produced and laid be- 
fore y presbytery." At the visitation of 1721, though the presby- 
tery found that the session had no church Bible, nor Confession 
of Faith, nor the later acts of Assembly, and ordered them to be 
bought, yet, when the session-register was called for, it was pre- 
sented. When laid before them at Dunse the following year, 
they approved of it in all respects, except an allowance of half- 
a-crown given by the session to the elder who represented them 
in the synod, and which the presbytery declared that " they would 
not suffer to be done by any session within their bounds." 

The first part of the records which remains extends to February 
1733, and is deeply interesting. It exhibits a view of the session 
and of their management of the parish, so admirably fitted to pro- 
mote the interests of religion, that, if realized at present through- 
out the parishes of Scotland, it would demonstivate the superior 
efficiency of an ecclesiastical establishment more irresistibly than 



LANGTON. 



243 



au' speculative argument. The session was not only composed 
of elders who had the spiritual superintendence of particular dis- 
tricts which were marked out and assigned to each, but in accord- 
ance with the Acts of Assembly, which are still binding, of a cor- 
responding number of deacons who attended to the poor in their 
several bounds, and assisted at the communion. The minutes 
always run thus, " Sederunt minister, elders and deacons." It 
does not appear whether they observed the directions of the Ge- 
neral Assembly of 1723, and required the elders when they were 
ordained to sign the formula contained in the 10th act of the As- 
sembly 1694, but the attention which they paid to their other du- 
ties renders this highly probable. They not only assembled from 
time to time for the exercise of discipline, in wliich they appear 
to have been mild and prudent, for electing commissioners to the 
presbytery and synod, and for examining the communion-roll be- 
fore the sacrament, but they had frequent meetings for prayer and 
conference respecting the state of the parish. At these meetings 
other members besides the moderator engaged in devotion, and he 
was accustomed to give such exhortations as these, — that they 
should be " faithful in the exercise of their offices, and give infor- 
mation to the session what irregularities were committed in their 
several quarters, that so a check might timeously be put to any 
appearances of vice, and that they themselves should behave in ane 
exemplary manner in their respective bounds." 

And along with these attentions on the part of the elders to the 
conduct of the members, and on the part of the deacons to the 
necessities of the poor, a kind and steady superintendence was 
maintained by the presbytery over the ministers and sessions in 
the different parishes, which must have been followed by the most 
beneficial results. It was common to call for their records once 
in two years, and appoint them to be examined. The following 
is an example of the vigilance which they exercised respecting the 
deportment of ministers, and a striking proof of their solicitude for 
their usefulness. "Marc/i 1, 1709. — The presbytery this day taking 
again into consideration the affair anent the sacrament of the Lord's 
Supper, and finding that there has offence been given by the 
sumptuousness of dinners after sacraments, and the great number 
of persons resorting thereto, do therefore discharge all the mem- 
bers within their bounds from having any persons whatsomever on 
the Munday or other days at their dinners, except the ministers 
who have been assisting, and appoint that their discourse at that 
time be rpiritual." At the parochial visitations questions were 



244

put by the presbytery, first to the ciders respecting the walk, con- 
versation, and doctrine of the minister; then to the congregation 
respecting the elders and deacons ; then respecting the school- 
master, session-clerk, precentor, and beadle ; and, last of all, to the 
session respecting the congregation. It is impossible to conceive 
a system more fitted to promote the diligence and faithfulness of 
ministers, or the spiritual and moral improvement of parishes. Its 
effects, accordinglj', were visible in a diminution of crime, and an 
increase of personal and family religion among the surrounding 
districts. 

The next part of the records, from 11th February 1733 to 7th 
July 1747, has been lost, — through a mistake, it is said, on the 
part of an ignorant individual who destroyed both these and the 
more ancient minutes. The rest have been preserved. 

The session has at present a copy of the acts of Assembly, and 
of the formula contained in the 10th act of Assembly 1694, which 
has been subscribed by the elders. The late Mr Gavin present- 
ed them with a pair of silver communion cups ; his daughter, Miss 
EHzabeth Gavin, with a silver baptismal basin ; and Lady Ehza- 
beth Pringle, daughter of the late Marquis of Breadalbane, pre- 
sented them in 1827 with a handsome pulpit Bible and psalm- 
book. The church, which is at present in excellent repair, con- 
tains 250 sittings, all of which are free. 

The glebe consists of 1 0 acres. The stipend consists of L.122, 
5s. 4:j\d., and of 67 bolls, 2 bushels, 2 pecks, 3 quarts, 0.1 03 of oats, 
and 38 bolls, 3 bushels, 1 peck, 2 quarts, 1 pint, 972 of barley paid 
by the Marchioness of Breadalbane ; and of 3 bushels, 2 pecks, 1 
gallon, 2 quarts, 1 pint, 179 of oats, and 2 bushels, 3 quarts, 
1.6.255 of barley paid by Mr Hay of Dunse Castle. The teinds 
are supposed to be nearly exhausted. 

The Dissenters attend the different chapels in Dunse. Their 
number throughout the parish is about a third of the population. 
In the village of Gavinton, containing September 1833 a popu- 
lation of 243, there were of Churchmen, 182 ; of .the Relief, 33; 
Burgher and Antiburgher, 28. 

It must be observed, however, that among the farm-servants, — 
a population much less stationary than the inhabitants of villages, 
the proportion of Dissenters is greater. The number of com- 
municants in the Established Church averages from 210 to 232. 

Education.— The parochial schoolmaster has, for the last seven 
years, been unfit for duty, and has resigned the management of the 
school, retaining the salary, which amounts to L. 25, 4s. 4d., with 
his dwelling-house and garden. An assistant and successor has 



LANCJTON. 



245 



been appointed, who, besides a house and garden, and a salary of 
L. 20 paid by the Marchioness of Breadalbane, receives the school 
fees and other emohiments. His income may amount to L. 60. 
The average number of scholars is between .60 and 70. The school 
is taught on the most approved principles, and the fees charged 
are,— English reading, 2s. 6d. per quarter ; writing, 3s. ; arith- 
metic, 3s. 6d. ; geography, 5s. ; practical mathematics, 5s. ; Latin, 
6s. ; Greek, 7s. 6d. ; French, 7s. 6d. ; theoretical mathematics, 
8s. 6d. The gross amount of the fees received is about L. 32. 
There is no other school in the parish. 

A Sabbath school is taught by the assistant-schoolmaster, with 
the aid of some respectable individuals, and under the superin- 
tendence of the minister. It has existed, with two short intervals, 
for nearly twenty years, and has been attended with the most im- 
portant advantages. There is a library for adults, containing 
some valuable books in history, biography, and divinity. 

Charitable Institutions. — The only institution of this nature is a 
Friendly Society, instituted in 1803. Its object is to provide support 
for those members who are suffering from sickness, or who are per- 
manently disabled by the infirmities of age, and to defray, in part, 
their funeral expenses, with those of their wives. Every applicant 
must be of a good moral character, — of a healthy constitution, — 
not exceeding forty years of age, — and must produce a certificate 
signed by respectable individuals, stating that he is a peaceable 
member of society. Members are received from any part of the 
county; but, from the existence of similar societies in Allanton, 
Chirnside, Swinton, and Dunse, applications are rarely made by 
persons living at a distance. The terms are, a sum of 7s. 6d. as 
entry-money, and a permanent quarterly subscription of Is. 6d. 
No one is entitled to assistance till after being three years con- 
nected with the society. If he should by irregular conduct bring 
on illness, he receives no aid, but, on the contrary, is liable to a 
fine not exceeding 5s. Before aid can in any case be granted, the 
member, if residing in the village of Gavinton, must, within a week, 
apprise the deputy-director of his illness ; or, if living elsewhere, 
he must apprise the preses or treasurer. Every application must 
be accompanied by a certificate from the minister and an elder. 
If a dispute arise between the society and any of its members, it 
IS referred to the decision of two individuals,— one chosen by each 
party. Should these umpires not agree, they are empowered to 
choose a third, by whose decision the parties are bound. 

The number of members at present on the roll is 146. Those 
receiving aid arc 32, of whom 9 arc superannuated and 23 sick. 



246 



BERWICKSHTRK. 



At an average, the society relieves 21 sick persons and 7 super- 
annuated. The largest sum given to a member when sick is 4s. 
per week, and this is continued, if required, for three months, 
after which it is reduced. The least sum is Is. per week. L. 3 
are allowed to defray the expenses of a member's funeral, and 
L. 1, 10s. for that of his wife. 

This society was for a long time exceedingly prosperous ; but 
latterly, like those in the neighbourhood, it has received only a 
small addition to the number of its members. Its allowance was 
at first more liberal than the funds would admit, and was conse- 
quently reduced, — a circumstance which probably deterred many 
from joining it. Still it is exceedingly useful ; and, as the rate 
has for some time been stationary, strong hopes are entertained 
that it will revive. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The annual assessments have been 
greatly reduced, chiefly by the temporary aid which is furnished 
from the weekly collections in church to those individuals or fa- 
milies who may require it. They are thus enabled to extricate 
themselves from difficulties, and prevented from coming perma- 
nently on the roll. To enable the session to afford this assistance, 
the whole of the collections since the commencement of the pre- 
sent incumbent's ministry have been placed at their disposal. The 
allowance to paupers on the roll averages Is. 9d. per week; but 
the session also gives occasional donations of meal and coal dur- 
ing winter, and 8s. or 10s. to each after the communion. In some 
instances a weekly allowance of 4s. has been given to individuals 
who had formerly been in more prosperous circumstances; but 
these instances have been rare. Widows with three or four young 
children have received 4s. and have had their children educated, 
sometimes at the expense of the session, sometimes at that of the 
heritors. It is due to the benevolence of the Marchioness of Brea- 
dalbane to say, that there is not a parish in Berwickshire where 
more liberal provision has been made for the poor. 

In 1832 the assessment amounted to L.29, exclusive of L.2, 10s. 
paid to the collector. The number of paupers on the roll was 5, 
one of whom was so old as to require the attendance of another 
individual. The collections at the church doors amounted to 
L. 29, 3s. Od. Of this, L.6, 17s. was paid to the precentor, ses- 
sion-clerk, beadle, presbytery and synod clerks. The remaining 
L. 22, 6s. Od, was distributed, partly among the poor on the roll, 
and partly among ten individuals not receiving stated assistance.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. GEORGE CUNNINGHAM, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries. — The ancient name of the town and pa- 
rish of Dunse was Duns, from the Celtic Dhun or Dun, a hill ; 
the ancient site of the town having been towards the north-west 
side of a beautiful hill called Dunse-Law, till it was burnt by the 
English. From this circumstance, the fields occupying the space in 
which the town was formerly situated are now called Brunton. 
Soon after the year 1588 the present town began to be built in a 
lower situation on the skirts of the southern side of the hill, from 
which the town derives its name ; then the name was corrupted 
into Dunse. 

The extreme length of the parish is about 6 miles from south- 
east to north-west ; its mean breadth about 3 ; so that its extent in 
square miles is about 18 or 19 miles. Its figure is so irregular as 
not to admit of any more exact description, than that, towards its 
northern and southern extremities, its breadth is between three and 
four miles, and in the middle, less than two miles. It is bound- 
ed by the parish of Edrom on the east, south, and south-east ; by 
Bunkle and a detached part of Longformacus on the north-east ; 
by Abbey St Bathans on the north ; and by another part of Long- 
formacus and by Langton on the west. 

Topographical Appearances. — The Lammermoor range of hills 
runs along the northern side of the parish ; in which may be in- 
cluded Cockburn-Law, about 912 feet above the level of the sea, 
the conical figure of which, so different from the gibbous shape of 
the neighbouring hills, renders it a land-mark to mariners coming 
from the east. There are scarcely any valleys or absolutely flat 
lands in the parish ; but in the south and east, which are the most 
fertile parts of it, the ground, to the extent of two or three gquare 
miles, rises into gentle swells, ranging from a point north of east 
to a point south of west ; from which circumstance the meridian

generally adopted by those who are not very accurate in their ob- 
servations is placed a little to the eastward of its proper position. 
Dunse-Law is 630 feet above the level of the sea. 

Hydrography. — The river Whitadder runs along the northern 
and eastern sides of the parish, and forms its boundary with the 
parishes of Longformacus and Bunkle. The nearest point at which 
it approaches the town of Dunse is distant two miles. — Langton- 
burn, a rivulet, rises in the parish from which it receives its name, 
and forming the southern boundary of this parish with Edrom, 
joins the Blackadder a little below Wedderburn through part of 
which estate it passes. 

The Dunse spa, analyzed by Dr Francis Home about the year 
1751, at which time it was in much repute, is now entirely neglect- 
ed, — having sunk in reputation ever since it was analyzed. Its 
waters having become mixed with the ordinary springs in the neigh- 
bourhood are considered as destitute of any efficacy. This 
spring, though called Dunse spa, is within the limits of the pa- 
rish of Edrom. 

There is an artificial lake near Dunse Castle formed about a 
century ago, which is very ornamental to the place. 

Considering its distance from any river, Dunse is remarkably 
well supplied with soft water. Till within these few years, its supply 
of that article, so essential to cleanhness, health, and comfort, de- 
pended entirely on a spring conveyed from the top of Dunse-Law, 
and there was plenty of hard-water in wells dug in every part of 
the town ; but by the application of a considerable sum of money 
- bequeathed by the late Alexander Christie, Esq. of Grueldykes, 
and the liberal permission of William Hay, Esq. of Dunse Castle, 
an inexhaustible supply of excellent water, fit for all purposes, has 
now been brought in pipes from a spring near the site of the old 
town of Duns. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Cockburn-Law affords an interesting 
subject of investigation to the geologist; and the following notices 
are furnished by a friend well skilled in the science of geology, who 
informs me that it is one of those detached hills which so frequently 
occur in Scotland to perplex the geologist. The Whitadder en- 
circles it on three sides, the rocks in the bed of the river being 
principally greywacke and greywacke-slate, the characterizing rocks 
of the transition series. Tlie neighbouring hills are also princi- 
pally composed of these rocks. Cockburn-Law itself, however, is 
a great mass of unstratified rocks, the principal of which are por-

phyry and granite, with occasional beds of greenstone. The gra- 
nite forms the highest part of the hill, porphyry being situated 
lower down. The granite appears to be the same as that which 
occurs at Fasney Water, at some distance to the westward, and 
which has been the subject of such keen discussion between the 
Wernerians and Huttonians. The former have called it tran- 
sition sienite, but this on Cockburn-Law has all the component 
parts of granite, and these disposed in the usual way. The hill is 
detached in this manner from all the surrounding hills, — being com- 
posed of rocks totally dissimilar and unstratified, and surrounded 
at the base by regularly stratified rocks, which, from their present 
appearance and position in many places, seem to have suffered great 
violence. The same formations cross the Whitadder eastward into 
the parish of Bunkle. Between Cockburn-Law and Dunse a nar- 
row stripe may be traced of old red sandstone, the first and oldest 
rock of the secondary series. This formation of old red sandstone 
appears to rest immediately on the transition rocks. The rocks in 
the lower part of the parish appear to belong partly to the coal, 
and partly to the new red sandstone formation, but the sandstone 
of the coal formation seems to be the predominant rock. This 
sandstone frequently abounds with vegetable impressions, and casts 
of palms and other monocotyledonous plants. These are found in 
abundance in a sandstone quarry at the southern boundary of the 
parish. 

Immediately to the southward of the town, there is a bog ex- 
tending a considerable distance eastward and westward, which was 
formerly impassable, except in one place, and seems in ancient 
times to have formed one of its principal defences from its southern 
enemies. There is now a small detached part of the town on the 
south side of it, named the Bridge-end, and opposite, on the north 
side, a small field named Barniken, probably a corruption of Bar- 
bican. The bog is now drained, and is excellent cow-pasture. 

The northern part of the parish is in general a sharp gravelly 
dry soil ; the southern part is a very rich light deep loam, and 
all except some very small detached spots of clay, of that sort 
which agriculturists denominate a good turnip soil. Close to the 
town is a dark deep sandy loam, formed from the debris of the 
sandstone. 

On the banks of the Whitadder, mines have been repeatedly 
dug, and copper has been found, but not in sufficient quantity to

recompense the labour employed, and therefore the exertions in 
search of it have been discontinued. 

Zoology. — The lake at Dunse Castle is well stocked with tench, 
perch, and eels; but attempts to stock it with trout have not been very 
successful. In the months of September and October, salmon and 
grilse in great numbers ascend the Whitadder to its very source, 
and all its tributary streams, even those that are inconsiderable, — for 
the purpose of depositing their spawn in the gravel. The whit- 
ling, a smaller fish, resembling them in quality and habits, is also 
found in considerable numbers ; also a coarser fish somewhat simi- 
lar, and commonly called the bull-trout. They return to the sea 
with the first spring floods. In May the common burn trout is in 
abundance : although not accounted so rich in quality, it is more 
delicate in flavour than the trout of the Blackadder. Though the 
Whitadder and Blackadder unite their streams a few miles below 
Dunse after their union retaining the name of Whitadder, the 
quality of the trout remains quite distinct ; and salmon is seldom 
known to enter the Blackadder, although at their junction there 
is no remarkable difference in their size. 

Pheasants were introduced into the woods at Dunse Castle, 
about twenty years ago, and abound there' and in the neighbouring 
plantations. 

II. — Civil History. 

The original charter erecting Dunse into a burgh of barony was 
granted in the year 1489 by James IV. A charter was also grant- 
ed by James VI. to Cuthbert Home in Dunse of nine acres of 
land, and " confirmand ane charter yrof granted to him by Sir 
Hugh Hudson, Chaplane of the alter of the Virgin Marye in 
Dunse, dated 1584." 

Eminent Men. — As far as tradition is entitled to any credit, 
John Duns Scotus, Doctor Subtilis, appears to have been a native of 
this parish. His father was a younger son of Duns of Grueldykes, 
a cadet of Duns of that ilk, and the house in which he is said to have 
been born was situated in the old town of Duns, near the gate leading 
to Dunse Castle. Alarge stone, now forming part of a park wall, has 
been pointed out from generation to generation as having belonged 
to the house in which he was born. There are different accounts 
as to the date of this extraordinary man's birth, — some placing 
it in the year 1265, and others in 1274. All agree that he early 
entered into a monastery of Franciscan or Gray friars, but all are 
not equally agreed whether at Newcastle or Dumfries ; whence he 



DUNSK. 



251 



went to prosecute bis studies at Merton College, in the University 
ol' Oxford, where he acquired a fellowship, and was advanced in 
1301 to the University Professorship of Theology. By command 
of the general of his Order, he went to Paris in 1304 to defend his 
doctrine of the immaculate conception; which he did with great 
applause. He was sent on the same mission to Cologne in 1308, 
where he died on the 8th of November in the same year. His 
works are collected into twelve bulky folios, of which the most per- 
fect edition was printed at Lyons in 1629. Long after his decease 
the disputes of the Scotists and Thomists continued to disturb the 
peace of the Christian church, and to exercise the perverted inge- 
nuity of churchmen. 

This parish has also produced men distinguished by their piety, 
and by their scientific, literary, and moral attainments. Among 
these, as elsewhere noticed, the Rev. Thomas Boston, the author 
of the Fourfold State and Sermons, was born at Dunse in 1676, 
and died at Etterick in 1732. 

Abraham Robertson, LL. D., Savilian Professor of Astronomy 
at Oxford, who also presided at the Board of Longitude, was born 
in 1751, of parents in a humble condition of life in the town of 
Dunse ; and, after arriving by the diligent application of his talents 
at high distinction in mathematical science, died at Oxford in 1826, 
as much distinguished by his unaffected modesty and other moral 
qualities as by his scientific attainments. 

The Rev. Thomas M'Crie, D. D., author of the life of John Knox, 
and other admirable historical works, was born at Dunse in 1773. 

This parish was alsothe birth-place of the Rev. James Gray, 
formerly one of the Masters of the High School of Edinburgh, 
and afterwards admitted to holy orders in the Church of England. 
He was appointed to perform the duties of his office at Cutch, in 
the East Indies, and at the same time to direct the education of the 
prince of that country ; but was cut off in 1830, while zealously em- 
ployed in translating the Holy Scriptures into the Cutchee and 
Hindostanee, and composing the first grammar and dictionary which 
had ever been attempted of the Cutch language. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial register of baptisms has 
been kept since 5th February 1615. The register is now regularly 
kept ; but was not so in former times. It consists of the following 
volumes : 

1, from 1615 to 1G6G 4, from 17-2.5 to 1778

There are five vohimes of alphabetical indices to the above, 
from 1615 to 1832. 

The record of the kirk-session commences in 1720, and is con- 
tinued in two volumes to 1738; after which it is discontinued till 
1797, when the present incumbent was ordained. — There are also a 
record of deaths or rather funerals, and a record of marriages, com- 
mencing at, and continued from, the above date, 1797. 

Antiquities. Edinshall. — Till within a recent period this parish 
could bo£ist, if the writer of the present article be not mistaken, 
of possessing perhaps the only specimen of the architecture of the 
first Saxon invaders of Britain, which has been preserved till mo- 
dern times in the southern part of Scotland. Within these forty 
years, the stones of this singular monument of antiquity were used 
as materials for fences, and the foundations only can now be traced. 
We shall describe, however, the building as it appeared before its 
final demohtion, and shall state the reasons for attributing it to the 
era mentioned. 

The ruins referred to bear the name of Edinshall. They are 
situated about a mile east from Abbey St Bathans on the northern 
slope of Cockburn-Law, where this hill stretches into a terrace of 
inconsiderable size, skirted by steep banks descending to the river 
Whitadder, which is distant about 200 yards. The building was 
circular, the outside diameter being 85 feet 10 inches, and the 
walls 15 feet 10 inches thick. The height of the walls, which, 
in their ruinous state, was seven or eight feet, must originally have 
been considerable, as appeared from the large quantity of mate- 
rials rolled down the bank on which they stood, and lodging in the 
area they enclosed. In the interior of the walls were open spaces, 
having the appearance of separate cells, extending all round the 
building, differing greatly in length, but all of the width of about 
three feet, and presenting in some places an appearance of having 
been arched over. The entrance was by a low narrow door on the 
eastern side. No cement had been used in the building ; but the 
stones, which were of whin, and most of them very large, were fitted 
with considerable accuracy to one another, — the concavity of the one 

• These dimensions were ascertained when tlic building was extant by Mr John 
Blackadder, an accurate land-surveyor. In the descriptions oF this ruin, contained in 
the first Statistical Account and in Clialmcrs' Caledonia, wliich seem botii to have 
been copied from an article in the Scots Magazine tor 17G4, Vol. xxvi. p. 431, it 
is said that the building consisted of three concentric circles. This, however, is a 
mistake ; for allliougli two circles could be traced, in consequence of the walls having 
been divided by tlie nearly continuous cells mentioned in tlie text, there was no thiid 
interior wall.

receiving the convexity of the other, and the interstices being filled 
up with small stones. On the east and south of the principal 
tower, were the foundations of several oblong buildings, and of a 
single round one. To the south of the whole were trenches of 
considerable depth, surmounted on both sides by walls of stone and 
earth, one of which, after running in a westerly direction for fifty 
or sixty yards, turned northward, and followed the sweep of the hill 
till it reached the river. 

From the description now given of the principal tower of 
Edinshall, never entitled to the name of a tower from its height, 
but only from its circular form, it will be perceived that this build- 
ing is similar in construction to those called burghs in Orkney and 
Shetland, and Duns in the Highlands of Scotland, where the re- 
mains of many of them are still to be seen.  Indeed, the only dif- 
ference consists in the nature of the spaces in the interior of the 
walls, — which in Edinshall seem composed of separate cells, while in 
the similar buildings they are continuous passages ; but this dis- 
similarity is apparent only, because the upper part of the walls 
and the roof of the hollow spaces in Edinshall having fallen down, 
had partially filled up the passage, which went entirely along the 
interior of the wall, and had thus divided that passage into what 
seemed to be separate compartments. This supposition derives 
confirmation from the fact, that most of these cells had no en- 
trances, and it may safely be assumed that they were not origi- 
nally constructed in that form. 

Now it is known that the buildings called Burghs or Duns 
were the workmanship of the ancient Scandinavians, and that the 
kind of architecture of which they are examples was common to 
that nation with the Saxons and other northern tribes. Hence it 
may be inferred, that Edinshall was built by one of those tribes ; 
and, as it bore the name of Edwin, the most celebrated king of the 
Northumbrian Saxons, and as it was situated within his territo- 
ries, which extended from the Humber to the Forth, we may con- 
clude that he was the builder of Edinshall. In that case, it must 
have been erected between the years 617 and 633, the period of 
Edwin's reign. 

This conclusion derives confirmation from other circumstances. 
In King Edwin's time, the mode of architecture of his tribe

could not have undei-gone any change, because his father, Ella, 
was the first of his house who settled here, and because in the 
interim the arts of peace were not cultivated. It is recorded, 
too, that the art of building with mortar or cement was not intro- 
duced into Britain till after this time, — the first Saxon buildings of 
stone and lime having been the monastery of Weremouth, found- 
ed in 674, and the Cathedral of Hexham erected soon after- 
wards, — both constructed by masons and artificers brought from 
abroad. 

The situation of Edinshall is neither strong in itself, nor fitted 
to protect any part of the adjoining country. From this fact, it 
may be inferred that the building was designed not so much for a 
military station as a place of residence or a court of justice. 
Hence it does not bear the name of burgh, which signifies a 
castle, but that of hall, which means a palace or a court. 

It is now generally admitted that the present metropolis of Scot- 
land was founded by the same prince to whom we have attributed 
the erection of Edinshall. 

On the summit of Dunse-Law are the vestiges of the entrenched 
camp occupied by General Leslie and 20,000 Covenanters in May 
1639, — for the purpose of opposing a threatened invasion of Scot- 
land by King Charles, who, wishing to impose Episcopacy on the 
Scottish nation, had advanced with a great force to Birks, seven 
miles beyond Berwick. Matters were, however, accommodated 
without bloodshed at that time, by an agreement, with which nei- 
ther party seems to have been quite satisfied, or in which neither, 
of course, was quite sincere. There was found in Dunse Castle, 
between thirty and forty years ago, a copy of the Solemn League 
and Covenant, which was most probably sworn and signed on that 
occasion, and left there by some of the Scottish nobles who were 
parties to the accommodation, and occupied the castle, while their 
troops were encamped on the neighbouring hill. 

In the turbulent times of 1517, during the minority of King 
James V. and the absence of the Regent Duke of Albany in France, 
a deed of atrocity was perpetrated on Sir Anthony D'Arcy, also 
denominated the Chevalier de la Beaute, at a morass called, from 
the name of the sufferer. Battles' Bog, on the line which di- 
vides the parish of Dunse from that of Edrom, on the north-east. 
The Chevalier, in performing the duties of Lord Warden of the 
marches, acting with much severity, had incurred the displeasure

of the laird of Wedderburn, who was also exasperated by the re- 
cent murder of his chief, the Earl of Home, though under the pro- 
tection of an invitation by the Regent Albany to Edinburgh. The 
warden being worsted by the Homes, fled unattended towards Dun- 
bar, pursued by the laird of Wedderburn. His horse being swamped 
in the bog, he continued his flight on foot, but was overtaken by 
his adversary, who cut off his head, and carried it, fastened to his 
saddle girth by the hair, in triumph to the Castle of Wedderburn. 
As the bog is on the confines of the parishes of Dunse and Edrom, 
and the deed was done in the parish of Edrom, while the perpe- 
trator was a distinguished person in the parish of Dunse, the dis- 
credit of it falls in some measure on both ; and it is, perhaps, in- 
cumbent on the writers of the statistics of both parishes to record 
the atrocious fact. 

Modern Buildijigs. — These are, — Dunse Castle, a very splendid 
edifice, in the Gothic style of architecture, the greater part modern, 
but added to an ancient tower said to have been built by Randolph, 
Earl of Murray. — Wedderburn Castle, a very elegant building, in 
the Grecian style of architecture. — Manderston, also a fine man- 
sion, situated in a lawn, and adorned with a lake and other embel- 
lishments. — The town-house of Dunse, a modern building, the 
foundation stone of which was laid in 1816, in the Gothic style of 
architecture. The present church was built in the year 1790. It is 
as remarkable for the plainness of its exterior as for its neatness and 
commodiousness within. The Saxon pillars and arches of the old 
church, which it replaced, indicated its antiquity. From a date on 
the gallery, called the Burgess-loft, it seemed to have been repaired 
.in 1572. 

The estate and patronage of the church belonged in early times 
to Duns of that ilk, and were granted by Robert the Bruce to Ran- 
dolph, Earl of Murray. The latter granted a charter in 131 6 to the 
monks of Newbattle, with an annuity of two merks out of the lands 
of Kingside. The charter was dated " apud Parcum de Duns," 
in the king's presence,— Patrick Earl of March, Sir James Dou- 
glas, and several persons of note, being also present.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — This parish, which is partly 
in Lammermoor, contains about 12,000 acres. About 6000 acres 
are arable, 1000 underwood, and the remainder hill pasture. The 
arable land is highly cultivated, being all enclosed, limed, and 
drained, and generally let in leases of nineteen years. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of the southern part of the 
parish is nearly L.2, 10s. per imperial acre; the remainder L. 1, 5s. 
The hill pasture is of very little value. 

Husbandry. — Nearly the whole of the arable land is a dry sandy 
loam, and well adapted for the raising of turnips. It is managed 
partly in a four-course shift, and partly in a five, viz. first, turnips; 
second, barley; third, pasture; fourth, oats, or two years pasture. 

Rate of Wages. — On the different farms almost all the servants 
are paid partly in corn and partly in money, — they having a cow 
maintained all the year. Servants paid in this manner appear to 
live better than those who are paid entirely in money.

sheep, and Hampshire pigs, have been introduced for many years, 
— the chief excellence of which consists in their coming to a state 
of full size and fatness in less than half the time required for 
the native breed, and so more speedily remunerating the skill and 
industry of the breeder. These are reared mostly for the Eng- 
lish market, and the labouring-class of consumers at home, — while 
the Kyloe or Highland oxen and the black-faced or Cheviot sheep, 
kept to a more mature age, are chiefly fattened for the use of those 
who can afford a somewhat higher price at home. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Mm'kets. — There is a weekly market in Dunse every Wednes- 
day, at which little business is done. The principal market-town 
is Berwick, distant about fifteen miles. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post twice a-day to Lon- 
don, and once to Edinburgh. There is also a daily coach to Edin- 
burgh. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, conveniently situated for the 
parish in general, is in good repair, and affords accommodation to 
about 1200 persons. The manse was built in the year 1780, and 
has undergone no general repair since, but is kept in good habit- 
able condition. The extent of the glebe is between nine and ten 
acres, and its value about L. 35 or L. 40 a-year. The stipend was 
augmented in 1833 to 20 chalders, — one-half meal, one-half bar- 
leys with L. 10 for communion elements. 

There are three dissenting chapels in this parish, — two of the 
United Associate, and one of the Relief. The stipends are paid 
by the congregations. ' 

The number of families attending the Established church is 
390; attending the dissenting chapels, 446. Divine service is, 
with as few exceptions as in most places, well attended in the Esta- 
blished church and in the chapels. The number of communicants 
in the Established church averages nearly 600. 

Education. — There is one parochial school in the parish, at- 
tended at an average by 120 children. The schoolmaster, who 
has all the usual emoluments, is qualified to teach the English, 
French, Latin, and Greek languages, writing, arithmetic, book- 
keeping, the principles of mathematics, and geography. He is 
diligent, and successful in communicating instruction. His salary 
is the maximum L. 34, 4s. 4d. The average amount of school-

fees for the last 3 years is L. 70 per annum ; and the average of 
his fees as session-clerk is L. 8. 

There is also a very respectable and flourishing institution, in 
which the above-mentioned branches of education are taught by 
one licentiate of the Church of Scotland, assisted by another. They 
at present, with much ability and success, superintend the educa- 
tion of twenty boarders, and of about thirty other pupils in the 
town and neighbourhood, to whose instruction, conduct, and com- 
fort, every possible attention is given. Besides these, there are 
six schools for the education of boys and girls, who are well taught 
in all the ordinary branches of education. Religious instruction 
is communicated by reading the scriptures and catechising. There 
are two respectable schools for female education, — one of them a 
boarding-school, well entitled to every degree of encouragement, 
and both of them well taught in everything useful and ornamental 
required in the middling ranks of life, as well as in religion and 
morals. There are several sewing-schools for young females in 
an inferior condition of life. All, except the parochial school, are 
supported entirely by fees for instruction. 

Some Sunday schools are taught by persons of the labouring 
classes under the superintendence of their ministers. It is said 
that those for whose benefit they are chiefly intended, the children 
of negligent parents, seldom attend, there being no compulsatory 
power to enforce attendance. 

The people are generally alive to the benefits of education. 
The heritors pay the school fees for those parents, the poverty of 
whose circumstances has been ascertained. 

Savings Bank. — There has been a Savings Bank for Dunse and 
the contiguous parishes existing for a good many years, but in a 
very languishing state. 

Literature. — A subscription library was commenced in 1768. 
There are also two circulating libraries, and a reading-room for 
newspapers. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor on 
the roll is 130 : they receive from Is. to 3s. per week. The legal 
assessment for the poor amounts to L. 710 yearly, and is their sole 
supply, except a small sum from the collections, which are much 
reduced by the heavy assessments. Collections, mortcloth, and mar- 
riage-fees may amount to L. 18 or L. 19. L. 100 was bequeath- 
ed to the poor by General James Dickson of the Honourable East 
India Company's service, the interest of which is divided yearly

amono- those who have a claim. It is a very remarkable circum- 
stance, that during the year ending in December 1830, only one per- 
son died who had a claim on the fund, and that, from May 1830 
to July 1831, no pauper died, though their ages averaged sixty- 
one years. 

Dr Abraham Robertson, LL.D., mentioned among the distin- 
guished natives of this town, whose moral worth was equal to his 
scientific attainments, settled annuities of L. 10 on five poor fe- 
male cousins in the humble rank of life from which he sprung, 
and whose infirmities, arising from old age, reduced them to the 
necessity of receiving supply from the poor's fund ; for which an- 
nuities he paid L. 450. 

In the year 1826, Alexander Christie, Esq. of Grueldykes, a 
native of, and a liberal benefactor to, the town of Dunse, bequeath- 
ed to the poor on the roll of the parish of Dunse, a sum equal to 
the sum to which they should be entitled from the roll for two years 
after his decease. His intention evidently was to prevent the in- 
terference of the heritors of the parish with his bequest, — the dispo- 
sal of which, however, would be attended with this evident con- 
sequence, that, if the poor should receive double aliment for two 
years, they would feel their privations, and be consequently more 
discontented after it was withdrawn, than if they had never received 
that benefit. Some of the heritors suggested the plan of re- 
ducing the aliment on the roll to one-half during these two years, 
and taking the other half from the legacy. But Mr Christie's 
heirs declared their determination to reject that proposal, though 
it would have saved them one-half of the legacy, because they 
thought that such a plan would evade the intention of the testator. 
Another mode, however, was contrived and carried into effect, — by 
which the whole poor on the roll having claims, on condition of re- 
ceiving a certain sum in hand, disposed to George Peat, Esq. 
Sheriff-substitute, and James Bell, Esq. Sheriff-clerk of Berwick- 
shire, William Cunningham, Esq. bailie of Dunse, the Rev. George 
Cunningham, minister, and James Watson, Esq. writer, the whole 
remaining sum, to which, when accumulated, they might have claim, 
— that sum amounting to above L. 700 : and the interest was to be 
divided annually among the survivors at the beginning of each suc- 
cessive year: no one to receive more than L. 10 per annum. As, 
however, no provision is made for the disposal of the above L. 700, 
when those having claims may have died out ; and as it is not stated 
whether the trustees act in their official or their individual capa-

city, nor whether they can appoint successors, — this plan does not 
obviate, but only postpones, the difficulty respecting the ultimate 
disposal of the fund. 

The late Charles Marjoribanks, Esq. M. P. for Berwickshire, be- 
queathed first L. 10 and afterwards L. 100 to the poor of Dunse, to 
be at the disposal of the minister. By far the greater part of this 
is already distributed, and the rest is in the course of distribu- 
tion. 

Two Friendly Societies were iristituted in 1780, and one in 1790. 
They still exist, though not founded on the most approved princi- 
ples of calculation. The Berwickshire Farmers' Widows' Fund, 
from that cause, has almost sunk under its own weight. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs annually held in Dunse, — one in 
June, another in August, and another in November, for cattle and 
horses ; and four quarterly markets for sheep, held in March, May, 
July, and September. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most remarkable variation between the present state of the 
parish and neighbourhood, and that which existed at the time of 
the last Statistical Account, is in the rent of land. Land which 
then let at 15s. and 7s. per acre, now lets at L. 2, 10s. and L. 1, 5s. 
per acre. Every improvement in the system of husbandry is speedily 
adopted.

PRESBYTERY OF CIIIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER CHRISTISON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
J:s[ame. — There is a tradition that the parish of Foulden, or 
Fulden, received its name from some foul transaction, of which it 
was the scene during the border feuds. This origin of the name, 
however, does not satisfy etymologists, of whom some hold that it 
refers to the former marshiness, and others, to the fertility of the 
parish. 

Extent, Boundaries. — It is 2 miles and 2 furlongs in length, and 
2 miles and I furlongs in breadth, and is of a compact form. 
The northern conterminous parish is Ayton ; the western, Chirn- 
side ; the southern, Hutton ; and the eastern, Mordington. The 
southern extremity is traced by the river Whitadder ; which is here 
remarkable for the depth of its bed, insomuch that its banks are 
from 120 to 150 feet in height. The hither bank is often inter- 
rupted by deep and wild ravines, some of which wind fully a mile 
northward. Traversing the parish from south to north, one meets 
first with a strong clay, then with a sandy loam, and lastly with 
cultivated moor. 

Climate. — As Foulden is highly cultivated in an agricultural point 
of view, as plantations and a chain of heights shelter it from every 
inclement blast, and as it slopes gently and continuously from its 
northern to its southern extremity, its people ought to be very 
healthy. Yet the former Statistical Account, founding, no doubt, 
on inadequate data, gives a very exaggerated representation of the 
salubrity of the parish. During my connection with it, malignant 
small-pox, scarlet fever, and influenza have prevailed in it. In 
the year 1827, eleven of its inhabitants died; and the average- 
yearly mortality since has been five. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — Four-fifths of the land is the property of John 
Wilkie, Esq. of Foulden : the rest belongs to Geo. Baillie, Esq. 



262 



BERWICKSHIllE. 



of Jerviswoode, and to Miss Wood of Nunlands. Nunlands is the 
least estate, but far above L. 50 in yearly value. 

Historical Notices. — On the 24th March 1587, a conference 
was held in Foulden church between commissioners sent by 
Elizabeth of England to Scotland, and others appointed by our 
James VI. At this meeting were discussed the circumstances 
which, according to Elizabeth, vindicated her treatment of Mary, 
and, in particular, her execution. 

Antiquities. — The only antiquity in Foulden which merits no- 
tice is an epitaph in the church-yard, dated 4th January 1592. 
The person whom it commemorates must have been of some dis- 
tinction ; for traditionary accounts of his forays are still extant. 
The epitaph is highly interesting as an excellent example of the 
quaintness of thought and style, so universal at the time at which 
it was written.

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers have suffered mu- 
tilation, and had been long kept in a very slovenly manner. The 
earliest entry is dated 13th April 1682. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population was 465 ; in 1793, it was 344 ; and, ac- 
cording to a census taken by me in July last, it was 395. Of the 
present population, 196 are males, and 199 are females : 73 reside 
in Foulden village, — the only village in the parish ; and 322 in the 
country : 4 are bachelors or widowers above fifty years of age ; 
and 8 are single women upwards of 45 : 1, a very old woman, is 
blind; and 1 is fatuous. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is 9 ; of 
deaths, 5 ; and of marriages, 3. 

The number of families in the parish Is - - - - 78 

of families chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 55 

chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 12

fallen into total disuse. One of these obsolete games I may par- 
ticularize, on account of the singularity of the goals. It was cele- 
brated, along with many others, on Eastern's eve. The villagers 
were opposed to the inhabitants of the country ; a large ball was 
tossed into the air midway between the parish church and mill ; 
and this the former strove to lodge in the church pulpit, and the 
latter in the mill-happer. An ancient and odd, but local usage, 
called creeling, is still kept up here. On an early evening after a 
newly-married couple have commenced house-keeping, the young 
men of the parish repair to their house; invite the bridegroom out, 
or, if he refuses, take the first opportunity of laying hold on him, 
and place a creel laden with stones on his back, with which he has 
to pace up and down, till the bride comes forth, and, cutting the 
cords, disencumbers him. By this ceremony are shadowed forth 
the cares which a man incurs by marrying, but of which it is in the 
power of a dutiful wife to lighten him. A gratuity, however, is 
given by all who can pay it, rather than be creeled. I presume 
that the actual load of matrimony is considered quite enough to be 
borne without the addition of this symboHcal one. 

At the morning and evening meals of the peasantry, their staple 
is oatmeal porridge and milk ; their dinner consists of bread made 
from pease and barley, and of potatoes, seasoned with fat pork. 
Each family feeds at least two pigs a-year. Tea is getting more 
and more into use, and especially among the female heads of fami- 
lies ; a change which, from its cost, and for other obvious reasons, 
is much to be regretted. The peasantry here, — as throughout the 
county, — are religious and moral; and, in particular, there is scarce- 
ly an instance of habitual intemperance. 

Irregularity of marriage, from the facility and secrecy with which 
it can be contracted on the border, is very common. This has both 
its advantages and its evils ; an illegitimate birth, on the one hand, 
very seldom happening ; but, on the other hand, improvident and 
ill-assorted matches being often made. 

Though favourably circumstanced in respect of the comforts and 
advantages of society, and not discontented with their condition, 
yet emigration is remarkably prevalent. There is a general mis- 
apprehension, respecting the description of emigrants from among 
our rural population. From this parish, at least, they, for the most 
part, have been the robust, the enterprising, and the provident ; 
they have been eminently successful ; and the accounts sent home 
by them of their prosperity have extended the emigratory spirit.

IV. — Industry. 

The number of acres, standard imperial measure, in the parish 
IS 2976. 330 acres have never been under the plough, and are in 
pasture ; the rest are arable, with the exception of 260, which are 
planted. Part of the wood in the vicinity of Foulden House is very 
old ; but the great bulk of it is of recent origin. The trees planted 
are oak, ash, elm, birch, sycamore, chesnut, spruce and Scotch fir. 

Rent of Land. — The highest rent of arable land per acre is L. 4, 
and the lowest is L. 1, 7s. 

Twelve years is the general duration of leases. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of a single farm-servant, living in 
his master's house, are L. 5 for the summer, and L. 4 for the win- 
ter ; those of a female are L. 5 for the one, and L. 2, 2s, for the 
other. The wages of a hind for the year are L. 4 in money, 10 
bolls oats, 3 bolls barley, 1 boll pease or beans, 1600 yards of po- 
tatoes, a cow's food, and the cartage of his coals. His gains this 
year are valued at L. 21, 2s. He pays rent for his cottage, and 
this he does Jby providing one shearer. He is required to keep a 
bondager. The wages of a day-labourer are 9s. per week. 

Produce. — 

The average gross amount of wheat is 1416 bolls. 

barley, 1865 do. 
oats, 3633 do. 
beans, 451 do. 

The value of the wheat, according to the fiars of last spring, is L. 2360 0 0 

barley, - - - 1748 8 0 

oats, - - - 2452 0 0

The total yearly value of raw produce raised is - L. 10517 8 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Berwick, which is five miles distant; 
it is also the nearest post-town. 

Means of Communication. — The want of a bridge across the 
Whitadder the nearest being five miles distant, and of a more 
gradual access to the river, has been long and much felt. This, 
however, is soon to be remedied. The plan of a bridge, and of a 
very preferable line of road to it, have been procured from Mr Jar- 
dine, civil-engineer ; and towards defraying the cost, which is es- 
timated at L. 2500, there have been subscribed from the bridge 
money of the county L. 500, and by the gentry L. 1500. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church was built in 1786. It 



FOULDEN. 



265 



is placed in the heart of the parish, is in excellent repair, and the 
interior might be seated so as to accommodate the whole popula- 
tion. The manse was built in 1772 ; an addition was made to it 
in 1813. The site of the church and manse is peculiarly beauti- 
ful ; sheltered to the east and north by the stately and ancient trees 
within the pleasure grounds of Foulden House ; while the view to 
the south and west is rich and varied, and only bounded by the 
Cheviots and Eildons. The glebe is 8 acres in extent, and is let 
for L. 24 annually. The stipend is L. 59, 9s. 3d. 38 b. 2 f. 2 p. 
2f 1. barley, and 77 b. 1 f. 1 p. H 1- oats. Those in connection 
with the Established church are 284, and the communicants at the 
last dispensation of the sacrament were 160. There are 106 Se- 
ceders, and 3 Catholics. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in the parish. 
The teacher has the legal accommodations, and the highest salary. 
The quarterly school fees are 7s. 6d. for Latin, Greek, and ma- 
thematics; 5s. for arithmetic; 4s. for reading and writing; and 3s. 
for reading alone. The yearly amount of fees actually paid is 
L. 10; and of other emoluments, L. 10. Education is universal, 
and duly appreciated. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are 12 paupers, and their 
average monthly allowance is 8s. 2d. This is entirely defrayed by 
assessment; the church collections, with the exception of the sa- 
cramental ones, going to pay the precentor, beadle, and session- 
clerk. Repugnance to apply for parochial relief is very little felt, 
— the inevitable consequence of compulsory assessments; which, 
nevertheless, under due regulations, is the best, and the only equit- 
able mode of supporting the necessitous. 

Inns, Sfc. — There are no inns, alehouses, &amp;c. in the parish. For- 
merly two fairs were held at the village, and were much resorted 
to ; but now one only is held, and that, too, but nominally. The 
principal fuel is coal ; which is procured at Berwick, and costs 6d. 
per boll. A cart load, such as one horse can draw, is delivered 
for 6s. 7ld. 

Upon the whole, the parish of Foulden has fully kept pace in 
improvement and embellishment with the rest of Berwickshire, since 
the last Statistical Account of it was written.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. ALEX. CUTHBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The ancient name of this parish was Aderham. It is 
still called Etherham by the commonalty. Ader comes from the 
Cambro-British word Awedur, signifying running water, and ham 
in Anglo-Saxon, signifies a village. Aderham is thus the village, 
on the banks of the Ader. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The extreme length of the parish is 7 
miles; extreme breadth, 4 miles; mean length, 5 miles; mean 
breadth, 2|- miles; extent in square miles, ISf.  It is bounded 
on the west by the parishes of Dunse, Langton, and Polwarth ; 
on the south by Fogo, Swinton, and Whitsome ; on the east by 
Hutton and Chirnside ; and on the north by Buncle. The country 
is generally flat. 

The climate in this part of the country is now very good. Ague, 
which about forty years ago, before the practice of draining became 
general, was very prevalent, is now never heard of. 

Hydrography. — There is a mineral well in this parish called the 
Dunse Spa. It is situated in a valley which lies nearly a mile on 
the south side of Dunse, on the estate of Nisbet. This well was 
discovered accidentally in 1747. It was a place of very general 
resort for a considerable time ; but has long ceased to be so. A 
very full account of the composition and virtues of this water has 
been given by Dr Francis Home, in a treatise published in Edin- 
burgh, 1751. The well, however, is now entirely out of repute. 
There is likewise a mineral well on the estate of Blackadder, in a 
ravine near the banks of the Blackadder, and not far from the bridge 
on the eastern approach to Blackadder House from Allanton, — 

• I am indebted for this measurement, and for various other jiarticulars relative 
to the Blackadder and Wiiitadder, and the extent of arable land in the parish, woods, 
&amp;c. to Mr John Blacka-.ldcr, land-surveyor, Dlancrnc, East Side. 



EDROM. 



267 



which some of the old residenters in Allanton resorted to in their 
younger days, and found beneficial in many instances. They call 
it the "Vertur" Well, meaning, probably, the well whose water 
has a medicinal virtue. 

The Whitadder bounds the parish on the north side, and runs 
the whole extent of the parish from west to east. The altitude of 
its source above the medium sea level is supposed to be 1150 feet ; 
fall per mile, 32 feet, 10 inches; breadth, 35 yards. Length of 
Whitadder in Edrom parish, 6 miles ; greatest height of Whit- 
adder in flood 9 feet above the ordinary level; average fall of 
Whitadder through. Edrom parish, 23 feet per mile. From 
Broomhouse, the upper part of the parish, to the lower extremity 
of the parish, the fall of the Whitadder is 149 feet. It runs into 
the Tweed about two miles from Berwick. 

The length of the Blackadder water is 19 miles; supposed altitude 
at its source 1 1 30 feet above the medium sea level ; length within the 
parish of Edrom 6 miles, flowing in a north-east direction, divid- 
ing the parish into two equal parts nearly; breadth, 17 yards. The 
Blackadder falls into the Whitadder at the village of Allanton, in 
this parish. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There is a shell-marl bog on the estate 
of Kimmerghame. The bog is of considerable extent : greatest 
depth 15 feet. Machinery has been lately erected for draining 
off" the water, and a very considerable quantity of marl has been 
taken from it; price Is. per cart load. A cubic yard of this 
marl is equal to a boll of lime. It does not operate so readily 
as lime, but it is more durable in its influence. In working the 
marl, several beavers' heads one nearly entire were found, and 
some deers' horns. One head was nearly complete, and was sent 
to Dr Barclay in Edinburgh. 

The rocks of this parish belong to a formation, the characters 
of which have not yet been precisely determined. It has not been 
ascertained whether they are members of the new red sandstone 
group, or are the lowermost beds of the Durham coal field. Va- 
rious facts may be adduced in support of these two theories, but it 
seems probable that they are of older date than the strata of the 
Durham coal field, and are a fresh water deposit. 

The rocks consist chiefly of clay, marl, and sandstone ; the first of 
these composing, perhaps, about two-thirds of the whole. The marl 
strata are in thin beds, never exceeding two or three feet in thickness. 
The sandstones are generally of a whitish colour, and sometimes ex- 



268 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



ceed twenty or thirty feet in thickness, as at Puttenmill, Kimmerg- 
hame, Greenknows. All the strata dip to the south-east, at a small 
angle of inclination, except at the west end of the parish, where they 
have been upraised by a trap dike. A good section of these rocks, 
as affected by this cause, may be seen at the junction with the 
Whittadder, of the small burn which runs past Cumledge, about a 
mile below Preston bridge. The strata are there elevated at an 
angle of about 50°. The basis or lowermost beds of the Berwick- 
shire marl strata may be seen at the turn of the Whitadder, above 
the point last described. Beyond this point, the strata consist 
entirely of red sandstones resting on a conglomerate, which some 
geologists have described as belonging to the old red sandstone 
group. 

The only fossils discovered among the rocks of this parish, and 
contemporaneous with their formation, are vegetables. The re- 
mains of neither shells nor animals have yet been found. The ve- 
getable fossils are very much the same as found in the Mid- Lothian 
and Northumberland coal fields, consisting of impressions of Equi- 
setse, &amp;c. But besides these, an extensive deposit of fossil or 
petrified trees has lately been discovered, which, upon a botani- 
cal examination of their structure, seem to belong to the Coni- 
fer se. The water-worn appearance of the trunks, and the total ab- 
sence of branches and leaves, lead to the opinion that they have 
been transported to their present situation by the force of running 
water. It is no small confirmation of this opinion, that these fos- 
sils are found imbedded in a thick deposit of blue clay, which was 
most probably thrown down by water in a state of mud. The 
bark which envelopes these ancient trees has been converted into 
a black coal, probably from the original bark having been deprived 
of its bituminous matter. 

There are in this district, the strongest proofs of the effects of 
the deluge, that vast flood by which our mountains were submerged, 
and the plains strewed with the records of its violence. Immense 
boulders or erratic blocks may be seen in the alluvial soil that is 
cut through by the river courses, which cannot have been derived 
except from hills at a great distance. Among these boidders, there 
are some of mica-slate, a rock which does not occur nearer than 
Cumberland, from the mountains of which these rolled masses 
were probably torn and transported. The direction in which, as 
thus indicated, the waters of the deluge flowed, viz. from south- 



EDROM. 



269 



west to north-east, the reader will perceive, agrees entirely with 
the proofs otherwise and elsewhere derived as to the violence, ex- 
tent, and direction of the diluvial flood. Several specimens of 
these mica-slate boulders have been found at Blanerne east side. 

Notwithstanding the abundance of marl and clay in this parish, 
we are not aware that gypsum has been found in it, as in other 
parishes where the same formation occurs. 

11. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — The grave of Sir Anthony Darcy, sur- 
named Le Sieur de la Beaute, is in a field on the estate of Broom- 
house, in this parish, — called De la Beaute's field. Sir Anthony 
Darcy, commonly named Anthony de la Bastie, properly De la 
Beaute was a Frenchman, and was appointed by the Duke of Albany 
Warden of the Marches, and captain of Dunbar Castle, in the room 
of Lord Home, — when the Duke, who was regent in the minority 
of James V., went to France, June 1517. Lord Home had been 
treacherously decoyed to Edinburgh, and put to death, together 
with his brother William, as was supposed, by the instigation of 
Darcy. This rendered Darcy odious in the Merse. A dispute 
having arisen between him and David Home, the laird of Wedder- 
burn, Darcy and his party were attacked by the laird of Wedder- 
burn and his associates near Langton, October 12, 1517, and put 
to flight. Darcy's horse stuck fast in a bog in the end of Dunse 
Moor, — which obliged him to fly on foot. He was overtaken by 
Wedderburn at Broomhouse, who slew him, and carrying his head 
in triumph through Dunse, fixed it on the battlements of Home 
Castle. A cairn marks out the grave of Darcy. 

One of the largest meetings of the Covenanters took place at 
East Nisbet, in this parish, subsequently called Allanbank, and 
now called Bighouse, in 1674. They were convened for the pur- 
pose of celebrating the Lord's Supper. They assembled on the 
banks of the Whitadder, about one mile south of Chirnside, where 
3200 communicated. The Rev. Mr Blackadder, Mr Welsh, Mr 
Riddel, Mr Rae, and Mr Dickson officiated. The Earl of Home 
threatened an attack upon them, but the meeting passed off" with- 
out molestation. 

Parochial Registers. — The early registers of this parish have 

A particular account, of all the circumstances wliich led to the death of Darcy

been lost. The only account which I have heard of them is, that 
they were accidentally burned a long time ago. The register of 
baptisms commences in 1720; register of marriages, in 1783. In 
the register of burials, there are only a few entries. In all of the 
registers, there are mutilations till 1801, — from which period the re- 
gister of births and baptisms has been regularly kept. This re- 
gister, however, is far from being complete in regard to births. 

Land-oioners. — There are nine landed proprietors. George Lo- 
gan, Esq. of Edrom ; John Carnegie, Esq. of New Edrom ; Co- 
lonel Home of Broomhouse ; George Buchan, Esq. of Kelloe ; 
Alexander Dudgeon, Esq. of St Helens ; Miss Boswall of Black- 
adder; James Bonar, Esq. of Kimmergharae; Lord Sinclair of 
Nisbet; Major Mackay of Bighouse, formerly called East Nisbet, 
and afterwards Allanbank.

A considerable number of houses at AUanton, with gardens at- 
tached, are feus granted by the proprietor of Allanbank a consi- 
derable time ago. In ancient times, there were castles at Nisbet, 
Blackadder, and Broomhouse. Upon the property of Kelloe there 
is a square of cottages called Kelloe Bastle, — which was the site 
of the hastell, or keep, in ancient times. There were several build-- 
ings of this kind in this district. 

Mansion Houses. — The mansion house on the estate of Broom- 
house was built by the present proprietor. Colonel Home, in 1813, 
on the site of the ancient castle. Several skeletons were found in 
digging the foundation : and a stone coffin, with an entire skeleton, 
was discovered several years ago, in a field adjoining to that which 
contains the grave of Sir Anthony de la Beaute. — The mansion 
house of Nisbet is a fine old building, likewise in the castellated 
form. — Kimmerghame House is old, but its situation on the banks 
of the Blackadder is beautiful. On these banks are also situated 
the mansions of Kelloe, and Bighouse, and Blackadder House. At 
Blackadder House there is a conservatory in the form of a Gothic

chapel, the frame work of which is entirely of cast iron. Part of 
the glass is beautifully stained. It was erected by Thomas Bos- 
wall, Esq., the late proprietor, and cost several thousand pounds. 
The situation of Edrom House and the parish church is very beau- 
tiful. The lands all around are in a state of high cultivation, en- 
riched with plantations and hedge-rows ; and, in the distance, there 
are the upland scenery of Dunse Law, Cockburn Law, and the sweep 
of the Lammermoor Hills, and the Cheviots. 

Mills. — There are four corn-mills in the parish on the Black- 
adder Water, — Bighouse mill, Blackadder, Nisbet, and Kimmer- 
ghame. At Kimmerghame and Bighouse mill, there is conjoined 
to the corn-mill a saw-mill, where a good deal of wood is cut for 
rural purposes. 

Paper-Mills. — There are two paper-mills on the Whitadder. 
That of Broomhouse is on a very extensive scale. The number of 
hands employed is 56, male and female ; and the hours of work 
are ten per day. Printing-paper is chiefly manufactured. The 
people are healthy, sober, and every way decent in their conduct. 
At Allanbank paper-mill, binding boards are manufactured : and 
the number of hands employed is 25 for eight hours a-day. Men's 
wages are 14s. per week : women's, lOd. per day. The people here 
are equally correct in their conduct as those at the other paper-mill. 
— A lint-mill and a wheel-wright-mill are mentioned in the former 
Statistical Account; but these have been discontinued for a good 
many years.

from the village of Allanton, and some from the country part of 
the parish. 

Theje are two insane persons maintained by the parish at a 
weekly allowance. 

Habits of the People. — The people generally live in a very com- 
fortable manner. They are honest, contented, sober-minded, and

well-affected to both church and state. . Tliere are not many in- 
stances of poaching in game and salmon. About forty oi- fifty years 
ago there was a good deal of smuggling in this district, of brandy, 
gin, teas, &amp;c. ; but now this is entirely unknown.

Acres, 7579 

A considerable quantity of fir and hard-wood is cut yearly on 
some of the estates in the parish. On one estate the wood cut 
and sold for a considerable number of years past, has brought 
L. 300 per annum. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land per acre is about 
L. 1, 5s. ; the minimum price from 13s. to 15s. per acre; the best 
land L. 2 per acre; some very good land, L. 2, 10s. and upwards. 
The farms are in general large in this parish, and vary in rental 
from L. 400 to L. 1000. The rental of the parish at the time of 
the former Statistical Account was L. 6493 ; at present, it is about 
L. 15,200. The average rent for grazing a cow or an ox is about 
L.4. 

Husbandry. — The general length of leases is nineteen years ; 
and the general routine of cropping is a four or five years' course. 
The five-course system is now more generally followed. The four- 
course is too severe for most kinds of lands. 

The whole land in the parish is in a state of good cultivation, 
enclosed, and pretty well-drained ; and the practice of draining is 
kept up. A great many improvements have lately been made on 
the estate of Kimmerghame, as to farm-buildings, young planta- 
tions, &amp;c. ; and on the other estates, a similar spirit of improve- 
ment and attention to the comfort of the agricultural population 
have been evinced.

The ftirm buildings are in general good, the enclosures well 
kept, and the woods and plantations carefully managed. 

Sheep and cattle of various breeds are fed in the parish, besides 
those bred in it, viz. a cross between the Leicester ram and Che- 
viot ewe, and the north country kyloes. The practice of feeding 
cattle is more prevalent in this parish than that of breeding them. 

jRate of Wages. — The wages of men-servants for farm purposes, 
are, from L. 3 to L. 5 per half -year, with board. Women's wages, 
with board, from L. 4 to L. 5 in the summer, and L. 2 in the 
winter. Boy's wages per half year, from L. 2 to L. 3. A labour- 
er's wages, winter and summer, are 9s. per week ; at some sea- 
sons, and for particular work, 10s. per week. Mason's wages 3s. 
per day ; carpenter's 2s. 6d. without victuals. Smiths are in gene- 
ral paid from L. 1, 15s. to L. 3 per annum, for a pair of horses kept 
in shoes, and plough and harrows kept in repair. 

It may be proper to contrast these rates with those that prevail- 
ed at the time of the last Statistical Account. A labourer's 
wages were then from lOd. to Is. per day; mason's and carpen- 
ter's Is. 6d. ; tailor's 6d. and victuals. Male servants employed 
in husbandry, 50s. or L. 3 per half year, with their board ; female 
servants from 30s. to L. 2. 

Prices of Provisions.; — The price of butcher meat is now, and for 
a considerable time past has been, from 5d. to 7d. per lb. Butter 
from 7d. to 8d. Cheese according to its quality, from 4d. to 6d. and 
7d. In this part of the country very little butter and cheese are made. 
No more milch cows are kept than what are necessary for the use 
of the famihes themselves. It is more profitable, from the mode 
of agriculture pursued here, to buy stock than to rear it. 

There are 206 work-horses in the parish ; 35 riding horses and 
coach horses, ; 25 brood mares. For these statute-labour money is 
paid, at the rate of 7s. 6d. for each horse, and 3s. 9d. for each 
brood mare. Farm-servants for whom road-money is paid, are 1 28 
in number, the payment for each being 3s. ; householders who pay 
road-money, are 42 in number, each paying 3s. The amount 
raised from this source, and applied to the keeping of the parish 
roads in repair, is L. 120 per annum. 

It may be noticed, that the best kind of plough made in Scot- 
land was invented by James Small, who resided in this parish. 

Produce. — The total value of the raw produce raised in the pa- 
rish is, as near as I have been able to estimate it, about L. 32,500 
Sterling per annum.

Quarries. — There are four good freestone quarries in the pa- 
rish, one of which is a sale quarry. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Dunse is the nearest market-town, — distant from this parish 
about three and a-half miles. Allanton is the only village in the 
parish, — about three miles from Edrom. 

Means of Communication. — We have a regular conveyance for 
letters and newspapers by Dunse and Ayton. The length of the 
public roads in the parish, including turnpikes and parish roads, is 
twenty-five miles. A public coach runs between Dunse and Ber- 
wick in the summer season thrice a-week, and sometimes every 
lawful day. Carriers from Dunse to Berwick pass Edrom every 
day in the week : there is a daily coach from Dunse to Edinburgh, 
besides regular carriers. There is one bridge over the Whitadder, 
called Chirnside Bridge ; and another over the Whitadder at Al- 
lanton is very much needed. There are also two bridges over the 
Blackadder in this parish, — one, called the Mouth Bridge, on the 
road from Dunse to the south Berwick road ; the other at Kimmer- 
ghame. Farther, there are two wooden bridges over the Blackad- 
der for foot-passengers. 

Corn-Markets. — There is a weekly corn-market in Dunse every 
Wednesday. The sales are by sample ; but the principal corn 
market is Berwick, which is held every Saturday. The corn is 
shipped to London, sometimes to Edinburgh. Some farmers 
drive their grain to Dunbar and Dalkeith, and frequently lime is 
brought back by the returning carts. Sheep and cattle are mostly 
driven south to Morpeth ; but some to the Dalkeith and Edin- 
burgh markets. There are fairs, besides, in the neighbourhood 
for the sale of cattle, and there is a monthly market at Coldstream. 

Ecclesiastical State. — " The present church of Edrom was built 
in 1732, and has since been repaired. It is a long building, a 
gallery at each end and a gallery in front of the pulpit, and ano- 
ther gallery immediately behind the pulpit. The gallery in front 
is over the burying vault of the Kelloe family, the gallery behind 

 " The lands and church of Ederham with Nisbet were granted to St Cuthbert's 
monks by Gospatrick Earl of Dunbar, and confirmed in 1139 by David I. I" 1150 
the donation of Gospatrick was confirmed by Robert Bishop of St Andrew's, in the 
presence of the Synod at Berwick town, and it was also confirmed by Bishop Richard, 
who ruled the see of St Andrew's from 1 1 G'.i to 11 77. Richard also granted in favour 
of the prior of Coldingham the investiture of the church of Ederham. In the ancient 
taml'w the church of Ederham was rated at no less tlian 100 marks. Ederham was, 
of course, a vicarage till the Reformation, and.WiUiam dc Chatton, vicaire de I'eglise 
de Ederham, swore fealty to Edward I. 24th August 129G, at Berwicktown."—

the pulpit is over the Blackader burying vault. Robert Blackad- 
er, first Archbishop of Glasgow, whose family derived its surname 
from Blackader in Ederham parish, built a vaulted isle to the an- 
cient church." — Redpath's Border History, p. 473. 

Part of this ancient vault is still standing. On the south-west 
corner of the Blackadder aisle, over which is the gallery already 
mentioned, there is a stone with this inscription : " Founded by 
Robert Blackader, Archbishop of Glasgow, in the year 1499." On 
the south-east corner of the same aisle, there is a stone with this in- 
scription : " Repaired by S. John Home of Blackader, in the year 
1696." These two corners are evidently much older than the rest 
of the aisle, which probably was built and connected with the church 
in the. manner already mentioned, when the church was built in 
1732, or subsequently. 

" During the minority of James V., the most murderous con- 
tests for the lands of Blackader continued between the Blackad- 
ers of Blackader, and the Homes, which finally ended in the fa- 
vour of the Homes, by violence against right." — Chalmers' Cale- 
donia. 

The church may accommodate about 450 persons. A range of 
stables has been built on the north side of the church-yard, for 
the accommodation of the horses of heritors and tenants during 
the time of divine service. It is remarkable that in this church- 
yard, as in almost all the churchyards of the neighbourhood, all 
the interments are on the south side of the church ; and none -on 
the north side. There seems to have been a prejudice of old 
against burying on the north side of a church. 

The old manse and glebe were situated nfir the church, and 
still more near to the mansion-house of Edrom. But the proprie- 
tor of Edrom, Mr Breimer, being desirous to have them removed 
to a farther distance from his house, effected an excambion in 
1760. The present manse was then built, and the repairs since 
that time have been trifling. The present glebe is about the same 
extent as the old, — namely, ten acres. The exchange was satis- 
factory to Mr William Redpath, who was then the minister of 
the parish, and it was gone about, so far as I have been able to 
learn, in the usual way; but there must have been a mistake; for 
the old glebe is of as good land as any in the parish or county, 
and one acre of it is worth three acres of the present. The pre- 
sent glebe was at the time of the exchange a moor covered with 
heath, with a swamp at the lower end ; and though it has since 



27G

been much improved, a different equivalent ought tg have been 
obtained. 

The stipend is 16 chalders, half oatmeal and half barley, pay- 
able according to the fiars prices of the county. In 1755, the 
stipend v'as L. 76, 14s. 5d. : in 1798, L. 120, lis. 6d.; at the time 
of the former Statistical Account L. 110 Sterling, including the 
value which was put on the glebe. 

There are no chapels of ease in this parish ; and there is no need 
of any, — though the church is very inconveniently placed for the 
parish, and by no means in a central situation. Divine service at 
the parish church is generally well attended. The proprietors are 
mostly resident, and we have a most respectable tenantry. 'iThe 
average number of communicants is about 350. Of the propor- 
tion of the parishioners belonging to the Established church and 
to the Dissenters, no precise account can be given, because a con- 
siderable number of the latter belong to the shifting class of farm- 
servants. I would conjecture, however, that the number of Dis- 
senting heads of families may be about 55. 

The heritors and their famihes are almost all annual subscribers 
to Societies for religious and charitable purposes; and generally 
in the summer season we have a collection in the church for some 
religious or charitable object. Our collection last year for the 
Highland Schools under the management of the General Assem- 
bly was L. 14, 18s. Sterling. 

Education. — There are three schools in the parish, — the paro- 
chial and two private schools. The parochial schoolmaster has 
the maximum salary, a very good house, and an allowance in lieu 
of garden. His school-fees probably do not exceed L. 5 a-year. 

One of the private schools is at Allanton. The Blackadder fa- 
mily give a school-house and a dweUing-house for the teacher, and 
a salary of L. 10 per annum. The other private school is at Kimmer- 
ghame. The proprietor of Kimmerghame gives a school and a 
dwelling-house and garden for the master, and a salary of L. 10 per 
annum. The parish school has on an average about 45 scholars; the 

• There was, till within these few years, when it was ploughed up, an old burying- 
ground on the estate of Kimmerghainc, where there is also a field, called tlie Clia- 
pel-field. There was likewise a chapel on the estate of East Nisbct, subsequently called 
Allanbank, now Bighouse, near the spot where the large meeting of Covenanters 
formerly mentioned was held. Some of the foundation stones have been lately 
ploughed up, but I have not been able to get any more authentic partieidars about 
it. There are likewise on the same estate the remains of a cam : but the field lias 
been so long under the plough that the form is not very perceptible. 



EDROM.

private schools about 70 each.  The same branches are taught 
in all the schools — Latin, Greek when required, mathematics, and 
French; together with the ordinary branches of education, English 
reading and English grammar, writing, arithmetic, and geogra- 
phy- 

The school fees are nearly the same in all. The wages for 
scholars under seven years of age is 10s. per annum, or 2s. 6d. per 
quarter; under ten years, 12s. per annum; above ten years, 16s. 
per annum, or 4s. per quarter. The wages advance after this ac- 
cording to the number of branches taught. 

There are none in this parish who are not sent to school ; and, 
from the situation of the parochial and private schools, no part of 
the parish is at so great a distance from school as to make it any 
hardship for the children to attend regularly in summer and winter. 

Libraries. — There are two or three small libraries in the parish 
for young people. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — Some of the parishioners are 
connected with Friendly Societies in Dunse and elsewhere; but this 
mode of obtaining assistance, in case of sickness and old age, is 
not so much attended to as it ought. 

Savings Bank. — There is a savings bank in Dunse for this and 
the neighbouring parishes. The deposits a few years ago were 
considerable, but they have fallen off to a feW pounds a year. One 
reason for this falling off may be the reduced rate of interest. Five 
per cent, was the rate of interest given, till within these two or 
three years, when it was reduced to two and a-half per cent. 
Another reason may be the fall in the prices of labour. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 30, — at the time of the former Statistical 
Account, it was 12. The allowance to each at an average, is 2s. 
per week. The assessment is about L. 150 per annum : at the 
time of the former Statistical Account, it was L. 10. The collec- 
tions at the church, and from the letting of a hearse and the use 
of a mortcloth, have amounted, for a great many years past, to 
L. 25 or L. 30 per annum. The collection at the church door 
has of late, however, considerably fallen off, in consequence of the 
assessment. The sum of L. 5 a-year is paid to the kirk-session for 
the behoof of the industrious poor on the estate of Nisbet, — being 

" The niimhcr of scholars at tlie ]arisli school is necessarily much smaller liaii ul 
the private schools, i'rom the situation of the iarish sihoo], which is at a corner of

the produce of a sum of money left by the late Mrs Carre of Nis- 
bet for that purpose. In all, the sum expended in the support of 
the poor in this parish is about L. 175 or L. 180 per annum. It 
will be seen, therefore, that the increase of the assessment during 
last forty years has greatly exceeded that of the population. 

Inns. — There are three inns in the village of Allanton, and one 
at Mountpleasant, on the estate of Kimmerghame. They have 
decidedly a bad effect on the habits and morals of the people. 

Fuel. — Coals are the fuel used in the parish. They are brought 
from the county of Northumberland, a distance of thirteen miles ; 
and from Eyemouth, a distance of about ten miles. The coals got 
at Eyemouth are brought by sea from Newcastle and from Fife. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Agriculture in all its branches has been vastly improved since 
the time of the last Statistical Account. There are now no infield 
and outfield lands, — no moor lands set apart for the casting of turf 
for fuel, — no swamps — no ague. A considerable quantity of land has 
been planted : and the parish roads have been greatly improved, par- 
ticularly of late years. In 1 759, the first act was passed anent turn- 
pike roads and toll-bars in Berwickshire. The next act of Par- 
liament on that subject was in 1787, to which there was great op- 
position. The general mode of carriage by all the parish roads at 
that time was on horseback, with panniers. Such a thing is now 
never seen, except, indeed, in the case of muggers, who still tra- 
verse this part of the country in gangs during the summer season. 
The roads are so good now in all this part of Berwickshire, that 
a ton and upwards is the usual load of carriers drawn by one 
horse, and no person grumbles at the toll-bars. Two horses, one 
in the trams of the cart, and one in front, are generally employed 
by the farmers. 

To show the change of times, I may mention, that I have in my 
possession the valuation of one of the largest properties in the pa- 
rish, proposed to be sold in 1748, the free rental of which at that 
time was L. 320 Sterling. The rental of the same lands at pre- 
sent is about L. 2500 Sterling. 

 A head constable has been appointed lately for the county, — one of whose duties is 
to prevent the itinerating of muggers in the coiuUy : and since this appointment very 
few muggers have been seen in this quarter.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE An5 TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JAMES HOME ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The origin of the name Coldingham cannot be dis- 
tinctly traced. It is most probably Saxon ; in which language 
Ham signifies a village, Col-den a cold vale,— these terms correctly 
describing the situation of the present village, which is much expos- 
ed to cold winds from the east and north-east. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is of great extent, and of 
a very irregular figure ; — its extreme length from east to west being 
12 miles; its breadth 9. It comprehends about 57,600 impe- 
rial acres, upwards of 5000 of which, termed Coldingham com- 
mon, are moorland, scarcely capable of cultivation. It is bound- 
ed on the north-east and north by the German Ocean, and the 
opening into the Firth of Forth at St Abb's Head ; on the north- 
west and west by Cockburnspath parish : on the south-west by 
the parishes of Abbey St Bathans and Bunkle ; on the south by 
Chirnside ; and on south-east and east by the parishes of Ayton 
and Eyemouth. 

It is still one of the largest parishes in the county of Berwick, 
and previous to the Reformation it comprehended most of the pa- 
rishes just mentioned as at present constituting its boundaries. It 
was then termed in its charters Coldingliamsliire. It is very un- 
even in its surface. A range of hills forming part of the Lammer- 
moor range runs in parallel lines from east to west, intersected by 
valleys of considerable extent, and by numerous small streams. 
None of these hills are of great elevation ; the highest, Wardlaw 
Bank, is 640 feet above the level of the sea ; and the largest of 
these streams is the Eye, which, after traversing the whole length 
of the parish, falls into the sea at Eyemouth. 

Caves c. — Numerous caves and fissures, formerly the haunts of 
smugglers, exist in the neighbourhood of St Abb's Head, some of 
these of considerable dimensions, excavated out of the solid rock,

are inaccessible by land, and can only be approached at low water, 
and in tlie calmest weather. Their narrow entrances are com- 
pletely blocked up by the rising tide, and a gentle breeze from the 
east speedily creates a dangerous surf. 

About a mile west from St Abb's Head lies Coddingham loch, 
which covers thirty acres of ground, is 300 feet above the level of 
the sea, and about 300 yards distant from it. The late Mr Blair, 
Professor of Astronomy in the Edinburgh University, attempted 
to ornament a small portion of its sloping banks with trees, but its 
high situation and contiguity to the sea rendered his efforts un- 
avaihng. The only fish in this lake are perch, with which it abounds. 

Geology. — The parish of Coldingham is rich in various depart- 
ments of natural history, particularly in that of geology. In no 
part of the kingdom are there more striking displays of stratifica- 
tion, or more singular and perplexing appearances, than along the 
magnificent sea-coast. The rocks throughout the whole extent of 
the parish belong to the transition class. Greywacke and grey- 
wacke slate are the prevailing minerals. Generally the strata 
are either vertical or inclined at a very great angle with the ho- 
rizon, their general direction being from east to west. The 
stratification of this rock is seen to great advantage in the neigh- 
bourhood of Redheugh, but it is interrupted by rocks of trap at 
St Abb's Head, which, however, extend a very short way inland. 
St Abb's itself may be described as a huge insulated mass of trap 
rocks, of which the principal are trap-tuffa, amygdaloid, and felspar 
porphyry. These continue for some miles along the coast towards 
the east, interrupted by occasional displays of the older strata, till 
we reach the mouth of the river Eye, when the greywacke again 
presents itself. 

Botany. — A very lengthened catalogue of plants might be given 
as indigenous to this parish. Cryptogamous plants are particularly 
abundant. A great variety of mosses, and many individuals of the 
order Felices, are also to be met with. Among the phenogamous 
plants we may mention the following as the most rare : Arenaria 
verna, growing in great abundance on the trap rocks on St Abb's 
Head ; Mhodiola rosea, to be found in great beauty in Lumsden 
dean ; also Epilohium angustifolium, decidedly wild ; Poterium 
sanguisorha near, and Niiphar lutea in Coldingham Loch ; Glai~ 
cium maritimum on Coldingham sands, growing in company with 
the Cynoglossum officinale, Alisma ranunculoides in the moss at 
the foot of St Abb's Head ; Arundo jhragmites, Betonica offici-

II. — Civil History. 
St W.— About the beginning of the seventh century, Ebba, 
daughter of Ethelfrith, and sister to the celebrated Osway, both 
Kings of Northumberland, fled from Penda, King of Mercia, who 
was desirous to marry her, and seize her father's kingdom. Hav- 
ing embraced Christianity, she abhorred an alliance with a pagan, 
and resolved to escape from his entreaties and his violence. -The 
vessel in which she embarked was driven ashore in a storm on that 
promontory which from her derives its name, St Abb. There she 
built a nunnery. A few of the foundation stones still stand on the 
verge of a rock overhanging the sea. Nowhere could she have 
found a more suitable situation for such a purpose. Remote from 
the world, the surrounding scenery is in harmony with every devout 
feehng. The neck of land, five acres in extent, on which it was built, 
stretches into the sea, having for its three sides perpendicular rocks 
of great elevation. The fourth side, by which alone an enemy could 
have approached, was cut off from the mainland, and rendered im- 
pregnable by a high wall and deep trench, while the immense height 
and ruggedness of the stupendous rocks by which it was surrounded, 
the overhanging precipices on which it stood, the dark caverns yawn- 
ing beneath, the boundless expanse of ocean stretching in front, 
elevate the soul, and excite a religious tone of feeling. In a storm 
the situation is sublime in the extreme. The walls are drenched, 
and the atmosphere darkened by the spray. The building trembles 
to its foundation at the beating of the surge upon the precipice 
where it stands. A wild waste of broken waters rolls over the 
mighty masses of rock that lie scattered around, or, dashing with 
a stunning sound against the headland of St Abb's, shoot into the 
air. Here, amidst the greatest and grandest of nature's works, 
was the nunnery of St Abba founded. It is recorded in history, 
that the abbess and her nuns, about the year 837, to escape the 
licentiousness of the Danes, disfigured their faces by cutting off 
their upper lips and noses ; but that the cruel invaders, unmoved by 
this act of devoted heroism, burnt the nunnery to the ground with 
all its inhabitants. The chapel of this nurmery and the cemetery 
which surrounded it, stood a mile to the east, on another mount. 
Little of them now remains; but the old inhabitants remember when

el considerable part of the wall and a semicircular arch was pulled 
down, and when the surrounding ground was used as a place of 
burial.  

Coldingham Priory was founded about the year 1098 by Edgar, 
King of Scotland, who, having been driven from his throne, fled 
into England, and obtained from William Rufus 30,000 men, and 
from the Abbot of Durham the banner of St Cuthbert, to a'ssist 
him in subduing his rebellious subjects. He afterwards consider- 
ed he was as much indebted for his success to the banner and the 
priests, as to the King and his soldiers ; and as a proof of his gra- 
titude, he founded the church of St Mary Coldingham, had it 
constituted a cell of Durham, and bestowed on it the lands of Pax- 
ton, Fishwick, and the village of Swinton. 

The several kings, from Edgar, its founder, to James 1. regarded 
this priory with peculiar favour, and enriched it with valuable gifts 
and important privileges ; but in the feeble reign of Robert III., 
and under the regency of the Duke of Albany, the kingdom being 
torn by faction, the monks found it necessary to put themselves 
under the protection of the powerful family of Douglas, who ap- 
pointed Alexander, the Laird of Home, under-keeper ; and thus 
commenced a connection between the family of Home and the 
priory of Coldingham, which terminated in that family obtaining 
all the temporalities of the priory. James HI. endeavoured to 
suppress the monastery, and obtained the consent of his Parlia- 
ment to apply its revenues to the support of the chapel-royal, 
which he founded at Stirling. The Homes, in consequence, re- 
belled, and a battle was fought near Stirling, in which the king 
was slain, 11th June 1488. In 1509 Coldingham was disjoined 
from Durham, and placed under the jurisdiction of Dunfermline 
by the Pope. Alexander Stewart, natural son of James IV. Abbot 
of Dunfermline, and Archbishop of St Andrews, was chosen prior. 
He was afterwards slain, fighting by the side of his father, on the 
fatal field of Flodden. In 1514, this high office was conferred on 
David Home, brother of Lord Home, who was succeeded by Wil- 
liam Douglas, brother of the Earl of Angus. Adam, the next 
prior, was removed in 1541 to Dundrennan, to make room for 
John Stewart, the infant and natural son of James V., who was 
appointed commendator, while his father enjoyed the revenue. In 

• The history of Coldingham Priory occupius a prominent place in the history of 
the south of Scotland; and we must refer the reader wlio feels interested in the for- 
tunes of this still celebrated, once rich and ]owerful, ]riorv, to Chalmers' Caledonia, 
lledpath's Border History, and to Uaiue's History of North Durham.

November 1544, the English seized the abbey, and fortified it so 
strongly, that all the efforts of the Earl of Arran, Regent of Scot- 
land," failed to reduce it. In 1545 it was burnt by the Earl of 
Hertford, and never afterwards regained its former wealth and con- 
sequence. John Stewart, commendator, who married Lady Jane 
Hepburn, sister of the well-known Earl of Bothwell, died in 1563, 
leaving two sons, Francis and John, on the eldest of whom James 
VI. again bestowed the commendatorship of Coldingham. Fran- 
cis, like his father, having rebelled against his kinsman and bene- 
factor, the whole of the temporalities were taken from him and 
bestowed upon the Earl of Home. On the earl's death in 1619, 
John, the second son of Francis, who had been created Earl of 
Bothwell, was appointed commendator. This worthless and pro- 
fligate individual, in order to procure the means of supporting him- 
self in his career of dissipation and extravagance, alienated in small 
lots, all the lands which had hitherto remained attached to the 
priory, and from him the numerous small proprietors in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood of the church and village received the charters 
by which they continue to hold their property. Of this most an- 
cient and richly endowed monastery nothing now remained but its 
magnificent church, and the extensive buildings by which it was 
surrounded. It was left to Oliver Cromwell to complete its final 
overthrow, as he passed through Berwickshire to attack the army 
of the Scots. A strong body of the inhabitants of the district, 
who were generally Episcopalians and royahsts, established and 
fortified themselves in the church and tower, in which their fore- 
fathers had successfully defended themselves against the Earls of 
Arran and Angus. The first detachment of troops which Crom- 
well sent, was repulsed with loss, and he was forced to bring up se- 
veral pieces of cannon, which in two days shook the tower, and 
compelled its defenders to capitulate. He afterwards, that he 
might leave no means of annoyance in his rear, blew up the church, 
leaving only the north wall and east gable. The tower was nine- 
ty feet in height, and formed the north-west corner of the northern 
transept of the church. It continued in a very precarious state, 
till it fell about sixty years ago, and not a stone of it now remains. 
The north wall and east gable of the present church form the 
whole that remains of this ancient monastery, founded upwards 
of 700 years ago. They afford beautiful specimens of the transi- 
tion from the Norman to the early English style of architecture. 
A number of circular arches, each two divided with an intercolum-

niation, ornamented the whole of the north wall, resting on cor- 
bals, and having richly adorned canopies ; but about sixty years 
ago, with most barbarous taste, the shafts of the arches were cut 
away, which greatly disfigured the interior aspect of the church. 
Above these still remain entire five windows of beautiful workman- 
ship, nearly approaching to the lancet figure, and twenty-six plain 
and clustered shafts, with capitals of different forms, and ornament- 
ed with various kinds of foliage. Behind these runs a narrow cor- 
ridor extending the whole length of the church. The exterior of 
what remains of the old monastery is remarkable for its beautiful 
simplicity. The design of the exterior corresponds with the interior. 
Below is a series of coupled Norman arches embeUished with the 
Chiffron moulding. Above are lancet-shaped Gothic windows, 
with columns at the sides. The remains of several arches surround 
the building, and only a few years have elapsed since others were 
torn down for the sake of the stones. The Prior holding rank as 
a baron had the right of pit and gallows. The pit was situated a 
little to the east of the present church, and was filled up so late 
as 1800 ; the gallows stood upon a little hill about a mile distant, 
and is still called Gallowside. A quantity of bones, forming an 
artificial mound, were dug up here twenty-five years ago. Previous 
to the Reformation, the priors and monks of Coldingham had ac- 
quired the churches of Coldingham, Aldecamus, Ayton, Fish- 
wick, Knapden, Corvendean, Edenham, Swinton, Nisbet, Ber- 
wick, Mordington, Lamberton, Ederham, Ercildoun, Smallhom, 
Stitchel, with the chapels of Newton, Nenthorn, and others. The 
revenues of the priory were variously stated ; but the following 
account from Lauchlan Shaw's Manuscript may be considered as 
nearest the truth: money, L. 818, 10s. 9d.; wheat, 6 chalders, 
7 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks; bear, 19 chalders, 12 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 
pecks; oats, 56 chalders, 8 bolls, 2 firlots; peas, 3 chalders, 13 
bolls, 2 firlots ; and a right to a number of kain fowls, services and 
carriages from their vassals. By the charters of Alexander II., they 
had a right of warren and forestry over the extensive waste now 
called Coldingham Moor, with all the woods and forests adjoining, 
which charters may be seen at length in Mr Raine's History of 
Northumberland. 

Antiquities. — There are some vestiges of a Roman camp on a 
hill west of St Abb's Head, and of a British camp on the summit 
of Ernsheuch, surrounded on three of its sides by lofty precipices. 
On the top of Wardlae Bank hill is another British camp, with

four rows of circular trenches. There is also a large Roman 
camp on its north-west side, two sides of which have been level- 
led ; but two still remain undisturbed by the plough. The sta- 
tions of the centinels on the brow of the hill may be distinctly 
seen. 

Two miles to the west of St Abb's Head is Fast- Castle, built 
upon a peninsular rock jutting into the sea. The narrow neck 
which joins it to the land had been cut down almost to the level 
of the sea, and a draw-bridge was thrown over it, rendering it almost 
impregnable. The building, which is in ruins, forms one of the 
most striking and picturesque objects in the county, and is much 
resorted to by strangers, both on its own account and for the 
splendid view from the hill immediately above it, which presents 
the boundless extent of the German Ocean, rolling farther than 
the eye can reach, the fertile shores of Fife and the Lothians, 
the distant hills of Stirling and Perthshire, the numerous vessels 
passing and repassing, the rugged shores and massy rocks of St 
Abb's -Head, — all forming a scene so vast and diversified — so near 
and so remote — that the imagination can add nothing to its splen- 
dour. As might have been expected, from the contiguity to the 
English border, there were in former days numerous strongholds 
in this parish, few vestiges of which now remain. Such was Lang- 
ton Tower, Heughhead, Renton and Houndwood, the last of which 
was the hunting seat of the prior. 

Land-owners. — The parish is divided among 59 heritors, 11 of 
whom have about L. 400 Scots valuation, among whom are For- 
man Home, Esq. of Billy ; Henry Home Drummond of Blair 
Drummond ; Sir John Hall, Bart, of Dunglass ; Sir Samuel Stir - 
ling, Bart, of Renton ; Mrs Coulson of Houndwood ; William 
Hume, Esq., of Fairlaw ; William Hood, Esq. of Sunnyside ; Wil- 
liam Macintyre, Esq. of Templehall ; Thomas Weir, Esq. of Bo- 
gan Green ; William Dickson, Esq. of Whitecross ; John Fuller, 
Esq. of Hallydown ; the Rev. Edward Sandys Lumsden of Lums- 
den ; Thomas Henderson, Esq. of Press. 13 heritors have from 
L. 400 to L. 100, and 35 have from L. 100 to L. 1, Os. lOd., all 
Scots money : 36 proprietors of land have upwards of the yearly 
value of L. 50 Sterling., It is much to be regretted that there is 
no magistrate in the parish, and few residing heritors, to whom the 
poor might apply for temporary relief, the oppressed for assistance, 
the ignorant for advice. 

Parochial Itcgisters. — The first entry in the parochial regis- 
ter of the parish was in 1694, when John Dysart was the first

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres in this 
parish, at once so large and so irregular, cannot be correctly as- 
certained ; but these may be about 57,000, of which 5000 or 6000 
are moorland. It is supposed that there are 100 acres of natural 
wood, and 400 of plantations. The indigenous wood consists prin- 
cipally of oak, elm, and birch. No additional land could be pro- 
fitably brought under cultivation. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land per acre may 
be estimated at L. 1, lis. : the rent varying from 2s. 6d. to L. 5 
per acre. Few or no cattle are taken in for grazing. 

Rate of Wages. — Farm-labourers receive Is. 6d. to 2s. in sum- 
mer, and from Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. in winter; masons and carpenters 
one-third more. There are 55 hand-loom weavers in the villao-e 
of Coldingham, who are employed by Glasgow manufacturers to 
weave cotton, who for several years past have received only 6s. per 
week for working thirteen hours a-day. 

Husbandry. — The general mode of husbandry practised in the 
parish is that of the four-shift system. Leases are generally for a pe- 
riod of twenty-one years. Farm dwelling-houses and offices are large 
and. commodious, suited to the size of the farm and to the wealth 
and respectability of the farmer. There are neither quarries nor 
mines worked in the parish.

A small harbour for the security of fishing boats was erect- 
ed at Northfield shore, about a mile distant from Coldingham, 
in 1833, at the expense of about L. 1200, one-fourth of which 
was raised by private subscription ; Government supplied the re- 
mainder. Sixteen families reside close bye at the picturesque fish- 
ing village of Northfied, who, with about 20 others living in Cold- 
ingham, obtain their livelihood by fishing. In addition to these, 30 
persons proceed annually to the north for the herring fishing, which 
gives employment for fourteen boats from this place. The fish 
caught upon this coast are cod, which, when pickled, are sent to 
the London market; also, haddock, turbot, lobsters, which are 
transported in carts to the Edinburgh market. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-town — Villages. — The nearest market-town is Eye- 
mouth, two miles and a-half distant. The villages are Colding- 
ham, having a population of 850 ; Reston, 222 ; Auchincraw, 161. 

Means of Communication. — A daily post goes between Colding- 
ham and Ayton. Nine miles of the great London road traverse 
the parish, along which three public coaches daily travel ; there 
are 53 miles of parish roads, upon which L. 160 a-year, in the con- 
version of statute-labour, are expended. All the bridges and most 
of the fences are in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated nearly at 
the south-east corner of the parish, in the village of Coldingham. 
The situation is inconvenient for the parishioners generally, as it 
has the sea on the east, and the neighbouring parish of Eyemouth, 
within a mile of it, on the south, and is above eight miles distant 
from the other extremities of the parish. The church was repair- 
ed, and one of the walls rebuilt, in 1662; the remaining part of 
the building is a part of the old monastery. The church can ac- 
commodate 1000 persons, and the greater part of the aisle is ap- 
propriated for free sittings, but has never yet been fitted up for that 
purpose. The manse, which is situated within a short distance of 
the church, was built in 1801, and repaired and enlarged in 1828. 
Two glebes are attached to the living; one, consisting of five acres 
of excellent land, valued at L. 4 per acre ; the other, which was 
allotted to the minister at the division of the common, in lieu of 
his right of pasturage, also five acres in extent, but of very inferior 
quality, and worth L. 1, 10s. per acre. The stipend, by an aug- 
mentation obtained in 1833, was raised from 15 chalders 15 bolls, 
and L, 8, 8s. for communion elements, to 18 chalders, and L. 10 
for communion elements.

A chapel was erected at the distance of seven miles from the 
parish church, on the estate of Renton, in 1794, by Sir John Stir- 
ling, the proprietor of Renton ; and the Rev. Mr Beaton was or- 
dained to the charge by the Presbytery of Chirnside, Sir John 
Stirling granting him a bond for L. 80 a-year. He was succeeded 
by Mr Marshall, who afterwards was appointed to a parish in Shet- 
land in the year 1810; from that time, till 1831, with the excep- 
tion of an occasional sermon during the first few years after Mr 
Marshall's departure, public worship ceased to be performed, and 
the chapel became much dilapidated, — no successor to him was 
appointed, as it was found impossible to procure a sufficient provi- 
sion for the support of a clergyman. 

In the spring of 1831, the present incumbent raised a suffi- 
cient sum among the inhabitants of the district in which the 
chapel is situated, for its complete repair ; and in the month of 
November following, Mr Duncan, with the full approbation of all 
concerned, was appointed to officiate, and the religious charge of 
the people entrusted to him by the parish minister, and he has 
since continued to reside and labour amongst them. His income 
is derived from the seat rents, and a subscription received from Lord 
Douglas, Mr Balfour of Whittingham, and the parish minister, — 
which have hitherto averaged a little more than L. 60 per annum. 
There is one Dissenting chapel in the village of Coldingham in 
connection with the United Associate Synod. 

Divine service, both at the church and chapel, is generally well 
attended, and there are few parishes where the Sahbath-day is 
more devoutly observed. The average number of communicants 
at the parish church is 560. The number of families in connec- 
tion with the chapel at Renton is upwards of 70, and the average 
number of individuals who attend public worship there is 250, and 
of communicants 140. 

Education, — There are eight schools in the parish, having 260 
pupils; two of which schools are parochial, where the common 
branches of education are taught, together with the Latin classics, 
mathematics, and French ; the other six are supported entirely by 
school-fees, in two of which the classics are taught, and in the 
other the ordinary branches of education. Both of the parochial 
schoolmasters have the minimum salary; one of whom draws L. 60 
a-year from other sources, and the school-fees are as under; 
reading, 2s. ; writing, 3s. ; arithmetic, 4s. ; Latin, 5s. per quarter. 
The opportunity of education is so generally embraced by the 
people, that there are few who cannot read, and the number of 



COLDINGHAM.

persons who are not able to sign their name is very inconsiderable ; 
and there is no part of the parish so distant from a school as to 
prevent attendance. In addition to these sources of instruction 
there are four Sunday schools, which are numerously attended. 

Literature. — The village of Coldingham is furnished with a sub- 
scription library containing 400 volumes, consisting of the best 
English authors. 

Fairs. — There is a fair held twice a-year in the village, which has 
now dwindled almost to nothing. 

Inns. — There are two inns and ten public houses in the parish; 
four are situated on the great London road, and all of them are 
well conducted, and do not appear to be productive of any serious 
injury to the niorals of the people. 

Fuel. — The principal fuel used in the parish is coal, brought 
from the sea-port of Eyemouth and Berwick ; but the persons who 
live in the moorland parts of the parish chiefly burn peat. 

Charitable Institutions. — A friendly society was established in 
1791 ; it is in a very flourishing state, consisting at present of 125 
members. The present amount of its capital stock is lent in 
small sums on floating security, and amounts to L. 700. The 
quarterly payment of each member is 3s. ; and the allowance per 
week to the sick and those unfit for work, 2s. ; and in the case of 
a funeral, L. 5 for expenses. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of individuals 
on the poor roll is 140, a few others receiving temporary aid ; 
and the average sum allotted to each is 1 s. 3d. a-week. The poor 
are supported by a legal assessment, amounting to nearly L. 600 
per annum, and there is no other source of relief except that af- 
forded by the collections at church, which may amount to L. 10 
per annum. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Nothing is wanting to promote the progress of industry and the 
happiness and comfort of the labouring classes, but the residence 
of the landed proprietors, scarcely any of whom reside in the pa- 
rish. The consequence of this is, that the poor have none to whom 
they can look for assistance in adversity, or counsel in difficulty; 
and the relative duties between rich and poor have no existence 
in this parish.

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The parish of Cockburnspath, to which that of Old 
Cambus appears at a very early period to have been annexed, oc- 
cupies the north eastern corner of the county of Berwick. An- 
ciently it seems to have been written Coldbrandspeth, Cowbrands- 
peth, or Colbrandspath ; but, with regard to the etynology of both 
this and the more modern name, Cockburnspa;th, there is much 
uncertainty. Tradition generally derives the former from a Da- 
nish general of the name of Colbrand, who, it is said, resided at 
one time in a castle of some strength in the centre of the parish, 
the ruins of which still remain ; while the latter, on the same au- 
thority, is attributed to another family of the name of Cockburn, 
which, at a more recent period, acquired possession of the same 
stronghold, and the adjacent lands. Chalmers mentions that the 
original name began to be corrupted so early as the year 1506. 

Boundaries. — In point of figure and extent, the united parishes 
may be described as nearly a square of 4 miles : being bounded 
on the east by Coldingham ; on the south by Abbey St Bathans ; 
on the north by the German ocean ; and on the west by the pa- 
rish of Oldhamstocks, in the county of Haddington. 

Topograpliical Appearances — The general aspect of the parish 
is varied and uneven : being diversified by hill and dale, and in- 
tersected by occasional deep and picturesque ravines, through each 

• According to Chalmers, Old Cambus is derived from the Gaelic name Aid, sig- 
nifying a streamlet, and Camus, a creek or bay ; and, in confh-niation of this deriva- 
tion, he mentions, that a rivulet passes at a little distance, and falls into an inlet of 
the sea. It is more probable, however, that its derivation is from the Gaelic adjec- 
tive ylftl, wild, savage, strange, and Cannts, a creek or lay, — a derivation which is

of which a little river works its troubled way to the sea. But, 
though thus generally uneven, a very marked distinction in point 
of scenery is nevertheless apparent : that part of the parish lying 
nearest to the sea being arable and highly cultivated, while, as it 
recedes from the coast, it becomes more hilly, and is principally 
adapted for pasture. This latter division of the parish may be 
considered as a continuation of that subalpine tract of country 
which is known by the name of the Lammermoor hills, a tract 
which, extending across the island in a direction from N. E. to 
S. W., terminates a little beyond the boundaries of this parish, 
in the bold promontory of St Abb's. The general outline of this 
hilly tract is smooth, — the hills being generally round-backed and 
lumpish in their shape, none of them rising to a greater elevation 
than between 500 and 600 feet, and having a direction in general 
from west to east. The valleys are deep, having each a little 
streamlet flowing through it, which, as it approaches the sea, be- 
comes in many places exceedingly picturesque from the mingled 
, charms of rocks and woods, and little waterfalls. Of these val- 
leys, or deans, as they are here generally named, the most remark- 
able are Dunglass Dean, one-half of which is in this parish ; the 
Tower Dean, so named from an old castle built on the edge of it ; 
Edmond's Dean, in the more hilly part of the parish ; and the 
Pease Dean, a ravine or glen remarkable for its depth and pic- 
turesque scenery, and across which was thrown, about fifty years 
ago, the celebrated Pease Bridge. 

The coast of this parish is throughout bold, rocky, and steep, 
especially the eastern portion of it, where it merges into the hilly 
range, already described as terminating in the promontory of St 
Abb's Head. Along this bold sea line occur some very interesting 
and striking pieces of coast scenery. Of these, one of the most 
picturesque is the Cove, a little bay surrounded by precipices of 
above 100 feet in height, and which, by the building of a break- 
water, &amp;c. has recently been converted into a pretty little harbour 
for the protection of fishing boats. So perfectly secluded is this 
little bay, and so unexpected is the scene which almost instanta- 
neously opens to the view, that it uniformly produces on the mind 
of the stranger an almost electrical effect of surprise and admira- 
tion. A remarkably fine insulated cliff, perforated in the centre 
by the action of the waves, and another lofty and magnificent rock, 
bearing at a short distance so close a resemblance to an ancient 
tower or cathedral, as to be very easily mistaken for such in ruins,

add greatly to the effect of the other objects; while the extent of 
ocean beyond, the vessels of every size and description entering 
or leaving the Frith of Forth, and the bold headlands along the 
coast, complete a scene of remarkable beauty. Several natu- 
ral excavations round this little bay have probably given to it the 
name of the Cove. These have partly been taken advantage of 
to form a range of cellars in the rocks, and also a road or tunnel, 
of about 60 yards in length, through one of the rocky sides of the 
bay, affording at high water the only means of access to the 
shore. 

Various other very interesting coast scenes might be described, 
especially in the neighbourhood of Redheugh, in the eastern part of 
the parish ; and at a spot named the Siccar Point, which may now 
be said to be almost classic ground. The geological phenomena 
which have made this point so celebrated, we shall have occasion 
to describe immediately i but in the meantime we may be permit- 
ted to mention it as a very striking piece of scenery. It is a lofty 
cape or headland running abruptly into the sea, at the base of 
which, by a good deal of scrambling, we arrive at a remarkably fine 
cavern of considerable height and extent, the roof being covered 
with very beautiful calcareous stalactitic encrustations, and the en- 
trance being guarded by ranges of cliffs and isolated rocks, producing 
at high water, and especially when the wind has been for some days 
in the sea, a very splendid effect. Both the natural and scientific 
beauties of this place. Sir John Hall, Bart., the proprietor, has 
lately rendered more accessible to strangers, by means of a wind- 
ing footpath along the sides of the steep sea-bank. Generally 
speaking, the coast of this parish may be described as an alterna- 
tive of bay and lofty headland, the beach being for the most part 
rough and rocky, with very httle extent of sand. 

Meteorology. — The natural history of the parish is in many re- 
spects exceedingly interesting. But under this head, we shall 
merely observe, that there is a remarkable difference of climate be- 
tween the lower and higher districts of the parish, insomuch, that 
gardens, &amp;c. in the latter district are fully a fortnight later, and 
that, too, in some cases within a distance of little more than a 
mile. On account of the inequalities of the p£\rish, rain sometimes 
falls partially ; it being not unusual, in crossing two streams with- 
in a distance of a mile of each other, to observe the one much 
flooded, while the other is untouched. The aurora borcalis is 
sometimes seen to great advantage on this coast ; and unifoi-mly,

in the course of our experience, is it a precursor of turbulent stor- 
my weather. A remarkably fine display of this meteor took place 
in the month of October 1833. The whole heavens were covered 
with its splendour, and a gale very shortly followed of unusual vio- 
lence. The height in the atmosphere of this meteor has been 
variously estimated, and it has been much controverted whether or 
not sound has ever been heard to proceed from it. On this oc- 
casion it may be worth remarking, that many respectable indivi- 
duals in this neighbourhood are satisfied that they did hear such 
sound, and we have heard the same from others in other districts. 

Hydrography. — The streams in the parish are numerous but 
small, the largest being the river Eye, which flows through the 
wilder part of the parish. Its banks are generally bare and unin- 
teresting till it reaches the neighbourhood of Ronton, in the pa- 
rish of Coldingham, where it becomes both a larger and more or- 
namental stream. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geological features of the pa- 
rish are in many respects highly interesting, principally from the 
opportunities afforded in various places, but especially along the 
coasts, of observing the succession and position of the different 
strata and rock formations. Of these last there are two great 
classes, the transition and secondary, — the former composing the 
whole of the hilly part of the parish, — the latter being confined to 
the lower division towards the west and north. The transition 
rocks, so far as we have observed, are entirely the greywacke and 
its accompaniment the greywacke slate ; no trap or other subor- 
dinate rocks presenting themselves, and, so far as we have seen, 
and we have examined this part of our subject with some minute- 
ness, no vein, dike, or other extraneous mass occurring to derange 
the strata. The greywacke is very distinctly stratified, the gene- 
ral direction of the strata being from west to east; although in this 
respect, as well as in the dip and inclination, there are great ir- 
regularities. Of all the stratified rocks, indeed, there are none 
more varied and irregular in these respects than the greywacke. 
This is a remark which applies to all the transition districts of the 
island, but to none, we believe, more than to the district now de- 
scribed. Very frequently, perhaps we should say most frequently, 
the strata are vertical or nearly so.  This position continues 
for a considerable extent, when, all at once, they change to hori- 

 Such is their position at the Siccar I'oiiit, in the bed of the Pease Burn, in the 
bed of the Tower Burn, in quarries on Ewieside, and other places.

zoiital. Frequently, also, the most singular bendings and contor- 
tions may be traced ; and sometimes a structure or arrangement 
on a great scale, exactly resembling that which in a smaller scale 
we observe in the agate or Scotch pebble. Not unfrequently, also, 
in the ravines we behold the following arrangement : viz. the bed 
of the small stream is composed of strata perfectly vertical, while 
on either bank they dip away at a greater or less angle in opposite 
directions. This rock, the greywacke, is, throughout the parish, 
of the same general characters, being commonly fine-granular and 
compact, in many situations, indeed, only a variety of sandstone. 

To attempt an explanation of these irregularities in the strati- 
fication of this rock is what our space will not admit of, were we 
even able to present a plausible hypothesis. Satisfied, however, 
of the futility of theory on these subjects,— at least, of the impossi- 
bility of explaining all the appearances of such a district as that 
now described by any one system, — we prefer a simple statement or 
description of the appearances themselves, subjoining, in a note, 
one or two passages descriptive of this coast, from the interesting 
paper of Sir James Hall, Bart, of Dunglass, read to the Royal So- 
ciety, February 3, 1812.  

 " The killas," or greywacke, says he, " consists everywhere of an assemblage 
of strata of various thickness, from several yards to the minutest leaf of slate. It is 
in general of a dark-blue colour, and, when examined, is found to consist of a conge- 
ries of fragments, which bear the most undoubted proofs of having been deposited in 
an horizontal position. The strata lie parallel to each other, but are everywhere far 
from being horizontal, their prevailing and best known position being vertical or 
nearly so. They are often bent, however, at various angles, frequently very acute, 
and sometimes with the strata nearly doubled upon themselves. In all the inland 
part of this range the rock appears so partially, showing itself only in river courses or 
in quarries, that it is difficult to obtain any correct information as to the position' of 
the strata, which fi-equently exhibit great seeming irregidarity, and which cannot be 
described without making use of language which at first sight bears an appearance of 
contradiction in terms. ThJrs, it not unfrequently happens that one set shows itself 
in a position at the surface nearly erect, but having a decided dip to the east ; and 
that, in the immediate neighbourhood, another set occurs in a position similar to the 
first, but having a no less decided dip to the west." 

" On the shore of the sea, however, where these rocks arc bare, and exposed in 
such a manner that our view can embrace at once a considerable extent of the mass, 
the general structure becomes apparent, and we arc enabled to give a rational account 
of these seeming anomalies. This opportunity of observation occurs with peculiar 
advantage on the coast of Berwickshire, where the lofty cliffs which extend from Fast 
Castle eastward to Gun's Green, near Eyemouth, present to the view a cross section 
of these strata, by which their position is seen to possess much more method and re- 
gularity than the inland rocks would have led us to expect. The strata liere exlu"bit 
a succession of regular windings and ]owerful undulations, reaching from top to bot. 
tom of the clifKi two or three hundred feet in height. These are occasionally inter- 
rupted, as might be expected, by the irregularities of the co;ist, by shifts and disloca- 
tions of the beds, and sometimes, as happens at St Abb's Head, by the intervention of 
wiiinstone, or occasionally of por|hyry. 

" Notwillistanding these intcrruitins, I reckoned in an excursion to that coast 
made last sunnner with my son, Lieutenant Basil Hall of this Society sixteen dis- 
tinct bendings in the course of aout six miles, each of the largest size, and reatliing

The secondary rocks, as already said, are confined almost en- 
tirely to the lower division of the parish; consisting of alternate 
beds or strata of sandstone, a kind of shale, thick beds of indura- 
ted marl, irregular deposits of clay ironstone, and coarse deposits 
of conglomerate, generally occurring near the surface. Of these 
rocks, the sandstone is by far the mot abundant, formmg in many 
places, especially on the coast and on the sides of Dunglass Dean, 
very lofty and striking precipices. This sandstone appears to be of 
two different descriptions or formations : 1. The old red sandstone, 
extending for some miles along the coast, and resting immediate- 
ly on thegreywacke; and 2. The sandstone of the coal formation 
resting on the old red sandstone, and passing under the moun- 
tain limestone a few miles westward in the parish of Innerwick. 
The immediate junction of the old red sandstone with the 
greywacke is distinctly observable in various places; and in all 
of these, it is remarkable, that the direction and dip of the strata 
of both rocks, as well as the characters of the rocks themselves, 
are precisely and in all respects similar, though the situations 
where we observe this junction are considerably distant from one 
another. One of these situations is the Tower Dean, — a deep and 
wooded glen in the centre of the parish, in the bottom of which, 
that is, in the bed of the little stream which flows through it, we 
observe this junction in several places. But the most striking 
situation is the Siccar Point, the natural scenery of which we have 
already described under a former head. The geological appear- 
ances at this latter point are so very remarkable as to strike at 
once even those who are the least acquainted with geology as a sci- 
ence. And no .wonder, therefore, that they were thought of suffi- 
cient importance to attract at one time three of the most eminent 
men of their day ; we mean Dr Hutton, Professor Playfair, and 
a name not less distinguished in the history of geology, the late 
Sir James Hall, Bart, of Dunglass. 

An excursion, undertaken by such gifted individuals, and with 
such objects in view, could not fail to be one of interest ; and, as it 
has been recorded in very elegant language by one of the distin- 
guished party themselves, we shall beg leave to quote his admired 
description : " The ridge of the Lammermuir Hills, in the south 

from top to ottoin of tliu clifls, their curvature being alternately concave and con- 
vex upwards." 

" i. c. The greywacke is arranged in vertical strata rangin'g from west to east, or 
nearly so, and tlie sandstone, which at the innnediate junction is a conglomerate of 
fragments, generally speaking of tlie older rocks, dips towards the north at an angle of 
nearly 26° with tlie horizon, tlie junction being strikingly unconformable.

of Scotland," says Professor Playfair, " consists of primary mi- 
caceous schistus, and extends from St Abb's Head, westward, 
till it join the metalliferous mountains about the sources of the 
Clyde.  The sea coast affords a transverse section of this al- 
pine tract at its eastern extremity, and exhibits the change from 
the primary to the secondary strata, both on the south and on the 
north. Dr Hutton wished particularly to see the latter of these, 
and on this occasion. Sir James Hall and I had the pleasure to ac- 
company him. 

" We sailed in a boat from Dunglass on a day when the fineness 
of the weather permitted us to keep close to the foot of the rocks 
which line the shore in that quarter, directing our couise south- 
wards in search of the termination of the secondary strata. We 
made for a high rocky point or headland, the Siccar, near which, 
from our observations on shore, we knew that the object we were 
in search of was likely to be discovered. On landing at this point, 
we found that we actually trode on the primeval rock which forms 
alternately the base and the summit of the present land. It is here 
a micaceous schistus, in beds nearly vertical, highly indurated, and 
stretching from south-east to north-west. The surface of this rock 
runs with a moderate ascent from the level of low water at which 
we landed, nearly to that of high water, where the schistus has a 
thin covering of red horizontal sandstone laid over it ; and this 
sandstone, at the distance of a few yards farther back, rises into a 
very high perpendicular cliff. Here, therefore, the immediate con- 
tact of the two rocks is not only visible, but is curiously dissected 
and laid open by the action of the waves. The rugged tops of the 
schistus are seen penetrating into the horizontal beds of sandstone, 
and the lowest of these last form a breccia containing fragments of 
schistus, some round and others angular, united by an arenaceous 
cement." 

" Dr Hutton was highly pleased with appearances which set in 
so clear a' light the different formations of the parts which com- 
pose the exterior crust of the earth, and where all the circumstances 
were combined that could render the observation satisfactory and 
precise. On us, who saw these phenomena for the first time, the 
impression made will not easily be forgotten. The palpable evidence 
presented to us of one of the most extraordinary and important 
facts in the natural history of the earth gave a reality and substance

to those theoretical speculations, which, however probable, had never 
till now been directly authenticated by the testimony of the senses- 
We often said to ourselves, what clearer evidence could we have 
had of the different formation of these rocks, had we actually seen 
them emerging from the bosom of the deep  We felt ourselves 
necessarily carried back to the time when the schistus on which 
we stood was yet at the bottom of the sea, and when the sand- 
stone before us was only beginning to be deposited in the shape of 
sand or mud, from the waters of a superincumbent ocean. An 
epocha still more remote presented itself, when even the most 
ancient of these rocks, instead of standing upright in vertical beds, 
lay in horizontal planes at the bottom of the sea, and was not yet dis- 
turbed by that immeasurable force which has burst asunder the solid 
pavement of the globe. Revolutions still more remote appeared in 
the distance of this extraordinary perspective. The mind seemed 
to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time ; and, while 
we listened with earnestness and admiration to the philosopher who 
was now unfolding to us the order and series of these wonderful 
events, we became sensible how much farther reason may some- 
times go than imagination can venture to follow. As for the rest, 
we were truly fortunate in the course we had pursued in this ex- 
cursion; a great number of other curious and important facts pre- 
sented themselves, and we returned, having collected in one day 
more ample materials for future speculation, than have sometimes 
resulted from years of diligent and laborious research." 

In addition to this description, we have only to remark, that the 
old red sandstone at the Siccar Point dips to the N. N. W. at a 
considerable angle, 28°, a dip and inclination which it maintains on 
either side, for about a mile with httle variation. At the termina- 
tion of this mile, on the eastern side of the Siccar, the sandstone 
ceases altogether on the farm of Redheugh, a little beyond the 
Coast Guard station. Here it occurs very low in situation, being 
nearly covered at high water. But to the west of the Siccar it con- 
tinues considerably farther, gradually becoming more horizontal, till 
it reaches the vicinity of the Cove harbour about three miles from 
Siccar Point, where the altered character of the rock itself, its 
different inclination, and accompanying strata, lead us to conclude 
that the old red sandstone has now ceased, and that it is succeed- 
ed by the lower measures of the coal formation. From the Coast 
Guard station already alluded to, to this latter point, a distance of

about five miles, the sandstone is throughout nearly of the same 
general character, being generally coarse-grained, red in colour, 
and highly indurated. But here a decided difference is observable. 
The strata in the neighbourhood of the Cove become almost ver- 
tical ; their direction also is somewhat altered, and we have now 
subordinate and accompanying strata of slate, marl, clay ironstone, 
and loose beds of conglomerate. Here, also, we begin to meet 
with impressions of palms and other tropical plants, which, till we 
arrive here, we seek for in vain towards the east. At the Cove, 
therefore, we think we can trace an imperfect coal formation, which, 
continuing westward for about a mile or two, terminates the geo- 
logy of this parish. That the coal formation does occur in the pa- 
rish, there are other facts to prove, besides what we would predict 
from the appearance of the sandstone and its accompaniments at 
the Cove. On the south side of Dunglass Dean, which may in fact 
be regarded as only a continuation of the rocks which show them- 
selves so distinctly at the Cove, at the distance of about one and 
a-half miles, and also near the village of Cockburnspath, are to be 
seen the openings of several shafts, from which, about 100 years 
ago, coal was procured, though, from what we have been able to 
gather, it probably was not in such abundance as to encourage 
working, or afford temptation strong enough to sacrifice beauty to 
utility. Limestone occurs nowhere in the parish, — its substitute 
here being the indurated marl. A few miles farther along the coast, 
however, towards the west, this rock the limestone occurs in great 
abundance, being the encrinal or mountain limestone of geologists. 

The soil in the parish is very various. Generally, however, it 
may be described as light ; though in many situations, especially 
in the lower division of the parish, it is rich and strong, and well 
adapted for crops of every description. 

• Since writing the above outline of the geological structure of this parish, I have 
had the pleasure, not only of having its general correctness abundantly confirmed by 
Professor Sedgwick and Mr Murchison, two names which stand deservedly high in geo- 
logical science ; but I have also had the good fortune to accompany these gentlemen 
in several very interesting and delightful excursions along the shores. The geology 
of a great part of Berwickshire, 1 may be permitted to state, is exceedingly perplex- 
ing, from the very indistinctly marked formation which covers the lower and richer 
parts of the county, — a formation which, if it be determined merely by mineralogical 
clfaracters, we would in very many places decidedly pronounce to be tlie new red 
sandstone. And such, indeed, it has been named and considered by various distin- 
guished geologists : an opinion which the author of these remarks felt equally inclin- 
ed to entertain regarding certain portions even of the coast of this jiarish. Since the 
visit of Messrs Sedgwick and Murchison, however, who spent some days at Dunglass 
after the breaking up of the British Association in Seitembcr last, he has been in- 
duced, partly from a more careful examination, and partly from deference to two geo- 
logists of such acknowledged eminence, to give up this idea, and to consider all from 
the Cove westward a set of rocks harmonizing entirely with those which compose 
the greater part of the Merse as the lower and older measures of the coal forma-

Zooloy.— In this department there is very considerable variety 
and interest, from the extent of wood and sea coast, and from the 
varied character of the scenery. A tradition exists, that " the 
wood of Penmanshiel was at one time frequented by wolves a 
very pretty story being told of two fair ladies sisters who, in a 
path of that wood, since named from them " Sisterpath," were 
destroyed by these ferocious animals : the only consolation left to 
an unfortunate lover of one of the ladies being to collect next day 
their mangled remains, and to deposit them in an urn near the 
fatal spot,— which urn was found some years ago, and is" now in 
the possession of Sir John Hall, Bart. Foxes are numerous : all 
the varieties recognized by sportsmen being occasionally seen. 
The badger is very frequently met with, both in the rocky deans 
and on the sea coast. The polecat, weasel, and ermine are also 
abundant, and the martin [Maries fagorum is said, a good number 
of years ago, to have inhabited the woods near the Pease Bridge. 
The red squirrel Schirus vulgaris is also said at one time to 
have been a denizen of Dunglass woods. The otter Lutra vulga- 
ris is occasionally seen near the mouths of the rivulets, and ocr- 
casionally, also, the common seal {Phoca vitulina. 

Ornithology. — In Penmanshiel wood, jays build in considerable 
numbers. On the margins of the little streams we frequently 
see the beautiful kingfisher. The golden crested wren [Regulus 
cristatus is also of frequent occurrence ; and many a bird of fair 
and foreign plumage is occasionally seen to halt for a day or two 
among the woody retreats of the parish. Of these occasional vi- 
sitants, we may notice, in particular, the Bohemian chatterer 
[Bomhycilla garrula, Temm., the hoopoe [Upupa epops, and the 
golden oriole [Oriolus galhula. The sea eagle also has been oc- 
casionally shot. Hawks of many kinds build on the rocky sides 
of the deans, and on the lofty sea cliffs ; the hunting hawk being 
frequently met with on the Redheugh coast. The raven [Corvus 

tion ; lower probably in point of position than even the lowest measures of the coal 
field round Newcastle. 

In conclusion, I may only observe farther, that the two distinguished naturalists 
above named were equally struck with the great similarity of these rocks in many 
places to the new red sandstone of England, and that it was not till after a very care- 
ful examination that tiiey felt themselves warranted to pronounce them as belonging 
to the coal formation. 

• In reference to this late investigation of Messrs Sedgwick and Murchison, it may 
be remarked, that Professor Jameson, in a memoir on East Lothian, which tract, 
geologically considered, is a continuation of lierwickshirc, read before the Wernerian 
Society in the year 1815, remarks, " That the red sandstone, where its junctions can 
be seen, is observed to rest on transition rocks, and to be covered more or less eom- 
letely with the common rocks of the coal formation," which is the iOsition given to 
these formations by the Eiiglisii geologists just mentioned.

corax builds on the most inaccessible sea cliffs, the carrion crow 
C. corone, and the hooded or royston crow {C. comix being also 
abundant. But perhaps the most interesting bird on this coast 
IS the red-legged crow, or Cornish chough {Pyrrhocorax gra- 
cuius, a bird mentioned about 300 years ago by Bishop Lesslie, in 
his work « de Origine Scotorum," as occurring on the eastern coast 
of Scotland, but which, since his days, had apparently been totally 
lost sight of, till a few years ago the author of these remarks found 
means to intimate its occurrence on these coasts to P. J. Selby, 
Esq. ; thus confirming the accuracy of the Bishop's information, 
and showing, in consequence, that the limits usually assigned to 
the distribution of the chough in this country are erroneous. 
Rock-pigeons occur in great abundance in the sea caves, &amp;c. 
along the coast; and, owing to the neighbourhood of St Abb's 
Head, well known as one of the principal breeding stations of sea 
fowl in the island, the variety of sea gulls and other aquatic birds 
frequenting the coast is very great. The goatsucker, or night- 
jar, {Caprimuljus Europeus, has also been frequently shot. 

Game is tolerably abundant : the usual kinds being the red 
grous, black-cock, partridge, pheasant, woodcock, dottrel, &amp;c. 

Reptiles, 8fc. — In the woods and moors we meet with the adder 
or viper  Fijjera communis in considerable abundance, and occa- 
sionally, also, the blind worm {Anguis fragilis is observed in the 
heaths and upland coppices. Three species of eft also occur : viz. 
Triton jmlustris, T. aquaticus, and T. vulgaris. The Lacerta 
agilis, or nimble lizard, is occasionally seen in the sunny heaths, and 
the natter-jack {Bvfo rubeta, we have seen one specimen of. 

Botany. — In this department of natural history there is also con- 
siderable interest, partly from the variety of natural scenery and 
elevation, and partly from the quantity of ground still in a state 
of nature. The deans are all interesting botanical stations. The 
shore also furnishes some interesting plants; and Penmanshiel 
wood contributes its numbers. Of all these, however, Dunlass 
Dean is certainly the richest and most interesting: a glen of 
such uncommon beauty and picturesque effect, that it never fails 
to excite in all who visit it the greatest admiration. This beau-

for about two miles, the western boundary of this parish, and

most beautiful which cau be imagiued. Ou its western side 
stands the elegant mansion of Dunglass, Sir John Hall, Bart. a 
residence of uncommon beauty. Occurring in this station, we 
have to notice, among a host of others, the following plants, 
which we mention, because many of them are rare in other dis- 
tricts: Veronica montana, Vicia sylvatica, Chnjsosplenium alter- 
nifoUum, Pyrola media, Anchusa sempervirens, Epilohium angus- 
tifoKwn, Eupatorium cannabinum, Circaa lutetiana, Allium ursi- 
num, Thalictrum flavum, Cardamine amara, Hypericum Immifu- 
sum, Lepidium campestre, Epipactis nidus avis, Melica carulea, M. 
unifiora, &amp;c. Belonging to the Cryptogamous class, we notice in 
the same situation the following interesting and beautiful indivi- 
duals belonging to the order Filices : Scolopendrum vulgare, in 
great abundance, and exceedingly ornamental ; Asplenium adian- 
tum nigrum, A. Trichomanes, Aspidium lohatum, A. aculeatum, 
A. dilatatum, Pohjpodium dryopteris, &amp;c. Among the mosses 
may be mentioned the following, as occurring in very great pro- 
fusion, as well as in very fine fruit : Bryum punctatum, B. ros- 
tratum, Hypnum undulatum, H. proliferum, H. alopecurum, Bryum 
hornum, Hookeria lucens, &amp;c. On the shore, we meet with the 
Thalictrum minus, Glaucium luteum., Erythrcea Centaurium, Cakile 
maritima, Ligusticum Scoticum, Silene maritima, Statice armeria, 
and the beautiful Pulmonaria maritima, first noticed on these 
shores by the great Ray 1661, and lately rediscovered in the 
same situation. In various situations in the parish, we meet with 
the beautiful Dianthus deltoides. In the Pease Dean and Tower 
Dean the Campanida latifolia is abundant, and highly oniamen- 
tal. In the latter dean, we also meet with the Euonymus Euro- 
pceus, Saxifraga umhrosa, and the Aspidium angulare, being the 
first Scottish station, so far as we are aware, for this very hand- 
some fern. On the sides of the hills, we meet with the Juniperus 
communis in abundance; Genista Anglica, Gnaphalium dioicum, 
Tormentilla reptans, &amp;c. while, in other parts of the parish, we 
have noted the following plants, as being worthy of a place in 
this sketch of the natural history of the parish, — Trollius Euro- 
poius, Drosera rotundifolia, Fumaria clavicidata, Stachys arvensis, 
Peplis portula, Menyanthes trifoliata, Sedum Anglicum, Scutellaria 
galericulata, Cichorium intyhus, Hyoscyamus niger, Rliodiola rosea, 
Symphytum tuberosum, Anemone nemorosa, Cistus Helianthemum, 
Trifolium scahrum, T. arvense, BJiamnus catharticus, &amp;c. &amp;c.

parish, without a few observations on the woods and plantations, 
and the principal trees within its bounds. In all, there are about 
550 acres of wood, of which about 440 belong to Sir John Hall, 
Bart, principal proprietor in the parish. These woods are of dif- 
ferent descriptions,, but, for the most part, they are natural. Con- 
siderable quantities of trees, however, have, especially of late years, 
been planted. The soil is evidently most congenial to oak, and 
this, accordingly, is the principal tree in the parish, — there being 
about 300 acres covered with it. Generally speaking, the species 
is the Quercus sessilijlora, not the Qiiercus robur ; and many very 
fine picturesque trees of this kind ornament the rocky sides of seve- 
ral of the deans. Much attention has been paid by Sir John Hall to 
the management of his woods. Indeed, nowhere is a better sys- 
tem carried on, and nowhere, accordingly, are woods in a more 
thriving condition. From this attention which has been paid to 
the subject, the following facts become apparent, — that on soil 
fo rmed from the debris of greywacke, Scotch firs and beeches will 
not thrive, though many attempts have been made for this pur- 
pose ; but that oaks, on whatever soil they are planted, uniformly 
succeed. On the sandstone district, however, especially in the 
neighbourhood of Dunglass, both firs and beeches thrive amazingly, 
— there being few places in this country where finer trees of the 
latter are to be seen. A considerable number of Spanish chest- 
nuts have been planted, within a few years, in both districts of the 
parish ; and in both situations they thrive well. A good number 
of larches have also been planted, principally for the purpose of 
sheltering the young hard-wood. Many of the beeches in Dun- 
glass Dean, and in the park, are above 100 feet in height, and 
-hundreds of them have an average girth of 8 feet. There are also 
some very fine sycamore trees, and a considerable number of large 
and very handsome ashes. Among the more ornamental trees, 
the holly seems to be one that suits the soil and climate best. The 
laburnum also thrives well ; and there is not, perhaps, a spot in 
the kingdom where the ivy is more luxuriant or ornamental. In 
the mosses, some very large fossil oaks have been occasionally met 
with. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — So far as we are aware, there is no account of the 
history of this parish, either printed or in manuscript, with the ex- 
ception of the last Statistical Account. That it has been the theatre, 
however, of many important events, and that its ancient history,

therefore, is far from being devoid of interest, there are many ap- 
pearances tending to show, in addition to numerous notices scat- 
tered throughout the works of our older chroniclers. Many re- 
mains of military stations and fortifications may be traced in dif- 
ferent parts of the parish, — particularly in the neighbourhood of 
the deans, which at one time were all very formidable and import- 
ant passes. Some of these remains are evidently British ; others 
appear to be Danish. Of the former description, a very fine spe- 
cimen is to be seen on the summit of Ewieside Hill ; and of the 
latter, an equally interesting specimen occurs at the mouth of 
Dunglass Dean, on th§ summit of a lofty precipice overhanging 
the sea, from the shore of which, by very great labour, a covered 
way has at one time been cut through the rock, leading, by a wind- 
ing course, to the fortification above. About three years ago, when 
this ancient encampment was broken up for the purpose of con- 
verting it into arable land, a great number of human skeletons, 
many in very good preservation, were dug up. The mode of in- 
terment had been very simple, — four large rough stones serving 
the purpose of both grave and coflin. Vestiges of the Romans 
may also be traced in several parts of the parish, — many urns hav- 
ing in various places been turned up by the plough, with several 
articles decidedly of Roman workmanship. 

In 1544, the English army, under the Earl of Hertford, passed 
through this parish in returning from their desolating inroad into 
Scotland ; and in 1548 it formed also part of the route of the Earl 
of Somerset's army in his memorable expedition. Several very 
curious accounts of the passage of both armies through the parish, 
particularly of their passage of the Pease and Tower Deans, are 
still in existence, and show how very important, in a military point 
of view, were these valleys or ravines. 

Nearly in the centre of the parish, or about a mile east from 
the village of Cockburnspath, stand the ruins of an old castle, 
commonly called Cockburnspath Tower. It does not seem ever 
to have been a place of great extent, having been evidently built 
to protect the strong pass or ravine, on the edge of which it 
stands.  So early as 1073, this castle of Colbrandspath ap- 
pears to have belonged to the Earl of Dunbar and March. Such 
is the statement of Boecius, who also gives the following ac- 

 In Grose's Antiquities there is a skctcli of this tower, rcpjarding which tlic aii- 
tlior remarks : "If tlie apijellation of Cckiiiriis]ath, by whidi it is at iircsent called

count of its coming into that family: " About the year 1061," 
says he, " a formidable band of robbers infested the south-east 
part of Scotland, One Patrick Dunbar attacked them, — slew 
600 — hanged four score, — and presented the head of their com- 
mander to the king. That valour might not remain in obscu- 
rity, the king created him Earl of March, and bestowed on him 
the lands of Colbrandspath, to be held by the tenure of clearing 
East Lothian and Merse of robbers, and bearing a banner, whereon 
the bloody head of a robber was painted." What credit may be 
due to this relation we do not inquire ; but it seems evident, that, 
at a very early period, the Earls of March possessed this castle, as 
well as that of Dunbar, — these forts being at that time of such 
strength and importance as to be considered keys of the kingdom. 
In 1484, King James III. having proposed to the Parhament, on 
the attainder of the Earls of March, to annex unalterably to the 
crown the Eai'ldoms of March and Annandale, with the baronies 
of Dunbar and Colbrandspath, the borderers, fearful of a more 
rigid discipline than that to which they had been accustomed, 
raised a rebellion, in which the king was slain. In this rebellion, 
the rebels took the castle of Dunbar. This castle and barony of 
Colbrandspath appear subsequently to have formed part of the 
dowry, or marriage portion, of several of our king's daughters. 
It now belongs to Sir John Hall, Bart, of Dunglass, into whose 
family it came nearly two centuries ago. The immediately pre- 
ceding possessor was the Earl of Home. 

In the annexed parish of Old Cambus, the ruins of the old church 
named St Helen's still remain, overhanging a high precipice on 
the shore, and commanding a very striking and extensive pros- 
pect. With regard to the history of this building, and, indeed, 
the ancient history of this part of the parish in general, very little 
is kno\n. Even the date of the union of the two parishes appears 
to be lost. From the nature of the building, however, which is a 
very simple piece of Saxon architecture, and from several other 
circumstances, it is supposed to have been erected some time in 
the seventh century. It was dedicated to St Helena, mother 
of Constantine the Great, and the circumstances of its erection, 
&amp;c. have been thus handed down by tradition : Three Northum- 
brian princesses, having found it advisable to seek refuge in Scot- 
land from a violent war which had broken out in their father's do-

minions, set sail with some friends and domestics in a small ves- 
sel bound for some port in the Frith of Forth. A contrary wind, 
however, having' sprung up, they could not weather St Abb's Head, 
but were obliged to land in some part near it. On landing, they 
were hospitably entertained by the Bishop or Prior of Colding- 
ham ; and, out of gratitude to the respective saints, through whose 
intercession, as they imagined, their 'lives had been preserved, they 
erected severally a chapel at their own expense, viz. St Abb's, on 
the summit of "the Head St Helen's, in the parish of Old Cam- 
bus; and St Bee's, on the shore of Dunbar; which last, however, 
has long since disappeared. Near this remarkable old ruin a con- 
siderable number of coins were found about three years ago, to- 
gether with an ancient rosary. Many of the coins were much de- 
faced, but others were exceedingly perfect. They were of silver, 
and of Athelstan or Edelstan the Great, grandson of Alfred the 
Great. 

Eminent Men. — With the exception of the late Sir James Hall, 
Bart, of Dunglass, we are not aware of any eminent departed cha- 
racters with whom the parish can claim any connection. Even he, 
indeed, can hardly be said to have any immediate connection with 
the parish, since neither his birth-place nor his residence were in 
it. Dunglass, however, being so very contiguous, to which the 
greater part of the parish belongs, we cannot omit his name, 
which will be respected as long as natural science is cultivated, to 
the advancement of which he so materially contributed. 

Land-oiDners. — The land-owners, according to the value and ex- 
tent of their respective properties, are, 1. Sir John Hall, Bart, of 
Dunglass, who possesses nearly three-fourths of the parish; 2. 
James Hunter of Thurston, Esq. ; 3. Sir J. G. Suttie, Bart, of 
Balgone ; 4. W. W. Hay, Esq. of Blackburn ; 5. Thomas Broad- 
wood, Esq. of Fulfordlees ; and 6. James Balfour, Esq. of Whit- 
tingham, M. P. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers consist of three 
folio volumes, containing an account of the births and marriages 
which have happened in the parish from December 18, 1642, to 
the present time. They appear to have been very regularly kept, 
particularly that of marriages; but within the last thirty years pa- 
rents have become very negligent in getting the names of their 
children entered in the baptismal register.

lation of this parish prior to the former Statistical Account iu 
1794; but, if a conjecture might be formed regarding its state 
from the number of births and marriages which were yearly entered 
in the parish register about a century ago, the number of inhabit- 
ants must have been at that time one-half greater than it is at 
present. The principal reason assigned for this diminution, as 
stated in the former Statistical Account, is ihe cessation of seve- 
ral collieries at that time in activity, and the loss of the various 
advantages connected with them. 

In 1755, the population was 919

1811, - - 921 

1821, ... 966 

1831, - - 1143 

The increase betwixt 1821 and 1831 is to be attributed partly 
to the improved state of agriculture in the parish, and partly to 
the erection of a small harbour at the Cove, which, at the time 
the last census was taken, was still unfinished ; and, consequently, 
several strangers probably about thirty are included in it who 
have now left the parish. Of the population in 1831, the number 
of males was 570 ; that of females, 573. The yearly average of 
births for the last seven years is uncertain, from parents neglecting 
to register their children. Of deaths there is no correct record 
kept. Of marriages the yearly average for the above period is 
10. Number of families, 227 ; of inhabited houses, 213; number 
of houses uninhabited, or at present building, 8; of fatuous people 
there are 4 ; of deaf and dumb, 2. 

The number of families chiefly employed in agriculture is, - - 123

There are no resident heritors in the parish. The number of 
proprietors of land is 16 ;— the lowest rental being L. 175; the 
highest L. 1050. 

Character and Habits of the People.— people, generally 
speaking, are of a strong robust frame ; for the most part cleanly 
in their habits, houses, and dress ; and seem, on the whole, to en- 
joy, in a very competent degree, the comforts and advantages of 
society. The ordinary food of the peasantry at their meals is 
oat-meal, milk, potatoes, and pork. Almost every family keeps a 
pig, and few are so poor that they cannot at a time afford a little 
mutton or beef. In general they appear to be contented with their 
situation and circumstances. Both smuggling and poaching in 
game prevailed at one time, we have understood, to a great ex- 
tent. Both, however, have been given up ;— the latter, we trust,

from the improved morality and comfort of the inhabitants ; the 
former, principally at least we suspect, from the superintendence 
of the coast guard, who have a station within the parish, consisting- 
of six boatmen and a commanding officer.

Rent of Land. — From the great diversity in the quality of the 
soil, it is not very easy to state the average rent of arable land in 
the parish. A considerable part of the farm of Pathhead, and 
other lauds near the village of Cockburnspath, rent as high as 
L. 3 per acre ; while in some other parts of the parish, the rent of 
arable land per acre is as low as 5s. or 8s. The difficulty of stating 
an average sum is increased from the circumstance, that most of the 
farms are let at corn rents. Perhaps the average sum for the 
lower part of the parish may be stated at L. 1, 15s. per acre, and 
for the whole parish at L. 1. The rent of grazing an ox or cow 
may be averaged at L. 3 for the whole parish a ewe or full-grown 
sheep at 8s. The rental of the parish may be estimated at about 
L. 8000. 

Prices of Labour. — Ploughmen or hinds throughout the parish, 
with some trifling variations, are paid as follows: — 10 bolls of oats ; 
3 bolls of barley ; 2 small bolls, or 6 firlots of peas ; L.3 of sheep- 
money as it is called in this parish, or falloio-money, as it is named 
in some other parts of Berwickshire ; a cow kept summer and win - 
ter; 3 bolls of coals at 12 cwt. per boll; and 12 bolls, at an ave- 
rage, of potatoes. Every hind and cottar is required to keep a 
hondayer. It should also be mentioned, that the hind's wife, instead 
of the payment of rent for the house and small garden attached to it, 
gives her services in cutting down the crop in harvest. Formerly it 
was permitted to the hinds to keep poultry, — a practice now very 
generally given up. Instead of this privilege they are allowed one- 
half boll of barley. Altogether a hind's income cannot at present 
be stated at more than from L. 22 to L. 24 per annum. Men-ser- 
vants, with board, &amp;c. receive for wages L. 9, lOs;, — that is, L. 5 for 
summer and L. 4, 10s. for winter ; women servants receive generally 
L. 7, viz. L. 5 for the summer half year, and L. 2 for the winter. 



308 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



Farm-labourers, labourers employed on the roads, &amp;c. are paid 
at the rate of" 10s. per week for the summer half year, and 9s. for 
the winter. The wages of mason and carpenter may be stated 
from 15s. to 18s. per v/eek. 

Prices of Iw.jlementSi Sfc. — A double horse cart, full mounted, 
with iron axletree, costs L. 12, 12s. ; a single horse cart, do. do. 
L. 10, 10s.; a long cart do. without wheels, L. 4, 4s.; a wheel- 
barrow, full mounted, 18s. ; an iron plough, full mounted, L. 3, 
3s.; a wooden plough, L. 1, 15s. ; a pair of wooden harrows, full 
mounted, L. 2, 2s. ; building stone and lime dikes, per square rood, 
18s.; building dry-stone dikes, per running rood, 3s.; sawing of 
fir-wood, per 100 feet, 2s. 6d. ; sawing of hard-wood, do. 4s. 6d. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The breeds of sheep in the parish are 
various, according to the soil and situation. On the best land the 
pure Leicester is the breed preferred; on the higher ground they 
are generally of the Cheviot breed. A considerable number of 
half Leicester and half Cheviot are also kept. Very few black- 
faced are kept. Until lately, it cannot be said that much atten- 
tion has been paid to the improvement of the breed of cattle. The 
cows at one time were of a very ordinary description ; but of late 
years, it has been a practice for two or three neighbouring tenants 
to club together and keep a well-bred bull, since which time a very 
considerable improvement has taken place. More attention than 
formerly is also paying to the breed of farm-horses. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry pursued differs consider- 
ably in different parts of the parish ; but it may be safely affirmed, 
that in no part of the island is the management of land better \m - 
derstood than in this parish. The farmers of this neighbourhood 
have long been distinguished for intelligence and enterprise, and 
the changes which in consequence have taken place of late years, 
and are still taking place on the appearance of the country, are 
great. On one farm, 100 acres of ntioor have, within ten years, been 
added to the cultivated land of the parish; on another, 150 acres 
have been reclaimed within six years ; and on various other farms 
the changes have been equally great. The general rotation of 
crops in the upper part of the parish is what is called the five-shift 
rotation, viz. 1. turnips or fallow; 2. barley or wheat; 3. grass; 
4. grass ; 5. oats. On the best land of the parish the rotation is 
the six-shift, viz. 1. fallow; 2. wheat; 3. hay; 4. oats; 5. beans; 
6. wheat. The four-shift is also followed in some parts of the pa- 
rish. The distance from lime is inconsiderable; but as the coals

necessary for burning it are all brought from a distance, it is not 
cheap. Sea-ware is much used, and highly esteemed as a manure. 
Bone-dust is also used to a very great extent, — a manure, the dis- 
covery of which has been of immense use in reclaiming waste 
ground not only in this parish, but generally throughout the coun- 
try. In no part of Berwickshire is it used in such quantity as in 
this parish. A very striking instance of the importance of this ma- 
nure may be seen in the case of the farm of Bowshiel, in this pa- 
rish, where, by means of it, large tracks of high ground have not 
only been reclaimed, but are now producing immense crops. 

The leases of farms are from nineteen to twenty-one years; 
a smaller duration being considered unfavourable to the occu- 
pier. . 

Notwithstanding the acknowledged high state of agriculture, we 
fear that a great deal cannot be said in commendation of the state 
of farm-buildings and enclosures in the parish. Compared with 
many other districts of inferior importance, the former may be de- 
scribed as possessed of very ordinary comforts ; in most places of 
Berwickshire, both the farm-houses and steadings being superior. 
Throughout a considerable part of the parish, we may also state 
that little has been done in the way of enclosing land, — a circum- 
stance which forcibly strikes the traveller in passing, and for which 
deficiency we have never heard any good reasons assigned. Among 
the principal improvements which have taken place of late years, 
may be mentioned casually the new line of post road from Dun- 
glass Bridge to Renton, — the recently constructed pier and har- 
bour at the Cove, and universal drainage. 

There is hardly a necessity for a single remark on the quarries 
and mines of the parish. The only quarry worth mentioning is 
near the mouth of the Pease burn. The rock is the old red sand- 
stone, and principally valuable on account of its qualification of 
standing heat. 

Fisheries. — There are no river fisheries; but the coast affords con- 
siderable numbers and variety, giving employment to sixteen fami- 
lies, fourteen at the Cove, and two in Old Cambus district. The 
common fishes are, cod, haddock, whiting, ling, skate, halibut, and 
turbot. A great number of crabs and lobsters are taken at particu- 
lar seasons, the latter being generally shipped for London from the 
port of Dunbar. Shrimps and prawns are numerous, but they are 
not taken. Herrings in former years used to frequent the coast, but 
for about eight years past, with the exception of a few shoals in

BERWICKSHIRE. 



the end of September 1833, no herrings have been seen in this 
neighbourhood. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, calculated as carefully as possible, may be stated as 
follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man or tlic domestic 
animals, - . . . L. 12880 0 0 

Of potatoes, turnips, cabbages, and other plants cultivated in the 

fields for food, - - ... 350O 0 0 

Of hay, whether meadow or cultivated, ... 70O 0 0 

Of land in pasture, rating it at L. 3 per cow or full-grown ox grazed 
for the season, and at 8s. per ewe or full-grown sheep pastured 
for the year, ...... 2000 0 0 

Annual thinning, &amp;c. of woods, .... 500 0 0 



Total yearly value of produce raised, L. 19,580 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villages, and Means of Communication. — Though hardly en- 
titled to the dignified appellation of a market-town, the village of 
Cockburnspath may nevertheless be said to possess all the advan- 
tages of one. On its shops and tradesmen a considerable surround - 
ing district is dependent, there being no place of equal size or con- 
sequence nearer than Dunbar on one side, or Dunse or Ayton on 
the other ; the first town being eight miles distant, the two last 
fourteen. It is a neat clean village, containing a population of 
about 230, and affording to a great portion of several neighbouring 
parishes all the necessaries, and not a few of the luxuries, of life. 
Between thirty and forty years ago, this village presented a most 
decayed and nniserable appearance, but, under the judicious ma- 
nagement of Lady Helen Hall, lady of the late distinguished Sir 
James Hall, Bart., it has been amazingly improved both in com- 
fort and in appearance.  The village contains a surgeon, a 
baker, a butcher, 2 grocers, or rather general merchants, one 
of whom has long carried on an extensive trade both wholesale 
and retail, 2 carpenters, who generally employ from 3 to 5 jour- 
neymen each, 3 tailors, one of whom usually employs 3 or 4 men, 
2 smiths, 3 shoemakers, two of whom keep from 3 to 6 men each, 
1 cooper, 1 constable, several masons, various dress-makers, straw- 
hat manufacturers, &amp;c. The village belongs to Sir John Hall, 
Bart., and the householders are all tenants at will, there being no 
such thing as a feu in this parish. A considerable village exist-

resided at Dunglass, and whose absence would be deeply folt, wei c it not tliat fortu- 
nately the same spirit of kindness and charity has descended to her successor, the

rish and neiglibourhood are deserving of all praise and imitation.

ed at one time at Old Cambus, but it is now reduced to a few 
houses. 

The parish contains no post-office ; but by means of a runner 
who goes to Dunbar every morning, and returns in the evening, 
more than the usual advantages of a post-office are enjoyed. The 
parish has the peculiar advantage of being intersected by public 
roads, which afford convenient and easy communication to all quar- 
ters. The great eastern road from Edinburgh to London by Ber- 
wick passes through the centre of the parish, in a direction from 
N. W. to S. E. ; its length from Dunglass Bridge to the other ex- 
tremity of the parish being about five miles. A considerable part 
of it is entirely new within the last twenty-four years. Before that 
date the road was nearer tbe coast, passing along an old and very 
inconvenient bridge at one place, and along the Pease Bridge at 
another, which last was built in 1785-1786, in order to avoid the 
very dangerous pass which travellers, before that time, were ob- 
liged to cross near the sea. Part of this oldest road still remains 
rising through a height of upwards of 150 feet at a declivity of 
1 foot in 5. Many old people in the parish still remember the mail 
travelling by this road. At that time it was carried on horseback, 
the post-office being at Old Cambus. When this old road was 
changed, the line by the Pease Bridge, &amp;c. was considered, as well 
it might, a very great improvement. This, however, has also been 
abandoned. The last made Hue leaves the old road at Cockburns- 
path Tower, about half a mile westward from the Pease Bridge, 
passing in a south-east direction into the valley of the Eye by Ren- 
ton, &amp;c. This new line of road has been of great advantage to 
the parish, and though generally excellent, is still susceptible of 
great improvement. The numerous deep ravines which intersect 
the parish, give occasion to several striking and picturesque bridge 
scenes. Of these bridges there are four particularly deserving of 
notice, two across Dunglass Dean, one very ancient and pictu- 
resque, the other more- modern and exceedingly beautiful, both 
in itself and in its accompaniments of rocks, woods, and waters. It 
consists of one spacious arch, about ninety feet above the bed of 
the little stream, the view from the top of the bridge being seldom 
equalled in beauty. About two miles eastward, at the old castle 
of Cockburnspath, the road is carried along another bridge, which, 
though not equal to the former in architectural beauty, is never- 
theless, from its height and the wild beauty of the glen which it 
crosses, a very picturesque and pleasing object. 

Pease Bridge. — But the chief of picturesque and striking

bridges is undoubtedly the Pease Bridge, to which we have al- 
ready more than once alluded, but which demands a more par- 
ticular notice. It is situated about one mile and a-half eastward 
from the village of Cockburnspath, crossing a very deep and spa- 
cious ravine, formed by a little rapid river called the Pease burn. 
Its length is 300 feet, its breadth 16, and its height 127. It has 
four arches, two of which rest on the banks of the chasm ; a tall 
slender pier rising from the middle of the glen supports the other 
two. The view from the top of the bridge into the rocky yet 
richly wooded glen beneath, well repays a very long and fatig- 
uing journey, but, to be properly impressed with the stupendous 
height of this beautiful structure, it is proper that strangers should 
descend the side of the glen to the bed of the stream, from which the 
view is equally sublime and beautiful. The bridge was built by 
Mr Henderson, and as a specimen of architecture has been long 
admired. In addition to these lengthened notices we may be al- 
lowed to mention, that in former times the Pease was considered 
a pass of great importance, from the circumstance, that a very few 
men were able to defend it against a multitude. Accordingly, it 
was one of the channels of escape which the Scottish army block- 
ed up against Oliver Cromwell in the year 1650, and that cele- 
brated general describes it in his dispatch to the Parliament, after 
the battle, as a place, " where one man to hinder is better than 
twelve to make way." 

The other roads in the parish require no particular notice. 
They are generally kept in good repair, though, from the inequa- 
lities of the ground, &amp;c. this is not always very easy. 

Three coaches pass and repass daily, changing horses at the 
inn of Cockburnspath. These are, the Mail, the Union, a four- 
horse coach from Edinburgh to Newcastle, and a two-horse coach 
from Edinburgh to Berwick. 

Harbours, Src. — At the Cove, distant about three-fourths of a mile 
from the village of Cockburnspath, a small harbour was completed in 
the month of October 1831. More than seventy years ago, a 
similar attempt was made by Sir John Hall, Bart., of Dunglass, 
who had actually proceeded a considerable way in the erection of 
a pier, when a heavy sea from the north-east entirely destroyed 
it. A similar fate befel another attempt immediately before the 
present pier was erected, which, in consequence, was built upon 
another plan, and may now safely bid defiance to any sea. The 
expense of this woi'k, which was considerable, was defrayed partly 

3 



COCKBURNSPATH AND OLD CAMBUS. 



313 



by Government, partly by Sir John Hall, Bart. Unfortunately it 
is found to be of much less advantage than was anticipated, the 
consequence, we believe, of a change in the direction of the main 
pier from that originally proposed, which, though intended as an 
improvement, has turned out the very reverse. The entrance, 
likewise, is too wide, admitting too much sea. Though intended 
principally as a protection for fishing-boats, larger vessels, never- 
theless, occasionally come in laden with coals, bone-dust, &amp;c. It 
will hardly, however, admit with safety vessels above sixty tons 
burden. 

Ecclesiastical State.— TXe church, though situated much nearer 
one corner of the parish than any other, may, nevertheless, be 
described as so far convenient, that it stands in the most populous 
part of it. It is only about half a mile from the extremity of the 
parish in one direction, while in some others, it is fully four and 
five miles distant. We have sometimes found, however, that those 
who come the farthest attend most regularly. When the church 
was built, I have never been able to discover. It is, however, an 
ancient structure ; — one of the stones taken from it at a late re- 
pair bearing the date of 1163. It remained long in a most un- 
comfortable state; but repairs at various times have been made 
upon it, especially in 1807, when it was newly seated and ren- 
dered more comfortable ; and again to a trifling extent in 1826. 
Additional repairs have been obtained since the writer of this 
account was settled in the parish, 100 new sittings having been 
added, and the church-yard, which before his settlement was in a 
most disgraceful state, having been well-fenced and made as neat 
as any church-yard in the county. With the late additional sit- 
tings, there is accommodation for about 400 people. The seats 
belong entirely to the heritors. 

I have never been able to learn at what time the manse was 
built. The greater part of it, however, is evidently ancient. It 
was repaired in 1791, and again in 1808. Some additional re- 
pairs were also obtained about two years ago, which have made a 
comfortable, though certainly by no means either an elegant or 
very commodious mansion. 

The glebe measures about 7- English acres, and is let at the 
rate of L. 3 per acre, including the driving of coals and the quan- 
tity of potatoes required by the minister. 

The stipend modified in March 1831 is seventeen chalders, 
half meal and half barley, at the highest Merse fiars prices, with 



314

two bolls of wheat. The allowance for communion elements is 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. The amount converted into money was for crop and 
year 1832, nearly L. 230; for crop 1833 about L.220. The 
Crown is the patron of this living. 

A chapel belonging to the United Secession church was erected 
about forty-five years ago at Stockbridge, about a mile south from 
the village of Cockburnspath. Particular circumstances led to its 
erection, which it would not be agreeable here to state but hav- 
ing once been erected, it has continued not only to exist, but to 
keep together a very considerable congregation. It ought to be 
stated, however, that the congregation is not all from this parish, 
but that a pretty large portion of it is from the adjoining neigh- 
bourhood. The managers have the letting of the seats, and they 
bind themselves to pay their minister L. 100 per annum. This 
sum, however, notwithstanding that a considerable debt still re- 
mains unpaid, is generally increased, so as to make the minister's 
income from L. 120 to L, 125 per annum. 

The chapel is to be considered in the light of a feu from Sir 
John Hall, Bart, a yearly acknowledgment being now exacted of 
a boll and a half of barley. 

The number of famihes attending the Established church is 
about 112, but a considerable additional number attend from the 
adjoining parish of Oldhamstocks, on account of the more con- 
venient distance. The number of families in the parish who at- 
tend the meeting is about 87. There are some families in the 
parish who are members neither of church nor meeting, and these 
we have not included. The number of male heads of families in 
communion with the church is 90, attached to the meeting 74. 
The average number of communicants at the Established church 
is about 285. Notwithstanding what we must acknoM'ledge to be 
the very considerable number in this parish attached to the Seces- 
sion, it is exceedingly gratifying to be able to state, and we do it 
from a very recent personal visit to almost every house in the pa- 
rish, that exceedingly few, indeed, can be said to be attached to 
voluntary principles, notwithstanding the too numerous attempts 
at the present time to inflame men's minds upon this subject. 
Wei'e people left to their own quiet judgments, there is no wish, 
we are persuaded, throughout this country, that the Established 
church should be overturned. Multitudes we have seen who do 
not even know what is meant by the term voluntary, and, from 
what we have lately seen, we are perfectly certain that many of 



1

315 



those Dissenting ministers who now advocate so boldly and confi- 
dently, the voluntary scheme, would be somewhat mortified, as 
well as surprised, if they were to take the sense of their congrega- 
tions on this important question. Divine service, we are happy to 
state, is generally very well attended, both at church and meeting. 

Education.— There are three schools in the parish, the paro- 
chial school, a school supported by subscription in the village of 
Cockburnspath, and an endowed school in the district of Old Cam- 
bus. In the parochial school, which is ably conducted, the bran- 
ches generally taught are, English reading, English grammar, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, book-keeping, Latin, and practical mathematics; 
sometimes also Greek, French, geography, and the theory of ma- 
thematics. The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 30, and 
the yearly average amount of school fees for the last ten years is 
L. 45. This sum, however, is never completely realized on ac- 
count of bad payments. The yearly season for teaching continues 
for three quarters and a-half, each thirteen weeks, and the expense 
of attendance during that time is, for English reading, 10s. 6d. ; 
writing, 14s. ; arithmetic, 17s. 6d. ; Latin, L. 1, 6s. 3d. The ave- 
rage annual number of scholars is 90. The school-house is good, 
but the dwelHng-house is very uncomfortable. Repairs, however, 
have been ordered, and are to be proceeded with immediately. 
The branches taught in the other two schools are neariy similar to 
those in the parochial. The average number attending the sub-i 
scription school is 30, attending the Old Cambus school, 45. 
This last school, which is also well taught, has a salary attached 
to it of 8 bolls of oats, and L. 13 of money, with a free house. 
The number of children under five years of age who are now learn- 
ing to read is, of males, 7 ; of females, 5 : total, 12. Of children 
between five and fifteen, now learning to read, the number is of 
males, 116 ; of females, 60 ; total, 176. Of children between five 
and fifteen years of age, now learning to write, the number is, of 
males, 75 ; of females, 30 ; total, 105. One or two old people can 
neither read nor write : but, as will be seen from the foregoing 
statement, the inhabitants of this district seem on the whole to be 
very much alive to the benefits of education, while scarcely any 
part of the parish can be said to be so distant as to prevent attend- 
ance at school. 

Literature. — A subscription library has been in existence in the 
parish about twelve years, and is at present in a thriving condi- 



316 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



tion. There is also a small village library, and one or two Stib- 
bath school collections of books. 

Friendly Society, 8fc.—K Friendly Society was in existence about 
fifteen years ago, but, from some mismanagement of the funds, or 
some other reason, it became unpopular, and was broken up. No 
attempt has since been made to revive it. No savings bank exists' 
in the parish. The establishment of one, however, is in contem- 
plation. The nearest, or at least the one which might be render- 
ed most available, is that of Dunse. 

Poor and Parochial Fimds.~\Jni{\ the author of this account 
was settled in the parish, about three years and a-half ago, there 
was no legal assessment for the support of the poor ; what was re- 
quired for this purpose in addition to the collections, &amp;c. being de- 
frayed by Sir James Hall, Bart, principal heritor in the parish. 
This he preferred to a legal assessment levied upon the heritors 
according to their respective valued rents ; his reason being, that, 
if such an assessment were established, his proportion of it would 
speedily amount to more than what he formerly paid for the sup- 
port of the whole poor of the parish. A few months, however, 
after the settlement of the officiating minister, a troublesome case 
occurred, which required an extraordinary expenditure, and, as it 
was unreasonable that the Dunglass family should be charged with 
this expense, when the pauper had never been on their property, 
and as the other heritors were unwilling to contribute voluntarily, 
there was no course left but to call an heritors' meeting, and to get 
an assessment estabhshed on a just and legal footing. 

Since that time the heritors' books have every day been confirm- 
ing the correctness of Sir James Hall's prediction, — though still the 
amount is by no means great. 

The average annual number of paupers who have received pa- 
rochial aid for the three years ending at Lammas 1834 is 30. 
The average sum allotted to each per quarter is L. 1, making an ave- 
rage yearly assessment of L. 120 for the ordinary aliment of the 
poor. Extraordinary cases of distress, however, at times occur, 
demanding an additional help from the heritors. The average 
annual collection at the church doors amounts to L. 13, more than 
one-half of which goes to pay the church officers, leaving the re- 
mainder in the hands of the kirk-session for the relief of the occa- 
sional poor and distressed. The only other fund for the support 
of the poor arises from the letting of the mortclotli, and from the 
interest of 500 merks, for which the session has a bond on one of

the heritors. We wish we could say there is any thing like a ge- 
neral disposition among the poor to refrain from seeking parochial 
relief. With one or two honourable exceptions, the reverse, we 
regret to say, is the true state of the case. 

Fairs. — Cockburnspath fair is said to have been at one time a 
market of some importance. Now the principal commodities ex- 
posed to sale are gingerbread, and a few toys for children. It 
holds on the second Tuesday of August. 

Inns. — There are three licensed inns or public-houses, besides 
a toll-bar, and a shop in the village licensed to sell spirits. The 
two last might well be spared ; for, although we do not mean to 
say that the inhabitants of this parish are more addicted to intem- 
perate habits than their neighbours in other places, yet the increas- 
ing number of such houses, and the readiness with which licenses 
are granted, cannot be viewed without alarm by all who wish well 
both to the temporal and spiritual interests of the people. 

Fuel. — The general fuel is coal, but wood and peats are both 
used to a considerable extent, especially by the poorer classes. 
The coal used is principally brought by sea, either to the Cove 
harbour in this parish, or to that of Skateraw, in the adjoining pa- 
rish of Innerwick. The nearest coal wrought is on the other side 
of Berwick-upon-Tweed, more than twenty-two miles distant. In- 
cluding carriage, &amp;c. coals cost in this parish, according to the 
quality, from 9d. to Is. per cwt.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND i'lVIOTDALTS. 

THE REV. JOHN TURNBULL, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, Name, c. — The parish of Eyemouth may be de- 
scribed as nearly a square of one mile and a-half, each side, in ex- 
tent. It lies on the eastern part of the sea coast of Berwickshire, 
and is bounded on the north by the German Ocean ; on the east 
and south by the parish of Ayton ; and on the west by that of 
Coldingham. The derivation of its name is sufficiently obvious ; 
the town of Eyemouth, which contains the principal part of the 
population of the parish, being situated at the mouth of the small 
river called the Eye, which, rising at the Dodhill, in the parish of 
Oldhamstocks, and flowing through those of Cockburnspath, Cold- 
ingham, and Ayton, bounds the parish on the east side for about a 
mile and a-half, and then empties itself into the sea, forming the 
bay and harbour of Eyemouth. 

Topograpldcal Appearances. — The coast-line, commencing at 
the promontory called the Fort, which forms the northern boun- 
dary of the bay of Eyemouth, and is the great bulwark of the town 
and harbour against the gales which blow from that quarter, is rocky 
and precipitous throughout its entire extent, running at an average 
height of eighty feet above the level of the sea, and exhibiting ap- 
pearances which, to the geologist, are not devoid of interest. It 
is intersected by several remarkable fissures, or gullies, and exhi- 
bits strong symptoms of igneous agency. In one place it is per- 
forated to a short extent by a cavern, which is tenanted by flocks 
of rock-pigeons, and the roof of which is ornamented by elegant 
specimens of the Asplenium marinum. The extent of coast is a 
mile and a-half, and the beach is accessible only at three points, 
— at the Crimels, at the bay of Killiedraught, and at Eyemouth. 
At Crimels and Killiedraught, roads have been formed at con- 
siderable expense, which are used for transporting to the adjoining- 
lands the sea-weed, or ware, which is cast ashore after stormy wea- 
ther; but it is only at Eyemouth that the wall-like precipices, by 



EYEMOUTH. 



319 



which the coast is begirt, are interrupted, and that a safe and com- 
modious access is obtained to the shore. The bay of Eyemouth 
is formed by the promontory of the Fort, and by the projectmg 
point of Gunsgreen, and is protected in front by a remarkable ridge 
of rocks called the Barkers, round either extremity of which ves- 
sels pass in approaching the harbour. The position of these rocks, 
it is said, suggested to Government the idea of unitmg them to the 
mainland by cones, or buttresses, according to the plan practised 
at Cherbourg; but the vast expense which would be necessary for 
that purpose, and the very limited extent of anchorage which, after 
all, would be afforded, have caused the project, if ever seriously en- 
tertained, to be abandoned; and the bay is now only resorted to by 
vessels waiting the flow of the tide to enable them to pass into the 
harbour. Its'outhne is exceedingly graceful, sweeping round the 
bases of the houses in a semicircular form, from the harbour to the 
rocks on the opposite side ; and, on account of its gentle slope and 
gravelly bottom, it is much resorted to by bathers in the summer 
season. 

Hydrograplnj. — The only stream of any consequence is the Eye, 
a small but very ornamental river, which, at the south-eastern cor- 
ner of the parish, receives as a tributary the Ale, — a rivulet, which, 
flowing for some miles through a valley occasionally deep and pic- 
turesque, forms the southern boundary of the parish. The highest 
tides reach about half a mile above the mouth of the Eye. There 
are no lakes or cascades, nor are the springs in any respect worthy 
of particular notice. 

Geology. — The geology of the parish is in some respects very 
interesting, though occasionally very difficult to be correctly de- 
scribed, partly from the want of opportunities, in some places, of 
ascertaining the succession of the rock formations, and partly from 
the indistinct character of several of these rocks, even where they 
are sufficiently exposed to view, as, for instance, on the sea coast. 
Speaking generally, it may be described as a district consisting of 
greywackc and greywacke slate, with subordinate rocks of trap, and 
slight traces of the old red sandstone. The greywacke occupies 
only a small portion of the parish, though in the neighbourhood, 
especially towards the west, it is a very abundant rock ; the large 
parish of Coldingham being almost entirely composed of it. This 
rock we trace in the bed of the Eye throughout all its extent, the 
strata varying exceedingly both in direction and in inclination; 
though, generally speaking, they are elevated at a considerable 



BERWICKSHIRE. 

angle, hot unfrequently perfectly vertical The prevailing direc- 
tion of the strata is from west to east. In composition, this rock 
bears the same general character throughout the parish, being com- 
pact and fine-grained; in many places, indeed, it is only a variety 
of sandstone. It forms a very good building stone, and is the prin- 
cipal mineral employed for that purpose. The trap and porphyry 
rocks are more abundant; they present themselves on the western 
side of the bay of Eyemouth; but their exact position, with reference 
to the greywacke on the opposite side of the bay, it is by no means 
very easy to ascertain, the space between being constantly under wa- 
ter. These trap and porphyry rocks form very considerable preci- 
pices all along the coast, and the scenery, in consequence, is in va- 
rious places highly picturesque. With little interruption thev con- 
tinue from the town of Eyemouth to St Abb's Head, beyond which 
the greywacke again appears; but how far they extend from the coast 
into the interior cannot be easily ascertained, though probably the 
distance is inconsiderable. Of these trap rocks the principal are 
trap-tuff and felspar porphyry, the former being most abundant. 
The trap-tuff occasionally contains large masses of porphyry, a 
good deal of the green ore of copper, and large portions of grey- 
wacke. Occasionally, also, the finer portions of this rock assume 
such an appearance of stratification, as is apt not a little to puzzle 
the observer. An attentive examination, however, leads to the con- 
clusion, that, instead of stratification, it ought rather to be con - 
sidered as a modification of structure. This appearance is particu- 
larly observable beyond the Bay of Killiedraught, at the western 
extremity of the parish, it being exceedingly difficult, in examining 
several parts of the cliffs in that direction, to say whether they are 

• Opposite Netherbyres, these rocks have been quarried to a considerable extent, 
to supply stones for the improvements in progress there. At first, the strata, as 
above noticed, were found vertically disposed, but at the bottom of tlie quarry, after 
turning and twisting about in a very remarkable manner, they assumed tiie form of 
a long, low-browed double arch. The surface of tliis arch is so smooth, aiul so per- 
fectly turned, that it resembles a work of art rather than an operation of nature. A 
friend, who lias devoted much of his time to the study of the geology of Berwick- 
shire, has given the following explanation of the appearance which tliese rocks pre- 
sent : 

" The rocks in the channel of the Eye from its mouth to Ayton mill are the grey- 
wacke or transition rocks. They can be proved to have been originally deposited ho- 
rizontally. Now to account for their disturbance ; they have been, at a subsequent 
period, elevated, — and elevated by an eruption of lava or traj, which has burst through 
them in an igneous state. The Hill of Ilighlaws is coni]osed of this trap. You will 
see it in the harbour, on the north-west corner, where it has lifted up the conglome- 
rate. You will also see it on the Ilighlaws, where it is quarried. This traj, in 
bursting through and lifting up the greywacke rocks, has softened them, and in many 
]laces the greywacke strata, whilst in that softened state, have, jirobably by their own 
weight, folded over one another, and thus formed arches in apjearance." 



EYEMOUTH.

stratified or unstratified, whether they are trap or a variety of the 
graywacke. 

The only other rock which we have to notice as occurring- in the 
parish is a remarkable mass of breccia or coarse conglomerate, 
which must be referred to the old red sandstone formation. It 
forms the beautiful projecting point known by the name of the Fort, 
on the north-west side of the Bay of Eyemouth. The space which it 
occupies is inconsiderable, being apparently httle more than the 
eighth part of a mile square, with an average thickness of about 
fifty feet ; but in point both of structure and situation it is highly 
interesting. It rests immediately on the trap rocks already de- 
scribed, the junction being well seen round nearly half a mile of 
sea-coast. One-half rests on the trap-tuff, and the other on the 
porphyry. Though somewhat rude and imperfect, a stratification 
may, nevertheless, be traced, the strata being nearly horizontal. 
As in other situations where the oldest member of this formation 
is observed, it is here composed almost entirely of the detritus of 
the rocks on which it rests, and of the older rocks in the neigh- 
bourhood, viz. greywacke, porphyry, &amp;c. united generally by an 
arenaceous cement. It is remarkable that, on both sides of the 
high land terminating at St Abb's Head, we find, as we recede 
from St Abb's, and very nearly at equal distances, the same great 
succession of rock formations. What distinguishes the situation of 
the old red sandstone in this parish from its corresponding situation 
on the other side of the high land alluded to, is, that there it rests, 
as we would expect, immediately on greywacke, while in this pa- 
rish it rests upon trap. Whether this great mass of conglomerate 
has been deposited subsequently or antecedently to the formation 
of the trap, is a question which we leave to be settled by geolo- 
gists ; although we cannot help saying that the appearances ob- 
servable incline us to the former supposition. This conglomerate 
forms an excellent building stone in situations where it is exposed 
to the action of sea water, for which purpose it has been exten- 
sively employed in the construction of the breakwater, quays, &amp;c. 
of the harbour of Eyemouth. It can be quarried in masses of any 
size. 

Zoology. — So far as we have been able to learn, there are no 
animals cither rare or peculiar to the parish. The otter is fre- 
quently met with in the Eye, and the seal is occasionally seen in 
the Bay of Eyemouth. Porpoises also are numerous off the coast 
in the summer season. In 1817, a whale of a very large size was 
observed floating a little way off this coast, and towed into the bny.

In the department of ornithology there is no great variety. The 
kingsfisher and dipper are occasionally seen flying about the Eye. 
The golden-crested wren is also frequently met with. The star- 
ling, fieldfare, and missel -thrush occasionally halt for a week or two 
in large flocks. The Bohemian chatterer is also occasionally seen 
in the plantations about Netherbyres. The sandpiper breeds on 
the margins of the streams. The woodcock, the common snipe, 
and the jack-snipe, are common. The water-hen abounds in the 
Eye. Herons are observed in great numbers preying upon the 
smaller fish both in the Eye and on the sea-coast. The creeper, 
great titmouse or ox-eye, cole-mouse, long-tailed titmouse, &amp;c. are 
common. Linnets and finches of various kinds are also common ; 
the bullfinch being not infrequent. A few months ago several 
swans made their appearance in the bay of Eyemouth, one of which 
was shot. Owing to the neighbourhood of St Abb's Head, well 
known as a great breeding station of sea fowl, a great number of 
aquatic birds frequent our coast ; of these the principal are cormo- 
rants, auks, gulls, many of the ducks, several of the divers, and 
one or two species of grebes. The solan goose is an occasional vi- 
sitant. The guillemot and tern are abundant; and occasionally, 
in particular states of the weather, the stormy petrel is observed at 
no great distance from the shore. The more common birds of the 
game kind are partridges and pheasants, the latter having increased 
considerably within the last few years. The principal fishes of the 
coast are haddock, cod, ling, turbot, halibut, skate, &amp;c. 

Botany. — Owing to the small extent of the parish, a great va- 
riety cannot be expected in the department of botany. On the 
sea shore, however, we meet with several interesting plants, while 
the woods about Netherbyres, and the banks of the Eye and Ale, 
contribute their numbers. In the former station we may mention, 
among, others more commonly met with, Ligusticum Scoticum lo- 
vage, Thalictrum mimes, Silene viaritima, Veronica scutellata, Tri- 
glocliin maritimum, EupatoriumcaJinabinum, Cynoglossuvi officinale, 
Glaucium luteum, Cakile maritima, Arenaria marina, and, in exca- 
vated sea rocks, the Asplenium marinum, a very pretty fern. On 
the sea banks at Gunsgreen, the beautiful Scilla verna occurs in 
considerable abundance. The station is not exactly within the pa- 
rish, but is so very near its bounds that it cannot be omitted. The 
discovery of this interesting plant is due to the Rev. A. Baird, 
minister of Cockburnspath. The station now mentioned is the 



EYEMOUTH. 



323 



only one as yet ascertained for it on the east coast of Scotland. 
On the authority of the same gentleman, we may mention the fol- 
lowing plants as occurring on the banks of the Eye, and in other 
situations in the parish, viz. : Thalictrum flavum, Epipactis nidus 
avis, Arum, maculatum., Rumex sanguineus, Listera ovata, Thalic- 
trum majus, Tulipa sylvestris. Geranium lucidum, Sium angustifo- 
lium, Lamium amplexicaule, L. incisum, Sedum Telephium, Daphne 
Laureola, Dipsacus sglvestris, Chara hispida, Cichorium Intyhus, 
Sagina apetala. Astragalus hypoglottis, Alium ursinum, A. vineale, 
Fedia olitoria, Samolus Valerandi, Cardamine amara, &amp;c. &amp;c. Of 
these plants, the most interesting are the Thalictrum majus, the 
T.fiavum., for which only two other stations have been ascertained 
in Scotland, Rumex sanguineus, a plant of rare occurrence, and 
the Epipactis nidus avis, not frequently met with. The Tulipa 
sylvestris to all appearance is decidedly wild ; but, as its station is 
only a little way from Netherbyres, it may perhaps prove to be an 
outcast of the garden at some former period. With the mention 
of two other plants we shall conclude this imperfect sketch of the 
botany of the parish ; the one is the Primula veris, the umbellate 
variety, which is frequently confounded with the Primida elatior 
or ox-lip ; it occurs both on the sea banks and on the Eye in to- 
lerable abundance ; it is the Primula elatior of Greville's Flora 
Edinensis, the true Primula elatior having, so far as we are aware, 
no station in Scotland. The other plant is a variety of Geum, in- 
termediate between the Geum rivale and the G. urhanum. It is 
noticed by Professor Hooker as occurring in the neighbourhood of 
Glasgow, and is supposed to be a hybrid between the two species 
already mentioned. It grows on the hedge sides between Eye- 
mouth village and Eyemouth mill. 

II. — Civil History. 
No ancient or modern accounts of the history of this parish are 
known to us. The chartularies of Coldingham priory are the chief 
sources from which our knowledge of the early history of this and 
the neighbouring parish of Ayton is to be derived, as there can be 
no doubt that both of them were dependencies upon that ancient 
Establishment. As a sea-port, Eyemouth would naturally be re- 
sorted to by the monks in their passing to and from foreign parts; 
and there can be little doubt that the earliest commercial transac- 

• The earliest incntion made of Eyemouth in the records of Coldingham occurs 
in a Cliartcr issued during tlic reigu of William the Lion, iuid consequently between 
the years II 74 and 1214. Ky this, Edward, son of Teter de Lastailrig  Restalrig, 
Haron of tlie King of Scots, gave and granted to God, St Mary, St Ehl, Herbert, the 
prir, and the monks of CohliTigham, " duas loftos ad Eimuthe ct unum ;id I,eth ho- 
norificc, &amp;c, reddendo anuualem sibi ct heredibus iij. tcises de laceo scriceo,"

tions, in which its inhcabitants engaged, were the receiving and pas- 
sing to Coldingham those supphes which were required, either for 
the support of its numerous inmates, or for the performance of the 
rites of their pompous and imposing worship. One of these notices 
occurs so early as the fourteenth century, and shows that shipping 
even at that early period-, had resorted to the harbour to such an 
extent as to encourage, the demand of anchorage dues on the part 
of the lord of the manor. It is in these terms, " Magna Placi- 
tatio, in curia de Eyton, pro duodecim denariis male receptis, per 
J. Kinkborn, nomine sedis unius navis, apud Eymouth." — Ab. 
Chart. Coldingham, 22. 

Land-oioners. — From the earliest notices extant, it would seem 
that nearly the whole of the lands in this, as well as a large portion 
of those in the neighbouring parish, belonged at one time to the 
Homes of Fastcastle. The last baronet of that name had two 
daughters, one of whom was married to Logan of Restalrig, the 
other to Ogilvie of Dunlugas; and charters in both of these names 
are found recorded. Sir Lawrence Scott seems to have been the 
next proprietor of the lands of Eyemouth, whose only daughter, 
Euphemia, was married to Mr George Winram, son of a Colonel 
Winram. Upon Mr Winram's failure, the estate was purchased 
by Mr Trotter of Mortonhall, who shortly afterwards in 1764 
sold it to the late Patrick Home, Esq. and in that family it has re- 
mained ever since. The late Mr Ninian Home, the father of the 
above Patrick Home, purchased the Linthill estate, which, with 
the lands of Eyemouth, forms a very compact and valuable pro- 
perty, from a Mr Alexander Home. 

The present proprietor of the Eyemouth estate is W. F. 
Home, Esq. of Billie, who resides at Paxton House, in the pa- 
rish of Hutton. The other proprietors in the parish are, David 
Jlenton, Esq. of Highlaws ; John Fowler, Esq. of Hallydown ; Co- 
lonel Logan; Rev. John Edgar; the Friendly Society; Mr W. 
A. Gillie ; Captain Brown ; Mr J. Purves ; Mr A. Robertson ; 
Mr R. Turnbull; Mr W. Purves; Mrs Wightman and Miss Fore- 

 Tlie mansion-house of Linthill, which is pleasantly situated on the banks of the 
-Ale, near its junction with the Eye, was, after the death of Patrick Home, the scene 
pf a remarkable tragedy, his widow having been barbarously murdeixnl there by her 
Servant, Norman Ross, about the year 1752. He had concealed himself under her 
bed, whence he sallied forth upon her at dead of night. After a severe struggle, 
during which he inflicted several dreadful wounds upon her with a case knife, with 
which he was armed, she contrived to reach the bell-rope and alarm the family ; upon 
wliich he leaped from the window, and escaped. A few days afterwards, he was 
found by some reapers in the adjoining field, having broken his leg in the fall. He 
was tried before the High Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh, and condemned to be 
executed, and his body to be hung in chiiins.

man. Their hands, however, are but of Hmited extent, only two 
of them being proprietors to the amount of L. 50 per annum.  

Although not connected with the parish in any other way, it 
may not be uninteresting to mention, that the famous Duke of 
Marlborough was created Baron of Eyemouth by WiUiam III. ; 
but the title, being limited to heirs-male, is now extinct, f 

Parochial Registers.— parochial registers or sessional records 
exist in this parish dated previous to 1 709. In a minute of kirk- 
session, dated 26th April 1716, the following statement occurs: 
" Mr Johnston represented that the minuts of the session in his cus- 
todie, from the year 1713 to the year 1716, were taken away by the 
violence of the time." From 1730, the entries in the registers of 
marriages, and of births and baptisms, are regular. Dissenters, 
hewever, do not generally register the names of their children. 

Antiquities. — Under the head of antiquities, we have only to 
mention the remains of a fortification upon the bold promontory 
to the north of the town, thence, in common parlance, called the 
Fort. It occupies the whole of the elevated ground, which is of a 
triangular shape, the apex of the triangle pointing to the sea. 
It was first erected by the Duke of Somerset in his famous expe- 
dition against Scotland in 1547, X and was shortly after demo- 

• As illustrative of the dependence of this town on the fisheries in former times, 
as well as latterly, it may be mentioned, that before the division of the runrig lands, 
there were several portions which were termed Fishers' Lands. Some of these were 
possessed by individual fishermen, others were held by a particular tenure, being the 
common property of a boat's crew. 

f Notoriety of a very different kind belongs to Sprot, a lawyer, who, if not a na- 
tive of the parish, at least practised as a writer in Eyemouth for many years. He 
was the professional agent of Logan of Restalrig and Fastcastle ; and, shortly after 
the time of the Gowrie conspiracy, had let fall some hints which implied an acquain. 
tance with that mysterious affair. « These rumours, getting into circulation, reach- 
ed the Privy- Council, who ordered Sprot to be apprehended in the month of April 
1608. When examined before the Council, and by torture, he persisted for about two 
months in denying the fact, or in contradictory statements, to which no credit was 
given ; at last he confessed that Logan was concerned in the conspiracy with Gowrie, 
and that a correspondence had been carried on between them by means of Bar, a con- 
fidential servant of Logan's, who had inadvertently communicated the secret to him, 
and had shown him some of the letters from the conspirators, two of which he had pur- 
loined, one from Gowrie and another from Logan, which the Earl had returned after 
having read : Sprot was tried and convicted upon his own confession, and hanged 
the same day he was convicted. The judges appear to have doubted the truth of 
his tale, and seem to have hanged the unfortunate notary in a hurry, because they 
did not believe he was guilty, and were afraid of losing his evidence in support of a 
conspiracy for which the king's credit was pledged." — Aikman's History of Scotland, 
Vol. iii. page 262. 

J The Protector, on the second day after his arrival at Berwick, escorted by his 
own band of horsemen and a few more, rode to Eyemouth, where, having examined 
the inlet iy which tlie small river Eye discharges itself into tlie sea, he found it would 
le a commodious place for a harbour ; and, soon after, ordered a fortress, for defend- 
ing its entrance, to be built on a promontory ni its north side. Of this fortress, he 
appointed Tlioinas Gowcr, marshal of Berwick, to be governor. — Kcdpath's Border 
History, page 560.

li&amp;'hed in terms of a treaty concluded at Boulogne between France 
and England, 24th March 1550. A few years after, Regent 
Mary, wishing to involve Scotland in the war then raging be- 
tween France and England, ordered D'Oysel, her general, to re- 
build these fortifications; who, though much harassed by the 
garrison of Berwick, succeeded in again putting the place into 
a state of defence. At the subsequent peace, however, it was a 
second time demolished; and the next reign, which witnessed 
the union of the two kingdoms, deprived it of its importance as 
a border fortress, and prevented all attempts at its re-erection. 
From the circumstances just mentioned, the remains of the walls 
are very scanty : the outline of the fortifications, however, as indi- 
cated by the large grass-covered mounds, is everywhere observ- 
able, and shows it to have been a place of some strength. Be- 
ing considerably elevated above the town, and commanding a good 
sea view, the Fort is a favourite walk of the inhabitants, and is 
much frequented by the youth of the parish when engaged in their 
various sports. 

Modein Buildings. — There are no buildings worthy of particu- 
lar notice in the parish, the old Manor House of Linthill only ex- 
cepted. It is a good specimen of that kind of architecture so hap- 
pily described by the author of Discipline and Self- Control, as 
characterizing the residences of the minor Scottish lairds, and, 
with its steep roofs and peaked and crowstepped gables, forms not 
an unpleasant feature in the landscape. The view from it is 
pleasing, embracing Captain Brown's villa of Netherbyres and its 
surrounding woods, Gunsgreen House, and the shipping in the 
harbour of Eyemouth, with the sea in the distance. In the town 
of Eyemouth are many good dwelling-houses, but none entitled 
to particular attention. In Chambers' Picture of Scotland, it is 
observed, " that at one time all the people, high and low, young 
and old, rich and poor, were more or less engaged in smuggling, 
and no house was built without a view to accommodations for con- 
traband goods. The whole town has still a dark cunning look, is 
full of curious alleys, blind and otherwise, and there is not a single 
individual house of any standing but what seems as if it could un- 
fold its tales of wonder." There is no doubt that, during the 
greater part of last century, the contraband trade was pursued to 

 In the immediate neighbourhood of the Fort, tlierc is a field called the Bare- 
foots, said to have been the scene of a battle in wliicli the Scots, having been surpris- 
ed in their beds, and not having time to put on their shoes, fought with bai"e feet 
and yet gained a decisive victory.

a considerable extent by the inhabitants of Eyemouth ; but it is 
proper to add, ihat that illegal and, generally speaking, unsuccess- 
ful traffic has, for many years past, been entirely relinquished by 
them: and that their wealth, if less than in former times, has at 
least been acquired in a more regular and creditable manner.

The average number of childi-en in each family is about four. 

From the preceding statement, it will be seen that the popu- 
lation of this parish, for a number of years past, has been steadily 
on the increase. If any specific cause be required for the small 
amount of that increase within the last twelve or fifteen years, the 
only one which can be assigned is, that within that period, a large 
portion of the lands in the neighbourhood of the town, which was 
formerly let as one farm, has been divided into ten or twelve small 
possessions, and that the number of individuals, partly employed in 
agriculture, has, by that means, been increased to a trifling extent. 

The number of illegitimate births in the parish during the last 
three years was two. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The parish of Eyemouth 
contains about 850 statute acres, and is all in a, state of cultivation, 
with the exception of about 10 or 12 acres of banks. One-half 
is managed after what is called the four, and the other half after the 
six-break system of husbandry.

Rent of Land, The avci-agc rent of arable land in the iarish 
is L. 3, 10s. The duration of the leases is in some cases twelve, 
and in others nineteen years, the principal farm being let on a lease 
of twenty-one years. The lands are all in the highest state of cul- 
tivation, and, as may be inferred from the rent named, they are of 
the first quality. The sheep and cattle kept are commonly of 
the Leicester and short-horned or Teeswater breed. They are 
generally bought in to be fed on grass or turnips, very few being 
bred in the parish. 

Rate of Labour. — The rate of labour is for men during summer, 
Is. 8d. per day ; and for women, Is. ; and during winter for men, 
Is. 6d. ; and for women, lOd. Joiners and masons are paid from 
3s. to 3s. 6d. a-day in summer, and 2s. 6d. a-day in winter. 

Produce. — The gross annual value of produce, on an average of 
the last five years, may be stated as follows : viz.

Fisheries. — It is exceedingly difficult to state the annual value 
of the fisheries in the parish, as it is necessarily very fluctuating. 
The cod and haddock fishery is prosecuted by nine boats, each of 
which is manned by six men ; the yearly produce of whose labour, 
in this department, may be stated at L. 1890. The herring fishery 
has also at various periods been very productive ; from 1809 to 
1820, not less than 10,000 barrels being brought into Eyemouth 
yearly.  Upon these occasions, from 100 to 150 boats a.ssembled 
at Eyemouth, and few sights more gratifying could be witnessed, 
than that of the little fleet setting sail on a fine summer even- 
ing, to take up their stations on the fishing ground, or returning at 
break of day, loaded with the treasures of the deep. Since 1820 

 During these years, tlie jirices of fresh herrings ranged between 10s. anl 15s. 
per barrel : cured herrings brought from L. 1, 5s. to L. 1, 12s., according to quality. 



EYEMOUTH. 



329 



this Hshing has been oa the decline ; and, for some years past, even 
the boats belonging to Eyemouth have not remained on this coast, 
but proceeded to Sunderland, Wick, &amp;c. to prosecute the fishing. 
By this change much injury has been done to the trade of the port 
of Eyemouth ; many valuable properties erected for the purpose of 
curing herrings have been rendered for a season altogether use- 
less ; and much lucrative employment has been lost to the poor of 
the town and neighbourhood. By the introduction of barilla at a 
low duty, the manufacture of kelp, which formerly afforded em- 
ployment to a number of our poor people, has been also destroyed. 

Newcastle, Hull, and London, are the ports generally resorted 
to for the sale of smoked or red herrings ; white herrings are com- 
monly sent to Ireland, the Baltic, or the West Indies. The pro- 
duce of the cod fishery is exported to London either in a dried or 
pickled state. 

Navigation. — The following is a statement of the trade and 
shipping of Eyemouth for the last two years. 

Vessels of all descriptions which arrived and sailed in 1833, 
201 ; in 1834, 198. Vessels with cargoes coast-wise in 1833, 
arrived 84, sailed 74; ditto in 1834, arrived 100, sailed 69 ; ditto 
from foreign ports, 1833, arrived 9, sailed 0; ditto in 1834, arrived 
11, sailed 0. 

The cargoes from foreign ports consist of timber, bones and 
rags ; those inwards coastwise, chiefly of coals, slates, bricks, and 
tiles, free and paving stones, and merchant goods. 

The quantity of coals imported in 1833, was 1935 tons 16 cwts. 
in 1834, 2367 tons 14 cwts. 

The cargoes outwards coastwise consist principally - of .grain, 

meal, flour, malt, and British spirits. 

Wheat exported in 1833, 2440 qrs. 3 bushels; in 1834, 859 qrs. 1 bushel,

In the former Statistical Account it is stated, " this port is a 
branch of the custom-house of Dunbar, and our merchants are 
obliged to go there, which is a distance of twenty miles, to report 
every cargo, and to get sufferances to load or unload, and there- 
after to go back again for cockets and clearances, which is attend-

ed with much dangerous delay, and no small expense." Tin's 
grievance is now remedied, the principal officer of the customs 
here being impowered to enter and clear all vessels, except those 
to and from foreign ports. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns Sfc. — Eyemouth, the only town 'in the parish, 
and, it may be added, the only sea-port in the county of Berwick, 
is also the market-town of the surrounding district. As may be 
seen by referring to the former Statistical Account, grain to a consi- 
derable extent has, for many years past, been shipped here, — but 
the trade in corn, like that in herrings, having seriously declined, 
it was proposed by several persons interested in the prosperity of 
the place, to establish a weekly stock-market for that article. At 
a meeting of farmers and dea:lers in grain, convened here in the 
beginning of January 1832, it was resolved that the market should 
be held weekly on Thursday ; and it is no slight proof of the pro- 
priety of this resolution, and of the benefit conferred by the mar- 
ket, both on Eyemouth, and on the surrounding district, that, dur- 
ing the first twelve months of its existence, grain to the value of 
L. 20,000 was sold in it. Considerable facihties were aff"orded for 
its establishment by the fact, that Eyemouth possessed an excel- 
lent harbour, and that the port charges were exceedingly moderate. 

The revival of the corn trade has led to the erection of spacious 
granaries upon the quay within these two years, and a large build- 
ing at the north end of the town, which was used during the late 
war as a barrack for soldiers, and near which a battery was erect- 
ed for the protection of the town and harbour, has also been em- 
ployed of late for the storing of grain. To the same cause we are 
also indebted for the recent establishment of a branch of the Com- 
mercial Bank. 

When not engaged in the cultivation of their lands, the smaller 
tenants, who all reside in the Town of Eyemouth, are generally em- 
ployed in supplying the Edinburgh and Glasgow markets' with 
fish ; and in winter, when -tempted by the prospect of high prices, 
instances are not unfrequent of their finding their way even to 
Dumfries and Carlisle. As the Coldingham and Burnmouth 
boats generally rendezvous at Eyemouth, these land carriers are 
unable to transport the whole produce of the fishery to market; 
a considerable part of it is, in consequence, sent by sea to New-

Harbour. — « The harbour of Eyemouth," says the celebrated 



EYEMOUTH. 



331 



Smeuton, " lies at the corner of a bay, in which ships can work in 
and out at all times of the tide, or lie at an anchor secure from all winds, 
except the northerly or north-easterly. From this circumstance, 
its situation is very advantageous." At his recommendation, and 
agreeably to a plan furnished by him, a break-water pier was erect- 
ed in 1770, by which the harbour is defended from the north-east 
gales, to which it was previously exposed; and since that time, by 
the clearing away of rocks, removing of shingle, erecting of wharf 
walls, &amp;c. the depth of water has been much increased, and the 
accommodation for shipping considerably enlarged. The flow of 
tide is nearly the same as at the other harbours on the coast, ave- 
raging 10 feet at neap tides, and 16 feet at spring tides. Be- 
ing situated at the entrance of the Firth of Forth, and easily 
accessible, it is much frequented by vessels prevented by contrary 
winds from prosecuting their voyages to the several parts within its 
limits, as also to those in the north of Scotland ; and there can be 
no doubt that every improvement effected upon it will increase the 
resort of such vessels, and thus afford additional accommodation to 
the trade of the country, and give increased security both to pro- 
perty and life. It is under the management of a board of trustees 
appointed by act of Parhament. 

Water was brought into Eyemouth some years ago, by means 
of iron pipes ; and the streets, which at that time were by no 
means in good repair, have all been recently re-paved. 

Thrashing-Machines, &amp;c. — There are two thrashing-machines 
driven by water in the parish, and in the same building that con- 
tains one of them there is also machinery for sawing timber from 
the log, grinding bark, &amp;:c. There is a mill upon the river Eye, 
which is generally employed in manufacturing pearl barley, oat- 
meal, &amp;c. for the London market. At Millbank, just loithout the 
limits of the parish, there is a paper-mill, at which a number of our 
labouring-people find employment, and for which the supplies of 
coals, rags, &amp;c. are imported here ; and Gunsgreen distillery, at 
which business to a very considerable amount is done annually, 
may also claim a notice from us, as it immediately adjoins the har- 
bour of Eyemouth ; and, both as to imports and exports, it is close- 
ly connected with this place. 

Means of Communication. — Eyemouth enjoys the advantage of 
a daily post, the office here being a sub-office to that at Ay ton two 
miles and a-half distant through which the great London road 
passes. A runner is employed, who conveys the letters both to

BERWICKSniKK. 



this Town and to Coldingliam. The hour of departure is 8 a. m,, 
of arrival 2 p. m. In no part of the country have roads been more 
improved than in the county of Berwick, during the last twenty 
years, and Eyemouth has received its share of the advantage con- 
nected with these improvements; access from this to all parts of 
the country being now rendered both easy and safe. About four 
miles of road lie within the parish ; two miles and three quarters 
of which are parochial, and the remainder turnpike road. At Eye- 
mouth Bridge the turnpike road divides into two branches, one of 
which connects this parish with Ayton, Dunse, &amp;c. by the north 
bank of the Eye, and the other by the south; both are maintained in 
good order, and the bridges, which respectively cross the Eye and 
the Ale, are substantial and in good condition. It may be added, 
that Captain Brown has very lately thrown a chain bridge across 
the Eye to afford an access to his property of Netherbyres. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church stands in the middle 
of the Town, and, though distant a mile and a-half from the extre- 
mities of the parish, yet, as so small a part of the population, only 
75, resides in . the country, it must be said to be conveniently situa- 
ted. It was built in 1812, and affords accommodation for about 
450 sitters. We cannot say much of the taste which its external 
appearance indicates ; but we may add, that it is one of the most 
comfortable places of worship in this part of the country. It was 
built at the expense of the heritors and feuars of the parish, and 
the sittings were allotted among them; but a large proportion, say 
150 sittings, belonging to the principal proprietor, and which were 
not required for the accommodation of his tenants, are left quite 
free to the poorer part of the population. The ordinance of the 
Lord's supper is dispensed here twice a-year, and is attended by 
from 300 to 320 communicants. Public worship is in general 
respectably attended, yet it must be added, that here, as in other 
places similarly situated, there are not a few " who forsake the as- 
sembling of themselves together." 

The number of families attending the Established church may 
be stated at 250 ; those attending the chapels of Dissenters and 
Seceders at 30. These go to Coldingham and Ayton, at which 
villages there are meeting-houses connected with the Associate 
Synod. There is a Baptist chapel in the town, which is not attend- 
ed by more than four or five members. 

Collections are made in church occasionally for charitable and re- 
'  A new school and schoolmaster's house were also hiiilt in 1S"21.

Hgious purposes, the average amount of which may be stated at L. 5 
per annum. 

The victual stipend of the parish of Eyemouth is 80 1 imperial 
bolls of barley, the boll being | of an imperial quarter, 54 
bolls of oats, and 18 of pease which, according to the average 
of the last five years, amounts to about L.150. There is no al- 
lowance for communion elements. The teinds are exhausted. 
The fishing boats belonging to Eyemouth pay each L. 1, 13s. 4d. 
annually to the clergyman, and strangers are liable to pay half 
teind, or a twentieth part of the produce of their fishing. This 
may be collected to the extent of a thirtieth or less, and, in seasons 
when the herring fishery was in a prosperous state, added consider- 
ably to the value of the living. 

The manse is old and in bad repair, but is not inhabited by the 
present incumbent, who in lieu of it has an allowance of L. 30 per 
annum from the heritors. It ought to be mentioned, however, 
that the heritors are perfectly wilhng to build a new manse when 
required. 

The glebe extends to ten acres or thereby, and may be valued 
at L. 30 per annum. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish is seven ; 
three of which are taught by men, and four by women. The 
parish schoolmaster has the maximum salary, and the legal ac- 
commodation. One of the private schools is maintained by indi- 
vidual subscriptions, and the other by school fees. In the parish 
school Greek, Latin, English, &amp;c. are taught. The fee for En- 
ghsh reading is 2s. 6d. per quarter, for writing, 3s. 6d. for arith- 

• Eyemouth does not seem to have ranked as a separate parish till the period of 
the Reformation ; previous to that era it was a chapelry dependent on the priory of 
Coldingham ; and this fact, taken in connection with its very limited extent, may ac- 
count for the very slight notices of it which are contained in the chartularies of that 
ancient establishment. Mr Alexander A. Carr, surgeon, Ayton, who is about to 
publish a work on the Antiquities of Coldingharashire, has favoured me with the fol- 
lowing notice concerning the ecclesiastical state of this parish in former times — " In 
1295, Gilbert, the priest presbyter of Iimuth, subscribed a charter granted by Wil- 
liam, Bishop of St Andrews, to the monks of Durham, &amp;c ; and from that time 
down to the Reformation, the names of its chaplains are occasionally met with in the 
churtularies. During the fourteenth century, one of these rose to be Sacrist of Col- 
dingliam priory, an office next in rank to that of prior." 

Tlie following notice, also furnished by him, may not inappropriately find a place 
here " A rental of Coldingham, made up in 1501, which is preserved in the Advo- 
cates' Library at Edinburgh, gives us a summary of the various ecclesiastical dues 
paid to it by the neighbouring parishes. From this it appears that the town of Eye- 
mouth paid yearly, conjointly with a piece of land called Ulackman's or Blackmain's 
acre, 42 shillings, .3 ennies, and 74 heads of ijoultry. The lands of Ueanrig, lield 
in feu-farm by Sir Alexander Home of Mandcrstone, paid yearly 48 shillings and 
4 pennies, with 7 fowls. The mill of Eyemouth, held by William Home of I'ren- 
dergucst, contributed L. G. Somehow or otber the lands of Linthill are not nUed in 
the rental, unless they are taken conjointly with those of Ilighlaws which paid 43 
shillings and 4 pennies."

metic, including practical mathematics, navigation, and other 
branches, 5s. for Latin, French, &amp;c. 7s. 6d., and for Greek, 10s. 6d. : 
when English grammar is added to any of the preceding, 6d. ex- 
tra is charged quarterly. The amount of fees received by the 
teacher of the parish school varies from L. 25 to L. 30 a-year. 
In one of the private schools the same branches of education are 
taught as in the parish school, and the fees, it is believed, are some- 
what similar to those mentioned ; in the- other, English reading, 
writing, and arithmetic only are taught. In the female schools, 
sewing, reading, &amp;c. are taught. Not above two or three indivi- 
duals are known to the writer who are not able to read, and these 
are persons somewhat advanced in life. Among the young such a 
thing can now scarcely happen ; as, independently of the moderate 
sum charged for instruction, the heritors, for many years past, have 
been in the habit of paying the fees of those who, from poverty or 
other causes, are thought entitled to that accommodation. A re- 
ligious society in the town also expends its funds in the education 
of the children of poor fishermen. In general, it may be stated 
that the people are anxious to obtain education for their children, 
and that the facihties for that purpose now enjoyed have had their 
usual effects in the improvement of the manners and general good 
conduct of the parishioners. Two Sabbath schools are also taught 
in the town ; one in the church by the minister, parochial school- 
master, and other assistants; the other by one of the private 
teachers. 

At the examinations in March last, the number of scholars at- 
tending all the schools in the parish was 191. 

Literature. — A parochial library, consisting chiefly of books of 
divinity, history, biography, &amp;c. was established by general sub- 
scription in the year 1821. The funds were increased by a very 
handsome donation of L. 10 from George Buchan, Esq. of Kelloe, 
and since that period a collection has been made in church at least 
once a-year for its benefit. From these causes it is now in a 
prosperous condition. The yearly subscription is two shillings. 

Charitable Institutions. — A Friendly Society was established in 
this parish in the year 1759 ; and, with varying prosperity, it has 
existed ever since. Like many institutions of the same nature, 
being founded on erroneous principles, it was, a few years ago, 
brought to the brink of ruin. At that period, however, the an- 
nual subscriptions of its members were increased, and the allow- 
ances to sick were diminished, in accordance with the tables pub- 
lished by the Highland Society; and it is now oncelnore in a safe 



EYEMOUTH. 



335 



and prosperous condition. It has an income of L. 36 a-year from 
land situated within the parish, and of course ranks as an heritor. 
Such an institution must have a tendency to promote industry and 
to excite a desire for independence; yet the extreme readiness some- 
times manifested, even in the case of trifling ailments, to take ad- 
vantage of its provisions, shows that those feelings of independence 
are not so strong as they ought to be. The allowance given at 
the death of a member is L. 6, and to the poor widow and her 
destitute family it is a most seasonable and grateful relief. Per- 
haps the existence of such an institution in the parish may go far 
to account for the fact, that a savings bank, though twice tried 
here, has never succeeded. I'he nearest bank of that description 
is one established at Dunse. 

Poor and Parochial Fund. — The number of stated paupers on 
the roll last year was 35 ; and the sum raised by legal assessment 
for their support was L. 199, 16s. lOd. The landward part of 
parish, which alone is rated, being small, this forms a heavy bur- 
den on the heritors and their tenants, and the experience of the 
last few years sufficiently shows that it is a burden progressively 
increasing. Assessments have produced their usual effects here 
in weakening the feeling of honest independence, which formerly 
so much characterized the people of Scotland ; and, so far from 
there being now any aversion to apply for parochial relief, there is 
rather a disposition to demand it as a right. 

The average of church collections may be stated to amount to 
L. 26 annually. These are distributed among the industrious poor 
by the minister and session, without any interference on the part 
of the heritors. 

Fairs. — Two fairs are held annually in the parish, at which, 
however, no business is transacted. 

Inns. — In the former Statistical Account, it is observed, " there 
are very few law pleas or disputes in this parish, because we have 
only one writer. There is one good inn, and too many alehouses." 
With the latter part of the quotation the writer most cordially 
agrees. We have no fewer than 14 alehouses ; and, as two or 
three would be amply sufficient for all the business transacted in 
the town, it may easily be supposed that the effect of such a num- 
ber upon the morals of the people must be most pernicious. 

Fuel. — Fuel is abundant and cheap in this parish, being pro- 
cured by land carriage from Berwick at an average price of 9s. 
per ton ; and from the Firth of Forth and Newcastle at average 
rates of 10s. and 12s. respectively.

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the former Statistical Account was written, the rental of 
this parish has been more than doubled, the natural consequence of 
the improved management of the lands, and of the high prices ob- 
tained for all kinds of agricultural produce during the late war. 
Should prices, however, remain long at their present level, the 
rental must again decline, as the returns at present received by 
the farmer are far from being remunerating. During the last thirty 
years, the condition of the labouring part of our population has 
also been much improved. They are better fed and better dres- 
sed than formerly ; and it is believed that, in respect of cleanh- 
ness, they may justly claim their full share in the improvement, in 
this respect, which is acknowledged to have taken place among 
the peasantry of Scotland. To no part of our population do these 
remarks apply with more accuracy than to our fishermen and their 
families. In every community the idle and the dissipated will be 
found ; and the uncertainties of a sea-faring life seem unfortu- 
nately, in many instances, to give increased force to evil habits ; 
yet, generally speaking, it may with safety be asserted, that they 
are a sober, industrious, and well-behaved set of men. They go 
to sea in boats of not less than nine tons register, worth L. 80, in- 
cluding tackling and nets, which are their own property; and, in 
place of creeping along the coast, as their fathers were accustom- 
ed to do, they launch boldly out into the deep, proceeding some- 
times to a distance of twenty miles from shore, and bring in 
large cargoes of fish of the best quality, to supply the markets of 
the country. Formerly, very few of them were in the habit of at- 
tending public worship : the greater part of them now attend it with 
tolerable regularity; and the young amongst them present them- 
selves as candidates for admission to the Lord's table in nearly the 
same proportion, to their entire number, as is found to exist among 
the other classes of the community. 

Our streets are better paved and better kept than formerly ; 
yet further improvement is still needed, and were the inhabitants 
to avail themselves of the provisions of an act of Parliament lately 
passed, to enable small towns like Eyemouth to maintain an effective 
police, &amp;c. that improvement, it is believed, might be effected. 
It has been mentioned, that the roads leading from this placa to 
all parts of the country arc good. A bridge over the Whitaddor, 
somewhere between Chirnside and Hutton, would tend much to 
improve our access to Tweedside, and to insure the prosperity of 
the corn market lately established here.

THE REV. GEORGE FULTON KNIGHT, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Boundaries, Extent, ct.— This parish is situated in the south- 
east corner of the county of Berwick. It is bounded on the north 
by the parish of Ayton ; on the east, by the German Ocean, and 
the hbcrties of the town of Berwick on Tweed; on the south, by 
the river Whitadder ; and on the west, by the parishes of Hutton 
and Foulden, Its form is irregular, somewhat resembhng a sand- 
glass, or the letter g, — on the narrow part of which stand the church 
and manse ; the parish is there only the breadth of the glebe. Its 
length from north to south is between 3 and 4 miles; its great- 
est breadth, which is towards the northern extremity, is above 
2 miles. Its original extent was very small, consisting only of 
the barony of Mordington and the estate of Edrington, till the year 
1650, when the lands of Lamberton of much greater extent than 
the whole of what, before that period, constituted the parish were 
disjoined from the parish of Ayton, and annexed to Mordington. 
In the year 1666, Mordington was disjoined from part of what is 
now the parish of Longformacus, — when the latter, together with 
other lands from surrounding parishes, was erected into a new 
parish. 

Topographical Appearances. — The north part of the parish con- 
sists of high ground, containing many commanding eminences, — from 
which is obtained an extensive and splendid prospect of the Merse 
.of Berwickshire, and the wooded and picturesque banks of the 
Tweed, Whitadder, and Blackadder, together with a considerable 
part of the county of Northumberland, — while the view is terminated 
on the south by the bold and lofty range of Cheviot; and on the 
west, by Ruberslaw, the Eildons, and the Lammermuirs. Toward 
the east, this highest part of the parish commands a view of the Ger- 
man Ocean, Holy Island, Bamborough Castle, &amp;c. At the extreme 
north-west of this high ground, there are the remains of a camp 

BERWICK. V

most distinctly and broadly marked, which, from its circular form, 
seems to be Danish. The hill on which it stands is called Hab 
or Habchester. The remains of this camp consist of two tren- 
ches, 18 or 20 feet high, which seem to have been faced with 
stones. Half of the circle remains entire, which half is in Mor- 
dington parish, and in which it would seem no change has taken 
place since its construction. The form of the other half, lying 
in the parish of Ayton, is scarcely discernible, having been plough- 
ed down. No station could have been better selected for observ- 
ing the movements of an enemy, and for keeping up a commu- 
nication with the German Ocean, which is not more than a mile 
distant from it. Another eminence, about a mile south-east of 
Habchester, is the spot where the last person burned for witchcraft 
is alleged to have undergone that fate, — so late as the beginning 
of the seventeenth century. It is still called the Witch's Knov:e. 

The ground falls by a gentle and gradual descent from this place 
towards the south, for more than half the length of the parish, till it 
reaches the river Whitadder, its southern boundary. On the east, 
it descends towards the sea. The coast of the parish exhibits a 
continued unbroken line of abrupt rocks, which contain some ca- 
verns that were much used by smugglers in foreign spirits, before 
the erection of a Preventive station at Burnmouth. Detached mas- 
ses of rock of considerable size stand out into the sea in one or two 
places, and some of them present an aspect of grandeur and subli- 
mity. The romantic and sequestered fishing village of Ross, at 
the northern extremity of the parish, is too much an object of in- 
terest to the admirers of picturesque scenery not to be noticed. It 
stands at the foot of a ledge of almost perpendicular rocks di\ided 
by a rivulet, which, in rainy seasons, forms many beautiful cas- 
cades, — while the sea foam beneath, and the cottages standing 
almost close upon high water mark, give the scene a very striking 
appearance. 

Climate. — The climate of this parish is generally salubrious. 
The prevailing winds are west and south, which are frequently vio- 
lent. The east winds on the coast are cold ; but the inhabitants 
are generally healthy and robust. Among the labouring classes, 
rheumatism is the most common complaint : there are no distem- 
pers, however, peculiar to the district. 

Hydrograjhy — The Whitadder is the only river in the parish, 
and forms its southern boundary ; its many windings and precipi-

tons banks, clad with wood and moss-covered rocks, possess great 
beauty. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There are two divisions of rocks in 
the parish, the upper and the under. The upper consists of a 
large mass of unstratified rocks, the principal of which are por- 
phyry and trap. The lower consists of stratified rocks, which appear 
along the sea coast on the north-east, and also on the banks of the 
Whitadder on the south. Although there has been considerable 
dispute of late years among geologists about what these last are, 
it is now generally agreed that they are the lower members of the 
coal formation, or the carboniferous series. The strata, as seen 
in the ravines and river sides of the lower parts of the parish, 
consist of numerous alternating beds or strata of shale, sandstone, 
and indurated marl. The general direction of these strata seems 
to be from west to east, the dip generally at a considerable angle, 
but so various, that it is impossible to state the general angle. 
Beyond the boundaries of the parish to the south, these rocks are 
succeeded by the coal field of Northumberland. 

As a circumstance tending to confirm the conclusion, that the 
lower division of the parish belongs to the old coal formation, and 
not to the new red sandstone, as has been supposed by several 
geologists, we may mention the fact, that coal does make its ap- 
pearance at several places near the sea coast of the parish, — that 
various attempts have been made to work it, — and that, from its 
importance, the present proprietor has lately made several inves- 
tigations with the view of working it. 

Some old pits and mines have been cleared, which are believed 
to have been wrought half a century ago, and by which two work- 
able seams of coal have been discovered, an upper and an under ; 
the former 13 inches thick, and of good quality; the latter 
26. It is stated by fishermen, that a third much lower and 
thicker is to be seen at very low tides. The proprietor has not 
yet completed his investigations, but, from the great depth of the 
coal, except when approached below the coast rocks, and near 
high water-mark, the working of it would seem likely to be attend- 
ed with some difficulty. Lime in considerable quantity has been 
found in the vicinity of the coal, but it is of an inferior quality. 

On this coast, a mile or two south-east of the village of Ross, 
the sandstone strata are nearly vertical, — which, indeed, we may 
nutiirally expect from their vicinity to the trap rocks. In other 



340 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



parts of the parish, it is impossible to perceive the junction of the 
trap and the sandstone, on account of the thick covering of soil. 

It may be mentioned, that in the strata of shale and indurated 
marl below Edrington House, a. iewver/etahle fossils have been found. 

Zoology. — There are no animals, wild or tame, peculiar to the 
parish. The rarer wild animals are, otters on the banks of the 
Whitadder, wild ducks on the high grounds, and herons. Foxes 
abound in the lower parts of the parish on the Edrington estate, 
and badgers are met with among the sea rocks. The common 
kinds of game, as hare, partridge, black-cock, dotterel, and wood- 
cock, are plentiful. These last are sometimes found in the early 
part of the season, weak and exhausted, probably by their long 
flight across the German Ocean. Brown and silver pheasants are 
occasionally found in the woods of Edrington. 

This coast has long been famed for white fish, every variety of 
which is to be found on it, and is sent chiefly to the Edinburgh 
market by sea. Cod, ling, and haddock are the most common 
kinds. Salmon are also found on the coast, and have been fished 
with bag-nets. There are no oysters nor muscles; but lobsters 
and crabs are plentiful ; the former are sold chiefly for the Lon - 
don market to smacks which pass the coast at stated intervals. 
The Whitadder contains trout and salmon, which ascend the river 
in spawning time. 

Botany. — For the more common plants in this as in the adjoin- 
ing parishes, the reader is referred to the " Flora of Berwick- 
on- Tweed," by Dr Johnston. The following habitats of some 
rarer plants additional to those given in the Flora may be men- 
tioned ; Fedia olitoria, found by Mr Carr, surgeon, Ayton, in 
the ravine above Ross : Parietaria officinalis, on the side of the 
old aisle of the former church, in front of Mordington House, by 
the same : Rosa ruhiginosa, on the sea banks half way between 
Ross and Lamberton Sheills, a single shrub, but perfectly wild, by 
Dr Johnston: Senecio temdfolius, in therlane between Edrington 
and Cocklaw.  

H. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — The church or chapel of Lamberton, which was 
either at one time a parish church, or, as seems more probable, a 
chapel of ease to Ayton, and an adjunct of the Abbey of Cold- 
ingham, is celebrated as having been the place where King

James IV. of Scotland, and Margaret, daughter of Henry VII. of 
England, were contracted in marriage in the year 1503,— which 
paved the way for the happy union, first of the two crowns, and af- 
terwards of the two kingdoms. This chapel has now nothing re- 
maining but part of the outer walls, and is used as the burymg- 
place o1" the family of Mr Renton of Lamberton. 

The old castle of Edrington, of which but a small part also has 
escaped the mutilating hand of time, is situated at the south of 
the parish, on the top of an almost perpendicular rock, which is 
clad with wood, and washed by the winding Whitadder below. Like 
many of the old forts in this neighbourhood, it was the scene of 
frequent contests in the border wars. Its possession was often in- 
cluded in treaties between the kings of England and Scotland. 
In the year 1534, it was restored by Henry VIII. to James V., 
from the latter of whom it had been taken in a former war,— Henry 
declaring that he made this restitution as a proof of his gratitude, 
benevolence, and friendship for the Scottish king. The posses- 
sion of this castle, and the lands connected with it, was thus con- 
firmed to the King of Scotland and his subjects, its former owners, 
free from molestation or injury on the part of the King of Eng- 
land, his vassals, or subjects, or the inhabitants of the town and 
castle of Berwick-on- Tweed ; and it probably continued in this 
situation till the union of the two kingdoms. From its command- 
ing situation, it seems to have been singularly well fitted for de- 
fence, especially from the south, and was likely to have been re- 
garded by the English as an important out-post when they were in 
possession of the town of Berwick. 

Eminent Men. — Under this head there is nothing to be men- 
tioned,— except that the Rev. Alexander Lauder, who wrote a work 
against Episcopacy, and lived in the beginning of last century, 
was minister of this parish. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population was only - 181 

In 1 792, it had increased to - 335 

By the census of 1821, it was - 302 

of 1831, - 301 

 It is worthy of notice, that below this castle, and close by the bank of the river, 
there is a flour-mill belonging to the proprietor of this part of the estate, the water- 
wheel of wliich not only drives the mill, but also a tlirasliing-machuie, situated up- 
wards of .500 feet above it, by means of a shaft iOO feet long, which runs through a 
tunnel in the rock above. 'I'his is an instance of the distance to which the powers 
of machinery may lie transferred by the application of very simple means. 

On tlie estate of Upper Edrington there is a secpiestered glen, which is said to 
have given rise to the old Scottish song of" Tibby I'owler o' the Glen."

This decrease in the population since 1792 is chiefly to be as- 
cribed to the union of small farms, and the consequent diminution 
in the number of farm-servants.

It may be noticed, as an instance of the longevity of fisher- 
men, that there is at present a boat's crew of four men belonging 
to the villages of Ross and Burnmouth, whose united ages amount 
to 301 years. Though no longer able for the rougher toils of their 
mode of life, they employ themselves in lobster-catching. 

Character of the People. — The inhabitants of this parish are in 
general frugal and industrious, orderly in their habits, and con- 
tented with their condition. They present an illustration of the 
high superiority of the purely agricultural districts over the manu- 
facturing, in regard to the general character of the population. 
No inhabitant of the parish has laeen convicted of a crime before 
a court of justice in the memory of man. 

As this parish lies on the border between Scotland and Eng- 
land, the illicit traffic of smuggling Scotch whisky into 'England 
is carried on to a considerable extent at two public-houses on the 
turnpike-roads to Berwick-on- Tweed. Those who engage, how- 
ever, in this unlawful employment, are persons of low character from 
Berwick, who buy the spirits at these two public-houses, and convey 
them secretly into England. A guard of excise officers, which is 
maintained by Government at considerable expense, traverses the 
roads, — by which means the traffic has lately somewhat decreased, 
but it is still carried on to a considerable extent; and its demo- 
ralizing influence on those engaged in it, is lamentably apparent. 
No remedy, however, seems likely to avail, but an equalizing of the 
duties on spirits in the two countries. 

IV. — Industry. 
This parish may be regarded as exclusively agricultural ; for, 
with the exception of the small fishing village of Ross, it is entire- 



MORDINGTON. 



343 



ly devoted to the occupation of husbandry. There are 40 males 
employed in agriculture, 6 in handicrafts, 14 are engaged in 
fisheries, and there are at present 4 superannuated labourers. 

Agriculture.— "The parish contains 2597 acres of cultivated land, _ 
26 acres in plantations, and 900 acres uncultivated ; these last 
are part of the lands of Lamberton, which, though generally spoken 
of as " muir land," consist to a very great extent of most profitable 
pasture ground ; and a considerable part of it was forty years ago 
under the plough. Since that period, this land has been in per- 
manent pasture, consisting of dry uplands. This forms about 
three-fourths of the whole of the land on the farm of Lamberton 
not at present cultivated. The remainder consists of boggy or 
marshy grounds, and about 100 acres of heath land ; which, from 
its rocky barren nature, seems to be the only soil in the parish 
which it would be impossible to cultivate to advantage. At pre- 
sent, owing to the extremely low price of grain, and from the 
uncultivated ground rearing such good and healthy stock, the price 
of which is unusually high, it is deemed unadvisable to plough any 
part of it; but, should a period arrive, when, from a change in 
the state of markets, it might be considered advantageous to im- 
prove this land, the whole might be again made arable at very 
little expense. 

It is supposed that 800 acres might, with a profitable applica- 
tion of capital, be added to the cultivated land of the parish. 

RerLt of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
is L. 1, 5s. per acre. Cows are grazed at L. 5 for the season. 

Wages of Labour. — Labourer's wages are the same as in all the 
neighbouring parishes, viz. 10s. in summer per week, and 9s. in win- 
ter ; artisans 2s. 6d. per day. The practice prevails here, as in neigh- 
bouring parishes, of having farm work performed by what is called 
bondage service. Farm-servants, called hinds, are paid, as in other 
parishes, partly in grain, and partly in money. Their general allow- 
ance is, of oats, 9 bolls, of six imperial bushels ; of barley 3 ditto of 
ditto ; pease 1, ditto of ditto ; an allowance of L. 4 Sterling, which 
among them is called sheep-money, in lieu of a small number of sheep 
they formerly were permitted to keep ; and a cow's g'rass, with ali- 
ment for the cow in winter. There is thus secured to themselves 
and their families a fixed supply of the necessary articles of sub- 
sistence, whatever may be the state of the market. This mode of 
paying farm-servants keeps them from ever being in want, while' 
they are able to work ; and deprives them, in a great measure, of 



344 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



the power of spending money imprudently. The very favourable 
effect of it, therefore, on the morals of the people is too important 
not to deserve special notice. 

Husbandry. — The situation of this parish is peculiarly favour- 
able to the purposes of agriculture, the lands in general consisting 
of a dry and manageable soil, which the skilful farmer can turn to 
great advantage ; and the climate being so favourable, that grain, 
even in the latest seasons, is commonly brought to maturity. There 
is a ready market for every kind of farm produce at the town of 
Berwick-on- Tweed, which is only four miles distant. There corn 
is sold by sample, and the utmost punctuahty observed by the corn- 
merchants, as to payment. To the recently established market 
at Eyemouth corn is also sent. Some part of this is disposed of to 
the millers in the neighbourhood, whose mills on the banks of the 
Whitadder one of which lies in this parish manufacture a consider- 
able quantity of meal, flour, barley, &amp;c. The wool-staplers from 
Yorkshire come here at particular seasons to purchase the wool ; 
while fat stock is sold to dealers from Morpeth, — to fleshers in 
Berwick, — and at a monthly market at Ayton. 

Berwick supplies the. agriculturist with manure, which is much 
used in turnip husbandry, though within these five or six years 
bone-dust has been greatly in request. Bones in considerable 
quantity are imported at Berwick from Prussia and other conti- 
nental countries, — are ground at mills in the neighbourhood, — and 
sold at from 18s. to 20s. per imperial quarter. This kind of ma- 
nure has greatly superseded the former, being suitable for the light 
soil of the parish ; and it is more easily, and at less expense, convey- 
ed to the higher grounds. Very considerable improvements in the 
cultivation of the soil have taken place during the last ten or 
twenty years. Draining has been and is carried on to a very 
considerable extent, so that the land has become greatly more pro- 
ductive. Every species ef white and green crops is raised, parti- 
cularly barley, oats, turnips, and artificial grasses. Wheat and 
beans are raised in smaller quantities than the other kinds of grain, 
because not so suitable to the light soil of the parish. The usual 
rotation of crops is, first oats, then turnips; after these, barley with 
grass-seeds, which makes hay the succeeding crop ; and the ground 
upon which it is raised is commonly allowed to remain for some 
years in grass for pasture, — after which it is again taken up and ma- 
naged according to the above rotation. There is always, however, 
a great proportion of the land in grass, and to this the tenants 



MORDINGTON. 



345 



are commonly bound down in tlieir leases, which extend to the 
term of nineteen years; and they are seldom permitted to have 
more than the half of their land in tillage. 

But the crop which ought especially to be noticed, on account 
of the improvements recently made in the mode of its cultivation, 
is the turnip crop. Turnip husbandry is conducted in this parish 
on an extensive scale. Turnips are highly valuable for feeding 
cattle during winter, either on neighbouring grass-fields into which 
they are carried, or by being used in houses or sheds. On the 
hght and dry soil, of which the greatest part of the parish consists, 
the feeding of sheep on the ground where turnips grow is consi- 
dered highly advantageous, and is the method universally adopted. 
The ruta baga, or Swedish turnip, whose hardy and durable qua- 
lity renders it so advantageous to the farmer after the early tur- 
nip has been used, is cultivated in the proportion of one-third to 
the white globe-turnip. The land on an average may yield 5 bolls 
of 6 bushels of wheat per acre ; 6 of barley ; and 7 of oats. 
Pease is a crop scarcely at all raised, except in the lower parts of 
the parish, where the land will yield from 6 to 8 bolls per acre ; 
and of hay no more is raised than is necessary to supply the horses, 
cattle, &amp;c. in the parish ; but on an average of seasons, the crop 
amounts to from 180 to 220 stones per acre. Potatoes are raised 
in small quantities for home consumption, and generally amount to 
from 25 to 30 bolls of 40 imperial stones, per acre. An acre of 
turnip will pasture ten sheep for six months. The ground is farm- 
ed under the four-shift husbandry. 

Produce. — The gross amount of the raw produce yearly raised in 
the parish may be as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, 3617 bolls at 24s. - - L. 4340 0 0 

Of turnips and potatoes, 283 acres, . - - - 1153 0 0 

Of hay, meadow and cultivated, 12000 stones at 7d. - - 350 0 0 

Of land in pasture, rating it at from 1. 3, lOs. to L. 4, 15s. per cow or 
full-grown ox, grazed, or that may be grazed, for the season ; and 
at Us. per ewe or full-grown sheep, pastured, or that may be pas- 
tured, for the year, . . . - . 1000 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, - L. 6843 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated, on the 
whole, conveniently for the population, being not farther than three 
miles from the most distant part of the parish. It was built in 
1757, when it was removed from its former situation on the south 
of Mordington House. The field on which it stood is still known 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



by the name of the " Kirk Park." The church is seated for 173. 
The average number of communicants is 98. Divine service is, 
on the whole, well attended by the parishioners, and by a consi- 
derable number of members of the Church of Scotland from the 
liberties of Berwick. The number of families belonging to the 
Estabhshed church is 45 ; of Dissenting or Seceding families, 14. 
The average amount of church collections may be stated at L. 8 
a-year. The manse was built about twenty years ago, and is in 
good repair. The glebe consists of fifteen acres and a-half of good 
arable land, and yields a rent of L. 37, 10s. The stipend is the 
minimum. 

Education. — There is one parochial school, at which fifty chil- 
dren on an average are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, &amp;c. 
The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum : and his school fees 
may amount to L. 30 per annum. The people are in general 
alive to the benefits of education ; but their anxiety to put their 
children soon to work for themselves, frequently induces them to 
take them from school before their education has been at all pro- 
perly advanced. There are not more than 2 or 3 persons upwards 
of fifteen years of age in the parish who cannot read. The total 
number of scholars attending school in the course of a year is 56. 

Tjibraryt — There is one small library in the parish, which has 
been in existence for two years. It was established, and is kept 
up, by private subscription, and the books are given out gratis. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — This parish, like many on the 
Scottish border, is very heavily assessed for the poor. The ave- 
rage number of persons receiving parochial aid is 18. The ave- 
rage sum allotted to each per week is Is. 9d. The only fund 
from which the maintenance of the poor is derived, is an annual 
assessment on the proprietors and tenants ; its average amount is 
L. 99, 18s. That so large a sum should be required for a po- 
pulation of only 301, is to be ascribed chiefly to the proximity 
of the parish to England. After a claim on this parish has 
been established by a residence of three years, persons remove 
into England, where, after the lapse of many years, they be- 
come paupers; and, not establishing a claim for aid from any 
English parish, they become burdens on this, the last Scotch 
parish in which they have estabhshed a claim for parochial re- 
lief.' In proof of this, it may be stated, that, at present, of 19 
on the roll, 12 reside in England. It is a remarkable fact, that, 
in the year 1792, when the former Statistical Account was writ- 



LEGEllWOOD. 



347 



ten, there were only huo paupers on the roll ; at present there 
are 19. Then, the assessment did not exceed L. 7 ; it is now 
L. 100. This enormous increase may be ascribed in part to laxi- 
ty in the administration of the poor -laws ; but chiefly to the loss 
of that feehng of independence which was formerly so noble a 
characteristic of the Scottish peasantry, — a circumstance to be 
ascribed almost entirely to the withering influence of the English 
poor-law system. 

Inns, Sfc. — There are no fewer than four public-houses where 
spirits are sold. Two of these are at toll-bars ; but it is to be 
hoped that this number will soon be diminished. 

Fuel. — Coal is easily obtained by the inhabitants of this parish 
from the Berwick collieries : it is sold at the rate of from 3s. 4d. 
to 4s. 8d. per cart load.

PRESBYTERY OF LAUDER, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE. 

THE REV. JOHN WALKER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish appears to have undergone 
several inconsiderable variations in its orthography. It is said by 
Chalmers in his Caledonia to be found, in the ancient charters of 
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, written Ligerdeioode, Ligerdes- 
luode, Ligeardeswode. About the period of the Revolution and sub- 
sequently, it was written Ligertwood and sometimes Legertwood, — 
which last form is still retained by the older people. It is most 
probably derived from the Saxon word signifying " the holloio wood,'' 
or " the hollow part of the wood" — which when the country was 
covered with trees, would be exactly descriptive of the principal 
farm which still bears that name. 

Boundaries, Extent. — It is bounded, on the north, by part of 
Westruther parish and Boon Dreigh, a small stream which separates 
it from the parish of Lauder; on the west, excepting in one place 
where it crosses that river a short way, by the Leader, wiiich divides 



348 



BERWICKSHIRE. 



it from the parishes of Lauder and Meh'ose ; on the south, by the 
parish of Earlstoun; and on the east, by the parishes of Gordon 
and Westruther. Its greatest length from Purves-haugh Bridge 
on the south, to Dodds Mill, on the north, is 6 miles; and its breadth 
from Bridge-end, on the west, to Stockbridge, on the east, is 4\ miles. 
These, however, are extreme points, and a more correct idea may 
be conveyed of its extent by stating it at 5 miles in length by 3 
in breadth. The boundary line is irregular : and of two portions 
into which its area is divided by a pretty deep valley, the northern 
and longest is, until near its upper limit, not much less than 3J 
miles in breadth, — while the southern, indented deeply by the pa- 
rish of Gordon, scarcely exceeds 2 miles. The whole parish con- 
tains about 15 square miles. 

Topographical Ajjpearances. — The greater part of the parish lies 
high; the northern part, especially, which maybe described as form- 
ing with Westruther the contiguous parish on the east, a table 
land of considerable elevation, extending from the narrow valley of 
the Leader to the base of the Lammermoor hills. The surface of 
this portion is not level, but consists of three ridges of hills, with 
high valleys intervening — the two southernmost of these ridges 
stretching from east to west, and the northern striking off from 
them in a northerly direction, and terminating in a round massive 
height named " Boon Hill," which rises 1090 feet above the level 
of the sea. The southern part of the parish is entirely occupied 
by one hill, which, on the south, slopes gradually into the vale of 
Earlston, and on the east towards the boundary of Gordon. Of 
the elevations generally, it ought to be stated, that they agree in 
having their direction nearly east and west, and in having their 
abruptest end almost westward, and a gentle declivity as they range 
to the east. 

Climate. — The cold and moisture are considerably greater than 
in the Merse and many parts of the Lothians, owing to the eleva- 
tion of the land, want of shelter, want of draining, and contiguity 
to the Lammermoors. The frosts in winter are understood to be 
more intense than in these parts, and the falls of snow are heavier, 
and continue longer on the ground. The crops in autumn are 
generally later by a week, and, in backward seasons, by a fortnight, 
than in the lowest grounds of the Merse. On the whole, how- 
ever, the climate is not insalubrious. 

Of the very limited population, it may be noticed that there are 
22 individuals betwixt sixty and seventy, most of whom are still ac- 



LEGEllWOOD. 349 



tive, and 5 above seventy ; one of the latter is considerably above 
eio-hty, and another has attained to the great age of ninety-four. 
The people are no doubt indebted in a great degree for the bles- 
sino- of robust health, to comfortable accommodation, temperate 
habits of life, and regular and bracing employment. 

Hydrography.— There are perennial springs of excellent water 
in all parts of the parish, which appear to flow from sandstone rock, 
and frequently-through gravel or through sand. It is said that tliere 
was formerly a loch of considerable extent on the lands of Oors- 
bie- and that it enclosed a small wooded mount, on which the 
ruins are still standing of an ancient tower, the residence of the 
old possessors of the barony. The sheet of water, however, if it 
did remain entire until so late a period as to encircle this seclud- 
ed fortalice, has long been drained off, and its bason is now partly 
unimproved moss, and chiefly meadow pasture. ■ 

The Leader washes the western boundary of the parish on its 
way to the Tweed. The Eden, a very small stream, has its source 
on the farm of Boon, and after a course of about fifteen mdes, 
falls into the Tweed below Newton Don. Several nameless ri- 
vulets convey the superfluous moisture to the Leader, or the Eden, 
and in the northern parts of the parish into Boon Dreigh, a tri- 
butary of the Leader. 

Geology, Sfc—TheMe eastern part of the parish, together with 
the northern side of the valley of Legerwood, rests upon secon- 
dary sandstone; and the hills in the northern part, excepting Boon 
Hill which appears to consist of conglomerate, have been raised by 
m-aywacke. This rock abounds in veins, filled, so far as I "liave 
seen with clay. At one place, where a quarry has been opened 
for dikes, these veins appear to cut each other at right angles ; 
some running almost due north, others east. Immediately above 
the bridge at Dodds Mill, on the Edinburgh road, a striking effect 
may be seen, produced by the action of water upon this veinous 
rock, which arrested the attention of the French traveller, M. Fau- 
ias St Fond The stream has uncovered a pretty large mass, and 
bv washing away the soft veins which lay parallel to its course, has 
caused the hard rock to present an appearance winch might be 
mistaken at first sight for columnar basalt. In a scientific point 
of view, it does not seem to possess much interest ; but its ap- 
pearance is attractive, especially if the formation be mistaken 
for columnar. The end, covered with ivy, of the edifice upon 
which the mill-wheel turns, and the trough that conveys the im-

pelhng stream, abut upon the httle cataract; and the whole is 
shaded by some thriving trees. In consequence of lying lower 
than the road, too, it is not observed until the passenger is almost 
in a condition to look down upon it, when the real scene may al- 
most be forgotten, in the likeness which it presents to a Dutch pic- 
ture. 

The hill which has been said to occupy the southern part of 
the parish is formed principally of conglomerate, resting on which, 
on the southern aspect of the hill, is a shivered graywacke, much 
more granular than the compact and solid stone at Dodds Mill, 
with frequent strata of camstone or slaty graywacke in thin layers 
much hardened, and at one place of the road quarry, where it is 
revealed, enveloping with saveral concentric folds an imbedded mass 
of the principal rock. 

Minute portions of copper of good quality have been found 
washed out by the rain, on the farm of Dodds. It is believed to 
be present in small quantities over a large part of the ditsrict; and, 
at a distant period, to have been wrought in the Lammermoors. 
No mine for that or any other metallic ore has ever been opened 
in this parish. None of the simple minerals have been found in 
the rocks, excepting veins and occasionally small crystals of calc- 
spar, and pieces of common quartz. The rolled stones which 
occur in the fields are generally sandstone, graywacke, camstone, 
and porphyry, pieces of which abound on Legerwood hill, and 
may form the top of the highest eminence, resting on the tuffa. 

A formation here called Moorland, clay with imbedded stones 
indurated by iron, is found at several places in thin but pretty ex- 
tensive masses near the surface. It seems to be a sort of bog-iron, 
forms rapidly, and, unless broken up and removed, which is not 
easily accomplished, is both a bar to the plough and destroys veo-e- 
tation. Peat of great depth and excellent quahty is abundant; 
but it is not permitted to be cut : and, excepting in a few instances, 
and very sparingly, that fuel is not used. 

There is a considerable variety of soils in the parish, which in 
general take their character from the underlying rock. Upon Boon 
Hill, the soil is clayey and very deep, and upon much of Legerwood 
Hill also the soil is a deep reddish clay. The graywacke is cover- 
ed to the top of the hills by a thin gravelly and untransported soil, 
which, on their sides, becomes deep and productive ; and upon the 

• The moorland, in ofiier paiislies in Scotland, is named pan, and generally is 
made iij of gravel and sand cemented by bog-iron ore.

sandstone rock, wherever the soil is good, it is a mixed soil, part- 
ly its own, with detached masses, and partly transported from the 
conglomerate of the hills. There is also resting upon it occa- 
sionally, chiefly in spots, or at the ends of fields, a soil of pure 
peat earth, which, though damp, appears to be quickened to some 
fertility. A considerable portion, however, of unreclaimed heath, 
much of which is considered incapable of being improved, rests 
upon this rock, and consists of a thin layer of sand or gravel mixed 
with, or underlying, peat earth. 

11. — Civil History. 
Eminent men. — The Rev. William Calderwood, who was minis- 
ter of this parish at the period of Episcopal domination in the 
reigns of the two last of the Stewart family, is entitled to notice, 
not as having acted in an eminent sphere, but worthily, during the 
unequal struggle which presbytery had then to maintain,— and also 
on account of his family, as he is understood to have been the son 
or nephew of the church historian. He was admitted to his charge 
in 1655, and in 1662, along with the great proportion of the talent 
and worth which still remained in the church, he was turned out for 
nonconformity to the Acts of Glasgow. Being much beloved by 
the people, he remained among them for a considerable time after 
his expulsion, and when at last he had removed from their neigh- 
bourhood, he often visited them privately. It appears to have 
been on account of the meetings which took place at these visits, 
that the parish was fined for holding conventicles in August 1684. 
He returned to his charge in 1689, and died in 1709, at the ad- 
vanced age of eighty-one, having earned a high reputation, which 
still survives him in the place, both for sanctity of hfe, and mini- 
sterial faithfulness.f 

Land-owners. — The land-owners are, according to their valued 
rents, Henry Ker Seymer, Esq. of Morriston; The Most Noble The 
Marquis of Tweeddale; Miss Innes of Stow; John Spottiswoode 
Esq. of Spottiswoode ; Dr Scott of East Morriston ; Colonel Shil- 
linglaw of Birkhillside ; Mr Fairholm of Chapel. 

Historical Notices. — The whole land in the parish, or at least 
Birkenside, Whitslaid, Legerwood, and the Morristons, belonged 
before the twelfth century to the family of Stewart. About the

year 1160, Malcolm IV. granted to his Stewart, Walter, the son 
of Alan,— Birchensyde and Legerdeswode, as they had been held 
by his grandfather David in his demesne. WaltJr, his grandson, 
and the third Stewart, gave the lands of Birchensyde in marriage 
with his daughter Eupliemia, to Patrick, who succeeded as Earl 
of Dunbar in 1232; and Robert the Stewart, who succeeded to the 
throne, granted to Alan de Lauder, his tenant of Whitslaid, many 
manorial rights in Birchensyde, Legerdswode, and Morristown,— 
a grant which was confirmed by King Robert II. 13th June 1371. 

The family of Lauder were still in possession of Whitslaid in 
1635. It afterwards belonged to the Montgomeries of Mackbie- 
hill ;  and, along with Birkenside, came by purchase into the pos- 
session of Mr Innes of Stow. Morriston and Legerwood were, in 
1635, in the possession of the ancient family who still hold it. The 
barony of Corsbie appears at an early period to have belonged to 
the Cranstouns of Oxenford, and in 1635 it was still in their pos- 
session. Dodds afterwards passed to the Hays of Mordington, and 
then came by purchase to the family of Spottiswoode. The rest of 
the barony, comprehending the farms of Boon and Corsbie, belongs 
to the Most Noble the Marquis of Tweeddale. 

East Morriston, in 1635, belonged to Francis and John Wilkison. 
It was afterwards the property of Mr Peter of Chapel, and was pur- 
chased by the late Thomas Scott, Esq. 

A part of Birkenside, which in 1635 belonged to Robert Hart 
of St John's Chapel, advocate, became in 1689, the property of 
William Shilhnglaws, elder and younger, of the elder in liferent; 
and is now in the possession of Colonel William Shillinglaw, their 
lineal descendant. It is the opinion of Colonel Shillinglaw, that 
his ancestor, whose entrance to the parish seems to have been con- 
nected with Mr Calderwood's return, and who was an elder and 
keeper for sometime of the Session records, assumed the name of 
Shillinglaw, in consequence of transactions in which he had been 
engaged during the previous troubles ; and that his real name was 
the ancient, and in this quarter, honourable, name of Kerr. 

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest entry in the pa- 
rochial registers is September 8, 1689. They appear to have been 
regularly kept, but are very meagre. 

Antiquities. — Of the three ancient towers which are mention- 

• There is a tomb-stone in the churchyard to the memory of Wiih"am i\Ioiigo- 
mery oF Mackbiehill, wlio died at Whitslaid in lJ8f, which was repaired by his 
grandson, the Right Honourable James Montgomery, Lord Chief Baron of tlie Ex- 
cliequer, in 1798.

ed in the former Statistical Account, two only, those at Corsbie and 
Whitslaid, are now standing. The tower of Morriston has been pul- 
led down, and has been nearly altogether removed in the course of 
agricultural improvements. Neither of the towers still standing bear 
any date or inscription; but they are supposed to have been erect- 
ed in the reign of James II. Upon the arched roof of Whitslaid 
tower, there is a fine sycamore tree growing. It is of considerable 
ize, and appears to be perfectly healthy. The traces of two British 
camps, one on the top of Legerwood Hill, and the other on the hill 
of Birkenside, are still discernible, but they have been much de- 
faced by the plough ; and on the farm of Boon, in the barony of 
Corsbie, there is a stone which is called the " Dodds Corse Stane." 
It is a shaft of sandstone sunk into a square block of the same ma- 
terial, and is said to have been the place where a market was at one 
time held for the vicinity. 

III. — Population. 

The population of this parish amounted in 1753, to - 398 

1791, - 422 

1801, - 493 

1811, - 360 

1821, - 476 

1831, - 365 

The apparent deficiency in the number of inhabitants in 1821, 
was owing to the census having been taken immediately upon the 
term of Whitsunday, after several house and farm-servants had 
removed, and before many of those had arrived who were en- 
gaged to supply their places. The inhabitants, therefore, until 
1811, seem to have increased with the demands, first of anadvancing, 
and then of a more perfect agriculture. Since that, period, the 
present system of husbandry is understood to have been followed. 
There has, however, been a trifling increase of the agricultural 
population; for in the year 1811, there were 14 families support- 
ed by trade and handicraft, and now there are only 10, — the heads 
of two of these being millers, who each rent a small piece of land. 
Indeed, the inhabitants may be said to be limited to a number 
barely sufficient to cultivate the soil and to tend the stock, — the 
deficiency which would otherwise be experienced in autumn being 
supplied by Irish labourers, who come in great numbers at that 
season. 

There is no town in the parish, and scarcely such a collection of 
houses as to deserve the name of a village. On every farm there 
is a hamlet, where the hinds or farm-servants reside, — every hind

supplying a female labourer, his wife or daughter, or hired servant, 
to be employed in the work of the farm, for daily pay, except dnr- 
mg harvest, when her work is given as for rent of the house whicii 
he occupies. 

The average number of births yearly for the last seven years 
amounts almost to 14. In the register, an account is kept of burials, 
not of deaths ; of burials the average is 8,— but this is not a cor- 
rect shewing of the mortality in the parish, because many people 
bemg in possession of a burying-place from their parents or more 
distant progenitors, inter their dead in the churchyard, who do not 



reside, or may never have resided, within the parish. The average 
number of marriages is 4.

There is only one proprietor of land resident. Colonel Shil- 
linglaw of Birkhillside. Some of the farmers are understood, in re- 
spect to fortune, to be independent of their profession ; and, as the 
farms are large, all have a considerable capital vested in stock, &amp;c. 

John Murray, Esq. of Uplaw, although not a proprietor, should 
be mentioned in an account of this parish, as his family has been 
longer connected with it than any other now resident, — that family 
having held the farm of Corsbie since 1671. In 1690, his ances- 
tor, John Murray of Uplaw, was ordained by Mr Calderwood one 
of the elders for arranging parochial affairs, then in a state of much 
confusion; and seems to have possessed great influence among the 
inhabitants, — an influence which his descendants have never ceased 
to retain. 

Character, Sfc. of the People. — They are commonly sober-mind- 
ed, industrious, and temperate. Their houses, are in general 
good and comfortable, well furnished, and kept with great atten- 
tion to cleanliness. They seldom eat butcher-meat; but they 
keep a cow, have a pig, which they fatten for their families, and 
get, as part of wages, more meal and potatoes than in some in- 
stances they consume. They appear to enjoy in a reasonable de- 
gree the comforts and advantages of society, and to be quite con- 
tented with their situation and circumstances. 

During the last three years, there have been 8 illegitimate births 
in the parish.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The number of acres in the parish amounts to 
8430. Of this land, 3470 acres are regularly under cultivation ; 
1830 are in permanent pasture, but are cropped occasionally, for 
the purpose of renewing the sown grasses when they die out; 2830 
acres have never been cultivated, some of which might be improved, 
perhaps, as pasture, but not otherwise ; and 300 acres are in wood. 
T nere is no part of the land in a state of undivided common. About 
16 acres are of natural wood, which consists, with a few ash trees 
and young oaks, chiefly of alder, birch, and hazel. The planta- 
tions are of larch, spruce, and common firs, with a small proportion 
of hard wood. They are all young, protected by good fences, and 
appear to be in a thriving state. 

The land forty years ago, as appears from the former Statistical 
Account, was held by seventeen tenants. It is now occupied by 
nine, several of the farms being extensive. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent per acre is from 12s. to 15s.; 
The average rent of grazing is at the rate of L. 3, 10s. per ox or 
cow grazed, and at the rate of 15s. per ewe or full-grown sheep 
pastured by the year. The rental of the parish is L. 3800. 

Live-Stock. — The common breeds of sheep are the Leicester and 
Cheviot, and a cross from these. The cattle are now chiefly, and 
until of late they were solely, of the short-horned breed : and very 
great attention is paid to the rearing and fattening both of sheep and 
cattle. Every arrangement of the farmer has some reference to 
this paramount object ; and the remark of the intelligent writers 
of the last Statistical Account is still applicable, " even a stranger 
might judge, at a first aspect, that the feeding and fattening of sheep 
and cattle are the primary objects of the industry of the farmers of 
this parish." Not an acre, probably, of the large portion of land, 
1830 acres, which has been stated to be occasionally under culti- 
vation for the purpose of reclaiming the pasture, remunerates by 
its grain produce, at present prices, the outlay in labour and manure, 
and seeds. Of that portion, also, which is under regular cultiva- 
tion, there is much which is considered to be scarcely profitable, 
and which would be kept, therefore, in permanent pasture, were 
straw and hay and turnips not needed for the winter sustenance 
and fattening of stock. A five years' rotation of crop is observed 
on all the farms ; and, as potatoes are not grown for the market, 
one-fifth of the cultivated land may be said to be annually in tur- 
nips, two-fifths in oats and barley, and two-fifths in grass, of which 
scarcely one-sixth is cut for hay.

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry thus arranged, is pur- 
sued with much zeal and enhghtened generosity to the land, and 
appears to be most judicious, and, in the circumstances, highly suc- 
cessful. The tenants are all men of acknowledged skill and ex- 
perience in the science of farming ; they are not embarrassed by 
inadequacy of capital, and almost every year some melioration, 
chiefly in the way of draining, is effected. Unfortunately, how- 
ever, the state in which they appear generally to have entered to 
the soil would impose upon them much more than it would be 
practicable for most, or prudent for any tenant, on a common 
lease, without the greatest encouragement, to undertake. A large 
portion of the land, it should be stated, is not enclosed, and much 
of the residue is enclosed but indifferently. The best soils are now, 
it is true, generally dry and kept in the highest condition: but drain- 
ing is needed on almost every inferior field ; while over nearly the 
whole of the land which is occasionally tilled, water that might be 
carried off injures the pasture. Embankment is in some places re- 
quired. The rigour of the climate, too, which in winter is fre- 
quently unfavourable to the turnip feeding of stock, and in other 
respects hurtful, might be mitigated, were convenient stripes of 
land, not of much value for other purposes, occupied by plantations. 
These, however, are changes, that, from their character, or from 
the extent to which they would require to be carried, no farmer 
could, without great imprudence, on a lease of sixteen or nineteen 
• years, the ordinary duration of leases, even purpose deliberately. 
It is gratifying to state, that improvements, in some instances 
of great importance, emanating from, or aided by, the land-owners, 
and sometimes effected entirely by the tenant, have been made, with 
manifest advantage, or are now in progress, on a scale sufficiently 
large to encourage the hope that anything requisite to put the 
agriculturalist, so far as our high climate shall permit, on an equal 
footing with more favoured districts, will follow in due time. East 
Morriston, the estate of the late Thomas Scott, Esq. has been under 
his own superintendence, drained carefully, enclosed, and shelter- 
ed by plantations, which have become highly ornamental. Colonel 
Shillinglaw's property of Birkhillside, with similar advantages, is 
in the same excellent condition. The large farm of Corsbie, 
through Mr Murray's exertions, has been improved, and is in a 
great measure subdivided to the full extent of its arable land, and, 
although not sheltered by plantations, is known for the rearing of 
excellent stock. On the large and valuable farm of Legerwood, 



LEGERWOOD.

thouoh also in need of shelter, so successful has been Mr Mur- 
ray's'treatment of the cultivated land, that much of his crop is not 
surpassed in the county, while his stock likewise bears a high cha- 
racter. On the farm of West Morriston, a considerable part of the 
regularly cultivated land is well sheltered and enclosed, and has been 
drained gradually with care, — while, on the pasture land, a simple 
but efficacious surface draining has lately been executed by a 
plough of Mr Sumner's own invention. The farm of Whitslaid 
appears to be well fenced, and has thriving plantations ; and on 
Birkenside, extensive improvements, conducted with great judg- 
ment, are in progress. Dodds, the property of John Spottiswoode, 
Esq. of Spottiswoode, is, as to the larger part, subdivided ; and 
through the spirit of the tenant, and the landlord's liberal and pru- 
dent encouragement, 100 acres of land have lately been improved. 
And the farm of Boon, the most extensive in the parish, is about 
to be suitably enclosed and subdivided, immediately on the entrance 
of the tenant upon a new lease, at Whitsunday next. These 
changes must shortly be of great benefit, both to the appearance 
and the qualities of the land. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish may be as follows : 

Produce of grain of alljjkinds, whether cultivated for food of man or the domestic

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication.— 1:\\q means of communication are 
ample. The road from Kelso to Edinburgh passes along the east 
side of the parish, and that from Hawick, along the west ; and there 
is a post-office both at Lauder and Earlston. There are about ten 
miles of parish road ; upon which, and on turnpike roads within the 
parish, are nine bridges in tolerable repair. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is placed on the north- 
ern ascent of the valley, which has been mentioned as passing 
across the parish ; and it is conveniently situated for the bulk of 
the population. Excepting on the extreme northern limit of the pa- 
rish, which is inhabited, and is three miles and a-half distant, none 



358

of the inhabitants are at a greater distance than two miles and a- 
half. It is not known at what time the church was built. It ap- 
pears, however, from an inscription upon the edifice to have been 
extensively repaired in 1717. It was again repaired in 1804, and is 
in good condition. It contains 203 sittings ; a greater number of 
persons might be accommodated, but not comfortably. There are 
no free sittings, nor are there any let for money. They belong to 
the different proprietors, according to their valued rents, and are by 
them apportioned to the tenants, who hold them for their own ac- 
commodation, and that of the people who live under them. 

The manse was built in 1750, and enlarged and repaired in 1812. 
The glebe extends to ten acres, and may be worth about L. 15, 
and the stipend is 14 chalders, half meal and half barley, with 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. Sterling of money. There is no chapel of ease at- 
tached to the Established church, or Dissenting or Seceding cha- 
pel in the parish. 

The number of families in the parish, as before stated, is 98 ; of 
which thirteen families belong to the Secession, and attend the 
chapels at Lauder or Earlston ; the rest attend the parish church : 
and the number of communicants is from 190 to 200. There is 
a branch of the Berwickshire Bible Society in the parish, and an 
association for contributing to the Highland Schools and Indian 
Mission, under the management of the General Assembly's Com- 
mittees. The church collections yearly for these purposes are ex- 
pected to amount to L. 10 or L. 12. 

Education. — There is only the parochial school in the parish. 
The branches of instruction generally taught in it are, English 
reading and grammar, writing, arithmetic, and occasionally book- 
keeping and practical mathematics. The salary is L. 28 per an- 

" I have been favoured by Mr Macdonald of the Register Office with an interest- 
ing notice respecting this matter. It is the answer of Mr George Byres to the in-

" The kirk of Legertwood is ane of the kirkis of Paislay ; the patronage thereof is

the school-fees amount to L. 20 per annum. The general expense 
of education per month is, for English, lOd.; for writing, Is.; for 
arithmetic, Is. 2d. ; and for book-keeping, &amp;c. 6s. per quarter. 

The number of scholars last year at school was 71. 

There are a number of children between six and fifteen years 
of age who cannot write,— for the population being scattered, five 
or srx years, according as it is winter or summer, is the age at 
which children are first sent to school ; and at eight or nine years 
they begin to write : but there are at present 63 between the ages 
of six and fifteen in the parish who have been taught to write, or 
are learning. 

There are, perhaps, some females above fifteen who cannot 
write ; but no individuals above that age are understood to be unable 
to read. The people seem in general to be alive to the important 
benefits of education, and it is an object which the kirk-session 
has for a considerable time anxiously watched over and promoted. 
There is a private school in the parish of Westruther; and another 
at Blainslie, in the parish of Melrose,— both of which some of the 
children attend, on account of their distance from the parish school. 
There is also a Sabbath school, which is well attended. No other 
schools are required. 

Literature. — There is a library in the parish; but the number of 
books is still very limited. It was commenced some years ago as 
a library for the young who were attending the parochial Sabbath 
school. The plan was afterwards extended, and books suited to 
grown-up persons have since been added. It increases yearly, but 
at a slow rate. 

Poor and Parochial Funds, — The number of persons at present 
regularly receiving parochial aid is 12; the average sum allotted to 
each per week is 2s. — children Is. The amount of money for their 
relief assessed upon the land at last November was L. 25. A regu- 
lar assessment for the poor appears to have obtained in this parish 
so early as 1755. The church collections for the relief of the poor 
may amount, together with the mortcloth money, to L. 10 oy L. 11 
annually. With this money, which is left entirely to the manage- 
ment of the Session, individuals who are in want, owing to ill health 
or large families, are occasionally aided: and endeavours have 
■for some time been made to bear up, by seasonable relief and en- 
couragement, persons who are in difficulties, so as to prevent them 
from sinking upon the poors' roll, and as much as possible to mi-.

backwardness on the part of individuals to apply for parochial re-

Fuel.— The fuel used is coal, and a small quantity of peat. The 
coal is principally carried from the Lothians, and costs about L. 1, 
Is. per ton. English coal can be purchased in Kelso at a cheaper 
rate, but it is considered to be of inferior quality, and is little 
used.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE 

COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q786649">BERWICK</name>.</head> 
<p> 
BY THE REV. JOHN EDGAR/a. M. MINISTER OF HUTTON. 

lame. — The ancient name of Berwickshire was the Merse, 
which it probably derived from its local situation as a border or 
march district. This name, however, appears to have been restrict- 
ed to the lower and more fertile part of the county, while the hilly 
and more sterile district was denominated Lammermoor. It is 
difficult to ascertain the precise limits of these two divisions, and 
the distinction is now only nominal. The only occasion on which 
it is recognized is at the striking of the fiars of the county, — the 
price of Lammermoor grain being fixed at a lower rate than that 
of the Merse. It is almost superfluous to observe that this County 
derives its present name from the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, 
in its immediate vicinity. With this ancient place, though not 
within its territorial limits, and though governed by English laws, 
Berwickshire is intimately connected. It is the only town of con- 
siderable importance, either for population or trade, in the district, 
and the principal sea port whence the corn, wool, and other agri- 
cultural produce of the county are exported. 

Situation and Extent. — This county is situated betwixt I°41' 
and 2° 34' of West Long, from London ; and betwixt 55° 36' 30" 
and 55° 58' 30" of North Lat. Its extreme length is 34 miles, and

its extreme breadth 21. Its mean length is 28 miles, and mean 
breadth 17 miles. It contains 476 square miles, or 304,640 Eng- 
lish acres. Berwickshire forms the south-eastern hmit of Scot- 
land : it is separated from Haddingtonshire on the north by an ir- 
regular boundary ; the counties of Edinburgh and Roxburgh bound 
it on the west, by a crooked and zig-zag line ; and the latter coun- 
ty, Northumberland, and North Durham form its southern hmits. 
On the east, the county is washed by the German Ocean. Its 
maritime coast extends nearly 20 miles, commencing near Lam- 
berton, at the eastern point of Mordington parish, and terminat- 
ing at the north part of the parish of Cockburnspath, where it joins 
East Lothian. On the south-east it is bounded by the liberties of 
Berwick. 

Topography.— The aspect of the county is considerably diver- 
sified. The Lammermoor district, if it cannot be called moun- 
tainous, is at least hilly, bleak, and moorish. Some of the hills m 
Lammermoor are of considerable altitude; they are generally co- 
vered with heath, and have round and flattened summits. The 
following table shows the heights of the principal hills above the 
level of the sea, and the parishes in which they are situated : —

Berwickshire cannot boast of such romantic features, and such 
striking localities as characterize some of the northern and western 
counties, and which prove so attractive to travellers. But still it 
is not without its beauties, though these are of a more subdued and 
less marked kind. Though there is a general uniformity in the 
Merse, yet even its flattest parts are not without many gentle swells 
and undulating elevations, which diversify the scenery, relieve the 
uniformity of a continued plain, and impart an agreeable variety 
to the prospect. These elevations generally range from the north- 
west to the south-east. In the district properly denominated the 

• This account of the measurement of the county is taken from Kerr's Agricultu- 
ral survey, published in 1809. It differs in some degree from Mr Blackadder's mea- 
surement. According to the authority of Mr Blackadder, as quoted in the Agricul- 
tural survey of Berwickshire, publislicd in 1809, the whole may be distributed into 
tiic following divisions : Lowlands of the Merse, containing 100,"22G acres ; lowlands 
of Lauderdale, 7'i80 ; lowlands of Cockburnsiiatli, 2200; hill lands of Lauderdale 
and Lammermoor, 175,734. — J. E.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



Merse, extending from the Tweed to the Whitadder, and whic-li 
is the most level part, a continued succession occurs, at short in- 
tervals, of those slight but well defined eminences. But what this 
county wants in the beauties of nature, has been abundantly sup- 
plied by the embellishments of art. Studded with handsome coun- 
try seats, snug farm-houses, comfortable cottages, and clean and 
thriving villages, adorned with tasteful clumps, and extensive co- 
lumns of wood of almost every variety of forest trees, and present- 
ing to view numerous and well laid out fields of corn and pasture, 
completely enclosed with thriving hedges, and managed according 
to the most improved methods of modern husbandry, it appears in 
striking contrast to the barren and sterile aspect of the uplandgrounds, 
with which it is skirted on almost every side, and to what we may 
imagine its appearance to have been a century ago, when there 
were few vestiges of culture, no enclosures, and but little wood. 
The view towards the south, south-east and west, from the heights 
above Chirnside, is one of great variety, and by no means des- 
titute of picturesque effect : it never fails forcibly to strike a 
stranger. It is doubtful whether in any district of Scotland such 
an extensive, rich, and well cultivated rural panorama can be 
found, or whose external features bear so near a resemblance to 
some of the fertile plains of " merry England." The Lammer- 
moor hills are seen in all their sterile and heath-clad blackness, 
their rounded forms well defined, and placed, as it, were, as a pro- 
tection to the wide and cultivated plains which they enclose. Ex- 
tending for many miles, the Merse appears reclining in calm re- 
pose, its surface decked with various objects of rural interest, and 
interspersed with trees, hedgerows, woods, rich pastures, and spa- 
cious and fertile corn fields. To the south-west is seen Hume 
Castle, frowning from its elevated site on the plain beneath, and re- 
calling the remembrance of feudal times. At a farther distance, 
in nearly the same direction, appear the Eildon hills, towering 
to the clouds, while far to the south-east, the huge masses of the 
Cheviot mountains, rifing in dim and dusky grandeur, arrest the 
eye of the spectator, and furnish a fine and imposing termination 
to the scene. 

The eastern part of the county differs considerably in the cha- 
racter of its topography from the parishes in its internal part, 
— being more diversified with hill and dale, more variegated with 
rising grounds, and not presenting such an uniform and level ap- 
pearance. In several places, this district is intersected with rugged

crullies and deep ravines, apparently produced by some violent 
natural convulsion,— through which meander gentle rivulets, whose 
tiny waters bear no proportion to the magnitude of their banks. 
The sea coast is generally high, rocky, and precipitous, present- 
ino- a bold front to the ocean, frequently rising perpendicular and 
abmptly from the sea, and indented and variegated with promon- 
tories and bays. The elevation of the coast is very considerable, 
especially in the neighbourhood of St Abb's Head, an object well 
known to mariners, and which forms the most prominent point on 
this line of coast,— at which the range of the Lammermoor hills, 
which extend so far across the island, may be considered as com- 
mencing. Of the several bays on the coast, the most remark- 
able is'' that of Coldingham, which, being protected by the 
high lands of St Abb's Head from the north-west, affords excel- 
lent shelter and secure anchorage-ground to vessels when prevent- 
ed, by the prevalence of westerly winds, from proceeding up the 
Frith of Forth. 

Climate.— Bm'mg the spring, cold easterly winds generally pre- 
vail for several weeks. These retard vegetation, and produce their 
usual pernicious effects on gardens, and corn and grass fields. Sum- 
mer weather seldom commences before the end of May, and in- 
deed a too forward spring is not generally desired by farmers. The 
prevailing wind in summer is the south-west. Great and long-con- 
tinued falls of rain do not frequently occur. Excessive droughts 
are more common, and by experienced agriculturists a series of dry 
weather, though of considerable duration, is considered more suit- 
ed to the soil, and better calculated to secure a productive crop, 
than the other extreme. The winters may be pronounced, on an 
average, to be mild. Heavy falls of snow are of rare occurrence, 
and when they do happen, the snow seldom Ues on the ground for 
any length of time, though on the Lammermoor hills it frequently 
retains its place weeks after it has disappeared in the lower 
parts of the county. In regard to climate, the Merse is rather 
favourably situated. Sheltered by the Lammermoor hills on the 
north, and by the Cheviot mountains on the south, the clouds 
which are generated by evaporation from the German Ocean are 
attracted by these hilly ranges, so that, while the operations of 
spring and harvest are proceeding in the lower part of the county 
with spirit and activity, under the cheering influence of genial and 
dry weather, in the higher they are not unfrccpiently interrupted 
and retarded, or, performed imperfectly, from the prevalence of

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



heavy rains, and from the moist and cold nature of the dimate. 
The well known fact, that, in the best districts of this county, a 
considerable breadth of land is annually sown with wheat after 
turnips, sometimes so late as the month of April, and that fair 
crops are the result, is a criterion, and by no means an unfavour- 
able one, of the character of the climate. 

Soil— A great variety of soils exists in the county ; some districts 
being remarkable for a stiff and stubborn clay, others for a mix- 
ture of clay and loam ; a rich loamy soil characterizing one part 
of the county, while another is distinguished for a mixture of sand, 
gravel, and loam, in various proportions ; and on the same soil all 
these diversities are sometimes amalgamated. When it is consi- 
dered that, not unfrequently on the same farm, all these varieties 
occur, and sometimes even on the same field ; and that all these 
kinds of soil are modified by the character of the subsoil, which 
also exists in as great diversity,— to classify the varieties of the soil, 
or to ascertain with any degree of accuracy the extent to which 
these endless peculiarities prevail, would be almost if not alto- 
gether impossible. It may, in general terms, be observed, that 
clay forms the discriminating character of the lands in the " How 
of the Merse loam that part of the soil which skirts the chief 
rivers ; while turnip soil is found in those parts of the Merse where 
there is not too great a preponderance of clay, and in the arable 
portion of the Lammermoor district. The lands on Tweedside, 
and along the banks of the Whitadder and Blackadder, generally 
consist of a fine deep loam, well fitted for raising luxuriant crops 
of almost every description, resting commonly on a gravelly subsoil, 
though sometimes on a stiff tenacious clay. These tracts of land 
are the most valuable in the county, and have been long under a 
course of skilful management. In the intermediate tract betwixt 
these rivers the land is less valuable, and degenerates into a stiff 
and hard clay, difficult to work, and from resting on a subsoil of 
stiff till, liable to be saturated with moisture, and long retaining it 
when thus saturated. The remainder of the arable part consists 
of a sharp sandy and gravelly soil, well adapted for raising turnips, 
combined in different proportions with loam and clay, easily wrought, 
and varying in quality and value according to the nature of the sub- 
soil on which it is incumbent. This species of land is highly valued, 
and those farms which contain a considerable proportion of turnip 
soil are generally preferred by the tenantry. In the Agricultural 
Report of this county, published by the late John Home, Esq. W. S.

upwards of thirty years ago, the proportion of the various kinds of 
soil are thus given: Deep loam on the principal rivers, 25410 acres ; 
clay lands in the How of the Merse, 40380 ; turnip soil, 119780; 
meadow, moss, and moor, in Lauderdale and Lammermoor, 99870. 

Hydrography, — The principal rivers connected with this coun- 
ty are the Tweed, Whitadder, Blackadder, and Leader. The 
smaller streams are the Eye, Dye, Ale and Leet, besides a great 
number of burns that cannot be particularized. The salmon-fish- 
eries on that part of the Tweed which skirts this county are of 
considerable value, and furnish employment during the season to 
a number of individuals. Of late years, however, it is matter of re- 
gret, that their value has been much diminished in consequence 
of a deficiency of fish. The rentals have accordingly sunk, some 
of them to a third of what they were a few years ago. Many causes 
have been assigned for this remarkable failure. None of them, 
however, appear satisfactorily to account for it. It has been con- 
jectured that, in consequence of the pier of Berwick, which was 
erected some years ago, obtruding too far into the mouth of the 
river, its inlet has been narrowed, and the fish thereby prevented 
from entering it. But by practical fishermen, and other intelligent 
persons well acquainted with the natural history of the salmon, this 
cause has been rejected as insufficient to account for the failure, — it 
being well known that salmon are not easily deterred from resort- 
ing to their usual haunts, and are abundant in rivers with a much 
narrower entrance than that of the Tweed. Others have ascribed 
the deficiency to the general use of lime for agricultural purposes, — 
which being washed from the land by heavy rains, and in this way 
conveyed into the Tweed, produces a deleterious effect on the fish. 
But the practice of liming land in this district has not been re- 
cently introduced, and existed for many years, when there was no 
complaint of this failure. By others, it is thought that the river 
is overfished, the number of boats on the water having been much 
increased of late years. The most general opinion, and perhaps 
the most satisfactory one is, that the deficiency is to be accounted 
for from the illegal destruction of fish during close time in the up- 
per part of the river and its tributaries, — which, in defiance of law, 
and in direct violation of the rights of property, has been persisted 
in to an alarming extent, especially in the higher district of Tweed- 
side. It is hoped that the Act lately obtained — a rigorous execu 
tion of the law on ofTenders — a stricter vigilance by those interest-

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



ed ill the fisheries — and more vigorous measures on the part of pro- 
prietors—will contribute to check this evil, and to restore the river 
to its former state of productiveness. 

The Tweed, so celebrated in song, and so renowned in history, and 
associated in the breast of every Scotsman with such interesting 
recollections, is, in the parts of it connected with this county, a 
magnificent and imposing stream, — maintaining through all its 
course its characteristic transparency — winding and tortuous in its 
career, and presenting on its banks a variety of interesting scenery. 
The road from Berwick to Kelso by Ladykirk and Coldstream, a 
great part of which passes close by the Tweed, is one of the most 
delightful in point of scenery in the south-east of Scotland. There 
is excellent salmon-fishing with the rod in this section of the Tweed, 
and in the autumn it is resorted to by amateurs of this interesting 
sport. A clause in the late act of Parliament renders it lawful to 
fish with the rod for a month after the usual fishing with nets has 
closed. 

The other rivers in the county also abound with trout, and in 
the spring and summer seasons afford good sport to the angler. 
The Whitadder takes its rise in the hilly part of East Lothian, and 
is remarkable for the rapidity of its current, the steepness of its 
banks, and its numerous and circuitous windings. After receiving 
several considerable contributions from various nameless rivulets, 
and being joined by the Blackadder at Allanton, it unites with the 
Tweed about three miles above Berwick. The Blackadder rises in 
the parish of Westruther, passes Greenlaw, the county town, and 
after permeating the Merse, and imparting its charms to several 
gentlemen's seats which skirt it, joins the Whitadder. It is dis- 
tinguished for the quahty of its trout, which somewhat resemble those 
of Loch Leven, and are esteemed for their flavour. The Leader 
winds through Lauderdale, to which it gives its name, and from 
the upper part of which it issues, and runs into the Tweed, near 
old Melrose, at the point where it becomes the boundary of Ber- 
wickshire. The Leet, originating in the How of the Merse, unites 
with the same river at Coldstream, ' and the Eye, which rises in 
East Lothian, and flows in an easterly direction, falls into the sea 
at Eyemouth. 

Coldingham Loch is the only natural piece of water of any ex- 
tent in Berwickshire. It covers about thirty acres, — is remarkable 
for its high situation and its proximity to the sea — abounds with

Berwickshire may be described as almost purely agricultural. 
The great majority of its population derive their means of subsist- 
ence from their connection with the various departments of this 
useful art. In the few manufactories established in the county, the 
number of individuals employed bears a small proportion to those 
engaged in rural labours. Even the tradesmen in the small towns 
and villages depend much on the prosperity of the farming inte-

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



rest, as they must look for employment in their different vocations 
almost exclusively to the agriculturists, and their servants and de- 
pendents. Perhaps no county in Scotland is more entirely of an 
agricultural character, or more interested in this great branch of 
national and productive industry. The artisan, the labourer, and 
the hind, have all a deep concern in its success, as well as the ac- 
tual cultivator of the soil, and the proprietor. They share in its 
depression and participate in its prosperity, and the various fluc- 
tuations to which it is exposed are felt, either for good or evil, by 
all classes of the comnmnity. To this art great attention has 
been paid. The march of agricultural improvements commen- 
ced at a comparatively early period in the Merse. So far back as 
in the year 1730, the judicious, spirited, and well-directed exer- 
tions of a few landed proprietors, gave a new character to the hus- 
bandry of the county. Among those patriotic and public-spirited 
individuals, who led the way in this good work, the names of Mr 
Swinton of Swinton, father of the late Lord Swinton ; Mr Hume 
of Eccles ; and at a later period, Lord Kames, — deserve to be ho- 
nourably mentioned, as having contributed by their example to give 
a stimulus to rural improvement, which- ha been productive of the 
best effects, and which has raised Berwickshire to a high rank in 
the scale of agriculture. This spirit quickly spread to tenants of 
skill, enterprise, and capital. Their success stimulated others to 
follow their footsteps. Encouragement was given by proprietors to 
tenants, by granting them leases on liberal terms, and of a proper 
duration. Lands were enclosed, moorish tracts improved, lime and 
manure liberally applied, the turnip husbandry extensively pur- 
sued, and by the general use of thrashing-machines, and a thorough 
improvement of turnpike and parish roads, facilities were afforded 
for marketing grain on a scale commensurate with the improved 
productiveness of the soil, and the increasing capabilities of the 
county. Notwithstanding the severe depression under which this 
interest has laboured for some years past, and which at no period 
was more felt than at present, this county still retains its agricul- 
tural pre-eminence. Improvements are still proceeding to a cer- 
tain extent, and perhaps there is no district of Scotland where agri- 
culture is conducted with more of the precision and exactness of a 
science. The average size of farms in this county may be stated 
at from 300 to 400 Enghsh acres. The duration of leases is gene- 
rally nineteen years. Of all agricultural improvements of modern 
times, perhaps the most valuable is the perfection to which drain-

ino- has been carried. From the nature of the soil, and its tendency 
to humidity, no county required this improvement more than Ber- 
wickshire, and though much yet remains to be done, nowhere has 
it been more successfully or more extensively pursued. Drains are 
now laid out in a more scientific style than formerly, and, as a na- 
tural consequence, their operation on the soil is far more efficient 
and salutary. As an instance of the extent to which draining has 
been carried, it may be mentioned, that, upon an extensive farm in 
the united parish of Bunkle and Preston, drains have been made, 
the measurement of which amounts to twenty-four miles. The 
practice of cutting sheep drains has also been pursued in the pas- 
toral and upland districts of the county, and the result has proved 
highly beneficial, by improving the herbage, and carrying off the 
superabundant moisture. 

At the end of last century, the local connection of this county 
with the English borders directed the attention of some consider- 
able landed proprietors to effect an improvement on the breeds of 
cattle and sheep. The late Mr Robertson of Ladykirk merits par- 
ticularly to be mentioned as having taken the leading part in this 
branch of improvement, to which he was sedulously devoted. His 
liberal fortune and rich and extensive old pasture land on the de- 
mesne of Ladykirk, afforded him means and opportunities which 
few enjoyed, of carrying this department of rural economy to great- 
er perfection than perhaps any other individual in Scotland. His 
efforts were crowned with success, and his breeds of sheep and 
cattle still continue to be highly prized by connoisseurs and adepts 
in these matters. The tenantry also followed his example on a 
more limited scale. The old breeds of cattle and sheep were gra- 
dually displaced, and kinds were introduced of more productive 
value, better adapted to the soil and climate, more kindly feeders, 
and sooner prepared for the butcher. To this department consi- 
derable attention is still paid in this county : and as its agriculture 
is of a mixed description, combining the raising of corn with the 
breeding, rearing, and feeding of stock, it is naturally to the far- 
mer an object of no small importance, and his success very much 
depends on it. By the gradual extension of the turnip husban- 
dry, which has gained for Berwickshire the appellation of the Nor- 
folk of Scotland, and to which, by the application of the modern 
improvement of bone manure, a greater breadth of land can now be 
devoted, means are afforded of feeding for the market a much larger

quantity of stock than in former times ; and from this county heing 
within a reasonable distance of the great stock markets in the north 
of England, and from the establishment of new markets for cattle 
and sheep at Coldstream, Dunse, and Ayton, at which places busi- 
ness in this line to a large amount is transacted, opportunities are 
■presented to the farmers of readily disposing of their stock to any 
extent. 

The grain raised in this county is mostly sold at Berwick, where 
there is a weekly corn-market. It is sold by sample, and the quan- 
tity annually disposed of is very great. It is believed that Berwick 
ranks amongst the third or fourth rate towns in Great Britain in 
respect of the quantity of corn exported. A great deal is sent to 
London. A stock corn-market has also lately been established at 
Eyemouth. 

The Lammermoor district not being adapted for tillage, but a 
small portion of it is under the plough. It is therefore principally 
devoted to the pasturage of sheep, which is deemed a more safe 
and profitable method of employing capital in this part of the 
county, than the attempting to raise grain, which frequently yields 
a precarious return. The hills, neither being so high nor so 
sterile as in other mountainous tracts in the south of Scotland, af- 
ford sound and healthy pasture for sheep of the Cheviot and black- 
faced breed, — the management of which is well understood and 
successfully practised by the intelligent and active Lammermoor 
farmers. 

A number of fields remain permanently in pasture, generally 
in the hands of proprietors. They are annually let by public roup 
— afford a fair return — and are convenient for breeders, dealers in 
stock, and butchers. 

Population. — The population of this county has been more station- 
ary than of most other counties in Scotland, which is doubtless to 
be ascribed to its almost exclusively agricultural character. There 
is a sufficient supply of labourers, and though the farmers, from 
the badness of the times, now employ as few hands as with proprie- 
ty they can, there are seldom any unemployed. For these few 
years past, a considerable emigration of persons belonging to the 
labouring classes has annually taken place to Canada, which, were 
it to proceed at the same rate for any length of time, would have 
the effect of sensibly diminishing the population.

Roads. — From being in former times proverbially bad, the roads 
are now excellent, and much attention is paid to keeping them in pro- 
per repair. When toll-bars were first estabhshed, great opposition 
was made to this measure; and acts of violence and outrage were re- 
sorted to. The people are now convinced of their error, and justly ap- 
preciate the advantages that are derived from having easy means of 
communication betwixt the dilferent districts of the county. The pro- 
prietors connected with the different trusts take great pains in super- 
intending and managing the road affairs. The parish roads are main- 
tained by the statute labour conversion money ; and overseers, who are 
generally respectable farmers, are appointed in every parish for in- 
specting the roads, managing the funds, and seeing them properly ap- 
plied. In the internal part of the county, there are several cross roads 



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

which are little used, and which, without any loss either to indivi- 
duals or the public, might with propriety be shut up. In some places 
of the district, the want of bridges to afford a safe passage over the 
rapid streams which intersect Berwickshire is severely felt, and 
much complained of. In that part " which is situated on the 
lower extremity of the Whitadder, this is particularly the case. 
The numerous fatal accidents that have occurred to persons at- 
tempting to cross the rivers while in flood, have excited an al- 
most universal anxiety that something should be done to prevent 
the occurrence of such heart-rending visitations. Several of the 
proprietors have shown a deep interest in providing a remedy, by 
the erection of bridges ; and it is hoped that the time is not distant 
when measures will be taken to obviate this defect. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Though in the course of last century le- 
veral unions of parishes took place, yet few are of an inconvenient 
size. In several parishes the churches being situated at their ex- 
tremities, are rather inconveniently placed for the parishioners. The 
largest parishes in point of territorial extent are those of Lauder 
and Coldingham, both of which comprise vast tracts of unimprov- 
ed and unimprovable moor. In the latter parish, there is a Cha- 
pel of Ease at Ronton, where a preacher regularly officiates. It 
is doubtful whether sufficient permanent funds could be obtained to 
justify the presbytery in ordaining a clergyman in this chapel. The 
most populous parishes are Dunse and Coldstream. The smallest 
parish in point of extent is Eyemouth, and the least populous Ab- 
bey St Bathans. There are about fourteen Dissenting meeting- 
houses of various denominations. 



 Part of the parish of Oldhamstocks is situated in Berwickshire, and detached at a 
considerable distance from the rest of the parish, which is in East Lothian. In all 
"other matters, except quoad sacra, it forms a part of the former county.

Education. — The parochial and private schools in Berwickshire 
are well attended, and are sufficiently numerous for the population 
of the district. Few parents are without the means of educating 
their children, and the offspring of those who from poverty are un ■ 
able to do so, are in most parishes instructed gratuitously, or at the 
expense of the heritors. 

At all the schools the ordinary branches of education common in 
Scotland are taught, accompanied with the elements of religious

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



knowledge. It has been observed of late years, that the number 
of Latin scholars has decreased much, several parishes of consi- 
derable population being destitute of these entirely. Perhaps this is 
not much to be regretted. Some of the parochial and other teach- 
ers have adopted Mr Wood's system of tuition with great success, 
— a method certainly superior to the old mechanical system, and 
which at an early age gives such scope and exercise for the intel- 
lectual powers. The estabhshment of normal schools for initiat- 
ing young men in the important and arduous task of teaching, from 
whom parochial schoolmasters could be selected, would, it is ge- 
nerally believed, be attended with salutary effects, and tend much 
to improve and increase the efficiency of the present system. The 
schools are annually examined by committees of the respective 
presbyteries within whose limits they are situated, and the reports 
transmitted to the General Assembly. In all the schools the Scrip- 
tures are daily read. 

Sunday schools prevail in most parishes, and it cannot be doubted 
that their effect is beneficial, when they are conducted by teachers of 
good character, and sound religious principle. It is thought, how- 
ever, by some, that they have a tendency to make parents careless 
about the religious instruction of their children, — an effect which 
would be much to be deplored, as certainly this kind of knowledge 
cannot be imparted with such interest and efficiency from any 
lips as from those of a parent. On the other hand, when pa- 
rents are negligent with regard to the spiritual improvement of 
their families, as is sometimes the case, Sunday schools supply this 
deficiency, and are highly useful and salutary.

ON THE COUNTY OF BERWICK. 



375 



The poor are supported in this county almost universally by 
compulsory assessments, the one-half of which is paid by the pro- 
prietor, and the other by the tenant, according to the valued rent. 

The collections made at church on the Lord's day are a fund 
quite inadequate for this purpose, and poor rates having been long 
established, these collections have in most cases dwindled into an 
insignificant sum ; and in the smaller parishes are insufficient for 
defraying those expenses which from time immemorial have been 
paid from this source. It cannot be denied that a heavy burden 
is thus imposed on landed property, and that the usual bad effects 
are produced on the character and habits of the poor themselves, 
which flow from this mode of maintaining them. The report of 
almost every parish testifies that they have no hesitation of ap- 
plying to be placed on the poor's roll,— that they claim it as a 
right to which they are legally entitled, and of which they do 
not consider it disgraceful to take advantage, — and that the lof- 
ty feeling of independence, and the praiseworthy delicacy which 
used formerly to be the characteristics of the Scottish peasantry, 
and which shrunk from the idea of receiving parochial aid, have 
now in a great measure disappeared. One thing which has 
made this change more visible here than in other parts of the 
country is the proximity of this county to England, where it is 
well known that the poor are supported at a profuse and extra- 
vagant expense. Accordingly, the border counties are assessed 
at a higher rate than any other district. At the same time, it 
would be difficult to devise any more equitable or efficient method 
for the support of the poor, and which would fall so equally on 
proprietors, whether resident or not. And, as long as none but the 
aged and infirm are admitted on the roll, and the assessments are 
imposed by the proprietors themselves, or their factors, who have 
an interest in keeping them as low as possible, there appears to be 
no great danger of the poor rates ever arriving at such a formi- 
dable height as in England. Notwithstanding the disadvantages un- 
der which Berwickshire labours from its vicinity to England, and 
from the poor being infected with the extravagant notions of their 
southern neighbours on this subject, the average assessment for 
their support does not, it is thought, much exceed sixpence in the 
pound Sterling of rent, which is paid jointly in equal proportions 
by the proprietor and occupier, — a sum of a moderate amount 
when compared to what is paid in some of the adjoining parishes 
of Northumberland and North Durham, where it is not uncom- 



376 



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 



mon for the rates to reach so high as 3s. or 4s. in every pound 
Sterhng of rent. It ought also to be mentioned, that the cases of 
pauper lunatics, supported at asylums by their respective parishes, 
contribute greatly to augment the assessments, as, even in the most 
economical style, this cannot be done but at a considerable ex- 
pense. It may also be stated, as a fact of some importance, that 
there is scarcely an instance known of a pauper of this county wan- 
dering about as a mendicant soliciting charity; though the dis- 
trict is inundated with vagrants of this description, who come 
from those parts of Scotland which pride themselves in having 
no compulsory provision for the maintenance of the poor. Con- 
siderable sums are frequently expended, certainly not always very 
judiciously, by parishes on litigations in pauper cases. The en- 
couragement of friendly societies — a rigid examination into the 

merits of every apphcation for being admitted to the poors' roll 

a determined resistance to the principle of able-bodied persons re- 
ceiving parish aid — and the continuance of that moderate and spare 
pecuniary allowance common in Scotland, seem the best methods 
for keeping the poor rates low, and for preventing those pernici- 
ous effects which they have produced in England. It is to be hop- 
ed that the change lately introduced into the administration of the 
Enghsh poor laws may check their baneful and deleterious influ- 
V ence, retard the growing evil, and prevent the lower orders of this, 
and the other border counties from being assimilated in this re- 
spect to the peasantry of the south. 

Character and Habits of the People. — The general character 
of the population, as described in the parochial reports, differs 
in few respects from that of the inhabitants of the other agricul- 
tural districts of Scotland. Like other gentlemen of the same 
rank in Scotland, the landed proprietors are distinguished for their 
attachment to the civil and religious institutions of the country, 
for their zeal to promote the interests of agriculture and to ad- 
vance local improvements, for their attention to their tenantry, for 
their willing co-operation in extending the benefits of education 
and religion, and for their benevolence, to the poor. Those of 
'them who reside constantly upon their estates enjoy the respect and 
esteem of those among whom they live; and several of them, by car- 
rying on extensive improvements on their properties, take the best 
method of obtaining the favour of the lower classes, and at the same 
time of promoting their interests, by giving them employment. 
The tenantry of the county are a highly respectable body of men,

intelligent, active, and enterprising ; many of them persons of li- 
beral education, well acquainted with all the most improved pro- 
cesses of agriculture, and generally respected and beloved by their 
servants and dependents. Though the times are not favourable 
to them, yet most of them are cheerful and happy, and look for- 
ward under the divine blessing to more prosperous days. They 
commonly live on terms of intimate and friendly intercourse with 
their neighbours, possess sound religious and moral principles, at- 
tend regularly on divine ordinances, and are seldom deficient in 
their attention to the comforts and wants of their inferiors. 

Assailed by few temptations, and little subject to those debasing 
influences which produce such fearful effects, both moral and phy- 
sical, on an urbane populations the labouring classes are distin- 
guished for honesty, industry, and. contentment. Education and 
the ordinances of religion are within the reach of all, and are sel- 
dom neglected. Indeed, moral and religious habits are so blended 
and entwined with all their feelings and associations, that they 
seem in little danger of ever lapsing in any considerable degree 
from the characteristics which have been so long distinctive of our 
Scottish' peasantry. To every sincere loveY of his country it would 
be matter of deep regret, if any causes should produce a change to 
the worse in this valuable and interesting class of the community. 
Were there fewer public-houses, were toll-keepers prevented from 
selling ardent spirits, and were some measures adopted by Govern- 
ment for abolishing the temptation of smuggling whisky into Eng- 
land, all of which circumstances, as they now exist, tend to the 
demoralization of the lower orders, salutary and beneficial effects 
would follow. 

Owing to the contiguity of the sister kindgom, this county in the 
" olden times" must have been the theatre of many a lawless foray 
and hard fought encounter between the rival borderers. Every 
trace or memorial of such ages has now, however, disappeared from 
this part of the country; and even those traditions which in most 
parts of Scotland are so fondly cherished by the peasantry, and 
handed down from generation to generation with all but religious 
care, have vanished without leaving a trace behind. The pheno- 
menon is remarkable, and cannot easily be accounted for. The early 
period at which systematic agriculture commenced in this district, 
and the complete change in the habits of the people that in conse- 
quence ensued, is the only circumstance that seems adequately to 
account for the ftict. In the labours of active industry and the exer-
