PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. LAURENCE ADAMSON, D.D. FIRST MINISTER.  
THE REV. JOHN BIRRELL, A. M. SECOND MINISTER  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, c. — This parish consists of the two parishes 
of Cupar and St Michael of Tarvit, which were conjoined in the 
beginning of the seventeenth century, in 1618, — the boundary of 
separation betwixt them having been the small river of Eden, as it 
then flowed, f It is situated about the middle of the county or pe- 
ninsula of Fife, and is nearly equidistant, about 10 miles, from New- 
burgh, Ferry-Port-on- Craig, St Andrews, and Largo. It contains 
the town of Cupar, which was made a royal burgh, invested with 
extensive privileges and properties at an early period, and is de- 
scribed by Cambden as " Burgus insignis." Though divested now, 
by the liberality or prodigality of its rulers, of nearly all its extensive 
properties, as a burgh Cupar enjoys still the privileges that are al- 
lowed by the late Reform Act, and ranks as the county town of 
Fife.+ 

The parish is of a very irregular form, and is much indented 
by the parishes of Dairsie, Ceres, and Monimail. It measures 
from east to west nearly 5 miles, and about the same from north 
to south. Its surface is beautifully diversified by rising grounds, 
and intersected by the river Eden and the Lady Burn, or St Mary's 
Burn, which meet at an acute angle at the eastern extremity of the 
town. It is bounded on the north and east by Dairsie and Kem- 
back; on the south by Ceres; on the west by Cults and Monimail; 
and on the north by Moonzie and Kilmany. 

Meteoroloffi/.— The climate of this parish is mild and salubrious. 

 Drawn up by the Rev. John Birrell, second minister of the parish, 
it  few years ago straighted, a small portion of St Michael's is situat- 

cdto the north of the Eden, near the County-Hall. 

+ By the ancient charters to the town of Cupar, preserved in the Register Office 
in J-,amburgh, whereof an authentic duplicate is deposited with the town clerk, the 
magistrates possessed a much more extensive jurisdiction over the surrounding pa- 
rishes than what is now or has been for a long time exercised.

FIFESHIRE. 



Though the town of Cupar and the lower parts of the parish that 
lie along the banks of the Eden are liable to be enveloped in hoar 
frost at certain seasons, particularly in the spring and autunnn, yet 
the air is in general dry and exhilarating. As the town is situated 
little more than twenty-five feet above the level of the sea, the 
temperature and climate are warm and agreeable. In consequence of 
this, there seems to be no particular disease incident to the parish. 
And while there are some instances of extreme old age in it, — two 
or three persons upwards of 90 and one above 100,— there are 
many of an almost youthful vigour at the advanced period of three- 
score and ten and fourscore years. 

Hijdrography.—The small river of Eden, flows from Avest to 
east through the parish, as well as the strath to which it gives its 
name. It rises about sixteen miles west, near the north side of 
the West Lomond. It is joined, at the eastern extremity of the 
town, by the Lady Burn, which flows from north-west to south- 
east till the point of junction. The bed of the Eden is very 
level, in consequence of which it flows sluggishly lene fluit 
aquis. Though Cupar is six miles from the sea, at Edenmouth, 
the river has a fall of only twenty-five feet. It is not available, 
therefore, for the purposes of machinery to the extent that the vo- 
lume of water which it contains would justify, were its descent more 
rapid. Through the enterprise of modern times, however, neariy 
every fall has been seized upon and turned to account. And though 
there is not a wheel moved by it within the parish that has more 
than a breast-fall, yet there are several employed for the move- 
ment of powerful machinery. From entering the parish till leav- 
ing it, it is made available to the extent of eighty horse power. The 
course of the Lady Burn is more brisk and rapid; but the volume 
of water is in general so small, that, except by much damming up 
and savincr, it cannot be made to serve any other purpose than 
that of driving thrashing-mills. The junction of these two streams 
at the town gives to it a lively appearance, and contributes greatly to 
its cleanliness and healthfulness. There are many perennial springs 
in the parish. And at any place of the town, by sinking to the 
depth of 20 or 30 feet, an abundant supply of water can be pro- 
cured, fit for all domestic purposes except washing. 

Geology and Miner alogy.-m\[e the surface of the parish ,s 
diversified and undulating, the geological construction and the cha- 
racter of the minerals is also various. Along the banks of the 
Eden on either side, white sandstone abounds, lymg m strata ol

various degrees of compactness according to their depth, and dip- 
ping on both sides towards the south. Along the banks of the 
Lady Burn, a sandstone conglomerate prevails, consisting of large 
masses of quartz and other flinty ingredients, and resembling a 
coarse puddingstone. Surmounting this rock, and at irregular 
and undulating distances from the Lady Burn, there runs a very 
singular mound, composed when examined of fresh water gravel. 
Beginning at the distance of nearly a quarter of a mile from the 
point where the Eden and the Lady Burn meet, this mound runs 
in a serpentine direction, till it terminates, as it rises, abruptly, in 
what is now called the School, but anciently the Castle-hill. About 
the middle, there is a peak of greater elevation than the rest, which 
is called the Moot-hill, and on which, according to tradition, the 
Earls of Fife used to hold their councils of war, and dispense the 
awards of justice. Were one to look to appearance, or to listen to 
report without attending to the magnitude of this mound, he might 
conclude, as has been sometimes supposed, that it is artificial. But, 
looking to the size, this supposition is instantly checked. And ex- 
tending the view across from the Castle or School-hill to the op- 
posite side of the Eden, and remarking the same serpentine and 
mound-like appearance continuing, there is left no room to doubt 
that the mound is a natui-al deposit formed at some remote period, 
and broken through', as it now is, by the action of the Eden. 
Above this mound, and on the north and south sides of the Eden, 
there is an immense bed of clay of a very excellent quality, and 
peculiarly fitted for the making of brick and tiles, for which it has 
long been used. Recently, it has been employed for the making of 
coarse earthen-ware, and is found to answer well. Higher up, and 
behind this embankment, as it njust have been till it was worn 
away by the water, lie what are called the Wards, — an extensive 
and fertile plain, all now under the plough, but wearing decided 
marks of having been at one time under water, and forming the 
bottom of a large lake or basin, which has been emptied and laid 
dry by the wearing down of the embankment. The name of Fer- 
ry still attaches to some of the places on the sides of this plain ; and 
even at the period of the Reformation it was of such an impassable 
nature, that, while the royal forces lay on the hill or Garley Bank on 
the south side, and the Lords of the Congregation lay encamped 
on a moor on the opposite, this marsh formed a barrier of separa- 
tion betwixt them sufficiently strong to prevent them from advan- 
cing to or molesting each other.

Above the gravel and sandstone strata which lie along the banks 
of the Eden and Lady Burn, trap rock, greenstone, and clinkstone, 
abound and are quarried extensively. Neither coal nor lime are to 
be found in the parish, nor in any part of the Strath of the Eden or 
How of Fife, — although both of these valuable articles are in abun- 
dance, and of excellent quahty, about seven and ten miles to the 
south. 

The soil of the parish is very variable, from a light sandy soil to 
that of a strong and heavy clay. In general, however, it is good 
and fertile, and through the means of long cultivation, and from a 
full command of manure, it is highly improved, and produces the 
finest crops. 

ZoohgT/.— The rarer species of birds to be found in the parisn, 
are the jay, the golden crested -wren, the willow-wren, the water- 
hen, the water-ouzel, the kingfisher, the long- tailed titmouse, the 
goat-sucker.  

II. — Civil History. 
There is a good map of the parish lately executed and litho- 
graphed by John Govan, Esq. W. S. common agent for the heri- 
tors in adjusting the localities,— and which, though not scientifically 
correct, gives a good view of the conjoined parishes. There is also 
a good plan of the town in Wood's Burgh Atlas, pubhshed several 

years ago. . 

Antiquities.— The ancient Castle of Cupar stood on the termina- 
tion of the mound already described as running along the course of 
the Lady Burn. This is represented by Buchanan as a place of very 
considerable strength in the time of Edward Bahol. During the 
invasion of the English at that time, it was seized upon, and occu- 
pied by them till they were driven by famine to abandon it and re- 
turn across the Forth to their own country. Its position at the 
iunction of the Eden and Lady Burn favours the opinion that, at 
a time when these streams were not so well guarded within then- 
banks as they now are by artificial means, it must have been a for- 
tress of considerable strength, and in a rude state of warfare must 
have presented considerable resistance to an assading force. W hile 
workmen were employed some years ago in improving the ine ot 
road that runs to the east, several skeletons were found, which were 
conjectured to be those of the soldiers who had fallen while con-

ducting some assault upon this fortress. Now, however, there re- 
main no vestiges of the fortress. The hill has long been held as 
the property of the town, and occupied as the site of the schools 
and academy.. In the times of Sir David Lindsay of the Mount, it 
is said to have been used as the play-field for the exhibition and the 
acting of his dramatic pieces. The name of Castle-hill has now pas- 
sed into the more peaceful name of School-hill, and the plays ex- 
hibited daily, are those of youths when just " let loose from school." 

Under this hill, on the south, stood a convent of Dominican or 
Blackfriars, belonging originally to the Island of May, and after- 
wards transferred to St Andrews, which, like its more warlike neigh- 
bour, has now been completely removed. That part of the chapel 
" built of cut freestone," which at the writing of the last Account 
is said to have been standing, has been taken away to make room 
for a very handsome street. Near or on the very site of the cha- 
pel of the convent, stands now the Episcopal chapel, St James's, 
which is a very handsome building, meant to form part of the street 
when completed. And lately, when the grounds of the convent were 
trenched, to answer the purposes of a kitchen-garden, many re- 
ceptacles of the dead were disturbed, and their skeletons dug up. 

Another striking remembrancer of the olden times is a small co- 
nical eminence on the opposite side of the Eden, and lying a little 
further down the river than the School-hill. This, which, at the 
time of the last Account, was under cultivation, is now covered 
with a young thriving plantation belonging to the proprietor of 
Tarvit. It was the site of the church of the parish of St Michael, 
and formed the burying-ground of that parish. A few years ago, 
when an alteration was making upon the public roads, many of the 
depositaries of the dead were broken open, and the remains of their 
mmates brought to view after a repose of at least two centuries. 
This receptacle of the dead has thus been again converted into 
common earth. In the same manner, has the burial-ground of the 
parish of Cupar, which lay at a remoter period at a distance of fully 
a mile to the north-west of the town, and ofthe present burial- 
ground, where the church also stood, been converted again into 
common earth, and scarcely does a vestige remain to shew where 
It was. At the time of the last Account, it formed part of what was 
called the glebe of the first minister of the parish. An excambion 
has since been made to accommodate the proprietor of Springfield, 
in whose policy it lies. With the exception of its being a'' little 
more elevated than the surrounding field, nothing remains to tell

the passing stranger that the dead lie there. To shew, however, 
the effect of prejudice upon the niind, it may be noticed, that there 
are still individuals to be found who have an unwillingness to pass 

the spot under night. 

The present burial-ground having been set apart and conse- 
crated in 1415, when the church was removed from its former si- 
tuation, and built nearer the town, can boast of few ancient monu- 
ments. One of the most ancient is that erected to the memory ot 
Mr William Scott, who was for many years first minister of Cupar, 
and who built the spire of the steeple at his own expense, and ac- 
cording to his own design. This monument shews the burial-place 
of the ministers of the parish. But, in consequence of the action 
of the weather upon the stones of which it is composed, the inscrip- 
tion is completely obliterated. It is said to have been executed in 
Holland, and erected by tFe relatives of Mr Scott, who belonged 
to the family of Balwearie, shortly after his death, and must have 
been thought a work of taste in that time. As there is none to 
take an interest in its repair, it bids fair to go soon into com- 
plete decay. There is also a monument erected to the memory 
of some of those who suffered for conscience sake in the times of 

"theal end of the outside of the present church there is a 
niche shewing where St James's altar once stood. Withm te 
lurch in th western wall, lies a full length statue of Sir John 
Arnot of Fernie, who fell in the last crusade. And in the same ..11

Edenwood, and Sir John, the present Attorney- General. 

The ancient cross of Cupar still stands, and is seen from a great 
distance on the top of the hill of Wemyss Hall. It was carried up 
and placed there by the late Colonel Wemyss, father of the pre- 
sent proprietor of Wemyss Hall, when it had been removed from 
its original position to make way for the improvements that were 
making upon the streets. It is a straight round column surmount- 
ed by the town arms, and placed now upon a strong pedestal, com- 
posed of the rock of the hill on which it stands. 

Porochial Records. — The records of the kirk-session reach back 
to the year 1648. The minutes of session contain many curious 
and interesting views of the character and manners of the times. 
Excepting a chasm from 1661-1695, they are complete. The re- 
gisters of baptisms, deaths, and marriages, reach back to 1654, 
and are brought down regularly, and without interruption, to the 
present time. 

Modei-n Buildings, c. — The modern buildings of the town are, 
the Town and County Halls, and an Episcopal chapel, standing 
in the New Street, otherwise called St Catherine Street, and form- 
ing part of it. Also, a town and county jail, standing on the op- 
posite side of the Eden from the town, but built in the style of 
the New Street, and according to a plan by which it was to orna- 
ment that street. Its present site, however, and the plan on 
which it is built, do not correspond. None of the modern build- 
ings can boast of much elegance. The County Buildings, when 
the plan by which they are now being enlarged shall have been 
completed, will be very spacious, and afford such accommodation 
for the county meetings, and the meetings of the Sheriff-courts, 
and Justice of Peace Courts, and also for the keeping of the pub- 
lic records, &amp;c. of the county, as will reflect great credit upon the 
county. In the County Hall, there are two very elegant portraits 
lately procured by the county. One of these is a portrait of the 
late General John Earl of Hopetoun, by Raeburn. The other is 
that of Thomas Earl of Kellie, Lord Lieutenant of Fife, by Wil- 
kie. They were procured by the gentlemen of the county in tes- 
timony of the high respect in which they held these noblemen, and 
in return for the high services which they rendered, by their atten- 
tion to the business of the county. 

The most ancient mansion-houses in the parish are those of 
Carslogie and Wemyss Hall. The former was built upwards of four 



8 FIFESHIRE. 

hundred years ago ; and, having long served as the family seat of the 
Clephanes, has now passed by purchase into the hands of the Rev. 
Mr Laing, who resides at his living in Northumberland. The 
latter, according to Sibbald, was newly built in the beginning of 
last century, and has been lately enlarged by the present proprie- 
tor, James Wemyss, Esq. of Winthank. The famous iron hand 
of the Clephanes is said to be still in preservation, and in the pos- 
session of the heirs of the family. There is said, also, to be a 
charter, granted to the family by Malcolm Canmore, in the posses- 
sion of the heirs of the family. 

The modern mansion-house of Kilmaron, the country seat of 
James Cheyne, Esq. Edinburgh, built in the castellated form, 
according to a plan by Gillespie, is the only house that lays clami 
to any degree of magnificence. The other houses are plam, and 
suited to the modest and unpretending requirements of the pro- 
prietors. They are, the house of Tarvit, the property and fa- 
mily residence of James Home Rigg, Esq. of Downfield; Sprmg- 
field, that of Colonel Don, E. I. C. S. ; Dalyell, that of John Dal- 
yeW Esq. of Lingo; Hilton, that of William Tod, Esq. ; Cairme 
Lodge, that of General Foulis, C. B., E. L C. S. ; Pitblado, that 
of George Russell, Esq. ; Prestonhall, that of R. Swan, Esq; Mid- 
dlefield, that of John Russell, Esq. ; Foxton, that of Andrew 
West Esq. ; Balas, that of Alexander Bogie, Esq. ; Ferrybank, 
that of Colonel Craigie, E. L C. S. ; Bellfield, that of Captam 
MoncrieffofBalcurvie; Blalowne, that of John Govan, Esq. W.fe.; 
and Westfield, that of Mr Walker of Pittencrieff. 

in. — Population. 
When the parishes of Cupar and St Michael were united m 
1617, the population of the two did not much exceed 1000. Smce 
that period it has continued to increase gradually and progres- 
sively. 

Population in 1801, - 4463 
 1811, - 47o8 

1821, - 5892 
1831, - 6473 

One mode of accounting for this gradual increase is the disposi- 
tion, engendered in some measure by necessity, on the part of the la- 
bou ing classes, to repair.to towns when old age and mfirmity ren- 
der thfm unfit for the labours of the field. Another x«ode of ac-

to be remarked, too, that the increase has taken place principally 
in the town of Cupar, and in the two villages of Springfield and 
Glaidney Cotton, — the one on the western, and the other on the 
southern extremity of the parish. In the landward part of the 
parish, the population has diminished rather than increased.

It is impossible to give any accurate average of the births in the 
parish, as the dissenters of all kinds are in the practice of declin- 
ing to register their children in the parish register. The funerals 
that take place in the parish amount to about 149 annually. Of 
these, some are brought from adjoining parishes ; while many of 
those that die in the parish are carried out of it for burial. The 
number of marriages, or at least of proclamations for marriage, 
amounts to 56 or thereby. 

Land-owners. — The parish can boast of no nobility resident in 
it, and none connected with it except the Earl of Glasgow, who, as 
heir to the Crawford estates, ranks as an heritor. There are, how- 
ever, residing in it 14 families of independent fortune. All these 
are landed proprietors, and with an yearly income from their land 
of L. 50 and upwards. 

There is nothing peculiar in the strength, size, complexion, or 
other personal qualities of the inhabitants. There are only two 
cases of confirmed derangement in the parish. Of late, the at- 
tention of the public to any instance of temporary derangement 
has been particularly favourable to their speedy recovery. By 
sending the patients, or, if paupers, by applying to have them sent, 
immediately to the very excellent and well-conducted asylum at 
Dundee, the effect has been truly gratifying. Of five or six that 
have been sent within these ten years, all have been restored, af- 
ter one or two quarters' confinement, perfectly cured. There are 
four or five fatuous cases in the parish ; one of blindness, occa- 
sioned by accident ; none deaf and dumb. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The state of agriculture in this parish is the most 
approved. The number of acres is 5545, imperial measure. Where 
every acre is arable, and either under the plough or covered with 
plantations in various stages of advancement, every spot wears theap-

pearance of the highest cultivation. As a great many of the farms 
are in the natural possession of the proprietors, and either ma- 
naged by themselves or by skilful and experienced overseers, it 
may be said, that nothing remains to be done in the way of im- 
provement. There are no wastes to be reclaimed, no commons to 
be divided, and no marshes to be drained. 

Eental, Sfc. — The total valued rent of the parish is L. 7237, 15s. 
7d. Scots. Of this, L. 1912 Scots is assumed by the burgh as the 
value of the burgh lands, and other property in the town ; and in 
this they allow themselves to be liable for repairs of church and 
manse. This sum, however, holds no place in the cess books of 
the county. The real rental, as taken in 1829 for a process of 
augmentation before the Teind Court, was L. 9977, lis. 9d. Ster- 
ling. This rental was subsequently examined and generally ac- 
quiesced in by all concerned, as a fair rule for laying on the cho- 
lera assessment in 1832. This, therefore, may be taken as the 
actual rental of the whole parish ; and if the number of acres is 
taken to be 5545, imperial measure, we have the average rental 
per acre to be L. 1, 15s. llfd. This includes what is under wood. 
Making a deduction for what is under wood and inarable, perhaps 
L. 2, 10s. per acre for what is under cultivation is as near an ap- 
proximation to the truth as any that can be found. According to 
its quality, or its distance from the town, the land varies from L. 5 
to L. 1, 10s. Some small spots have let within these seven years 
as high as L. 7. 

The average rent of grazing during the year, may be set down 
at L. 6, 6s. per ox, and L. 1, 5s. per ewe or full-grown sheep. 
The rate of a mason's labour is 2s. 6d. and that of a carpenter's 

2s. 3d. a day. . 

Live-Stock.— The common breeds of oxen are the ancient lite 
breeds, which have gained the prizes at all the great cattle-shows 
in Scotland, and so excel other breeds, that the Highland Socie- 
ty have doubts about allowing them to enter for competition. Some 
specimens of the Teeswater breed have been introduced, and do 
very well ; but there seems to be a partiahty for the old stock rather 
than for the new. And this arises from the impression that the for- 
mer are more hardy, equally profitable for feeding for the butcher, 
and more useful for all the purposes of the dairy. As sheep are 
little attended to except by those who feed their own mutton, no- 
thing can be said of this kind of stock. 

Husbandry.— The mode of husbandry in the parish is much 



CUPAR. 



11 



the same as what prevails over the county. It is the five or six 
year's rotation, and as the soil is suitable both for wheat and tur- 
nips, the most luxuriant and productive crops are everywhere to 
be found. The general duration of leases is nineteen years, with 
entry at Martinmas. The farm-buildings are neat and commodi- 
ous, and suitable to the requirements of farms where all is under 
the plough. 

Qiiarries. — There are four quarries in the parish of excellent 
white sandstone, and two of greenstone fit for road metal and coarse 
kinds of building. 

Produce. — It seems quite impossible to state the gross amount 
of agricultural produce. The number of heritors liable to pay 
stipend, or rather the number of small properties in the hands of 
heritors so liable, amounts to 172. Any attempt at determining 
the gross produce, could lead to nothing but a distant approxima- 
tion to the truth. It is no uncommon thing, however, to find land 
yielding 3 quarters of wheat, 6 do. of barley, 5 do. of oats per acre. 
Of potatoes, of which a great many are grown to be shipped for the 
London market, it is not very uncommon to find 50 or 60 bolls of 28 
stones on the acre. Fifty bolls an acre, however, may be taken as 
an average crop of this valuable root. 

Manufactures. — There are three spinning-mills in the parish, 
one of which is driven entirely by water, another partly by water 
and partly by steam, and a third altogether by steam. Of these 
the first two are occupied in spinning flax, and the last in making 
thread. The number of hands employed in the three amounts to 
236. Besides these there are two corn and barley mills, and two 
flour mills, all well employed. The corn, barley, and flour mills 
at Cupar, especially since they were feued by the burgh of Cupar 
to the late John Inglis, Esq. of Colluthie, have been celebrated 
as the best in Fife ; and have been employed by bakers and meal- 
dealers from a great distance. There is a snuff"-mill, to which to- 
bacco is sent to be manufactured, not only from all parts of Fife, 
but also from the counties to the north. It is said that about 
60,000 lbs. of snuff are manufactured there every year. And 
whether it is owing to the greater consumption of that article, or 
to the growing celebrity of the mill, it has been found necessary of 
late to increase the power of the mill, and to add a steam power 
to that of the water, by which it was formerly driven. There is 
also a washing or fulling mill. There are two tan -works j one for 
hides and another for sheep skins. To this latter a manufacture 



12 



FIFESHIRE. 



of glue has been added within these few years. There are three 
breweries ; a brick and tile-work, at which coarse earthen-ware is 
made ; and a rope-work. 

Though there are no linen manufactures upon a united scheme, 
and no power looms, yet the manufacture of linen is carried on to 
a considerable extent, and the number of weavers and others em- 
ployed is great. There are at least ten distinct manufacturers with 
their capitals embarked in the linen trade. By these different ma- 
nufacturers, there are employed within the parish not less than 600 
weavers. And as every two weavers require one person to wind 
for them, the number employed and earning a comfortable subsist- 
ence from this trade may be reckoned at 900, all living in their 
own houses, and labouring in their own workshops. Besides those 
that are employed within the parish, the different manufacturers 
have weavers employed in the various towns and villages in the 
neighbourhood throughout the county. The linen manufactured 
is of various kinds and qualities, and is exported to the East and 
West Indies, as well as to all parts of the continent of Europe and 
of America. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets.— Cu3ir has long been known as a leading and import- 
ant market-town. Besides the weekly corn-market, which is held 
every Thursday, there are a great many fairs for the sale of all 
kinds of stock, and domestic and agricultural utensils of all sorts. 
Till within these few years, these fairs took place on particular 
days of the month, and thus occasioned great confusion. Now, by 
an arrangement that has been generally approved of, they are held 
on the Thursday next to the day of the month on which they used 
to be held. Besides being a market-town, Cupar is also a post- 
town. And lying on the great road that leads from Edinburgh to 
Dundee and the north of Scotland, through Fife, there are three 
coaches that regularly pass through it every day except Sunday, to 
the north and to the south. There are also coaches to St An- 
drews and to Largo, where there is now a steam-boat ferry to New- 
haven. So that, with all the conveniences of excellent markets, 
the inhabitants of the town and parish can boast of as many advan- 
tages as are possessed in any town or parish of its size in the kmg- 
dom. The town of Cupar, along with St Andrews and CraiU, the 
two Anstruthers, Kilrenny and Pittenweem, send a member to Par- 

'7cdesiastical State.-The parish church is situated as nearly as

may be in the middle of the parish. It is a large and commodi- 
ous, though by no means an elegant building, according to the no- 
tions of elegance that are now entertained. It was built in 1785, 
and is in the plain and unattractive style of that period. It was 
originally built to accommodate 1196; but, by some slight altera- 
tions since made, it accommodates now 1300 sitters. This, how- 
ever, is far from being sufficient for a population of 6473. And 
did the law not define the extent of the accommodation that pa- 
rishes should have, it might be enough, to show the inadequacy of 
the accommodation in this instance, to mention that, in July 1835, 
the number of those that communicated at the dispensation of the 
Lord's supper was 1237. Another building of the same dimen- 
sions as the present would not furnish the requisite accommodation. 
To obviate the evils arising from this want, an apphcation was 
made by the kirk-session to the heritors two years ago to hire the 
Mason's Hall, for the benefit of those who could not ha provided 
with seats in the church. This they very readily did, and service 
is now performed in it by the collegiate ministers every Sabbath, 
to a congregation of not less than 300. The sittings in this place 
of temporary accommodation are all free. The sittings of the 
church are all occupied, and, with the exception of about 150, 
which are free, are all either let at a small rent, or are in the na- 
tural possession of the proprietors and their tenants. To get a 
permanent remedy for the want of accommodation, a subscription 
was entered into last year by a number of spirited and well-affect- 
ed individuals, among whom were almost all the heritors, to build 
another church in a convenient part of the town. The subscrip- 
tions were nearly completed. An application was made to the 
Presbytery to sanction the erection of the building, according to 
the conditions proposed by the subscribers. The Presbytery ap- 
proved and granted the apphcation. But an application made' to 
the General Assembly of 1835, to sanction the whole proceedings, 
was met by an injunction from that venerable court, which paralyz- 
ed all the proceedings of the subscribers and of the Presbytery ; 
and whether the building will now go on is very questionable. It 
IS very much wanted. It was anxiously wished for, by the church- 
going people of the parish. And without it, the population of the 
parish, as they are daily increasing, must either go off, against their 
wdl, as they have hitherto done in many instances, to the dissen- 
ters, or they must sink, as in many other large towns, into a state 
of heathenism, and show all the evils of spiritual darkness in the

midst of the very light in which the people of this country have so 
long rejoiced. 

Though there were originally two parishes in this locality, there 
is only a piece of land of about three acres got in exchange for the 
old kirk-yard, and which goes under the name of glebe for the first 
minister, belonging to the living. Till the decision of the House 
of Lords in the case of Ayr, there was not even one manse. Suice 
that decision, a manse has been built for the first minister. The 
second minister, though his stipend is paid out of the teinds, has 
neither manse nor glebe. 

Since the last Account was written, the number of dissentmg 
chapels has very much increased, in consequence, no doubt, of the 
increase of the population, added to the want of accommodation 
in the parish church. There is an Episcopalian chapel ; two cha- 
pels belonging to the Relief connection ; one to the Associate Sy- 
nod; one to the Old Light Burghers, or Original Seceders; one to 
the Baptists, and one to the Glassites. Till the late voluntary move- 
ments began in the country, the different dissenting bodies stood 
well affected to the church ; and, while they retained their own 
particular tenets, lived in a kindly understanding with the church. 
The mass of the people are still well affected as before, and show 
a disposition to go hand in hand with the church in all those mat- 
ters which tend to promote peace and good feeling. The exact 
number of Dissenters and Seceders in the parish, it has been found 
impracticable to ascertain. n-i j 

Divine service is, in general, well attended in the Established 
Church, and also in the dissenting chapels. The average number 
of communicants in the church is 1237. The stipends of the Es- 
tablished ministers are 1 8 chalders each, half meal half barley, with 
L. 10 each for communion elements. The stipends allowed by 
their people to the dissenting ministers are from L. 80 to L. 120 
per annum. 

There is a Bible Society and a Missionary Society in the pa- 
rish, but supported by contributors from adjoining parishes. Their 
contributions are not great, and not on the increase. The Bible 
Society suffered by the Apocryphal controversy a few years ago ; 
and the Missionary Society is suffering now by the voluntary dis- 
turbances, and by the misunderstanding that these have produced 
betwixt churchmen and dissenters, 

Education.- There is not, and, strictly speaking, never has been, 



CUPAR.

a parochial school in the parish. Up till the year 1823, there were 
two burgh schools, which were under the sole patronage and direction 
of the magistrates, — the masters' salaries being paid out of the funds 
of the burgh. In 1823, a subscription was entered into, to have an 
academy erected according to the approved model of modern times. 
An arrangement was made betwixt the magistrates and the sub- 
scribers, by which the former merged their rights of patronage and 
direction, and agreed to be represented at the meetings of the 
subscribers or patrons of the academy, by certain members of their 
own body. They agreed, also, to pay a certain proportion of the 
teachers' salaries along with the patrons, and to grant the use of 
the buildings belonging to them as a corporation, for the academy. 
This arrangement still subsists. By the munificence of the late 
Dr Bell, the estate of Egmore in Galloway has been left under 
trustees, consisting of the Lord Lieutenant of the county, the Lord 
Justice- Clerk, the Sheriff of the county, the Provost, the Dean 
of Guild, and the two parochial ministers of Cupar, to be manag- 
ed for the purpose of forwarding the interests of education accord- 
ing to the Madras system. By special stipulation, Dr Bell wishes 
his institution to be amalgamated, under certain conditions, with 
the academy as already existing. Hitherto the arrangements have 
not been completed. The burgh have it in their power to make 
arrangements which may free them and the community from a great 
expense, and to secure for them a great advantage under this trust. 
But whether they will see their interests, remains to be proved 
In the meantime, the business of education is conducted by Dr 
Bell's Trustees, in concert with the patrons of the academy. In 
the academy, there are three departments of teaching : English 
m all its branches; the languages, ancient and modern, with geo- 
graphy; arithmetic in all its branches and writing. The salaries 
of the masters are good, and the school-fees small; but, as there 
IS nothmg as yet permanently fixed, and as Dr Bell's Trustees are 
burdened in the meantime with the payment of several annuities 
and are therefore not yet come to the use of those funds which mav 
enable them fully to develope their plans, it is premature to be 
more particular at present. The community are fully alive to the 
benefits of education. Dr Bell's trustees are required to be libe- 
lal. Ihe result, consequently, must in time be highly salutary 

Besides the academy, Dr Bell's trustees have opened three 
schools in the town, for the benefit of the industrious classes, at 
which education is to be had at the most moderate rates ; and in 



1J FIFESHIllE. 

cases wliere the parents are not able to pay these rates, it is to be 
had, as Dr Bell stipulates, upon making proper application, for 
nothing. 

There are, in addition to all this, four female schools, and one 
promiscuous school, in the town. Of the female schools, one is un- 
der the patronage of the magistrates and mmisters, as trustees of a 
fund of L. 500, left by the late Dr Gray of Paddmgton Green, Lon- 
don. And at Springfield, on the property of David Maitland M'G.ll, 
Esq of Rankeillor, there has been erected, and also endowed by him, 
a very handsome school for the benefit of that portion of the parish. 
Under these circumstances, there is not a child in the parish of five 
Years of age and upwards, but is able to read, or is at school ac- 
quiring that power. And, with the attention that is paid to reli- 
gious instruction in the different schools, there is reason to believe, 
that, as the people have hitherto improved in their conduct, and 
morals, and religious character, through the facility of acquiring 
education,-so, through the blessing of God, they will continue to 

"Litelature.— There is one pubhc library in the parish, founded in 
the year 1797, and which has increased gradually till now it contains 
upwards of 4000 volumes. Dr Gray also bequeathed his library to 
the subscribers, which contains many scarce and curious books Its 
only regular source of increase is the annual subscriptions of the 
proprietors. There are two public reading-rooms, one frequented 
by the better classes, the other by the mechanics. There are five 
stationers' shops in the town. There are now two printing-presses. 
One of these, under the management of the late Mr Robert Tullis, 
had the creditof having sent out Hunter's immaculate editions of the 
classics And there are two newspapers published weekly ;— one 
at the office of Mr Tullis, who was the first to publish a newspaper 
in Cupar, many years ago ;-another at the office of the tifeshire 

Journal, recently set up. 

Charitable Institutions. -There is an alms-house, with a yaid at- 
tached, containing. 82 falls 9 ells Scotch measure. This is sup- 
posed to have been set apart for the benefit of the poor of the pa- 
rish, about the time that the church was removed from its former 
site and placed where it now is in 1415. There is no exact trace of 
its original. It is in the management of the kirk-session, and, so far 
as their records go back,-to the year 1648,-it is found that it 
was under the same management as it is at present, kept in repair 
Ty the session, disposed of by the session for the accommodation

of their poor, and treated in all respects as if it were their sole and 
inalienable property. The house contains accommodation for ten 
or twelve paupers, living two together in the same apartment. And 
the yard is let every year for the behoof of the session. As there 
is a great want of room for burying in the present churchyard, the 
session have resolved to feu or let out the yards for burying-ground 
according to a plan which will reflect credit upon the place. 

In addition to this place of accommodation for the poor, which is 
of very ancient standing, the late David Knox, Esq. of London, who 
was a native of Cupar, has left the sum of L. 3000 Sterling, for the 
purpose of building and endowing an asylum for females above fifty 
years of age, who have seen better days. It is judiciously to be 
placed under trustees not officially connected with the town, and, 
according to the conditions expressed in Mr Knox's will, it pro- 
mises to be of great benefit. The plan of the building has been 
already drawn out by an eminent architect in London, the site has 
been fixed upon, and, through the active benevolence of the testa- 
tor's sister. Miss Knox, the institution will, in all probabihty, be 
completed and occupied in the course of the present year. 

The trades' corporations were formerly the only friendly socie- 
ties that existed. Their funds, however, being now all squander- 
ed away, except those of the weaver trade, who have a piece of 
ground which they are feuing out for building, they contribute very 
little, if any thing at all, to their decayed members; and it is no un- 
common thing to find one who once plumed himself on the honour 
of some civic office, either becoming himself, or allowing his widow 
to become, a burden upon the funds of the session. 

Savings Bank. — There is a savings bank ; but from the very low 
rate of interest which is allowed upon the money deposited in it, it 
meets with but little support. The deposits altogether do not ex- 
ceed L. 150. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The parish of Cupar presents still 
an engaging specimen of the working of the poor laws of Scotland. 
Great as the population is, there is no such thing as any regular 
assessment for the poor. They are supported, therefore, by the 
collections at the doors of the Established Church,— by a poors' 
box carried through the town on Saturdays, — by the dues upon 
marriages and births, — by the exertions of a female society for the 
benefit of aged and decayed females,— by a fund of L. 450, left 
under the management of the town by the late Dr Gray already men- 
tioned, — and by voluntary charity, exercised by private individuals

and families towards the well-deserving of their poorer neighbours. 
Twice during the last ten years, the heritors of the parish have 
been called upon to subscribe a sum in aid of the funds of the 
session, and at each of these times have subscribed L. 100, ac- 
cording to their valued rent. Altogether, the sums distributed 
by the kirk-session from church collections and poors' box among 
the poor upon their roll amount yearly to L. 326, 9s. 0\d. or there- 
by They make no distinction between the members of the church 
and dissenters, even though the latter do not contribute to their 
funds, and they allow to each pauper a sixpence or a shilling, or 
sometimes more, a week, according to their circumstances, making 
their distributions, in as far as they can, auxihary to the industrious 
exertions of the individuals. The female society distributes about 
L. 35 annually, and the magistrates out of Gray's fund distribute 
L. 18 annually. 

The number of the poor upon the roll of the session who re- 
ceive a weekly allowance is 61. The number of those who re- 
ceive occasionally is 68. Those that receive from the female so- 
ciety amount to 30 females; and those that receive from Gray s 
fund to 16 males and females. As many of those that receive 
from one fund receive also from another, the number of poor alto- 
gether may be rated as amounting to 150, and the total sum dis- 
tributed among them, as amounting to L.379, 9s. Od. The amount 
raised by church collections is L.261, 9s. Ojd.; by the poors box 
L 65 As the kirk-session do not hold themselves liable for house 
rents,' these are often raised by private application made by the needy 
themselves for subscription ; and there is generally a distribution of 
coals during the winter, procured by subscriptions or donations. 
Upon the whole, it may be said that they are well provided for. 
Tey are at the same time contented and industrious, and grate- 
ful _Yery different from what the poor are found to be in parishes 
where the system of assessment is followed. Several cases have oc- 
curred of individuals refusing to take parochial aid, even when offer- 
ed and pressed upon them. And some have occurred, of individuals 
declinina- the allowance which has been for a time made to them, 
after the°y found themselves so improved in their circumstances as 

to be able to do without it. , /. ,  

Prison.— There is a prison in the parish for the use of the town 
and county. The number of prisoners confined in it last year was 
37. Of these, 15 were for debt, and 22 for stealing, assault, and 
such crimes as commonly occur in a populous country. The com- 



CUPAR. 19 

mitments before trial were 91. The prison is sufficiently secure, 
having been built upon the most secure plan within the last thirty 
years ; but the accommodation that it affords is uniformly con- 
demned as most unworthy of the town and county. The lodging 
is bad, and reckoned unhealthy, — there is no room for the classifica- 
tion of criminals, — there is no chapel or place of worship attach- 
ed ; and consequently, any attempt to reclaim or improve those 
that are once committed to it, becomes absolutely hopeless. The 
most unpractised being lodged in the same cells with the most 
hardened ; instead of a penitentiary, the prison may be said to be 
actually a school for confirming the one and ruining the other. 
Though the government and superintendence by a jailor acting 
under the Sheriff of the county and the Magistrates of the burgh 
be good, yet the construction and the defective accommodation 
destroy all their endeavours to soften or to reclaim its unhappy in- 
mates. 

Fairs. — These are numerous, as already stated. 

Inns. — Inns and alehouses within the burgh amount to 49; the 
number of alehouses in the country part of the parish amount to 
4, — making a total of 53, besides several licenses granted to deal- 
ers in spirits, who do not keep public-houses. 

Fuel. — The fuel uniformly used is coal, which is to be had in 
great abundance from the southern and western parts of the county. 
The distance being six or ten miles, it is, however, not remarkably 
cheap. A railway would be of great service to the town, in furnish- 
ing the means of having this very essential necessary brought and 
laid down at a more reasonable rate. And as it is now in contem- 
plation to open a railway through Fife, it is to be li oped that the 
public will soon have the benefit. Cupar being nearly in the direct 
line of communication between Edinburgh and Dundee, it is hoped 
that the Royal Mail will be established to run by Cupar as soon as 
some water piers are formed on each side of the Frith of Forth, and 
which are now in contemplation. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
When Buchanan wrote his history, he described St Andrews 
as " Fanum Andrete oppidulum memorabile propter bonarum ar- 
tium studia," and Cupar as the town or oppidulum " quo reliquis 
Fifani ad jus accipiendum conveniunt." The characters thus given 
to these towns they still retain. St Andrews is still the seat of 
learning; and, the local courts, and the public records of the county

of the county, and there are no less than 28 procurators before 
the Sheriff-courts, who reside and carry on a respectable busi- 
ness, and hold a respectable rank in the town. Since the last Ac- 
count, the number of these procurators has increased from 12 
to 28. Allowing to each of them 2 apprentices or clerks, there 
are no less than 84, all busied in directing the course of justice 
Since the time of the last Account, a Sheriff-court has been esta- 
bhshed at Dunfermline for the western district. 

The principal change that has taken place in the town since 
the last account is the removal of the jail, and the town and 
county halls, so as to open up the streets and improve the thorough- 
fares. The consequence is, that Cupar wears now the appear- 
ance of a clean and comfortable English town. Being lighted 
up with gas, during the night it has a very attractive appearance. 
Its dimensions have been much extended by the suburbs called the 
Brae-heads, New Town, and Lebanon. 

The principal change that has taken place in the parish is the 
improvement of the cross roads, which are now, with few exceptions, 
kept like turnpikes. The villages of Springfield and Glaidney 
have also been much extended since last Account, and are still in- 
creasing. There have been three handsome stone bridges thrown 
over the Eden to increase the communication betwixt the north and 
south sides. And should the railway that is now talked of be car- 
ried through, it seems impossible to conceive the advantages that 
would accrue to the town of Cupar and the neighbourhood. The 
people are much the same in character as they were forty years ago, 
—greatly influenced by politics, and very excitable, but upon the 
whole far more temperate and reasonable than in many other places.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JOHN MACFARLANE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
BouJidaries — Extent. — This parish is bounded on the north by 
Abdie; on the south, by Kettle; on the east, by Monimail; and 
on the west, by Auchtermuchty. The village is easily accessible 
from any quarter, being near the place where the two roads cross 
each other by which the parish is intersected, — the one leading 
from Newburgh to Kirkaldy ; the other from Cupar to Kinross. 
The points of the parish most distant from each other, and which 
are between north-west and south-east, include a space of eight 
miles. The average breadth of the parish is about four miles. 
, Name. — Collessie has always been the name of this parish. Al- 
though, from a few relics of antiquity that have been found in the 
neighbourhood, but principally, I believe, from the resemblance 
between the word and the Roman Colosseum, a classic origin has 
been claimed for it, it may with more truth be referred to a Gae- 
lic source. The name is a compound Gaelic word, signifying, the 
bottom of a glen. This derivation is corroborated by the fact, that 
it is exactly descriptive of the situation of the village which has given 
name to the whole parish. 

Soil, c. — There is great variety in the quality of the soil. The 
northern and north-west parts of the parish are by far the most fertile. 
In these districts, there is a good deep sharp soil, principally upon 
a whinstone bottom. From the position of the ground, too, situat- 
ed upon the sloping sides of the hills that form the northern 
boundary of the parish, it has a good southern exposure ; and, be- 
mg in a high state of cultivation, it produces early and excellent 
crops. The eight farms of Hall-hill, Collessie-mill, Corn-hill, 
Meadow-wells, Cold-wells, Weddersbie, Wester Rossie, and Lum- 
quhat, including in all about 1560 Scotch acres, present from the 
road to Auchtermuchty an appearance of considerable natural 
beauty, and great agricultural skill and industry. Although this 



22 



FIFESHIRE. 



may be described as the best part of the parish as to depth and fer- 
tiUty of soil, there are some fields of good ground both for tillage and 
pasturage, besides what have been mentioned, upon the properties 
of Rossie and Kinloch. Upon the estates of Rankeilour, Ramor- 
nie, and Pitlair, too, as well as belonging to the farms of Drumten- 
nant upon the banks of the Eden, and the Bowhouse and Shields 
of Lathrisk in the eastern and southern districts, there are some 
parts scarcely inferior in soil and cultivation. 

Towards the centre and southern district of the parish, however, 
the soil for the most part becomes light and sandy. It is occupied 
to the extent of some miles by fir plantations. Much of the ground 
here does not seem capable of being turned to better account. 
Some recent attempts, at least, to clear and cultivate it have prov- 
ed unsuccessful. The wood, however, is of considerable value. 
Besides the country purposes to which it is applicable in fencmg, 
and even roofing and flooring, large quantities of it are shipped 
from the port of Newburgh to Newcastle and other parts of Eng- 
land for planks and coal-props. When full grown it may bring 
from L. 40 to L. 50 ; when cut down at half-growth, it may be 
worth at the rate of about L. 20 per Scotch acre. 

The climate, which, in consequence of extensive draining and 
enclosure, and an advancing state of cultivation, has of late years 
been greatly improved, is dry and healthful. There are no dis- 
tempers or epidemics peculiar to the parish. Many instances of 
great acre having been attained by the parishioners might be ad- 
duced fn evidence of the salubrity of our atmosphere. There is 
at present an elder in the parish, who is in church every Sabbath, 
and who was born in the year 1745. Cases of no remote date are 
upon record, of parishioners having lived above a hundred years. 

HtjdroffrapJnj.-Smce the draining of Rossie Loch, which was 
partially done in 1740, and more perfectly accomplished at a sub- 
sequent period, there is no lake worthy of notice in the parish. 
That was once, indeed, the largest sheet of water in the county, 
abounding in perch and pike. There are several rivulets that di- 
versify and enliven the landscape; among which, one of the most 
considerable is the water of Keilour, which forms the eastern 
boundary of the parish, dividing it from Mommail. The only 
stream we have, entitled to the name of a river, is the Eden, which 
mves its designation to the strath, and ghdes with noiseless curren 
Lough the central vale or How of Fife. This nver rvms abou 
three miles along the southern boundary of the parish, dividing it 



COLLESSIE. 



23 



from that of Kettle. Even this stream is not more than twenty-five 
feet broad in any part of its course along, the confines of the pa- 
rish ; nor does it become considerable till it reaches the Guard 
Bridge in the parish of St Andrews, where it forms an estuary of 
the German Ocean. 

Geology. — As no mines of any description are wrought in this 
parish, and no considerable portion of the strata or formation of its 
rocks is exposed to view, it presents no feature of interest to the eye 
of the geologist. The only organic remains of any consequence 
of which I have heard being found in the parish, were the large 
branching horns and almost the entire skeleton of an elk of great 
size, which were dug up a few years ago in the marl pits of Pit- 
lair, in the eastern part of the parish. At the same place were 
found several segments of the oak, denoting great circumference 
and corresponding length in the trees of which they had formed a 
part ; probably a portion of the primeval timber that grew in the 
district, and so few traces of which are now to be found. 

There is excellent whin or greenstone open in the parish ; it 
is much used for building, for which purpose it is at once durable 
and ornamental. Sandstone has also been exposed on the proper- 
ty of Rankeilour, though not wrought to any considerable extent. 
Great quantities of marl too, both shell and clay, are found in the 
parish. It was formerly much used, and some of it even shipped 
to the Carse of Gowrie. It is now little in demand, except for top- 
dressing and forming compounds for grass. It may perhaps have 
been formerly applied in too large quantities, or the cropping may 
have been too severe after it. 

Botany. — I have been kindly furnished by one of the heritors 
with the following notice of the rarer plants found in the parish. 
It may be proper, however, to mention, in reference to this enu- 
meration, that, although part of the banks of the Black Loch are 
in this parish, the loch itself lies in the adjoining parish of Abdie. 

There is nothing in this parish which would, a priori, seem to 
indicate a great variety in its botany ; but, when more accurately 
viewed, we find that, being bounded by water on the north and south, 
and occupied in the centre by a wood of several miles in extent, in 
which there are several large marshes, few parishes are in this re- 
spect more favourably situated. A very brief view of the rare plants 
to be found within it will not disappoint the botanist. 

The Hippuris is found at Monkstown, and near the edges of the 
Black Loch ; the Scirpus sylvaticus is found on Edensmuir, and 



24 



FIFESHIRE. 



the Eriophonm polT/siachion is common there and in the other 
marshes of the district; the Alopecurus /eniculatusf var. 7. is found 
at Lawfield; the Affrostis alba, var. /S, the Fiorin grass on the 
banks of the Eden; the Ghjccria fuitans is not uncommon, and 
is noticed here as forming the chief grass in a meadow at the north 
end of the Black Loch ; the Poa nemoralis grows in patches on 
Edensmuir '; the Triodia decumbens is to be found on the farm of 
Birns; the Lolium temulenhm is occasionally met with. It is 
supposed the intoxicating and noxious effects of its weeds is exagge- 
rated. The smooth variety of the Scabiosa arvensis, a plant which, 
Sir James Smith says, has never been seen in England, grows on 
Ballomill. The Potamogeton lanceolatum, var. 3. without any 
floating leaves grows on the Black Loch; and P. pusillum in the 
old bed of the Eden near Pitlessie Bridge, and it is not uncommon 
in the district. The minute Radiola millegrana is found on Edens- 
muir, on those places overflowed in winter. The Cynoglossum of- 
ficinah is found near Trafalgar. The Eddum vulgare is only men- 
tioned, because dangerous to bees, as it tears their wings, and should 
be eradicated by each bee-master. The Solanum dulcamara, sup- 
posed by Hooker to be rare in Scotland, grows in many places of 
the district; it grows on the banks of the Eden, on the farm of 
Lawfield. The Gentiana campestris grows at Daftmill and near 
Ramornie. The poisonous Conium maculatum is to be found near 
Trafalgar. The Sambucus Ebulus grows near Kinloch, where it 
was found by the late Dr Malcolm. The beautiful Drosera ro- 
tundifolia is found plentifully in the marshes of Edensmuir, and a 
dead fly is not unfrequent in its leaves. Luciola congesta Luzula 
congesta, Hooker, is found near Ramornie. The Bumex sangui- 
neus grows near Melville. The B. acutus grows in many places; it 
is used by the country people as a vulnerary. The Calluna vul- 
garis and Erica tetralix and cinerea are all occasionally found with 
white flowers; and the variety oi E. cinerea, named by Loddiges 
E. cinerea, also purpurea, grows in considerable quantity near Ra- 
mornie. The Polygonum aviculare is noticed, because horses are 
particularly fond of it, and it will grow on the poorest soils. The 
Pyrola minor is the only Pyrola as yet found in the parish ; it 
grows on many places of Edensmuir. Arenaria rubra grows on 
Hetherinch. The Sedum relepliium on Ballomill, and near the 
Eden. A white flowering variety of Lychnis Flos-Cuculi is not un- 
common. The Cerastium aquaticum is rare in this part of the 
country. A single plant of it was found near Pitlessie dam-dike.

The Lythrum salicaria grows on Hetherincb, on the banks of the 
Eden. The Reseda lutea has been found on BallomilL The 
Spircea Filipendula grows on the farm of Birns ;— this beautiful 
plant is only found in two other places in the county, viz. North 
Queensferry and Aberdour. The Torment'dla reptans has been 
found in the willow grounds near Ramovnie. The beautiful Nym- 
phcea alba and Nupliar lutea are found abundantly in the Black 
Loch; the latter also grows in the river Eden, near Pitlessie Bridge. 
The Ranunculus Flammula, var. k is very common in Edensmuir. 
The R. auricomus is met with in Melville plantations. The Trol- 
lius EuropcBus the Luckan gowan of Allan Ramsay grows in con- 
siderable quantity on BallomilL The Mentha viridis, not yet no- 
ticed as a native of Scotland, grows betwixt Collessie and Kinloch. 
As it has been met with at two other places within the county, it 
seems an undoubted native. The Galeopsis versicolor is plentiful 
in the parish. The Thymus serpyllum, var. 7. grows on Edensmuir. 
The Digitalis purpurea var. Jlore alba is found on Peterhead, 
where the Camelina sativa has also been found growing. The 
Nasturtium terrestre is found at a pond near the Earl of Leven's 
cottages, and on the edges of the Black Loch. The Barbarea 
vulgaris grows near Collessie, on the burn. The Erodium cicu- 
tarium, both with pink and white flowers, is pretty common ; also 
the beautful Geranium pratense is found near Pitlessie Bridge. 
The Malva moschata grows near Lumquhat. The Genista anglica 
grows plentifully on Edensmuir and near Ramornie. The beauti- 
ful Anthyllis vxdnerdria will be found near the road betwixt Hether- 
incb and Daftmill. The Trifolium officinale has been found on 
Lawfield. The Leontodon palustre is found occasionally in the 
marshes. The Hieracium murorum is found on the walls. The 
H. sylvaticum is frequent in the woods. The Cichorium Intyhus 
grows at Daftmill, and is not uncommon in the district. The Bi~ 
dens tripartita grows on Drumtennant, and at the south end of the 
Black Loch. The Gnaphalium dioicum, uliginosum, and germa- 
nicum grow on Edensmuir. The Senecio lividus and sylvaticus 
grow in the parish ; the former sparingly, the latter abundantly. 
These species are perfectly distinct, and cannot be mistaken. The 
S. aquaticum is abo to be found. The Orchis bifolia grows near 
Monkstown; the O. mascula on Lawfield; the O. latifolia, ma- 
cidata, and Conopsea on Edensmuir. The Sparganium simplex grows 
on the edges of the Black Loch only 2 or 3 inches high ; while 
in Pitlessie dam it has leaves 6 or 8 feet long. There is a con-

siderable number of Carices on Edensmuir : the C. pulicaris grows 
near Ramornie ; the C. stellulata, curta, pejidula, Jiava, prcBcox, 
piluligera, paludosa, and riparia on Edensmuir; while the C. liirta 
grows near the Black Loch. The C. arenaria, so common on 
the sea coast, is found on the lands of Ramornie, running among 
the sand at a distance of ten miles from the sea. Littorella lacus- 
tris grows round the Black Loch. The Poterium sanguisorha 
was found near Birns farm. The Betula alba, var. /. grows at 
Rankeilour, while the Pinus sylvestris, either planted or native, 
covers the lands of Edensmuir. Besides the cultivated willows, 
such as the Triandra, fragilis, decipiens, Russelliana, rubra, cine- 
rea, viminalis, and alba; the repens, aquatica, and caprea are 
found in their native situations. Myrica Gale grows abundantly in 
the marsh at Muirside. The Aspidiwn Oreopteris is found on 
Edensmuir, along with the Blechnum boreale and the Lycopodium 
clavatum. Botrychium lunaria is found on the pastures of Ballo- 
miU. 

It would be improper here to enter the names of the other 
cryptogamic plants, but it may be mentioned that it is supposed 
there is no parish in Scotland where there is an equal number of 
agarics; 125 species were gathered previous to the dry summer in 
1826. They have not been so numerous since that year ; but many 
sorts which had not been seen for years have again made their ap- 
pearance, so that it is probable they will now rather exceed than 
fall short of that number. 

TL — Civil History. 

Pictures— wAex this head it may be mentioned, that there is in 
the possession of Charles Kinnear, Esq. of Kinloch, three original 
paintings by our countryman Wilkie. They are interesting not only 
as some of the earliest productions of his genius, but as indicating by 
their history, the good feelings of his heart. They were painted for 
the late Mr Kinnear, and presented to him by the artist, in testi- 
mony of the kindness and friendship he experienced at Kinloch in 
early life, and on this account are much valued by the family. They 
are in that peculiar style of his art in which he has acquired the 
greatest celebrity. It was by the largest of these pictures, indeed, 
that he first came into notice. The subject is " Pitlessie fair," con- 
taining upwards of 150 figures, the labour of a year. The size is 3 
feet 9 inches by 2 feet. The grouping is admirable. The princi- 
pal figures in the piece are characters who were well known in the 
neighbourhood during the early life of the artist, which gives a

oreater interest and value to his painting as a record of the times. 
It is considered equal in merit to some of the more recent and 
most admired productions of his pencil. 

Eminent Men. — Among the eminent characters connected with this 
parish, is the distinguished courtier Sir James Melville, who figured 
during the reign of Mary Queen of Scots, and who, according to 
his own relation, performed so many feats of dexterous diplomacy 
between the rival queens of Scotland and England. He was proprie- 
tor of the estate of Hall-hill. This property, it appears, originally 
belonged to Henry Balnaves, who, in 1542, was Deputy- Keeper of 
the Privy- Seal, and the following year, Secretary-Depute. The 
lands of Hall-hill were by him disposed of to Sir James Melville, 
who was third son to Sir John Melville of Raith, one of the early 
promoters of the Reformed faith. The property continued in his 
family till the reign of Charles H., when it was purchased by the 
Earl of Melville. No trace of the house now remains, and the 
ground where it stood forms part' of the present enclosures of 
Melville. 

The celebrated Dr Hugh Blair commenced his ministry in this 
parish, to the pastoral charge of which he was ordained on the 23d 
September in the year 1742. I -have in my possession a list of 
the names of the ministers of the parish as far back as 1578. There 
have been fifteen ministers since that year, previous to the present 
incumbent, of whom it appears that four were removed to other 
charges. One, Mr John Ogilvie, was ejected during the attempt to 
establish Episcopacy in Scotland before the Revolution of 1688 ; 
and the rest seem to have died in the parish. 

Antiquities. — There are several antiquities in the parish as to 

• The family burying-ground of Sir James is in the churchyard of Collessie, upon 
one of the walls of which the following inscription can still be decyphered, though 
much obliterated by the hand of time.

which no very certain information is possessed, but which might fur- 
nish interesting subject of investigation to those who devote them- 
selves to such inquiries. One of the most prominent of our me- 
morials of past times is a mound, consisting of a cairn of stones, a 
short distance south of the village of CoUessie, usually called the 
Gash-hill. It is about twelve feet above the level of the ground. 
It has been supposed to be the remains of a Roman station. It 
consists of loose stones, now grown over with turf. A few years, 
ago a sword, about eighteen inches in length, with one edge, and 
so formed that it might be used either for cutting or thrusting, but 
much corroded by time, was dug up from among the stones. Some 
fragments, too, of human bones were found here, enclosed by a few 
large flat stones. From their appearance, position, and mixed state, 
and their having evidently been subjected to the action of fire, it 
would require less effort of fancy, than antiquarians sometimes 
exert, to suppose these remains to have consisted of what the Ro- 
mans called the ossilegium, or gathering up of the bones, after the 

body was burnt. 

About a quarter of a mile east of the village, and within the 
grounds of Melville, there is one of those large whinstones placed 
on its end, so frequently seen in other parts of the country. It is 
upwards of nine feet above the ground, and about six feet in cir- 
cumference. This stone is near the spot where the house of Hall- 
hill stood, but probably of much'greater antiquity. 

Tradition marks two spots near the hamlet of Trafalgar, and 
at about equal distances to the east and the west of the inn known 
by that name, as the sites of two ancient military forts, which were 
probably intended to secure the pass leading from Newburgh to 
the central part of Fife. This must have been a station of great 
importance in times of war, as, with the exception of one other 
pass, it formed the only access to the interior of the county froni 
the north. The loch that lies upon the road between this place 
and Newburgh has in consequence received the name of Lindores, 
Linne-doris the water of the pass. 

The eastern fort was called Agahatha, or marsh-field castle. 
This name was appropriate to its situation, as, within the last forty 
years, the fields adjoining the little eminence called a castle, were 
a coinplete marsh, although now under cultivation. The eminence 
itself was surrounded by a ditch or moat, forming in a remote age 
the most effective kind of fortification. Several relics of antiquity 
have been found at this place. Among others a quern or hand-

mill of mica slate, a mineral not belonging to Fife. A number of 
coins also, belonging to the reign of Edward I. of England, were 
here turned up by the plough. They are the coinage of different 
towns, as London, Canterbury, and York, but are evidently all of 
the same reign. 

The western fort is called the Maiden Castle. A clump of trees 
planted by the late proprietor, Mr Thomson, points out its situa- 
tion. The tradition as to the origin of this name is, that during 
a siege laid to this station, the governor died, and that his daugh- 
ter, concealing the event, gave the necessary orders in his name, 
and that the castle thus defended held out till the enemy was 
obliged to retire. There is scarcely any thing in the external ap- 
pearance of the grounds in either of these places that would ar- 
rest the attention of an observer unacquainted with these tradi- 
tions. But in the fields adjoining, and particularly in the inter- 
vening space between these two stations, there are many traces, in 
the human bones, stone coffins and urns, which from time to time 
have been dug up, — that point out this place to have been, at a re- 
mote period, the scene of battles and of sepulture. 

Among the most entire of these remains may be mentioned two 
urns, said to be perfect specimens of the ancient Celtic urn, for de- 
positing the ashes of the dead. One of these, still to be seen at 
Kinloch, is made of bluish clay. Its height is about eighteen 
inches, and its diameter at the widest part about fifteen inches, like 
a bee's cap, a little more conical. It was found at the depth of a 
foot below the surface, in an inverted position, on a flat slab of 
stone, and enclosing several human bones which have been partial- 
ly burnt. The other urn, which has been carried away in frag- 
ments by different visitors, was in every respect similar, only its 
dimensions, somewhat smaller than that described.  

• From its proximity to Falkland, the frequent residence of James VI, this parish 
is recorded to have been the scene of some of the eccentric feats and munificent acts 
of that facetious prince. The following is one of the most authentic. It is related 
that in the disguise, which he often assumed, of a poor travelling man, he knocked 
one evening at the door of the miller's house of Ballomill. After some little difficul- 
ty he obtained quarters for the night. He joined the circle round the miller's fire- 
side, and partook of their social glee, as well as of their homely cheer. The miller's 
frank and honest bearing gained upon the good opinion of the King, his hospitality 
and kindness increasing as he became more intimate with the stranger. In the morn- 
ing, accompanying his unknown guest in familiar converse to the extremity of the 
farm, they were met, according to previous appointment, by the royal guards. The 
miller then saw with astonishment that he had had the honour of entertaining the 
King. At parting, to reward his hospitality, and at the same time to try his know- 
ledge of fractions, his Majesty asked the miller, whether he would have the fourth 
part, or the eighth part, or the sixteenth part of the lands on which they stood. The 
miller pondered a little a question so important, and said to himself, to ask the sax-

III. — Population. 
It appears from the account of this parish, pubHshed in the for- 
mer Statistical Account, that in the year 179], the population was 
949 souls. By the last census of 1831, the population amount- 
ed to 1162, viz. 559 males, and 603 females. The increase is to 
be referred to the steadily advancing prosperity and improve- 
ment of the country. Besides the village of Collessie, which con- 
tains 180 inhabitants, there are several other villages and ham- 
lets in the parish. Three of these are of recent erection, viz. 
Gifferton, Edenston, and Monkston, The houses of which they 
are formed are well arranged, neat, and comfortable. That a 
greater increase of the population has not taken place in conse- 
quence of the recent erection of these villages, is accounted for 
by the almost entire removal of the village of Kinloch, which, not 
many years ago, was the largest in the parish, containing 191 in- 
habitants. A considerable number of the families formerly resid- 
ing there now occupy Monkston. This village consists of twenty- 
four houses forming one line, with an interval of twelve feet between 
every four houses, so that the whole is divided into six squares. 
The place originally called Monks-moss takes its name from the 
district where it is situated, having been granted to the monks of 
St Mary's at Lindores Abbey to supply them with heather and 
moss for fuel. 

Number of families in the parish, - - - 247 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 

trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 104 

Upwards of 100 of the families live in the several villages, the 
rest in the country part of the parish. The yearly average, as ap- 
pears from the sessional books, which have recently been kept with 
considerable accuracy, is, for the last seven years, of births, 18; of 
deaths, U ; of marriages, 9. 

Resident Land-owners.— parish has the advantage of the 
permanent residence of most of its landed proprietors. To begin

, So manv of the heritors permanently resident, not only form a 
pleasant neighbourhood, but their residence exerts a very favour- 
able influence upon the condition and moral character of the whole 
population. "Anxious as the gentlemen of the parish are to give 
employment to the labouring-classes, and to relieve the necessities 
of the poor, their liberality, as will appear in a subsequent part of 
this account, is of great benefit to the parish. And it may be said 
of the people at large, that they enjoy, in a very considerable de- 
gree, the comforts and advantages of society. 

During the last three years there have been 2 illegitimate births. 

IV. — Industry. 

Manufactures. — There are no manufactories or public works in 
this parish. Yet more than a hundred families are supported by hand- 
loom weaving, the materials beingsupplied by agents, and the manu- 
factured goods transmitted by them to Glasgow, Dundee, and Aber- 
deen. It requires great industry to enable a weaver to make 9s. a- 
week. Females are also employed in this occupation, whose earn- 
ings are scarcely so good. 

Agriculture. — The number of acres, imperial measure, cultivated 
or occasionally in tillage, is about 5000. There may be between 200 
and 300 imperial acres of marshy and barren land lying continually 
waste, almost the whole of which might be improved for pasture, or 
planted to advantage. The only common in the parish, viz. Edens- 
muir and Monks-moss, was divided by Adam Holland, Esq. advo- 
cate, as arbiter, about forty years ago. 

Plantations. — The greater part of that common, extending in all 
to 967 imperial acres, has been planted, chiefly in fir. Weddersbie 
hill, also, extending to upwards of 200 imperial acres, was planted 
upwards of twenty years ago by William Johnston, Esq. of Lathrisk, 
the proprietor. The plantations in the neighbourhood of the man- 
sions in the parish extend to 60 or 70 acres, — so that the total wood- 
land may be about 1237 imperial acres. 

In Edensmuir and Monks-moss the wood planted is chiefly fir, too 
generally of a soft yellow pine, by mistake, instead of the Scotch 
fir. This great forest did not, in due time, receive judicious pe- 
riodical thinnings, which, from the lightness of the soil, it particu- 
larly required. It is, consequently in many places, not in a thriv- 
ing state, and the trees will not reach above two-thirds of the size to 
which they might otherwise have attained. 

Upwards of twenty years ago, a large fir plantation on the bor- 
ders of the common, belonging to the Earl of Leven and Melville, 



32 



FIFESIIIUE. 



suddenly died, when come to about two-thirds of its growth. The 
decay was so rapid that httle value was secured. Numbers of in- 
sects were found on the trees. This extraordinary effect is pro- 
bably to be referred to the want of proper thinning, the poor soil 
being unable to sustain so large a crop. The space once occupied 
by this plantation still retains the name of the " Dead Wood." In 
the thriving plantation of Weddersbie hill, there is, along with the 
fir in the better parts of the soil, a judicious admixture of larch and 
the ordinary forest trees. In planting Edensmuir, the genuine Scotch 
fir ought to be introduced; and everywhere except on the poorest 
parts of the soil, an admixture ought to be supplied of larch and of 
the hardy species of forest trees. 

Bent— The rent of arable land in the parish varies according 
to its quality, from 10s. to L. 2, 10s. per Scotch acre. 

gfock. The Fifeshire breed of black cattle is reared. It is much 

•crossed with various breeds, chiefly, however, with the short-horned 
or Teeswater, and with the Angus polled breed. More attention 
should be given to preserving and propagating the pure breed of 
the county. It combines in a great degree the hardiness of the 
Highland with the size of the southern breeds. 

Husbandry.— The mode of farming pursued in the parish is si- 
milar to that of the district at large. The common duration of 
leases is nineteen years. And the rents are now generally fixed, 
partly in money and partly in grain, according to the fiars of the 
county. The farm-buildings are generally good and commodious, 
and the fields for the most part enclosed with stone dikes or thorn 

Improvements.— Besides that this parish, in common with the coun- 
try at large, advances progressively in agricultural improvement, seve- 
ral extensive undertakings havebeen executed which haveproved very 
beneficial One of these was the embankment of the Eden by the 
late Mr Johnstone of Lathrisk, the father of the present proprie- 
tor That river flowing through a level country, very often over- 
flowed its banks, and considerably injured the grounds on either 
side by washing away the soil. To prevent this, Mr Johnstone 
caused a spacious canal to be made for the water, 12 feet wide 
at the bottom and 30 feet at the top, secured on the sides by em- 
bankments and hedges, which include a space 70 feet in breadth, 
so that in time of a flood there is sufficient space for containing 
the water, and preventing its overflowing and damaging the adja- 
cent grounds. 



COLLESSIE.

Extensive improvements have also been effected upon the flat 
lands of Rankeiloiu-Makgill, and Pitlair. A quantity of ground 
has here been reclaimed from marsh, by the spirited improve- 
ments of the late Charles Maitland, Esq. of Rankeilour. In ac- 
complishing this, he deepened the water of Keilour, to give greater 
descent to his drainage. So beneficial has been the effect of his 
operations in this neighbourhood, that it is difficult now to believe 
the tradition, that in 1745, when the horses at Rankeilour were 
seized for the use of the Pretender's army, those of Pitlair remain- 
ed secure, the Highlanders being unwilling to approach it by the 
single road which led to it through the surrounding morass. In 
connection with these improvements, Mr Maitland worked marl 
on Pitlair, to the extent of 83,010 bolls fine, and 28,721 black 
do., which he used largely for his own estate, and sold besides to 
the surrounding landlords, to the value of L. 1461, lis. 0-|d. 

Draining of Rossie Loch, Sfc. — But the most remarkable of 
all the improvements effected in the parish was the draining of 
Rossie Loch. The first attempt to accomplish this object was 
made in 1740. Notwithstanding the means then used, however, 
the ground was still left a kind of morass in summer, and almost 
covered with water in winter. It continued in this unsatisfac- 
tory state till 1805-1806, when Captain Cheape, the present 
proprietor, deepened and extended the drains, leading off the 
water to the Eden, -at an expense of L. 3000. The land was 
thus brought into a comparatively dry state. About 250 acres 
of it have been made capable of producing good crops of grain, 
although about 40 acres in the middle of the former loch still 
remain marshy, producing only natural hay. In carrying for- 
ward his operations. Captain Cheape found it very advantageous 
occasionally to pasture the reclaimed fields with sheep. They 
consolidated the land, and prepared it for the plough, without 
breaking the surface, as heavier cattle must have done. The ex- 
tensive drainage which has been effected by the active and intel- 
ligent proprietor of Rossie has at once improved and beautified 
his estate, and greatly promoted the healthfulness of the neigh- 
bourhood. 

The system of draining has not only been successfully employ- 
ed upon the lands of Rossie, but upon the estate of Kinloch and 
other adjacent districts. It might be suggested, however, that, 
although little remains to be done in reclaiming, much might still

be effected in improving the more retentive soils, by means of the 
system of furrow or frequent drainage. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 

Grain, 9000 quarters, ' 

Potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. 6000 tons, 

Hay, 1550 tons, jl 

Dressed flax, 4 or 5 tons, • • _ ' „„j 
Land in pasture, 9000 or 10,000 acres of various qualities and some wood 
pasture, at L. 3 per cow or full-grown ox grazed, and 7s. per ewe or 
full-grown sheep pastured, . . . • • 
Gardens, qqq 
Thinnings of plantations, 

L. 24,745 

Agricultural Society.— k society, formed with the view of giving 
encouragement to the raising of live-stock and other agricultural 
produce, holds its meetings in this parish. It is one of the oldest 
associations for this purpose in the county. Its annual meeting, 
known by the name of the Trafalgar show, is held on the 21st of Oc- 
tober, the anniversary of the great victory of Trafalgar. The system 
of sweepstakes has lately been substituted for the premiums for- 
merly given by the society; and the competition excited, in improv- 
ing the breed of stock, and introducing improved seeds, is consi- 
derable. The Chevalier barley and the Italian rye-grass were 
lately brought into general notice in this district, by means of this 
society. It is supported by the neighbouring landed proprietors, 
and a considerable body of the tenantry. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Covimunication.— the parish is situated upon the 
road between Cupar and Auchtermuchty, our means of communica- 
tion are easy and direct. There is a runner between these towns 
every day, who leaves letters and parcels at Trafalgar inn, and at 
the lodges of the mansions upon the road. No coach now passes 
through the parish ; the nearest point at which a public conveyance 
can be got is three miles distant from CoUessie. We are six mdes 
from the New Inn, where coaches to and from Edinburgh, Dundee, 
and Aberdeen, pass three times a-day. The projected railway, 
for connecting the Forth and Tay, will run through the centre of 
the parish. There are carriers almost every day to various parts 
of the country, and one regularly twice a week between Cupar and 
Auchtermuchty. . , i 

Ecclesiastical State.-The great majority ot the people are mem- 
bers of the Established Church. There is no dissenting meeting- 



COLLESSIE. 



35 



house of any description in the parish ; but there are about 80 
famihes of dissenters, who go to their several places of worship in 
adjoining parishes. There are 135 male heads of families upon 
the parochial roll, who have the right of exercising the veto, in 
conformity with the recent enactment of the General Assembly, 
among whom are included all the heritors, and every farmer in the 
parish. There are 330 communicants in the Established Church, 
and 8 elders. 

The manse is a very comfortable and commodious house, much 
improved and enlarged, — almost, indeed, renewed within the last 
fourteen years. If, for the personal comfort of the minister and 
his family, it is, like many of the manses in Fife, too much in the 
village, he has the advantage at least of being near the scene of 
his ministerial labours. The glebe is of not more than the le- 
gal size, but the land is of good quality. The stipend is 15 chal- 
ders of grain, half meal, and half barley, a small sum for vicarage 
and grass money, with the usual allowance for communion ele- 
ments. The last augmentation was granted in 1822. There is 
a considerable amount of unexhausted teind. 

The church is an exceedingly uncomfortable and ill-adapted 
structure. It is one of the few remaining long and narrow build- 
ings, that seem to have been common in the country in Ro- 
man Catholic times. It is 75 feet long, by 25 broad. The pul- 
pit is in the middle, and there are galleries to the right and left 
of it. Some of the old seats that remain bear the date of the 
fifteenth century. From its original situation, or by the accumu- 
lation of graves in the church-yard in which it stands, it is sunk 
some feet below the level of the ground, and is in the winter sea- 
son cold and damp in the extreme. It cannot, at the utmost, be seated 
for more than 400 hearers ; and, besides being too small for the po- 
pulation of the parish, it is irremediably defective in form, and can 
by no repair be rendered commodious or comfortable. There is 
no remedy but in a new one, which it is hoped will soon be erected. 

Poo-.— The poor of the parish are amply supported by the volun- 
tary collections made at the church doors. Our heritors for the most 
part being resident, and such of them as are not so occasionally 
commg to church, or sending their contributions, — although there 
is no fund or vested property for charitable purposes, — the kirk-ses- 
sion has been able, for the last three years, during the incumbency 
of the present minister, to meet, from the source alluded to, 
the exigencies of the poor. There is a prevailing opinion of the 



35 FIFESIIIRE. 



advantages to all parties attending this mode of parochial admi- 
nistration. The number of stated pensioners on the poors' roll is 
eleven,— 3 men and 8 women. The highest allowance is 10s. a 
month,— the lowest to any pensioner in the parish, 4s. 

The average sum collected yearly for the last three years is L. 58. 
This includes sums collected upon sacramental occasions twice a- 
year, and which, for the most part, are appropriated to the tem- 
porary rehef of such of the poor as are not regular pensioners. 
It includes also the amount of annual collections made upon 
the first Sabbath of every year, being at an average L. 7 for coals 
to the poor. The kirk-session have thus been able to distribute 
upwards of thirty cart loads of coals annually, the heritors and 
farmers, in addition to their collections, giving the carriage free. 

Societies for Religious purposes.— 'BesQS these collections for 
the temporal necessities of the poor, there is collected at the church 
door, for rehgious purposes, from L. 12 to L. 15 annually. The 
money thus raised for promoting Christian objects constitutes 
the funds of a parochial society, which are placed at the disposal 
of a committee, consisting of the kirk-session, ex officio, and three 
other members of the congregation, annually elected. And these 
funds have been principally appropriated to the support of insti- 
tutions connected with the Estabhshed Church. 

Education.— ThQ facilities for education in the parish are con- 
siderable. There is the parochial school, where the usual branches 
are taught. It is attended, at an average, by 65 scholars. The 
schoolmaster has the maximum salary; a comfortable and well-si- 
tuated house and garden. His fees may amount to L. 23 per an- 
num : he has also about L. 5 a-year from other sources. There is 
also a female school, a neat and well adapted building m the cot- 
tage style, near Collessie village, erected at the expense of the Mel- 
ville family, and partly endowed. It is attended by 50 girls, and 
a few boYS under six years of age They are not only well in- 
structed in the elementary branches of general education, but the 
ffirls are taught knitting and needlework in its several branches, 
and, what is scarcely less important, are trained to habits of order 
and exactness. Our only other school is a small one at Monkston, 
attended by about 25 scholars, the teacher of which is wholly 
dependent on the fees of his pupils, and the voluntary kind- 
ness of his employers. Some endowment for a school m this 
part of the parish would be highly desirable. The number of 
children, in all, receiving a public education, is 140, being about

1 to 85 of the whole population. A Sabbath school, well attend- 
ed by the children, and also by many of their parents, is taught at 
Collessie ; one at Rankeilour, and another at Monkston. We have 
a Parochial Juvenile and Adult Library, containing 370 well se- 
lected volumes.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JAMES BRODIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish is spelt in several different 
ways; but appears to have been the same in pronunciation from 
time immemorial. The first part of the word seems to be derived 
from the Celtic word Mon or Monath, a hill ; while the latter part 
may be either mile, a mile ; or meal, honey ; or meille, a mill. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The parish forms an irregular oval, of which 
the extreme length is 6 miles, and the extreme breadth 5 ; and con- 
tains about 16 square miles. It is entirely inland ; and is bounded 
on the north and east by the parishes of Abdie, Dunbog, Moonzie, 
and Cupar; and on the south and west by Cults and Collessie. 
The northern part of the parish consists of a range of whinstone 
hills, of which the Mount Hill is the highest. The southern part 
is more level, being a portion of the hollow which occupies the 
centre of Fifeshire. 

Meteorology, Sj-c. — The general temperature of the atmosphere, 
as ascertained by a register kept at Melville House, in which the 
greatest heat of each day, and greatest cold of each night, are re- 
gularly noted, is as under : 

Jan. Feb. Mar. Ap. May. June. July. Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. 

1833, 37.1 38.5 40.8 45.3 54 8 52.8 59 56.1 53.4 49.3 38.5 38.1 

1834, 31.3 38 38.5 43 55.1 56.4 59.6 

1835,35.2 38.8 40.5 46.1 49.3 5.5.2 57,2 58.3 50.6 43.1 39.1 35.5 

Generally speaking the chmate is mild. The hills to the north 
and east break the force of the wind from these quarters, while the 
abundance of plantations add to the warmth, as well as to the beauty 
of the district. The lower part of the parish was formerly sub- 



38 



FIFESIIIRE. 



ject to damps and lioar frosts ; but, by means of thorough drain- 
ing, these evils have been almost entirely removed. In conse- 
quence of its dry and sheltered situation, it is considered by medi- 
cal men as peculiarly healthy. Agues are unknown, and fevers 
occur but seldom, and are generally milder in their character than 
in other places. 

Hjidrography.— There are several rivulets in the parish, all of 
which fall into the river Eden. There is only one of them of such 
a size as to turn a mill-wheel without the aid of a dam. In some 
places, owing to the porous nature of the subsoil, the supply of 
water is deficient; but in general the springs are abundant, and 
the water good, without any trace of mineral impregnation. 

Geology.— The northern half of the parish consists of a mass of 
whinstone, full of rents, speedily yielding to the action of the at- 
mosphere, and, consequently, unfit for building. There are, how- 
ever, isolated portions of a harder and more durable nature. In 
some places, agates are found imbedded in the rock. Besides these 
portions, which seem to have been formed at the same time as the 
softer rock by which they are surrounded, there are two contigu- 
ous veins, or seams, of a more recent formation, running nearly 
east and west for many miles. The one to the north is a very 
tough, heavy, and coarse-grained stone, and varies in thickness 
from 15 to 40 feet. The other is harder and closer in the grain, 
and is from 10 to 20 feet thick. Between these veins there some- 
times occur cavities, in which very beautiful crystals of carbonate 
of lime and sulphate of barytes have been found. 

The southern half of the parish contains some sandstone, be- 
longing to the coal formation, which is spread over a large portion 
of the county. 

The more hilly parts present very evident proofs of the action 
of a strong current, flowing from the west or south-west. On that 
side of the diff'erent rising grounds, the soil rests immediately on 
the whinstone, and consists of decomposed rock and vegetable 
mould. Wherever it is of sufficient thickness, it produces abun- 
dantly all the different species of cultivated plants. On the east 
and north, the whinstone is covered by a deposit of clayey till se- 
veral feet in thickness. The soil in such places is more tenacious, 
and generally less productive. 

In the more level district, the coal strata are covered with a thick 
bed of gravel and sand, apparently deposited by an extensive lake, 
which had at some former period extended over the " Laigh of 



MONIMAIL. 



39 



Fife." This gravel is composed of fragments of many different 
rocks ; and the soil above it is light and thin. 

Botany. — The greater part of the land having been under culti- 
vation from time immemorial, and the rest affording good pasture 
for cattle and sheep, there is no secluded corner to afford a ha- 
bitat for any of the rarer indigenous plants. The yellow aco- 
nite grows in great abundance in the shrubberies at Melville, and 
the Geranium lucidum on the old walls round Monimail. The va- 
rious kinds of grasses and vetches are especially abundant. In the 
soils formed from the decomposition of the whinstone, we find Poa 
arvensis, P. trivialis, Festuca duriusculd, Cynosurus cristatus, Phleum 
pratense, and Holcus avenaceus most commonly occurring ; on the 
soils lying above sand or gravel, the Festuca ovina, and Agrostis 
communis are most frequently found ; while the Holcus lanatus 
and Dactylis glomerata are everywhere abundant. All the diffe- 
rent kinds of trees commonly planted seem to thrive ; some of the 
oaks in particular have been noted for an unusually rapid growth. 

Zoology. — Owing to the sheltered situation of the parish, and 
the number of plantations, there is a superabundance of the fea- 
thered tribes. Occasionally, some of the rarer species have been 
met with. Among others may be mentioned, the Bohemian and 
silken chatterers, the grossbeak, the siskin, the kingfisher, and 
the passenger pigeon, — the last being the only specimen hitherto 
discovered in Britain. A few foxes and roe-deer are found in the 
plantations, but none of the rarer quadrupeds have been observed. 
The jealousy of the gamekeeper has destroyed almost all the birds 
and beasts of prey not excepting the cat ; wood-pigeons, rabbits, 
rats, and other vermin, are in consequence numerous and very de- 
structive. The rivulets siipply a few trouts and eels. The only 
shell-fish is the fresh water muscle. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — Of eminent menconnected with the parish wemay 
mention, Sir David Lindsay of the Mount, whose family for many 
years retained that property. Several individuals belonging to the 
noble family of Melville have also received an honourable place in 
the history of their country. Melville of Raith, ancestor of the 
present Earls of Leven and Melville, was one of the first who 
embraced the Reformed religion. His sons, James and Andrew 
Melville, were distinguished for their diplomatic talent in the times 
of James and Mary. George, the first Earl of Melville, had the 
honour, as His Majesty's Commissioner to the General Assembly, 



V 



40 



FIFKSHIIIK. 



of announcing that church patronage had been abolished. He 
was also one of the most active instruments of bringing about the 
Revolution of 1688. In later times, this parish was the residence 
of Sir John Hope, Afterwards Lord Niddry and Earl of Hopetoun, 
who acted so distinguished a part in the peninsular war. 

Land-oioners. — The chief land-owners are, the Earl of Leven 
and Melville; General the Hon. Sir Alexander Hope of Ran- 
keilour, G. C. B. ; Francis Balfour, Esq. of Fernie, nearest heir- 
male to the attainted title of Burleigh; George Paterson, Esq. of 
Cunoquhie ; and Thomas Webster, Esq. of Balgarvie. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish registers commence in the 
year 1626. They are in general pretty well kept; but several 
portions have been lost. Some of the entries show that the for- 
mer state of the country was very different from the present. Thus, 
froih the treasurer's accounts, we learn, that, besides maintaining 
the poor, and assisting in educating young men for the ministry, 
the collections made at church were applied to the repairing of 
roads, bridges, and harbours. 

Antiquities. — Of antiquities the number is butsmall. Anold tower 
yet stands, which is said to have been built by Cardinal Bethune or 
Beaton, who resided here in 1562. It seems to have formed an addi- 
tion to a building which had previously been one of the country resi- 
dences of the Archbishops of St Andrews. There are several dis- 
tinct heads of the Cardinal in his cap, in relievo upon the walls. The 
arms of the family of Bethune are also entire. The house of Fer- 
nie is believed to have been one of Macduff's castles ; it is very old, 
and has evidently been a place of strength. In taking down the 
old church, a stone coffin was found in the wall, formed of a single 
stone, with a cavity cut of the shape of the body. Another stone 
formed the cover. Some remnants of what seemed to have been 
gold lace were found among the mouldering bones and dust ; but 
who was the person thus immured, could not be ascertained. About 
a mile from the site of the old church, there is a strong spring of 
very pure water, which is known by the name of Cardan's well ; so 
called from a celebrated physician, who is said with this water to 
have cured Hamilton Archbishop of St Andrews, of dropsy. A 
belief long prevailed, that this spring was possessed of peculiar me- 
dicinal properties, and within the last fifty years many persons used 
to frequent it ; but now its very name and situation are almost for- 
gotten. Its reputation perhaps arose from a cunning device of the 
physician, who praised its virtues, that he might induce a lazy eccle- 



MONIMAIL.

siastic to take the exercise necessary for his health, in walking to 
the well. 

Buildings. — The parish is rich in gentlemen's seats ; Melville, 
Rankeilour, Cunoquhie, and Balgarvie, are elegant modern man- 
sions. Fernie Castle, as before observed, is more ancient, and re- 
tains marks of having been a place of strength. A beautiful pil- 
lar, upwards of 100 feet in height, has been erected on the top of the 
Mount-hill, in memory of the late Lord Hopetoun. The materials 
generally used in building are freestone for the hewn work, and whin- 
stone for the ruble. They form together a very solid and durable 
wall. A few of the cottages are covered with thatch ; but most of them 
are roofed with tiles, and the better class of buildings with slates. 

III. — Population. 

Judging from the entries in the session registers, the population 
of the parish does not appear to have made any great increase for 
the last two hundred years. Dr Webster states it at 884, but this 
seems to be too low. The increase has arisen from the number of 
additional hands employed in weaving. The amount of the agri- 
cultural population is less than in former times. The numbers at 
each census are as follows : 

In 1791, . 1101 
1811, . 1160

• A stone coffin containing two skeletons was lately found at Uthrogal, in trench- 
ing a piece of ground, whicli is said by tradition to have been a Roman Catholic 
burying-place. Uthrogal was formerly a leper hospital, and with the lands of Hos- 
pital mill in the adjoining parish of Cults, was given by Mary of Gueldrcs, the wi- 
dow of James 11. to the Trinity Hospital at Edinburgh. On the suppression of 
religious houses it became the property of the town of Edinburgh, and now belongs 
to the Earl of Leven,

Language. — The language spoken is the dialect peculiar to 
Fifeshire, which contains a good many words not to be found in 
Johnson, though their number is gradually diminishing. The pro- 
nunciation is slow and rather drawling. The double oo, as in fool, 
is sounded as the French u in un. The I after p and b is often 
changed into a short i or y, plough and blue being pronounced piu 
and hiu, a corruption similar to the change of the Latin planus into 
the Italian piano. The a in haste, hate, &amp;c. has a sound interme- 
diate between the ay in may, and the e in me, which is in fact a dis- 
tinct vowel, peculiar to the " kingdom of Fife." The short i, as in 
him, is pronounced nearly as the u in tub. 

IV. — Industry. 
Provisions and Wages. — The price of provisions and rate of 
wages at different periods may be stated as under : 

In 

Provisions S/c. 
Beef and mutton per lb. 
Veal per do. 
Hens, 

New butter, 
Eggs per dozen, 
Salmon per lb.

Wages. 
Labourer per day. 
Mason, &amp;c. per day. 
Females per day. 
Ploughmen per year, 
Maid-servants per year. 
Livery-servants per year, 

The pound employed in this table is the Dutch pound. The 
price of grain is taken from an average of the fiars prices for pe- 
riods of five years, ending in the years mentioned. The yearly 
servants receive in addition to their wages, food and lodging, or 
an allowance of meal, &amp;c. in lieu. The payment of the day-la- 
bourers is stated at the average rate of the whole year. 

Agriculture.— T\iQ number of acres under cultivation may be 
reckoned in round numbers at 3000. The pasture including the 
parks round the different gentlemen's seats, amounts to about 2000

more; and the different plantations contain 500 acres in all. 
There is no undivided common, and little if any ground unimprov- 
ed, which would repay the expense of cultivation. The trees are 
skilfully managed. The kinds most commonly planted are, Scotch 
fir, larch, beech, oak, ash, elm, and plane. 

Rent of Land.— The rent of arable land per acre varies from 
L. 1 to L. 3 ; the average may be somewhat above L. 2. The 
charge for grazing depends on the size of the animal and quality 
of the pasture. The grazing for an ox varies from L. 2 to L. 3, 10s. 
the average about L. 3 ; for a sheep, from 7s. to 12s. the average 
10s. 

Live-Stock. — The most common breeds of cattle are the Fife- 
shire, Ayrshire, and Teeswater ; with the different crosses produ- 
ced between them. The Fifeshire is most esteemed for breeding, 
and the Ayrshire for milk. Few sheep are reared in the parish, 
but considerable numbers of the Cheviot and black-faced breeds 
are bought in autumn, and fed on turnips through the winter. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry pursued varies accord- 
ing to the nature of the different soils. On the richer fields, a 
rotation of four years is followed, and the principal change lately 
introduced is the taking of a crop of potatoes instead of fallowing 
previous to sowing wheat. The potatoes are either employed in 
feeding cattle, or are shipped for the London market. This plan, 
however, seems likely to prove ultimately injurious to the soil. On 
the poorer ground a different rotation is preferred, the fields be- 
ing left two or three years in grass. In managing them, the prin- 
cipal improvement is the applying of bone manure to raise a crop 
of turnips, which are afterwards eaten by sheep upon the ground. 
This has enabled the farmer to cultivate a good deal of thin land, 
which must otherwise have remained untilled. 

The farms are generally well laid out, and thoroughly drained. 
They are let upon leases of nineteen years; and the rents are in a 
great measure paid according to the fiars' prices of the county. 
They vary in size from 150 to 400 or 500 acres. The farm-stead- 
ings are substantial and commodious, and the system of husbandry 
good. 

The principal improvement since the former Statistical Account 
was published, is the draining of a morass of 30 or 40 acres ; but 
owing to the subsiding of the mossy soil, and consequent loss of 
level, the improvement has not been so complete as might have 
been anticipated.

may be stated as follows :

Expenses felling and pruning, - - 100 = 100 



L. 21 , 1 00 L. 8050 L. 1 3,050 

Of tlie L. 13,050, stated above as the actual profit derived from 
the soil, about one-third forms the remuneration which the farmer 
receives for his trouble and outlay of money in stocking, draining, 
liming, &amp;c. ; the other two-thirds go to the landlord for rent. Of 
late, the value of the diflferent articles enumerated has fallen short 
of the amount above stated. The valued rent of the parish b near- 
ly L. 8000. 

Manufactures. — The only manufacture worthy of notice is the 
weaving of linens. The value of the labour employed in it may be 
between L. 2000 and L. 3000 per annum. The hours of labour 
are very long, and allow little time for reading or relaxation. Our 
manufactures, therefore, can hardly be said to afford a fair remu- 
neration to those employed, or to be favourable to health aud morals. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Cupar, which is five miles and a-half 
from the church of Monimail. There are three villages in the pa- 
rish. Letham contains 440 inhabitants ; Monimail, 80 ; and Easter 
Fernie, 60. The nearest post-office is at Cupar. Three different 
lines of turnpike pass through the parish, containing in all ten miles 
of road, and as much more is kept in repair by the statute labour 
assessment. There are no canals, railways, or public conveyances. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the church and manse is 
far from convenient. They are scarcely a mile from the one end 
of the parish, and are fully five miles from the other. The church 
was built in 1796. It is rather a handsome building, with a tower 
at the east end, and is in thorough repair. It affords accommo- 
dation for nearly 600 persons. The seats are allotted to the in- 
habitants according to the properties on which they reside. The 
manse was built in 1790, and is still in excellent condition. The 



MONIMAIL. 



45 



glebe contains five acres, and is worth L. 12 per annum. The sti- 
pend is 16 chalders, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 
238, and the number of individuals belonging to them is 1057. 
The families of Seceders, &amp;c. are 31, and the number of persons 
162. There are 3 families containing 11 individuals of Episco- 
palian principles. Divine service is generally well attended,— allow- 
ance being made for bad roads and distance. The average num- 
ber of communicants is nearly 500. There was until lately a 
Bible and Missionary Society, collecting from L. 10 to L. 15 per 
annum. The plan of congregational collections is now adopted ; 
and hitherto the amount raised has not fallen off. Cases requir- 
ing the administration of discipline occur but seldom. Of the more 
flagrant offences within the last seven years there has been one 
murder, the murderer being a stranger ; and five persons have been 
convicted of adultery, three of whom were dissenters. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish. The paro- 
chial teacher has the full salary and the accommodation prescribed 
by law. With school fees and some other small emoluments, his in - 
come may be about L. 65 or L. 70 per annum. There are two 
other schools taught by male teachers, partly supported by private 
subscription and partly by fees, the emoluments being about L. 18 
per annum. Two female teachers are similarly maintained, hav- 
ing about L. 15 each. The branches taught are reading, writing, 
arithmetic, mathematics, grammar, geography, Latin, and in the 
female schools knitting and sewing. The school fees are 2s. or 3s. 
per quarter. The people are fully aware of the benefits of educa- 
tion. Very few, indeed, are ignorant of reading, though a good many 
have not been taught to write. No additional schools are required. 
The number of scholars during the winter season averages 150 ; but 
the classes are not so well attended in summer. Children of eleven 
and twelve years of age are sent to learn trades or to herd cattle, 
and consequently the amount of education that many of them re- 
ceive is very small. 

Libraries. — There are two parish libraries, — one contains a pretty 
good selection of books of general literature ; the other consists 
exclusively of religious publications. 

Friendly Societies. — There is a flourishing friendly society in the 
parish, which has done a great deal of good. Another was broken 
up a few years ago, having been established on erroneous principles. 
The nearest Savings bank is at Cupar.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving regular aid from the parish funds is 12. The usual sum 
allowed is 4s. per month. The collections made at the church 
doors exclusive of those for religious purposes amount to L. 55 
per annum; donations, &amp;c. average nearly L. 10 more; and a 
voluntary assessment from the heritors of L. 20, makes the an- 
nual income of the poor about L. 85. Of this nearly L. 20 are 
required for the support of pauper lunatics. Many of the poor 
show a very commendable spirit of independence ; others exhibit a 
disposition the very reverse. Generally speaking, they look on 
public aid as degrading. 

Inns. — There are three inns in the parish. 

Fuel, 4c. — The fuel principally used is coal, brought from the 
parishes of Markinch and Dysart. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the former Statistical Account was written, improvements in 
the system of husbandry have enabled the farmer to raise nearly three 
times the quantity of agricultural produce. Rents are more than 
doubled ; the quantity of cloth manufactured is increased fourfold ; 
and the people generally have more comfortable houses, food, and 
clothing; but their toil is harder, and their leisure less. Know- 
ledge is more generally diffused ; but contentment and happiness 
have not been equally extended. External decorum is as much 
regarded as formerly ; but family worship is not so generally ob- 
served ; and the religious instruction of children and domestics is 
not so carefully attended to as in former times. Still, however, in 
the words of the former Statistical Account, " the general charac- 
ter of the people has always been, that they are industrious, regu- 
lar, quiet, and respectable. There are mixtures in the purest so- 
cieties. But this character is still merited by the present race in 
Monimail."

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. LAURENCE MILLER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish, Abdie or Ebtie, is supposed 
to be the Gaelic word abtaob signifying vmterside. According 
to Sibbald, the ancient name of the parish was Lindores, which 
is still the name of the principal village in it, a place of great an- 
tiquity. At what time the parish got the name of Abdie is uncer- 
tain. But it has been so called for many centuries; and the church 
of Abdie was always reckoned one of those belonging to the abbey 
of Lindores, which is situated about two miles from the village on 
the south bank of the Tay. 

Boundaries and Extent. — The parish was formerly of much 
greater extent than at present ; for in the year 1633 the whole of 
Newburgh parish was disjoined from it. By this disjunction, and 
by the intersections of the neighbouring parishes, it has become 
. very irregular in its figure, so that it is difficult to ascertain its ex- 
act dimensions. Perhaps if the scattered parts of it were united 
into one whole, it might form an area of about 6 miles in length, 
by 4 in breadth. It is bounded on the W. and N. W. by Aber- 
nethy and Newburgh ; on the S. and S. W. by Auchtermuchty 
and CoUessie ; on the S. E. the E. N. E. by Monimail, Dunbog, 
and Flisk ; and on the N. and E. by the Tay. 

Geolofjy and Mineralogy. — Limestone occurs on the farm of 
Parkhill ; and several attempts have been made to apply it as ma- 
nure, but these have been abandoned, on account of the distance 
of coal, and the unfavourable dip of the stratum. This rock be- 
longs to the old red sandstone formation of Werner. There is 
also a quarry of red freestone, near the same place, which has been 
wrought at some former period. Dr Fleming, it is said, discover- 
ed some fossil remains of plants in this district. There are several 
quarries of whinstone in the parish, used for building houses and

repairing roads ; but the trade of exporting it, mentioned in last 
account, has been almost entirely given up for some years. 

Climate, Soil. — The air is salubrious, no diseases here having 
been ever ascribed to the influence of the atmosphere. 

Owing to the unevenness of the ground, the nature of the soil 
is various. In the lower part of the parish, on the banks of the 
Tay, there is a very rich alluvial field of considerable extent, of 
the same quality with the Carse of Gowrie on the opposite side of 
the river ; on the ascent to the higher grounds, the soil becomes 
a deep black earth, or in some places light and gravelly, but 
still very productive.' At an average, an acre may yield from 
seven to ten bolls; but the acclivities of the mountains, which 
are partly covered with heath or furze, still continue to be pas- 
tured by sheep, which are of a mixed breed, and considerable pains 
have been taken to improve them. They are disposed of at vari- 
ous prices in the neighbourhood. There are likewise considerable 
numbers of various sorts annually fed off, on turnip, many of which 
are sent to the London market by steam-vessels from Dundee and 
Leith. Some of the hills are now planted towards the top, which 
will improve the appearance of the country, but such plantations 
are complained of as affording shelter to rabbits, which prey upon 
the crops. 

Botany.— la. the marshy ground near the loch, there grows the 
Cicnta virosa or water hemlock, or as it is provincially called, 
deaffi7i or deathin, peculiarly noxious to con s. Here too the MeJ2i/- 
anthes trifoliata grows in great abundance, and is used as a medi- 
cine, being a powerful bitter. The Nymplma liitea major or great 
water-lily, may also be mentioned as a plant that grows in all the 
lochs in this parish. 

Zoology.— Dnvmg the violent tornado of 1825, there appear- 
ed among the poultry here a very uncommon bird. It was of 
the size and colour of the wood-pigeon, and exactly of the figure 
of the lapwing. Its bill, which was an inch and a-half in length, 
was one quarter at the bottom, of the colour of red sealing wax, 
the rest to the point was a bright yellow. It had also a famt cn-cle 
of red around its eyes. It ran and flew with amazing rapidity. No 
attempt was made to tame it, but after being kept in the house for 
twenty-four hours, it was set at liberty, No satisfactory account 
has hitherto been got of this bird. The description which M'Loc 
gives of the greenshank approaches nearest it. The osprey or 
sea-eagle is sometimes seen on the banks of the lake; and an 



ABDIE.

islet near the west side of it, called the Maw Inch, was formerly 
the haunt of sea-mews or gulls, but they have now deserted it. 
Large flocks of crows and pigeons are very destructive to turnips, 
if left in the fields, in spring. 

Hills, Lakes, Sc. — Those natural objects of this sort that chiefly 
deserve attention are, the Clatchard Crag, Norman's Law, and the 
Loch of Lindores. The first is a majestic cliff a little to the south- 
east of Newburgh, about 250 feet above the road which passes near 
its base. 

Upon its summit, there are the remains of a fortification similar 
to some of the outworks of the Roman camp at Ardoch. Nor- 
man's Law the hill of the northern men is in height 850 feet 
above the sea level. It commands a most delightful prospect, espe- 
cially to the north, where the Carse of Gowrie and the Frith of 
Tay appear in full view in all their richness and variety. There 
are three concentric circles of rough stone near the top, supposed 
to have been a fortification of the Danes to cover their inroads into 
the country, or perhaps erected by the natives to repel these in- 
vaders. But by far the most interesting object here is the Loch 
of Lindores, covering an area of 70 acres of ground, and in some 
places 20 feet deep. This sheet of water is not only highly or- 
namental, but also very beneficial to the proprietors. And it so 
happens that, by a servitude upon it for supplying the mills, the 
water belongs to one proprietor, while the fish and the fowl belong 
to another. For the two last years, L. 15 or L. 17 have been given 
for the privilege of fowling and fishing upon it. It is frequented 
by ducks, teals, snipes, and other water fowl, and it abounds in 
pike, perch, and eel. A few reeds are sometimes cut for the roofs 
of houses. But the chief advantage is derived from the stream of 
water which flows from it, and which is sufficient, except in very 
dry summer weather, to turn five or six very valuable mills, whose 
yearly rent is more than could be obtained for the whole extent of 
the loch though it were converted into arable land. A saw mill 
has been lately erected, where a great quantity of fir and other 
wood is cut, it is said to the value of L. 1500 per annum, and 
disposed of in the neighbourhood, or exported at Newburgh to 
Newcastle and other places. A bone mill has also been set a-go- 
ing of late, and the corn and barley mills continue to be well em- 
ployed; but the fulling-mills and hnt-miUs mentioned in the former 
Report have been given up. The lake, when covered with ice, af- 
lords amusement to curlers. The stream, however, which feeds it, 
called the Priest's Burn, never freezes, and is never dried up, eveii

in the hottest weather. In the summer 1826, when all other stream- 
lets, and ahnost every neighbouring spring, was dry, this burn was 
still flowing. It rises from a moss about half a mile distant. 
II. — Civil History. 
Ancieni Land-owners.— Maicdni, Thane of Fife, may be reck- 
oned as one of these. This Earldom, after having been pos- 
sessed by many of his descendants, came into the hands of Mor- 
dac, Duke of Albany. He being beheaded at Stirling, his property 
in Fife, Monteath, and elsewhere, was annexed to the Crown by 
King James I., and the succeeding kings gave portions of it to their 
favourites at diff'erent times. In particular, the lands of Den- 
mill, which then comprehended the greatest part of the parish, 
" were given by James II., in the fourteenth year of his reign, to his 
beloved and famihar servant James Balfour, son of Sir John Bal- 
four of Balgarvie." As a proof of this fact, the mills on this estate 
are called the King's Mills in the charter of the present proprie- 
tor. This family was always in great favour at court. One of them 
followed James IV. to the battle of Flodden, and was killed there. 
Sir James Balfour of DenmiU and Kinnairdwas Lyon King at Arms 
to Charles I. and II., and an historian of considerable repute. The 
funeral monuments of the family are to be seen in an aisle of the 

old church. , , j e .\ 

John Lesly of ParkhiU may be mentioned as the leader oi tbe 
band that cut off Cardinal Beaton. He first entered the Castle 
of St Andrews, and gave the Cardinal the first mortal stroke with 
his dagger.

Eminent Men. — Admiral Maitland, one of the present land- 
owners in this parish, is well known as the Commander of the 
Bellerophon, which received Bonaparte at the conclusion of the 
late war with France. By his vigilance and circumspection, he 
prevented the escape of this great troubler of Europe from 
Basque roads. He has published a very entertaining narrative 
of the transactions he had with that celebrated personage and his 
attendants while they were with him in the ship. On all other 
occasions, when on active duty, he signalized himself by his intre- 
pidity and skill in naval affairs, and was esteemed one of the best 
officers in His Majesty's service. While at home, he was attentive 
to every scheme of public utility ; and particularly interested him- 
self in the erection of our new church. 

Parish Registers. — Baptisms and marriages have been register- 
ed with some interruptions from the year 1693. This is now more 
carefully done than formerly, though still there are many omissions. 

Antiquities. — The old church, which is now in ruins, may be 
traced to the beginning of the fifteenth century. There still remain 
in the porch the basin for the holy water, and, till lately, the steps 
that led to the altar. All around, are the monuments of former 
times. We have the Lecturer's Inch, the Teind Knowe, and a 
park at Lindores called the Glebe. I have in my possession se- 
veral old coins that were found in the neighbourhood ; among these 
is a shilling of the reign of one of the Jameses, having on the obverse 
a crowned head, and on the margin-iej; Scotorum ; on the reverse, 
a cross, with the words villi Edinbiirgi ; also a sixpence, having on 
the obverse a crowned head, with the letters  Ediu. on the mar- 
gin, and on the reverse a cross, with the word vici very legible. 
Urns containing bones and ashes are occasionally dug up. One 
very lately, of rude workmanship, was met with at the foot of Clat- 
chard Crag, containing a skull and some bones. It was deposited 
between three or four large stones placed together in the form of 
a coffin. There was found nearer the abbey, several years ago, a re- 
pository of the same kind containing a great number of very small 
bones. In the village of Lindores, there are the vestiges of an 

lost his eye-sight by the small pox, but, notwithstanding, attained to great proficiency 
in almost every branch of liberal knowledge. He traversed the country as a lecturer 
on chemistry and all the branches of natural philosophy. But his favourite subjects 
were optics and the phenomena of light and colours. These he illustrated with pe- 
culiar propriety and suscess in spite of that bereavement of sight under which he la- 
brother "massed a considerable fortune, which was bequeathed chiefly to his

old castle, said to have belonged to Duncan Macduff, first Thane 
or Earl of Fife,— which is rendered extremely probable, by the 
circumstance, that the pedestal of his cross, the badge of the 
family, is still to be seen about a mile to the westward. Sir 
James Balfour, in his Annals, speaks of a battle that was fought, 
between the Scots under Wallace and the English, in June anno 
1300, near the Castle of Lindores, in which 3000 of the latter 
were killed and 500 taken prisoners. This castle of Lindores is 
also mentioned in the history of Wallace, as the place to which 
that hero and his companions retired after the battle. 

Mansion-Houses.— There are four of these lately built; but only 
two of the heritors reside. The most remarkable of these mansions 
is the house of Inchrye, which cost L. 12,000. It is hi the Gothic 
style of architecture, with a verandah in front, and adorned with tur- 
rets and battlements. From various points this most romantic build- 
ing is seen to great advantage, but especially from the high road 
that leads from Trafalgar inn to Newburgh. There it presents 
itself to the view of the delighted traveller, with its lawns and mea- 
dows, and woods fringing the lake. Proceeding westward, another 
picturesque object appears, the House of Lindores, the residence 
of Admiral Maitland, situated upon an eminence ; and farther on, 
the new church, with its pillared belfry overlooking the waters. 
This is, on the whole, a delightful scene, and, were the plantations 
a little more advanced, might vie in beauty with places of greater 
celebrity.

The farms are about twenty in number. Their yearly rent trom 
L 1200 to L. 100, part of which is generally paid in grain. The 
leases are for nineteen years. The farmers are active, industrious, 
and intelligent, eager to adopt every plan by which the soil or

the crops may be meliorated. In consequence of the improved 
mode of cultivation, and the draining and bringing in of waste land, 
the- quantity of grain raised is greater by one-third than it was 
at the time of last Report. The farm-steadings are excellent ; 
most of them lately erected. On all the larger farms there are 
cot towns, where the servants reside. The men-servants' wages 
are from L. 10 to L. 12 a-year, with two pecks meal per week ; the 
maid-servants get from L. 5 to L. 7. 

The draught horses may be reckoned in number about 200, 
milch cows, 110. Butter costs 8d per lb. ; cheese, 5d. There are 
5 smiths in the parish. When paid by the year, they get as wages 
L. 13 or L. 14; when by the day, 2s. Iron ploughs are now ge- 
nerally used, one of which costs L. 3, 10s. ; a brake of 3 harrows 
costs L. 3, 6s. ; and a cart, L. 10. There are 3 carpenters be- 
sides apprentices ; they get 2s. a-day. There are 3 shoemakers 
besides servants and apprentices. A pair of shoes costs 9s. There 
are 2 tailors, paid Is. 3d. per day with victuals. There are 4 car- 
ters ; they earn 5s. a-day ; 4 inn-keepers who have too much 
business; 3 shepherds; 108 weavers, male and female, earn a 
little more than Is. per day. Reapers are generally paid at L. 1, 10s. 
or L. 2 per season, or 12s. per acre, or 3d. or 4d. per thrave. 
Bell's reaping-machine is lised on one of the farms. Every far- 
mer has a thrashing-mill, and the use of the flail is discontinued. 
A stock-market has been established at Newburgh, and all sorts 
of grain are disposed of there every week for ready money. Grain 
and potatoes are exported to a great extent. 

Produce. — The average yearly value of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Grain, . L. 14898 

Potatoes, turnips, . 3151 

Hay, . . 1719

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — In nothing does the spirit of improve- 
ment appear more visible and beneficial than in the construction 
and repairing of roads. We are not now obliged as heretofore to 
ascend " the lofty mountain's weary side." Three turnpikes pass 
through the parish, each the length of six miles, — besides another 
upon the statute labour not so good. A coach passes daily from 
Perth to Kirkaldy through the middle of the parish ; and there 
is ready access to Perth and Dundee by the Tay steam-boats.

Ecclesiastical State— The Earl of Mansfield is patron ; and tliis 
right is derived to him from Mr Andrew Murray, one of his ances- 
tors, who was minister here, and also patron. He was a person of 
eminence in the church, and gained the favour of Charles I. by the 
discretion and authority with which he acted in the General As- 
sembly at Glasgow, 1638. He came to the peerage as Lord Bal- 
vaird in 1641, but was prohibited by the Assembly from bearing 
improper titles. Perhaps, like Archbishop Leighton, he did not 
think the pompous title of my Lord would add anything to the dig- 
nity of his character. He died on the 4th September 1644, the 
third year after his elevation. 

The church was built in 1827. It may accommodate 500 or 
600. It is a plain substantial building, planned by Burn, and cost 
about L. 1200. The manse was built in 1721. The offices are 
new.f 

By a locality dated 1650, the stipend, called there the mortified 
rent of the parish, was at that time 55 bolls bear ; 83 bolls meal 
and oats; and L. 133, 6s. 8d. Scots. It is now 15 chalders, half 
meal and half barley, paid by the fiars of the county, with L. 10 
vicarage, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The old glebe 
is four acres arable in extent. The grass glebe consists of six acres 
in arable meadow pasture. There was a long litigation about it, first 
before the Court of Session, and then carried by appeal to the 
House of Lords. It terminated in favour of the minister in 1815. 
The people are in general regular in their habits, and well affect- 
ed to the constitution, both in church and state. Only four or 
five families are Seceders. 

Education.— The parish school is attended by 30 scholars in 
summer, and about 40 or 50 in winter. They are taught chiefly 
reading, 2s. per quarter; writing, 2s. 6d. ; and arithmetic, 3s. 
The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, and his whole income 
is L. 60 a-year. There is also at present a school taught by a fe- 
male, attended by a few girls. Several of the children are very 
near the schools at Newburgh, Dunbog, and Collessie, and attend 
there. Teachers complain that children do not remain at school

their parents, to go to a trade, or to work for their livelihood before 
their education be completed. 

Poor. — There are 12 at present on the roll, but the average 
number may be 7 or 8. They are supported by the session fund, 
which consists of the interest of L. 320, a small mortification, and 
the collections at the church door. There are 4 lunatics, 2 furi- 
ous, and confined in the asylums of Perth and Dundee, 2 others 
tractable, and kept in the country. The rest are old infirm people. 
The whole are maintained for about L. 50 a-year, of which the 
heritors contribute a part by a voluntary assessment. The church 
collections amount to about L. 14 per annum. L. 200 of the poors' 
money was lost lately by the failure of the person in whose hands 
it was placed. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It would contribute greatly to the comfort of the parish, could 
the necessary articles of coal and lime be procured at a more rea- 
sonable rate. They are very dear at present. Whether coals are 
bought at Newburgh shore, or sent for to the Balbirnie or other 
coal pits, they cost 10s. a single cart load, and lime is proportion- 
ally expensive. Therefore, a railway has been talked of from the 
New Inn to Newburgh, and I doubt not but in some future time 
this improvement may take place. It would also be desirable, could 
the waters of the lake be confined within a narrower compass by 
such operations as have lately been carried through at Lochleven. 
By these means, a more equable supply of water might be furnish- 
ed to the mills, and many acres of marshy and useless ground might 
be rendered arable. This, too, is an improvement which the lapse 
of time may bring about. Much has been done since last Report ; 
many waste acres have been reclaimed ; the hills are now cultivated 
nearer to the summit ; the grounds are better enclosed ; and the 
houses and cottages much improved.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JOHN ANDERSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Sc. — The parish of Newburgh was created in the year 
1632, by an act of separation and disjunction from Abdie, and ob- 
viously derived its name from that of the town, which contains nearly 
its whole inhabitants, and which has existed from a very early period. 
Borough towns and corporations are not older in Scotland than 
the eleventh century ; and very early in the thirteenth, mention 
is made of the " Novus burgus juxta Monasterium de Lindoris." 
It appears from a register of the abbey, that the inhabitants were 
bound to pay to the abbot there " a ferm of a merit" annually, for 
every brew-house with an acre of land in the said new burgh. 
Among other reasons for the erection of the parish, it is set forth 
in the deed of disjunction, that " whereas the kirks of Ebdie and 
Newburgh have been separate these many years by-past, by act of 
Synodial Assemblie, &amp;c. humbly desire therefore the said commis- 
sioners to ratify the said separation." The separation alluded to 
and craved to be affirmed was effected in the year 1622, under the 
sanction and authority of the Archbishop of St Andrews. By a 
subsequent application to the commissioners, a portion of the pa- 
rish of Abernethy was disjoined and annexed to that of Newburgh. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish, which forms the eastern 
boundary of Strathearn, extends about 2 miles at its greatest length 
from east to west, and about 3 miles in breadth from north to south. 
It is bounded by the river Tay on the north; on the east, south, 
and west by the parishes of Abdie and Abernethy ; its southern ex- 
tremity also touches Auchtermuchty and CoUessie. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its figure is very irregular, being 
nearly divided into two separate sections, by the encroachments 
of Abdie on the east, and Abernethy on the west, giving to the 
southern portion the form of a triangle, while the northern as- 
sumes very much the appearance of the rhomboid. The extent 



NEWBURGH. 



57 



of coast, washed by the river Tay, is about two miles, the east- 
ern portion being low and flat, and the western towards Mugdrum, 
rising gently into a sort of table land, thence continuing its ascent 
to the south, till it attains an elevation of about 800 feet at the 
Black Cairn, which forms the summit. Alternate elevations and de- 
pressions mark its progress southwards, when at Pitcairly it begins 
to assume a gentle slope, fringed on the east, for a considerable 
distance, by a rivulet which issues from Loch-mill, and falls into 
the Eden at Auchtermuchty. An arm of the parish projects to 
wards the south-west, reaching an elevation of about 600 feet at 
Craig-sparrow ; the ridge which terminates in that abrupt rock near 
to Newburgh on the south-east, which excites the admiration and 
sometimes awakens the terror of strangers in passing along the road 
immediately under it, belongs to the parish of Abdie. Here it 
sweeps along in a beautiful level by the ruins of Lindores, bound- 
ed on the east by a streamlet which issues from the lake of the same 
name, and falls into the Tay at the Pow, which forms the north- 
east point of the parish. 

Climate, Diseases, cc, — The climate is healthy and salubrious. 
The northern district of the parish may be reckoned an exposed 
situation, where the north-east winds blow up the Frith of Tay with 
piercing keenness during certain months of the year; but, from the 
hills which skirt it on the south, the towft is more than ordinarily 
sheltered from the prevailing gales in that direction. There are 
no marsh or fen lands in the parish, and it does not appear that 
the rains are either more frequent or copious than in the surround- 
ing district. The fogs which prevail so much in Strathearn dur- 
ing the winter and spring months are almost unknown. Attract- 
ed, accordingly, by the beauty of the situation, and its easy access 
by steam and coach conveyance, families from a distance are be- 
ginning to resort to the town of Newburgh during summer ; and 
certainly a more agreeable retreat for change of air and recreation 
can scarcely be supposed. The most common diseases are fevers, 
consumptions, and dysenteries. 

Hydrography. —The Tay forms the northern boundary of the 
parish, and, though running through no part of it, may well find a 
place in the Statistical Account of any district that reaches to its 
borders. This noble river, having received the accession of the 
water of the Earn, begins to assume at Newburgh the appearance 
of an arm of the sea. It is there about two miles broad. When the 
tide is full, its waters are always brackish, and after long droughts,

contain a very considerable quantity of saline matter, although it 
does not appear that any marine plants approach nearer than two 
miles from this place. Mugdrum Island, which belongs to the parish 
of Abernethy, divides the river into two nearly equal portions, — 
where, collecting itself into two currents, it passes along the oppo- 
site sides of the island, in what are termed the North and South 
Deeps, the South Deep forming the principal channel, and furnish- 
ing the course which vessels of burden usually hold, in passing up 
and down the river. Ships of 500 tons burden reach the shore at 
Newburgh ; but above the confluence of the Earn, several miles be- 
yond which Perth is situated, vessels of 150 tons, when deep laden, 
proceed with difficulty. A dredging-machine has lately been erect- 
ed for deepening the upper part of the channel, and meantime, to re- 
medy the difficulties of navigation, a steamer has been employed in 
dragging up lighters, which convey the cargoes of the larger vessels 
that land at Dundee, in which the foreign trade of Perth is carried on. 
Operations are now going on upon a very extensive scale for con- 
tracting the North Deep, by projecting stone dikes from the op- 
posite banks into the bed of the river, where the intervening spaces 
rapidly silt up, and form in a few years solid alluvial deposits, fit, 
when embanked, for agricultural purposes. Mugdrum Island and 
the adjacent carses have already received great accessions in this 
way, and the period cannot be far distant, when, if these changes 
proceed at their present rate, a former state of things will return 
of which tradition still speaks, when the inhabitants dwelling on the 
opposite banks of " the lordly Tay" conversed together across its 
channel. The majesty of the stream will be thereby greatly di- 
minished, but its utility, both in an agricultural and commercial point 
of view, will be proportionally enhanced. 

Many excellent springs are to be found within the limits of the 
parish, from which the town is supplied with a constant and copious 
flow of that first necessary of life. One of these springs, which 
rises in the south-west, in the hilly district, is called the Nine Wells; 
and though that precise number of openings cannot now be traced, 
there is little doubt, as tradition relates, that the name was really 
descriptive of the true character of the fountain. The discharge 
from the several openings is copious and of the purest quality, and 
beingimmediately collected into one current, forms no inconsiderable 
stream, which has lately been profitably employed in the operations 
of a bleachfield. Here, amidst the barbarous practices of a bygone 
age, those who claimed the privileges of clan Macduff at the cross.

which stands in the immediate vicinity, were required to wash off 
the stains from their murderous hands, to which reference is made 
in the well known inscription on that ancient monument, 

" And by their only washing at this stone, 
Purged is the blood, shed by that generation." 

Geology, Soil. — The county of Fife, of which the parish of New- 
burgh forms the north-west extremity, may be regarded in a geolo- 
gical view as one of the most interesting in the whole island, rich 
in organic remains, and in all those important facts which belong 
to the carboniferous era. Although this parish partakes of few or 
none of its distinguishing characteristics, one or two observations 
may be permitted on the materials in its immediate neighbourhood, 
from which the relative position of its own may be best ascertain- 
ed, and in which some interesting valuable facts recently brought 
to light may be stated. Immediately on the east, along the mar- 
gin of the Tay, the old red sandstone appears, on which there rests 
a bed of limestone, and corresponding to this on the opposite side 
of the river, a similar bed is to be found in the property of Mewrie. 
Not far from the limestone and nearer to Newburgh, there is a bed 
of calmstone with vegetable impressions, and the flowering portion, 
in considerable numbers, of what Dr Fleming considers a Scirpus. 
It lies immediately under clinkstone trap, and although the junc- 
tion cannot be traced with regard to the sand and limestones, its 
position is unquestionably that of an upper member of the series. 
A similar bed, with identically the same impressions, occurs near 
the mouth of the river in the parish of Arbroath. The parish 
of Abernethy, on the west, likewise displays sections of the old 
red sandstone, and at a very elevated position, on the very sum- 
mit of the Ochils, a conglomerate bed of limestone may be ob- 
served. Near the church of Dron, a clayslate or calmstone, simi- 
lar to that on the east of Newburgh, occurs in the same relative 
position to the stratified and amorphous rocks, but without, as far 
as has yet been observed, vegetable impressions. Intermediate be- 
tween what has now been described, rises the parish of Newburgh, 
in one unbroken undulating mass of trap, the lower portion, imme- 
diately above the town, being a fine-grained porphyritic greenstone; 
that in the higher ridges approaches to a compact feldspar, and on 
the property of Pitcairly, beds of trap tuffa may be traced. In the 
small veins which occur abundantly in the greenstone, may be ob- 
served crystals of quartz, carbonate of lime, barytes and olivine ; the 
feldspar rocks contain nodules of claystone and jaspery agates, the

latter very numerous, and approaching in character and beauty to 
the Mocha-stone. The parks or table land of Mugdrum is an ac- 
cumulation of the debris of the old red sandstone and other gravelly 
matter, of great depth, and furnishes, in a geological point of view, 
some interesting problems as to the causes of its accumulation, at 
this particular spot. Peat occurs immediately on the south, where 
the surface dips considerably, forming the bed of a loch which has 
been lately drained, and in the low fields of Pitcairly, there is 
abundance of the same fossil. 

Along the sides and summits of the hills, boulders of the primi- 
tive rocks, granite, gneiss, quartz, mica-slate with garnets, and pri- 
mitive greenstone, occur in the greatest abundance, and many of 
them of the most unwieldy dimensions. Towards their base, and 
skirting the southern boundary of the valley, there are various ac- 
cumulations of a fine dark-red sand, containing rolled masses from 
a few inches to one foot in diameter, which belong for the most 
part to the secondary rocks. The materials, in both cases, have 
evidently been brought from the west, and considering that the 
heaviest boulders occupy the most elevated position, are we not 
warranted to infer the existence of two separate currents, of unequal 
magnitude and of different ages, as the agents of transportation  
This remark apphes to several of the adjacent parishes, where si- 
milar appearances may be observed. 

A well, which was lately opened here, on the sloping bank be- 
neath the town, exhibits the following interesting beds, and affords 
the geologist an excellent illustration of the alluvium formation in 
this quarter. It is 30 feet in depth, and intersects four distinct 
deposits. The first of these, about 5 feet thick, is a rich alluvial 
clay, common to all the lowlands in the district: a bed of peat suc- 
ceeds, composed of the usual materials which are found in that 
substance, with the addition of branches of the Alnus glutinosa and 
Corylus avellana, and many minute seeds belonging, apparently, 
from their angular shape, to the Carex tribe of plants. This bed is 
about 2 feet thick, and belongs to the great deposit which extends 
throughout Strathearn and the lower basin of the Tay. Under 
the peat, is a deposit of 2 feet thick, of extremely fine sand, of a 
light-blue colour, and very unctuous in its character ; it contains 
a considerable quantity of magnesia, which may be derived from 
the decomposition of steatite, so abundant in the greenstone in the 
neighbourhood. But what is most remarkable here is the fact, 
that this matter is confined entirely to this single bed— not a par-

tide of which is to be found in the superincumbent peat, or in the 
underlying stratmii. What peculiar agency has produced this  
The lowest bed of the series and the depth of which is unknown, 
is a plastic clay or till, containing boulders of the secondary rocks, 
mixed up with the debris of the old red sandstone. The surface 
of the ground here is about 40 feet above the level of the Tay, 
and the geologist will naturally inquire, whether it occupied the 
same level, or what was its condition, during the formation of the 
above-mentioned deposits  

The soil in the upper part of the parish, though generally of 
little depth, is of great fertility. It mostly consists of either a loose 
black loam, or of a more compact ferruginous mould. Here the 
entire property of Pitcairly, through an intelligent and enterprising 
tenantry, has been brought into the highest state of cultivation, and 
marks itself out to the traveller among the Ochils as an insulated 
spot of singular beauty and fertility. The soil on the north-east 
of the town, where the ground is low and flat, consists of the richest 
clay, not inferior to the best portions of the Carse of Gowrie.  

Botany. — It were easy to give a full and detailed account of this 
branch of natural history, as the writer has examined, he thinks, 
every plant within the bounds of the parish, with the exception of 
the Lichens and some of the Fungi. The celebrated Don used fre- 
quently to traverse this neighbourhood, and the results of his re- 
searches are amply detailed in"his Catalogue as well as in Hooker's 
Flora Scotica, where, from the frequency of reference, the student 
will find that Newburgh, in proportion to its extent, contributes 
liberally to the Flora of the island. Along with the usual plants 
common in the neighbourhood, the following are of rarer occurrence. 
On the banks of Tay and woods of Mugdrum, along with seven or 
eight species of Ranunculus, the Lt/chnis, Valeriana, Veronica, Scir- 
pus, Carex, Juncus, and Glaux, there are to be found Geum rivale, 
Alisma plantago, Cicuta virosa, Iris pseudacoriis, Arundo phrag- 
mites, Artemisia maritima, Senecio aquaticus ; also Gnaphalium 
supinum and gallicum, Erythrcea pulchella, Gentiana campestris, 

" The soil within the enclosures of the Abbey is a remarkably deep black loam, 
which, as tradition will have it, was brought by the monks from Ireland, and is there- 
fore untrodden by venomous reptiles  Classical authority can be adduced to attest 
the fact, although experience be against it. " Serpentes alit innoxios. Nullumque 
venenatum animal ibi aluit." — Lesly's Historia Scotica. " Neminem enim a serpenti- 
bus lividis in ea unquam est visum. Necq. in ulla circum regionc Scotia; tanta eorum 
copia conspectum. Ipse vidi adoloscentem puerili ludo in campo salicntem in me- 
dium colubrorum gregem inoidisse ac intactum illorsum abysse."— Boethius, Vita Wil.

Dispsacus sylvestris, Asperula odorata, Lythrum soLicaria Reseda 
luteola and lutea, Agrimonia Eupatoria, &amp;c. 

Within the small enclosure of the ruins of Lindores, we meet 
with a variety of plants, some of which are rare, if not extirpated 
entirely in the district; of these may be noticed the Hyoscyamus 
niyer, which was once abundant in the neighbourhood. Like the 
wild beasts of our forests, it has been expelled from our fields ; 
only one plant, of surpassing stateliness and beauty, reared its head 
this season, and none have been seen for many years. The Ga- 
lanthus nivalis is becoming equally shy in its chilly modest aspect ; 
but in abundance may be found Cynoglossum officinale, Mercuria- 
lis perennis, Scrophularia vernalis and nodosa. Erysimum alliaria, 
Hyacinthus non-scriptus, Stellaria holostea, Verhascum lonchitis. 
Allium ursinum, Parietaria officinalis, Chelidonium majus, Ber- 
heris vulgaris, Papaver somniferum, only once observed ; Lac- 
tuca virosa, Malva sylvestris, &amp;c. ; of the Filices, the Scolopendrium, 
Blechnum, and Adiantum are in abundance. 

In the hilly district we have the Pyrola media, Parnassia palus- 
tris, Pedicularis palustris, Linum catharticum, Genista anglica. 
Primula veris, Oxalis acetosella, Pinguicula vulgaris, Nymphcea al- 
ba, and Nuphar lutea. Among the grasses, Poadecumbens, Briza me- 
dia, Eriophorum capitatum, and Anthoxanthum odoratum : of Musci, 
Brijum, Bartramia, Grimmia, Hypnum, Polytrichum : of Fungi, 
along with the Agaricus 8 species, the Phallus fcetidus is sometimes 
met with. 

The principal woods are, Mugdrum, covering a surface along 
the banks of the Tay of about 34 imperial acres, and consisting 
chiefly of spruce and larch firs ; those of Pitcairly, extending to about 
12 imperial acres, which contain a considerable portion of the hard 
woods, ash, beech, elm, and plane-tree, interspersed with the usu- 
al varieties of coniferce ; about 41 imperial acres of the town's pro- 
perty has been lately planted with larch, spruce, and Scotch firs. 
No portion of the ancient wood of Earnside now exists, not even a 
vestige of its brushwood. The Abbey of Lindores, which, Camb- 
den says, " was placed among the woods," can still boast of a few 
fruit trees, which, though in ruins like itself, attract the notice of 
the passenger by their superb venerable appearance. The identi- 
cal trees of which Sir Robert Sibbald speaks, "witness the vastly 
big old pear trees there," as a proof of the richness of the soil, 
are still many of them remaining. The orchards of much later ori- 
gin, in the immediate vicinity of the town, are in a very thriving

condition, abound in fruit of the finest quality, and covering an 
extent, as they do, of nearly 40 imperial acres, are a source of con- 
siderable profit to their proprietors. It is impossible, while touch- 
ing on the subject of trees, those easy bought beauties of nature, 
not to lament that the hilly ridges on the south and east of New- 
burgh should have been suffered to remain so long unplanted. 
Letus hope that their present proprietor, into whose hands they have 
lately passed, will add to his deserved reputation as one of the 
most successful agriculturists in Fife, by adorning with a few clumps 
of plantation the sloping eminences of these picturesque hills. 

II. — Civil History. 
The town of Newburgh, from the charter already referred to, 
seems to be coeval with the erection of the monastery of Lindores. 
It was early created a burgh of regality, under the abbot of that 
place ; and as these monastic institutions were then the sole depo- 
sitaries of learning, and the centres whence civilization and im- 
provements of every kind were diffused around, Newburgh unques- 
tionably is indebted for its origin, as well as most of its privileges, 
to its vicinity to the abbey. The inhabitants are uniformly ad- 
dressed as the " Nostri hurgenses" of the ecclesiastical authorities 
there, and the whole property possessed by the burgh in the 
Woodriff and adjacent hills was derived from the same. In the 
year 1600, James VI. erected the abbacy of Lindores into a tem- 
poral lordship ; and in the year 1631, Charles I. granted a char- 
ter to the town of Newburgh, forming the community into a pro- 
per royal burgh, with all the immunities and privileges that are 

• King Alexander HI. granted to the abbot and convent of Lindores, "ut ipsi et 
eorum successores in perpetuum habeant villain eorumque dicitur novus burgusjux- 
ta monasterium de Lindores in liberum burgum ; et forum in eodem burgo quolibet 
die Martis cum libertatibus burgi et fori, salvis in omnibus burgorum nostrorum li- 
bertatibus." 

On the 4th July 1457, Abbot John granted to the burgesses of Newburgh the land 
of Vodrufe and the hill to the south of it, for which they were to pay to the Abbot 
homage and common service, use and wont, of forty bolls of barley. Among the sti- 
pulations for enforcing the conditions of this contract, it is provided, " Si contingat 
aliquem vel aliquos predictorum burgensium procurare prece vel pretio aliquera 
nobilem seu dominum in fomentum et auxilium oppositionis eorum in contra- 
riura et prejudicium libertatis et privilegii nostri abbatis et conventus et ipse et ip-

usually conferred on such corporations. Along with Falkland and 
Auchtermuchty, it early lost, or ceased to exercise, its right in the 
election of a representative to Parliament ; and though from its 
rapidly increasing population and greatly extended trade, so as to 
render it the third town in commercial enterprise in Fife, its for- 
mer privilege might fairly have been restored under the new char- 
ter, its voice has been allowed to merge in the general constituen- 
cy of the county. By the returns of the last registration the town 
and parish number eighty voters. In all other respects, New- 
Burgh retains the features of a royal burgh ; its revenue, though 
still inconsiderable, has greatly increased of late years, being 
about L. 170. It has two magistrates and a weekly court, fifteen 
councillors, and a clerk to record its public proceedings. In the 
progress of its civil history, nothing remarkable has been made the 
subject of record ; it has given birth to many respectable indivi- 
duals, but the writer can discover no name in its annals that would 
require a separate notice under the head of " Eminent Men." 

Land-owners. — The present land-owners are, David Balfour 
Hay, Esq. of Leys, proprietor of Mugdrum and the lands of Lin- 
dores, amounting to 400 imperial acres ; Taylor Cathcart, Esq. pro- 
prietor of Pitcairly, 429 imperial acres. The extent of property be- 
longing to the borough is 178 imperial acres; and the remainder 
of the parish, amounting to 24 imperial acres, is shared among 
twenty smaller proprietors, called here, as in other parts of the 
country, portioners. To these latter belong the sections of the 
out-field land of the Woodriff, which are called half-parts, but 
most of which have recently been purchased by the proprietor of 
Mugdrum. 

Parochial Registers. — The records of the kirk-session date from 
the year 1652. In the earlier period they have been very correct- 
ly kept, and contain many interesting allusions to passing events.  

Antiquities. — At the north-east extremity of the parish near the 
river Tay, on a gentle rise, in the middle of a rich and extensive 
flat of clay land, appear the ruins of the Abbey of Lindores. Con- 
cerning the history of this abbey, while it continued under the 
power of the church, or after it was erected into a temporal lord- 
ship, nothing remarkable has been recorded by the annalists of the 
times, except that, from its great wealth and extensive privileges, it

seems to have been an object of ambition to the aspiring ecclesi- 
astics of the day. It was founded by David Earl of Huntingdon 
in the year 1178, in memory of his taking Ptolemais in the Holy 
Land. It was bestowed upon the monks of St Benedict, of the 
order of the Tironenses, was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St 
Andrew the apostle, and from grants bestowed upon it, from time 
to time, it came to be one of the most richly endowed monasteries 
in the kingdom. The founder of it died at Geconlay, and was 
buried at Soltray in the year 1219. Robert the Bruce pretend- 
ed to the crown by his mother, daughter to this Earl, in 1218. St 
Bernard was the founder of the order at Tiron of France, who, in 
addition to the rules instituted by St Benedict, added new regula- 
tions of his own, which required that each of the brethren should 
practise within the convent whatever mechanical art he knew. Ac- 
cordingly, the monasteries of the order contained within them paint- 
ers, carvers, carpenters, smiths, masons, vine-dressers, and hus- 
bandmen, who were under the direction of an elder, and the pro- 
fits of their work were applied to the common use. 

David I. was the greatest benefactor of the order, who visited 
the original monastery, and on his return sent for thirteen monks 
in the year 1113, whom he afterwards made provision for in the 
monastery of Kelso, which was erected in the immediate vicinity 
of his palace there. The monasteries of Aberbrothoc, Lindores, 
and Kilwinning were planted from Kelso; but the Abbot John grant- 
ed a charter, in which he quits all claim to the subjection and 
obedience of the Abbot of Aberbrothoc; and it is probable that the 
convents of Lindores and Kilwinning obtained a similar exemption, 
as there is no mention of their being subject to the parent monas- 
tery. 

In the chartulary of Lindores preserved in the Advocates' Library 
there are two charters of Earl David, by the one of which he grants 
" to the church of St Mary and St Andrew of Lindoris, and the 
monks there serving God, the island which is called Fedinch, Mug- 
drum  and all the fishings in Tay, adjoining the said island, ex- 
cept one, VIZ. a yair at Tolcrik :" and by the other, the Earl gives 
to his monks of Lindores « a right of taking stone from his quarry 
in Irneside, both for their church and other buildings." By an- 
other charter, King William the Lyon granted to the Abbey a full 
tott in each of the royal burghs of Berwick, Strivolen Stirhng, 
rail, lerth, Forfare, Munros, Aberdene.— Alexander III. in two 
charters granted « to the abbot and convent their whole wood in 



66 FIFESHIRE. 

the fee of Fyntreth, and their whole wood with their lands of Lin- 
doris in free forestry." Isabella de Brous gave to the abbey her 
land of Cragyn, near Dundee, with all her land in the town of Mel- 
neton, and in the town of Abraham villa Abrahe. James II. 
granted to the abbey " his lands of ParkhiU, and also the office of 
forestry of his wood of Ironside, lying in the lands of Parkhdl m 

Fyfe." J . , . 

Of the abbots and other dignified clergy connected with this 

monastery, not many particulars have been recorded. Fordun 
mentions Guido as the first, and that he was succeeded by Tho- 
mas, a man of great sanctity ; upon whose death, John, one of the 
priors, was raised to the dignity of abbot. This individual was 
buried at Kelso, and was succeeded by Nicholas Cellerarius de 
Lindores. One name in the list of more distinguished eminence 
occurs, Lawrence, who had been a Doctor of Civil Law at St An- 
drews, and was associated with Bishop Wardlaw in laying the foun- 
dation of a university there. « Magnus Theologus et vitae venerabi- 
lis vir," we can therefore believe him to have been; but as if to tar- 
nish the lustre derived from this literary achievement, the same au- 
thority has recorded of him, " et heretico pravitatis inquisitor," and 
instances the case of Jacob Resby, an English priest, and one of the 
followers of Wykhff, whom he condemned to be burned at Perth, 
upon a charge of forty articles of heresy. He was the first individual 
in Scotland who suffered for anti-papistry, in the year 1408, a cu- 
rious account of whose trial is given in the Scotichromcon. At 
this period, a new impulse was given to learnmg; the long night 
of comparative ignorance and superstition was giving way to the 
rising dawn of knowledge and truth ; its light had already expos- 
ed many of the errors of papal theology, and was marshalling the 
way to that removal of its corruptions which was completed in the 
succeeding century at the Reformation. Many of the clergy and 
even monks and friars in England, had embraced the opinions of 
the proto-reformers, Wykliff and Huss. Lawrence of Lindores 
seems to have been a man of great firmness and decision, and was 
raised by the Pope to the high office of Inquisitor m Scotland; 
and we soon after find him engaged in the condemnation of ano- 
ther heretic, one Paul Crawar, a Bohemian, who came into this 
country as a physician. Pie embraced with great zeal and suc- 
cess the opportunities which his profession afforded him, of in- 
culcating his opinions, but was speedily interrupted in the midst 



NEWnUIlGH. 



67 



of his useful labours, and was burned at St Andi-ews in the year 
1433. 

Knox speaks of one Lesly, who was Abbot of Lindores and 
Bishop of Ross, whom he calls Priest-gate, but is afterwards fa- 
vourably mentioned by him as having " put some reformation to 
his place, anno 1560." He was chosen a Lord of the Articles in 
Parliament held in that year. Patrick of Lindores succeeded him, 
and was appointed one of the undertakers for planting lowland men 
in the isle of Lewis, 1602. The last notice of any of these digni- 
taries is contained in Calderwood's History, where, among the num- 
ber of those who were assembled at Westminster in 1606, to deli- 
berate on the comparative merits of Episcopacy and Presbytery, 
" John Abbot of Lindores" is simply mentioned as being present. 
And thus terminates with him the obscure history of a monastery 
which once possessed the patronage of twenty-two parish churches, 
and claimed a right of property in seven of the chief royal burghs 
of Scotland. 

Corresponding to the wealth of the institution, the buildings, 
which are now in utter ruins, appear to have been on a scale of 
suitable magnitude, and, if an opinion can be formed from the spe- 
cimens which remain, clothed as they now are with clustering piles 
of ivy, they display a style of architecture which reflects credit on 
the taste of our forefathers. The vestibule of the church, which 
occupies the centre of the building, is yet in such a state of pre- 
servation, as to indicate at once the extent and character of the 
work, and which, along with the massiveness of the walls, irresistibly 
lead the spectator to conclude that it must have been both a spa- 
' cious and elegant structure. In the process of dilapidation to 
which it was most unceremoniously subjected, but which is now 
fortunately interdicted, a stone coffin was exhumed, which is said 
to have contained the body of the Duke of Rothsay, who was so 
; barbarously murdered in the palace of Falkland, and privately in- 
■ terred, according to Winton, in this monastery. Here unquestion- 
ably the last of the noble house of Douglas found an asylum,f and

after a chequered life, spent amidst the toils and cruelties of civil 
war, engaged in the cloistered services of a penitent eccles-iastic ; 
but no inscription points out the place of his interment, and whe- 
ther the coffin raaj' be his, or that of the unfortunate prince to 
whom tradition has assigned it, is a point which cannot now be sa- 
tisfactorily determined. Of the famous causeway, which extended 
between Lindores and the church of Ecclesia Magirdum, in the 
parish of Dron, whither the monks annually went to meet the nuns 
of Elcho, who there paid their devotions to their patron saint, not 
a vestige remains. In the hills on the south of the ruin, the 
Monks' and the Abbots' Wells are still pointed out to strangers, but 
the present generation have even lost the recollection, as they re- 
pose but little faith in their virtues, of the many miraculous cures 
which, at no very remote period, were ascribed to these waters. 
Upon the whole, the ruins of the Abbey of Lindores cannot be said 
to present anything remarkable to the prying eye of the antiquary, 
as the imperfect record of its affairs contains little interesting to 
the historian ; stately fruit trees ascend from the floors of its once 
sacred halls, and, interspersed as these are with ivy, hazel, and 
flowers of all hues and colour, viewed in conjunction with moulder- 
ing fragments of the building, give to the place at large a pictu- 
resque, but melancholy air of grandeur. 

The parish likewise contains two crosses of remote antiquity. 
One of these is situated a little to the westward of the town, among 
the woods, and usually called by the local name of Mugdrum Cross. 
The term Mugdrum is obviously a corruption of Magridm, the 
saint in whose honour it may have been erected, and to whom the 
lands of Mugdrum were dedicated. It consists of one large stone, 
as the representation here shows, placed upright in another, and 
though the transept is now completely broken off", and all the up- 
per portion obliterated, so that the shaft only remains, there can 
be no doubt, from the appearance of the stone itself, as well as 
from its resemblance to the monuments of similar date and charac- 
ter, that a cruciform portion at one time surmounted what now ex-| 
ists. Fig. 1 represents the east face, which is divided into four 
compartments. The upper two, which together occupy nearly 
one-half of the stone, are of equal size, and contain each the reJ 
mains of a man on horseback, but the rider and posterior portior

of the horse are effaced by the injury of the weather. The third 
compartment from the top contains two figures, the smaller of 
which appears to be in the act of being overtaken or run down by 
the larger. The lowest division seems to be a representation of 
a boar hunt. No human figures are apparent, although traces of 
dogs in pursuit are clearly discernible. The south and west faces 
of the stone are so injured that no carving can now be seen on 
them, though similar monuments are generally sculptured on all 
sides. The northern side, represented by Fig. 2, exhibits remains 
of two kinds of ornaments very common on such remnants of anti- 
quity. The cross as it now stands is very little altered in its di- 
mensions since 1723, as appears from a measurement of it which 
was then taken and preserved in the Advocates' Library, viz. 11 
feet 6 inches high; 2 feet 4 inches broad; 1 foot 2 inches thick 
at the middle. It is firmly mortised into a square block of sand- 
stone 5 feet 5 inches in length ; 3 feet 6 inches broad ; 2 feet thick, 
and which rests on the surface of the ground. The weight of the 
column with its pedestal may probably be about five tons. It con- 
sists of white sandstone similar to Macduflf 's Cross, the nearest lo- 
cality of which is the Lomonds, about 8 miles south, with the hilly 
ridge of the Ochils intervening. 

It is curious that this beautiful and very remarkable monument 
has escaped the notice of Sibbald and the other Fifeshire anti- 
quaries. Nothing is known of its history. A group of five simi- 
lar ones exists at Meigle, assigned to the age of King Arthur, a per- 
son of more than apocryphal existence, but who is said to have 
lived about the year 800. Four others of similar aspect are found 
at Aberlemno, which, together with one at Pitmuis and another at 
Moneekie, are said to commemorate the defeat of the Danes and 
slaughter of Camus, their chief, in the eighth century. If this is 
the purpose of the cross under consideration — to commemorate a 
similar defeat at Luncarty, about the close of the tenth century, — 
certainly no site could be more appropriate for it than the imme- 
diate vicinity of the family mansion, where it now stands, of the 
direct lineal descendants of the patriotic Hay and his stalwart sons, 
who turned the tide of battle, and obtained in reward the hawk's 
flight, being the property of Leys, which is still in their possession.  
An obelisk of precisely the same characters has just been discover- 

" Buchanan informs us, that Kenneth commanded Hay to enter Perth in triumph, 
with the yoke wherewith he fought, surrounded by the victorious army, where tlie 
kmg raised him from the plebeian rank to that of tlie noble, with the gift of conside- 
rable territory to support his dignity. From him spring the illustrious Hays of Leys, 
Errol, Kinnoul, Tweeddalc, &amp;c.

ed in the churchyard of St Madoc's, on the property whicli origin- 
ally belonged to the Leys. 

Besides the above singular monuments, one of a similar cha- 
racter, and said to be connected with the murder of King Malcolm, 
in the year 1030, exists at Glammis— another, said to comme- 
morate the battle of Duplin, is to be seen in fine preservation at 
Duplin Castle in Perthshire ; and fragments of exactly the same 
class, but as to which even the whisper of tradition is silent, are to 
be found at Forres, Elgin, Aboyne, Eassie, Dunnichen, Menmuir, 
Arthurstone, near Cupar Angus, and in the cathedral yard of St 
Andrews. The real history of the last of these is not to be con- 
sidered more obscure than that of those in regard to which Ho- 
linshed, Fordun, and Buchanan, have written so much and record- 
ed so little. Such is their antiquity, that the lapse of three cen- 
turies appears to have little obliterated traditions, than which no- 
thino- more remained at the time our earliest Scottish historians 
flourished.  

The other is the celebrated cross of Macduff, which stands at 
the distance of about one mile to the south in an opening of the 
Ochil hills, on the confines of Strathearn, where it overlooks that 
beautiful valley and far distant Grampians. It consists of one large 
block of freestone, rudely indented in several places. According 
to a description given in 1712, these consisted of nine, each con- 
taining an iron staple and ring, and intended, according to tradi- 
tion, for the benefit of the kindred of the powerful Thane of that 
name, amounting to precisely the same number, who claimed pro- 
tection even against the penalties of murder, upon the payment of 
« nine kie and colpindach, or young kow."t The upright pillar 
which stood upon this base-stone, was destroyed by the reformers 
on their way from Perth to the Abbey of Lindores in 1559.

gis Macduff, ubi generosns occidens solvendo viginti quatuor marcas ad Kuibot, et ver- 
naculus duodecim marcas, remissionem plenariam exinde reportaret ;" which would 
seem to limit considerably the ferocity of the privilege — Lib. v. chap. 9. 

+ The inscription upon it, as taken about that period by the son of Sir James Uai- 
four of Denmile, the celebrated annalist, is as follows:—

words as Saxon intermixed with Latin, and the whole " aped in a Lat.ne dress, be-

The various tumuli around the cross seen by a former genera- 
tion, and said to contain the earthly remains of those who failed 
to establish the claims of kindred, have given way to the level- 
ling operations of the ploughshare, and the nightly traveller is no 
longer haunted, even in imagination, by the shrieks of the ghosts 
that were heard at no very remote period, by the superstitious of 
the neighbonrhood. There is, however, about 200 yards to the 
westward, a cairn of stones which is called Sir Robert's Prap, and 
which is said to contain the body of Sir Robert Balfour, laird of

proprietor, about the beginning of last century. 

Modern Buildings. — Under this head, may be included a very 
considerable portion of the town of Newburgh, which, within these 
fifty years, may be said to have been entirely rebuilt. Its suburbs 
are all of modern and of very recent origin. A town-house with 
a spire was erected in 1808, and there has lately been attached 
to it a building of considerable dimensions, for the accommodation 
of those engaged in the stock-market. The parish church was 
erected in 1833; it is a handsome and elegant structure, designed 
by William Burn, architect, and of the Gothic style. The manse, 
built about fifty years ago, has undergone a thorough repair since 
the admission of the present incumbent, and, though not an ele- 
gant, is certainly a very convenient, house : it stands on the slop- 
ing a charter from Malcolm Canmore to Macduff, "with the benefitsheenjoyed by vir- 
tue thereof, or the immunities, freedoms, and pardons indulged by, and conferred upon, 
that girth." The cross is theoldest regality in this country, whence we have thephrase, 
The Kingdom of Fife, an epithet certainly given to no other shire, " as if MackduiF 
had enjoyed his estate much after the way of Hugh Lupus in his earldom of Chester, 
of whom, it is said, he enjoyed that earldom from his uncle the Conqueror, 'adeo li- 
bere ad gladium, sicut ipse rex tenebat totam Angliam ad coronam.' " The last who 
claimed the privilege of the sanctuary as being within the degrees of kindred, was, 
according to Skeen, de Verb. Signif. voce clan-MakdufF, one Spence of Wormeston, 
upon his killing an individual of the name of Kinninmonth. Sir W. Scott has 
made it the subject of a poem, from which we transcribe these lines, as they contain 
at once an accurate description of its locality, and of nearly all that is otherwise 
known of it :

Placed on the summit of this mountain. pass,

ing bank to the south-east of the town, and commands an exten- 
sive view of the river Tay, and fertile Carse of Gowrie. The 
House of Mugdrum, beautifully situated on the banks of the river 
to the north-west of the town, is a large and extensive building, 
and was erected in 1786. The shore of Newburgh consisted till 
of late of three continuous piers, projecting into the south deep 
of the Tay. Two additional ones towards the eastward have, with- 
in these few years, been completed, with several dwelling-houses, 
store-houses, granaries, and other conveniences for commerce. 
The street, which has been long paved with stones, has just been 
relaid with new blocks of excellent quality ; the elevations along 
the southern range have been either taken away, or levelled down 
to a more gentle slope ; so that from the superior style of archi- 
tecture which now prevails throughout the town, and the increas- 
ed dimension of the houses, Newburgh may be considered as hav- 
ing some pretensions to neatness, as well as cleanness in its gene- 
ral outline and character. These buildings are all constructed of 
the greenstone trap, found in the parish or immediate neighbour- 
hood, with the exception of the ornamental parts, which are form- 
ed of freestone from the quarries of Cupar-moor, Hilton, Cullelo, 
and Kingoodie. A gas company has just been formed, and opera- 
tions will immediately commence for the manufactory and intro- 
duction to our streets and houses, of this beautiful element of hght.

Character, Sfc. of the People. — The people are in general active 
and industrious, and, with the usual exceptions which occur almost 
invariably in manufacturing and sea-port districts, merit the praise of 
sobriety. The great bulk of them are attentive to the ordinances 
of rehgion and the education of their children. The rising gene- 
ration are supplied from parish libraries with excellent and instruc- 
•tive books. These are read with much interest ; and the time is 
not far distant, when Newburgh, which has hitherto been noted for 
commercial enterprise, will also be distinguished for a moral, reli- 
gious, and a well-informed people. " No person belonging to the 
parish of Newburgh," says Dr Stuart, " has suffered the punish- 
ment of death for any crime within the period to which its records 
extend." To this notice in the former Statistical Account, the 
writer of the present one has only to add, that, in 1661, two wo- 
men belonging to the town were hanged at Cupar, accused of the 
crime of witchcraft, and for causing, under the, influence of that 
" black art, the minister's house, Mr Lawrence Oliphant, to be 
burnt." As in former times, " Newburgh supplied the navy of 
Great Britain with steady, well-behaved, and gallant men," the 
character of its seamen still continues to be held in estimation.

Rent of Land. — The valued rent of the parish amounts to 
L. 1958, 17s. 6d. Scotch. Its real rent is about L. 2400 Ster- 
ling. The average rent of the clay lands in the immediate vi- 
cinity is L. 6. In the southern and hilly part of the parish it is 
about L. 3, 10s. The greater part of the town's property has but 
recently been brought into cultivation, — the rent of which, for the 
new land, is about 10s. per acre, but upon the renewal of the 
leases may be expected to average quadruple that sum. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of labour for farm work is, for plough- 
men, from L. 10 to L. 12 per annum, with an allowance of 2 pecks 
of oatmeal per week, and 1 pint of sweet milk per day. Female 
house-servants have from L. 5 to L. 6 per annum. Male labour- 
ers have Is. 6d., and female, 8d. per day. Weavers, according 
to their expertness, can earn from 8s. to 148. per week. Masons, 
Wrights, and ship-carpenters have 2s. 6d. per day. Sailors, from 
L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 per month.

Hushandnj.—Theve are only four farms in the parish of any 
extent, the remaining lands being so subdivided and parcelled out 
among feuars and burghal heritors, as not to consist of more than II 
a single plough's labour. The whole may be considered in a very 
high ''state of cultivation, and farmed according to the most im- 
proved system of husbandry. There is no sheep pasturage, nor 
any orass parks but such as are in proprietors' own hands. The 
duration of leases on the estate of Pitcairly is for the period of 
nineteen years, and on that of Mugdrum from seven to ten years. 
Considerable improvements have lately been made in draining, by 
adoptincT, as has been done with the greatest success in the clay 
lands, the wedge form of draining. The higher grounds have been 
much benefited by the cultivation of turnips, manured with bone 
dust, and eating off the crop with sheep, after which, crops of bar- 
ley, of the most luxuriant description and of the finest quality, have 
been reaped. The Chevalier variety is beginning to be mtroduced 
here, and, from the trial made, it is found to be much heavier in 
quality, and more abundant in quantity, with a considerable in- 
crease also of straw. 

Fisheries.— The fishing of salmon is carried on to a considerable 
extent here, and the fish are reckoned of superior quality. When 
the tide has ebbed, the river leaves a great portion of its bed dry, 
where the fine silicious sand, borne along by its current, has ac- 
cumulated into large banks, which are designated by different 
names, and belong to different proprietors. Upon these the fisher- 
men, during the period of low water, ply with unwearied diligence 
their exciting occupation,-affording to about 60 of the weavers 
of Newburgh a healthful as well as lucrative recreation from their 
sedentary in-door labours, during the summer months. The 
number of boats employed in 1835 was 32, managed by 64 
men. One fishing station, with two boats, has realized 2j0 
salmon, 610 grilses, with a proportional number of trouts. The 
average price of salmon is about Sd.to 8d., trout and grilses, from 
3d to 4d. per lb. Wages, about 10s. 6d. per week, with a bounty 
of 6d. upon each salmon; 2d., grilse; and Id., trout. After sup- 
plvino- the town and neighbourhood abundantly with this « richest 
delicacy of the great deep," considerable quantities are exported to 
London in the Dundeesteam-packets,where,afteravoyageofthirty- 

six to forty hours, they are brought to the market, httle injured in 
quality or freshness. The spirling, or Salmo eperlanus of natxi- 
rali=ts, also abounds here, which is now the only station m the

Frith of Tay where it is caught. Tlie nets for this purpose 
are fixed by stakes in the rapids, produced by the heads or dikes 
which project into the river ; and continue, while the river is clear 
of ice, during the winter months. A heavy speat is likewise un- 
favour able to the fishing. The spirling is much relished by the 
inhabitants, and also at Perth, where it finds a ready market, from 
Is. to Is. 6d. per hundred. -

and 78 cattle. 2. Town of Newburgh, 35 horses; 75 milk cows ; 
and 13 cattle. 

Manufactures. — Cunningham in the course of his researches re- 
specting Macduff's Cross, says, " And pitie it were, that so old 
and famous a monument in this our kingdom should be so closlie 
dormant in a poor country village." Surely the antiquary forgot 
the comphment he had just paid, in giving to Newburgh the ho- 
nour of conferring upon the whole county the denomination of the 
Kingdom of Fife. " No trader," it was remarked in the last 
Statistical Account, " no trader has as yet appeared in New- 
burgh, whose extensive transactions in commerce would entitle 
him to the name and character of a merchant ; though per- 
haps the time is not far distant when many will be found here of 
that respectable description." That time has arrived; and New- 
burgh can now boast of a considerable number of spirited indivi- 
duals who are engaged in extensive commercial speculations, and 
fully entitled, as others of their countrymen, to the honourable ap- 
pellation of British merchants. 

The principal branch of trade consists in the weaving of linens, 
termed by the workmen Dowlas sheeting, and for which a ready 
market is found in London, Leeds, and Manchester ; also in the 
West Indies and South America, to both of which places it is ex- 
ported directly by our merchants here. A few years ago, indivi- 



70 



FIFESHIUE. 



duals employed in the trade, for the most part, wove their own yarn, 
and disposed of their webs to others of their own number, who 
again sold them at Perth, Dundee, Cupar, Auchtermuchty, and 
Glasgow, to persons who purchased them, either on their own 
account or upon commission for the English market. The trade 
is now limited to thirteen individuals, who not only employ all 
the weavers in Newburgh, but furnish work for considerable num- 
bers in Cupar, Springfield, Pitlessie, Kettle, Markinch, Falkland, 
Freuchie, Dunshelt, Auchtermuchty, Strathmiglo, Abernethy, 
Aberargie, Kintillo, &amp;c. The finest of the material wrought here 
does not exceed what are termed fourteen hundred linens, and from 
1 yard to 3 yards wide. Each web of the former sort contains 
about 140 yards, and averages from L. 5, 10s. to L. 6 in price. 
The latter is sold at 3s. 6d. per yard. 

The following are the particulars of the manufacturing trade 
of Newburgh for 1833: — In the single article of winding bob- 
bins, there are employed, boys, 10; aged men, 3; women above 
fifty, 80 ; women below fifty, 249 ; total, 342. The number of looms 
employed in town, 364 ; webs manufactured, 23,600 ; spindles of 
yarn contained in do. 826,000 ; cost of these, including weaving 
and bleaching, L. 128,325. 

Besides the manufacturing of linens, there is likewise a conside- 
rable trade in corn, carried on by the merchants of Newburgh. A 
weekly stock market was established in 1830, which, while it brings 
advantage to the town, must, from its local conveniences, operate 
greatly to the benefit of the surrounding country. Dealers from 
Kirkaldy and other places regularly frequent it ; and, from the ex- 
perience of its past operations, there can be little doubt of its per- 
manent prosperity. Barley is the grain which is principally sought 
after ; but wheat, oats, beans, and potatoes also find a ready sale. 
To the spirit and intelligence of John Burton, M. D. practitioner 
in Haddington, but then residing in Newburgh, the public owe a 
debt of gratitude for the establishment of this market, which has 
proved so beneficial to Newburgh, and the agricultural interests of 
an extensive district in the three counties of Fife, Kinross, and 
Perthshire. 

Malting was at one period carried to a very considerable extent 
at Newburgh, but has for some time past been entirely disconti- 
nued. 

Navigation. — This is by no means on a scale of proportionate 
magnitude to the advantages of the place. Only 10 vessels, from 



NEWBURGH. 



77 



60 to 150 tons burden, belong to individuals connected with New- 
burgh, and they are chiefly engaged in the coal trade. Two 
packets are regularly employed in conveying the raw material, used 
in the manufacturing of linens, from Dundee. The wood-yards are 
supplied from America, Norway, and Memel ; and the cargoes 
are often brought here in vessels belonging to these countries. 
Notwithstanding, there is a considerable appearance both of real 
trade and stir at the shore of Newburgh, — as most of the potatoes 
from Kinross, Strathearn, and the surrounding district, are ship- 
ped at this port for the London market ; while, on the other hand, 
the generality of vessels, bound for Perth, must often wait here the 
flow of the tide, and not a few of them unload part of their car- 
goes before they can, even with the tide, proceed farther up the 
river. 

Upon the whole, the trade and commercial enterprise of New- 
burgh will bear a comparison with those of places of much larger 
dimensions, and of greater external decorations. Two branches, 
one of the Commercial and the other of the Central Bank of 
Scotland, lately established, attest its domestic prosperity ; and a 
revenue from customs of a very considerable amount, annually con- 
veyed to the Exchequer, demonstrates its importance in a national 
point of view. Its local advantages are many, and, from the ra- 
pidly increasing wealth of its spirited merchants, there can be little 
doubt, but that every succeeding year will witness an extension of 
its business. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — 1. The post-office of Newburgh. 
Afoot-runner conveys every morning at eight o'clock the mail-bags 
from the Bridge of Earn to this place, and leaves again at five 
o'clock p. M. to meet the evening mails at the same village. 2. 
The turnpike road between the county towns of Perth and Fife- 
shire passes through the town of Newburgh; and about a mile to 
the eastward, at the village of Glenburnie, a road has been lately 
opened through the Ochils to Auchtermuchty, and the lime and 
coal fields of Fife. 3. A stage-coach, from Perth to Kirkaldy, 
passes daily during the summer months, and in winter on the al- 
ternate days from the one place to the other. There are also 
throughout the whole season, except when the river is interrupted 
with ice, several steam-boats which ply daily between Perth and 
Dundee, all of which touch at the shore of Newburgh. A regu- 
lar passage-boat sails between the Pow of Errol and this during the 



78 



FIFESHIIIE- 



periods of high water ; but at all times of the tide boats at New • 
burgh can be hired to the opposite banks of the Tay. 

Ecclesiastical State. — There are two clergymen in the parish of 
Newburgh, — the ministers of the Established Church, and of the 
United Associate Synod, formerly the Burgher Secession, — be- 
sides several others, who, without taking the name of clergymen, 
teach and exhort under the denomination of Anabaptists, Metho- 
dists, and Independents. The attendance upon the three last 
denominations is very limited, and will not, upon any occasion, in 
either, exceed the number of twenty. The United Associate Sy- 
nod congregation may approach to about a third of the whole in- 
habitants of the parish. The parish church is a new and elegant 
building, capable of containing 1000 hearers, and placed in the 
very centre of the town. With the exception of a few famihes on 
the estate of Pitcairly, the whole population lie within the easiest 
and most accessible distance. The sittings, for the most part, are 
either free or let out at a mere nominal price. 

The Earl of Mansfield and Mr Hay of Mugdrum are vice-pa- 
trons of the parish. The stipend consists of 15 chalders, half 
meal and half barley, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 
This is according to the decree of modification; but the full amount 
in the locality has not been realized, in consequence of a fall in the 
rent of the lands of Mugdrum immediately upon the last augmen- 
tation being granted. The glebe amounts to 4 Scotch acres, and 
the grass glebe to 10 do., both fields being of excellent quality. 

Education. — There are four schools in the parish, including the 
parochial school taught by Mr Wilson, besides other three which 
are superintended by females. The average number of pupils at- 
tending the whole may be about 400. The usual branches of edu- 
cation are taught in them; and in the parochial school, Greek, La- 
tin, and the higher branches of mathematics are taught in addi- 
tion. The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 34, and 
the amount of fees averages about L. 30. Besides the legal ac- 
commodations of a dwelling-house and garden, the schoolmaster 
has a glebe of nearly four Scotch acres of land, a bequest left 
many years ago, and a sum of L. 1, 15s. arising from feu-du- 
ties and altarage money. The people are in general alive to the 

 Precise ecclesiastical state of the parish, as just reported by the elders to the 
Church Extension Committee : Total population, 2868 ; belongmg to the Esta- 
blishment, 1G5G; communicants to do. 669: belonging to dissenters of all denomi- 
nations, 1008; communicants to do. 414; belonging to no stated place of worslnp,

benefits of education ; but it is impossible not to lament, that a 
more extended as well as combined form is not given to the edu- 
cational system here, commensurate to the rising importance and 
growing wants of the parish and neighbourhood. A part of the 
town's funds would be most beneficially employed for such a pur- 
pose, and, considering the numbers who are sent to complete their 
education at other places, and the great expense thereby incurred, 
the rest, if judiciously gone about, might be raised by private sub- 
scription. Let us trust that our townsmen, who have been hither- 
to so much occupied in matters of political strife, will henceforth 
unite and vie with each other in this truly laudable and philanthro- 
pic object. A greater boon they could not confer than an extension 
of our academical institutions. 

A private seminary for females has lately been opened under 
the superintendence of an experienced and accomplished female 
teacher, where, besides reading, writing, and needle -work, the more 
ornamental branches of education are likewise taught. The healthi- 
ness and beauty of the situation chosen by Miss Sime for her es- 
tablishment cannot fail to attract the notice and ensure the coun- 
tenance and support of the public. 

There are two Sabbath schools taught in the parish, both of 
which are numerously attended, and attached to each there is a 
juvenile library. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — " The poor are maintained by the 
interest of accumulated sums of money, feu-duties of a superiority 
of lands purchased for their behoof, collections at the church door, 
and casualties." The interest of poors' money is L. 19, 17s. 4d., 
and the amount of annual collections about L. 78. There is, be- 
sides, a charitable female society, which distributes annually in 
clothing, fuel, &amp;c. about L. 15. There are likewise four friendly 
societies, which are in a flourishing state, and which distribute from 
time to time considerable sums among their aged and diseased mem- 
bers. No assessment has yet been imposed, and while the manu- 
facturing trade continues to furnish employment in the compara- 
tively easy process of winding to all ages, and even the infirm, this 
hazardous experiment will not require to be made. 

Alehouses. — In the town there are 25 licensed houses for the 
sale of ardent spirits and wines ; at the shore there are 4, and 2 
in the country district. If the police arrangement, which requires 
every one of these houses to be shut at eleven o'clock on the Satur- 
day evenings, was rigidly and impartially enforced, much of the evil 



80 



FIFESHIRE. 



arising from these fertile sources of corruption would be lessened. 
With one or two well-trained public officers, the whole, in a place 
of this magnitude, could regularly and with facility be inspected, 
and the refractory punished according to law. 

Fuel. — English and Scotch coal are solely used for this purpose, 
the former obtained at the rate of 7d. a bushel, and the latter at 
4s. 6d. per boll of 40 stones. The English coal are conveyed by 
sea, chiefly from Newcastle and Sunderland ; the Scotch are brought 
in coasting vessels from Dysart, Wemyss, and Alloa ; considerable 
quantities are likewise conveyed in carts from Lochgelly, Balgouie, 
and Balbirnie. Newburgh lies on the northern limit of the great 
independent coal formation, no portion of it stretching beyond the 
Ochil range from the one extremity to the other. Many fanciful 
conjectures have, from time to time, been formed of the existence 
of this useful mineral in different localities in the basin of the Tay 
and the adjoining valley of the Earn, and expensive speculations 
have been actually engaged in. But the principles of geology are 
now too well established to admit, even of a doubt, in the mind of 
one acquainted with the science, of its non-existence in this quarter ; 
and henceforth our proprietors of their otherwise highly gifted do- 
mains will be more profitably employed in devising means for faci- 
litating its conveyance along the surface, than fruitlessly expending 
their money in making excavations for it beneath. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The agricultural district of the parish being of very limited ex- 
tent, and the lands being all in the highest state of cultivation, little 
alteration has, for many years, taken place, or can be henceforth ex- 
pected to take place, either in its population or amount of produce. 
The wealth, energy, and resources of the parish are concentrated 
in the town of Newburgh, and certainly, few places are more ad- 
vantageously situated for an increase and extension of them all. 
Lying midway between Perth and Dundee, with the fertile district 
of the Carse of Gowrie on the north, a rich and well cultivated coun- 
try on the east and west, the easiest means of access to the south, 
a good harbour and excellent shipping station in the immediate vi- 
cinity, together with an abundant supply of water from the adjoin- 
ing high grounds, Newburgh seems to have been expressly destined 
by nature as a place of trade. It is admirably adapted for the pur- 
poses either of an outlet or depot in distributing the commerce of 
the surrounding country ; and should the recommendations of the 
engineer be followed in the formation of a railway, it may be con- 



FERRY PORT-ON-CRAIG. 



81 



fidently anticipated that, at no distant period, new branches of trade 
will be opened up, while those which have already been so success- 
fully pursued will be greatly extended. While the population of 
Newburgh has been steadily increasing during the last fifty years, 
its wealth has been more than quadrupled since the commence- 
ment of the century. Both are still rapidly progressing, and from 
experience of the past, as well as speculations already forming, we 
have reason to conclude that the place will continue to progress in 
commercial enterprise and importance. One great and substantial 
evil felt here is that which arises from difference of opinion on pub- 
lic aflFairs. In places of greater extent, the shock is considerably mi- 
tigated, in consequence of the different classes, of varying shades 
and degrees of sentiment, through which it has to pass, thus con- 
stituting, as it were, an intermediate tribunal by which disagree- 
ments are insensibly reconciled and asperities softened down ; but 
here, and perhaps in most places of similar dimensions, the collision 
is abrupt, and families remain estranged from each other, because 
of matters in which neither may be personally or even in the re- 
motest degree concerned.

FKESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. W. NICOLSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The local situation of the town of Ferry Port-on- Craig 
naturally accounts for its name ; it is on a rocky shore on the south 
bank of the Tay, where there is a regular passage, by means of boats, 
to the opposite shore at Broughty Ferry. Previously to the erec- 
tion of a pier, the boats landed and took in passengers at the point 
of a craig or rock, where, by the aid of a timber platform laid be- 
tween the craig and the boat, horses and cattle were also shipped, 
— so that this was literally a ferry whose port was on a craig. 

• Neither liorses nor cattle, however, cross the river by this passage, since the erec- 
tion of the steam-boat between Newport and Dundee, although it is expected that a 
similar mode of conveyance will ere long be adopted here.

TopoyrapMcal Appearances, Boundaries, Sfc.— The craggy aspect 
of the shore where the town is situated has now almost disappeared, 
the rocks which stood between the houses and the water having been 
removed, and better accommodation afforded for boats and vessels ; 
dwelling-houses also have been erected close upon the beach. The 
parish stretches along the south margin of the river, from its mouth, 
where it empties itself into the German Qcean, to about five miles 
up. Its breadth is variable, extending in some places to about a 
mile and a-half from the river, and in others to about half a mile. 
It is narrowest near the middle, where the village is situated, and 
widens towards the east and west. It is bounded on the south by 
the parishes of Forgan or St Fillans, and Leuchars. The eastern 
part of the parish is flat and low, but on the west it is high and 
rocky. From the village eastward to the mouth of the river, the 
shore is flat and in general sandy, and at low-water there is a large 
extent of sands left bare by the tide. On the west of the village 
the shore is rocky and irregular. 

The atmosphere is here generally cool and salubrious, although 
the sea breeze to which this part of the country is exposed gives a 
sharpness to the air which is not felt in more inland districts. The 
proofs of a wholesome climate which this parish presents are early 
crops, and a healthy population. 

Except the Tay, which, as has just been stated, constitutes the 
northern boundary, no river bounds or intersects the parish. There 
is, however, abundance of excellent water in the higher parts of the 
parish, issuing in springs from strata of hard whinstone. Hence 
water is generally obtained without difficulty, and most of the in- 
habitants are supplied with this valuable article upon their own pre- 
mises. Among the whin rocks, there are considerable quantities of 
beautiful spar ; and in some of the rocks by the river side blue and 
red pebble stones are plentiful. 

This parish contains a considerable variety of soil. The eastern 
part, which is flat and sandy, contains in some places a light loam 
on a bed of sand, and in these places there are raised tolerably good 
crops of oats, barley, and rye, and also some wheat. There is also 
a very considerable extent of links, affording a slight pasturage for 
sheep and cattle, and supplying also a considerable quantity of rab- 
bits. The profits arising from this latter source, however, are not 
so great as formerly, in consequence of the great reduction m the 
price of their skins, which some years ago sold at 8s. per dozen, 
but now 1835 seldom bring more than 3s. 6d. or 4s. In the west- 



FERRY PORT-ON-CRAIG. 



83 



ern and higher p.art of the parish, the soil is generally a black loam 
Ibunded upon whin rock, and produces excellent crops of all kinds 
of grain. Green crops of every kind are successfully cultivated, and 
of late years the farntiers have raised great quantities of potatoes 
for the London market, which yield them a fair profit when sold at 
9s. or 10s. per boll of 32 stones Dutch. 

Flax, which in former times was produced in considerable quan- 
tities, and of good quality in the parish, seems now to be totally 
abandoned. 

Extent, 4'c. — The whole extent of the parish, according to a survey 
taken in 1831, is 2598.314 imperial acres, exclusive of commons. 
There are only four farms, besides upwards of 100 acres let out 
in small portions to a number of individuals in the village, who keep 
cows and horses. 

The cattle reared in the parish are a mixed breed, embracing the 
Fife, Angus, and Ayrshire kinds. There is also a considerable 
number of sheep, chiefly a cross breed between the Cheviot and 
Leicestershire kinds. The number of horses generally kept in 
the parish may be reckoned at about forty ; and they are chiefly 
employed for agricultural purposes. 

IL — Civil History. 

It appears that this was erected into .a separate parish by an act 
of King James VL in the year 1606. It is supposed to have pre- 
viously formed part of the parish of Leuchars, although it does not 
appear that there is any authentic record of this fact. There is, in 
the parish, a field which still retains the name of the chapel, in con- 
sequence, as is supposed, of there having been a chapel there pre- 
viously to the separate erection of the parish. The estate of 
Scotscraig, which comprises the whole parish, was formerly the pro- 
perty of Archbishop Sharp of St Andrews. The principal farm 
was church land, and was at one time feued by authority of the 
Pope at the sum of L. 132, 18s. 8d. Scots money, and 4 bolls of 
pease. Tradition says that the feuar was a Mr Scott, of the fami- 
ly of Balwearie in Fife, who, to distinguish it from other places cal- 
led Craig, prefixed his own name to it; hence Scotscraig, the name 
wliich the whole estate now bears. A portion of the Archbishop's 
room is still pointed out in a fragment of the old mansion-house, 
now forming part of the garden wall. The present house was built 
in 1807, and is a large and substantial building. 

Antiquities. — The only interesting object of antiquity in the 
parish is the remains of an old building, usually denominated the 



84 



FIFESHIRH. 



Castle. Of its original purpose and design, however, there is no 
certain account to be found. From the construction of the build- 
ing itself, there is reason to believe that it was erected after the 
use of fire arms ; and, probably, it may have been designed to con- 
stitute a protection against the entrance of any hostile force by the 
river, and for that purpose to act in concert with the Castle of 
Broughty on the opposite shore. On this point, however, we are 

left entirely to conjecture. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish in 1753 was 621 

1796, . 875 

1801, . 920 

1811, . 1164 

1821, . 1461 

1831, . 1680 

Thus showing a gradual and pretty uniform increase during nearly 

a century. The increase may be accounted for partly from the 

encouragement given for feuing by the proprietor of Scotscraig, 

and partly from the circumstance of the average of births being 

greater than that of deaths, as appears from the following averages 

for the seven years preceding 1831. 

Average of births for these seven years, 41 
deaths, . • 27 

marriages, • 1 3 

The principal part of the population is in the village, which, by the 
census of 1831, contained 1538, while there were in the other parts 
of the parish only 142. The number of families was 417, and the 
number of inhabited houses 311. The greater number of the 
houses are only one story in heighth, and contain two and sometimes 
three apartments. But there is also a number of two-story houses, 
generally containing four apartments, and sometimes the same 
number of families. The houses more recently built, however, 
are both more handsome and more commodious. On many of the 
feus taken within the last seven years, very handsome houses have 
been erected, and covered with blue slate, by which the appearance 
of the village has been greatly improved. 

IV. — Industry. 
The agricultural state of the parish may be exhibited in round 

numbers as under : 

Imperial acres in a state of cultivation, • 

not cultivated, including roads, 1 110 
underwood, . •

Besides the above, there are about 18 acres of undivided common. 



FERRY PORT-ON-CRAIG. 



85 



lying in the immediate vicinity of the village, and to which all 
within the parish have a right for pasturage. 

The wood generally planted is larch, until the last two years, 
when a considerable quantity of oak has been planted. The farms 
are generally let for a term of nineteen years, and the rents, being 
paid partly in victual, convertible at the fiars prices, are conse- 
quently variable. According to present prices, the whole parish 
will not yield an average of L. 1, 10s. per acre. There are 
upwards of 100 acres, however, in the immediate neighbourhood 
of the village, let out in small portions at much higher rents than 
the farms, and varying from L. 1, lOs. to L. 5 per acre. The 
common rate of wages for farm-servants is L. 10 to a married man, 
with 6 bolls of oatmeal, a house, and a cow kept on the farm. 
Unmarried men receive from L. 9 to L, 10, with 6 bolls of meal. 
Female servants receive from L. 4, 10s. to L. 5. Day-labourers 
are paid at the rate of Is. 6d. a-day in summer, and Is. 4d. in winter. 

With the exception of a few fields, the parish may be said to be 
wholly destitute of enclosures. The farm-buildings, however, are 
substantial ; two of them of recent erection are very superior. 

Produce. — There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the 
average gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish, but the 
following may be taken as a pretty near approximation : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, say - L. 3000 0 0 

Potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. . - _ 1000 0 0 

Grass, including hay crop, - - ] 300 0 0 

Quarries, - - . - 20 0 0 

Fisheries, - - - . - 900 0 0 

Yearly sale of rabbits, say - - 140 0 0 

Miscellaneous, - - - _ 50 0 0 

L. 6410 0 0 

The real rent of the parish is about L. 2500. 

In the item of grass in the above statement, the calculation is made 
according to the estimated value of pasturage during the season 
for a cow or full-grown ox. The calculation concerning the grain 
has reference chiefly to the prices of 1833 and 1834. 

Manvfactures. — The principal manufacture is hand-loom weav- 
ing, in which there is a very considerable number, both of men and 
women, employed. They receive their work chiefly from manu- 
facturers in Dundee. Several of the inhabitants are employed at 
this work in winter, who go to other employments in summer. An 
industrious hand-loom weaver can now earn from 10s. to 12s. a- 
week. 

Fishing. — There is a considerable salmon-fishing belonging to 



8G FIFESHIRE. 

the estate of Scotscraig, extending the whole length of the parish, 
and now let at an yearly rent of L. 600. Formerly, when stake- 
nets were used, this fishing station sometimes brought upwards of 
L. 2000 of yearly rent. The only mode of fishing now in use is 
by net and coble. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Fairs, 4-c.— There is a sort of fair held in the village annually 
upon the first Tuesday of June, old style. In former times it was 
well attended, but is now reduced to a few hucksters' stands, and 
is of no importance to the place. The nearest market-town of any 
consequence within the county is Cupar, the county town, eleven 
miles distant, where several well frequented fairs are held during 
the year. The principal intercourse, however, is with Dundee, to 
which there is easy access, either by the steam-boat on the New- 
port passage, or by an excellent sailing vessel which leaves Ferry 
Port-on- Craig for Dundee, and returns every lawful day, carrymg 

goods and passengers. 

Means of Communication.—The communication with this pa- 
rish has been greatly improved by the new and beautiful line of road 
between the village and Newport, a distance of about three miles. 
This road was made in 1830, almost at the sole expense of Robert 
Dalgleish, Esq. at that time sole proprietor of the parish, and 
may be regarded as one of the most valuable improvements to the 
place which has been accomplished for many years. There are 
two piers at the ferry, at the largest of which vessels land with coal 
and other cargoes, and where grain, potatoes, and other kinds of 
goods are shipped for London and other ports. The smaller pier 
is the landing place for the passage-boats. 

Ecclesiastical Stae.— The parish church is a neat and substantial 
building. It was rebuilt in 1825, and contains from 800 to 900 per- 
sons. It is most conveniently situated for the parishioners, being in 
the village, where by far the greater number of the people reside. 
The sacrament is dispensed twice a-year, in June and November, and 
the average number of communicants may be stated at 550. The 
people are most regular and exemplary in their attendance on di- 
vine ordinances, the church being generally well filled. There are 
sixteen sittings set apart for the poor ; but there are many persons 
besides allowed to sit free. 

There is a small Dissenting meeting-house m the village, m con- 
nection with the United Secession, having about fifty members m 
the parish,-any others that belongto it coming from otherpanshes. 



FERUY-PORT-ON-CRAIG. 



87 



The manse was built in 1796, and is a very substantial house, 
and in good repair. The glebe consists of about seven acres arable, 
and four acres of foggage or grass glebe, Scotch measure. The 
stipend is the minimum. 

Poor. — There is no assessment for the poor in this parish, that 
evil having hitherto been provided against by the liberality of the 
parishioners in their weekly collections at the church door, aided by 
the kind and judicious consideration of the proprietors of Scotscraig, 
who advance such suras from time to time as may be found neces- 
sary, along with the collections, to supply the regular disbursements. 
There are generally about 20 paupers on the roll, and they re- 
ceive from Is. to 2s. 6d. a week according to their circumstances. 
Extraordinary collections are made at the beginning of the year, 
and at the dispensation of the sacrament, on which occasions an 
extra allowance is made to' the poor. The yearly amount of col- 
lections at the church may be L, 55 : the proprietors' contributions 
L. 40. The laudable desire prevails to support themselves with- 
out parochial aid, as long as possible, and in some cases the kirk- 
session has found it expedient to offer aid to such as were known to 
be in need, before they had made any application for it. It is fre- 
quently found, too, that they who are backward in letting their 
wants be known, and manifest a reluctance to accept of help, are 
far more needy as well as far more deserving objects than they 
who are forward to seek relief. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are two private 
schools, one of which is taught by a female, and is chiefly attended 
by girls. The salary of the parish schoolmaster is L. 30, with 
house and garden. Besides the ordinary branches of education 
taught at the parish school, navigation, French, and Latin, are 
taught. The teacher's school fees amount to L. 22 per annum, 
and his yearly emoluments from other sources maybe about L. 12. 
There are always five bursars or free scholars at the parish 
school, whose education is provided for by the investment of a 
sum of money by the late William Dalgleish, Esq. of Scotscraig, 
the interest of which is paid to the schoolmaster. The heritor 
and the minister of the parish have the power of appointing to 
the benefit, which is restricted to boys. Every child admitted to 
this privilege enjoys it for five years, and the preference is al- 
ways given to poor children, ' the benefit being expressly de- 
signed for such. ' The schools are all well attended, the people 
generally manifesting a laudable desire to have their children edu- 



88 



FIFESHIRE. 



ctited. Here, however, as well as in other parts of the country 
in these days, the want of a due attention to the spiritual interests 
of the young on the part of the parents, was seen and lamented ; 
and to remedy as far as possible the evil resulting from such ne- 
glect, several Sabbath evening schools have been instituted. These 
schools are conducted by elders of the Established church, and 
other benevolent individuals, who gratuitously give their time 
and labour to the important purpose of instructing the young in 
the truths of religion. In winter there are about 200 children at- 
tending these schools. There is a library in connection with them, 
composed of small religious books, which are kept in constant cir- 
culation among the children. The funds for the support of this 
library arise from collections made in the parish church, where an 
evening sermon is occasionally preached for that purpose, and on 
which occasions the children all attend with their teachers. 

Libraries. — A subscription library for the use of the parish was 
instituted in 1829. Each subscriber pays 2s. of entry-money, and 
thereafter 2s. annually, or 6d. quarterly, and on these easy terms 
he enjoys the use of a valuable collection of religious and hterary 
productions. 

Savings Bank.— A savings bank has just been instituted Janu- 
ary 1836 in the village, but has not yet existed sufficiently long 
to justify any expression of opinion as to its success. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

In taking a general view of the state of the parish, and contrast- 
ing it with what appears to have been its condition at the time of 
the last Statistical Account, little occurs as worthy of remark. It 
has of course partaken, in common with other places, in the ge- 
neral advancement and improvement in the affairs of human life. 
Agriculture seems to have undergone considerable improvement, 
and almost every part of the parish is now under cultivation, which 
can be expected to repay the labour. There is nothing in which 
we seem to be left so far behind, amid the improvements of the age, 
as the state of the ferry passage, which has still to be effected in 
every state of the weather by small sailing boats. Scarcely any 
where else in the kingdom is this now the case on a passage of 
nearly two miles. A steam boat is therefore much desiderated ; 
and it is hoped that, among the improvements so vigorously carry- 
ing on under the new proprietorship of Scotscraig, this will not be 
long wanting.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE, 

THE REV. GEORGE WRIGHT, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish does not appear, from our ear- 
liest records, which go back to the time of its establishment, to 
have undergone any change. It may fairly be supposed to have 
orio-inated from the intimate connection which is known to have 
existed between the ancient Royal family of Scotland when re- 
sident at Falkland and this part of the country. About 800 
acres of the richest land of the parish were originally their pri- 
vate property. It is held of the Crown in feu, and pays to the 
Exchequer a specified amount of grain and money. The place 
is shown, and the form of a moat is still discernible immediately 
above the sea-beach, and about half a mile from the village, where 
what was called the Castle of Kingsbarns once stood. The re- 
mains of its foundation, composed of large and massy stones, regu- 
larly laid, were a few years ago removed by the present tenant. As 
a royal or baronial residence the site is certainly small; but if it 
be viewed as the place where the above feu, chiefly in grain, was 
deposited until removed for the use of the royal household at Falk- 
land, — in fact, as the granary or barn of the King, — then the size 
is suitable, and the name of the parish is fairly derived, and readily 
explained. Its castellated form was essential when the maurading 
incursions of the Scandinavian nations, in these days of rapine and 
violence, are borne in mind. 

Extent — Boundaries. — The parish forms, of course with many 
inequalities of line, a square of nearly 4 English miles. It is dis- 
tant six and a-half miles from St Andrews, and three from CraiL 
It is bounded by the former parish on the north, and by the latter 
on the south ; by the German Ocean on the east ; and by the pa- 
rish of St Leonards on the west. 

Topograpliical Appearances. — There is no ground of great eleva- 
tion within the parish. From the west, its highest range, to the east, 



90 



FIFESHIRE. 



its lowest, it gradually slopes down to the sea. It consists of two 
ranges of land, upon the lower of which the village of Kingsbarns 
stands, and the greater population reside. The shore is low and 
rocky, presenting, unless at Randerstone, no prominent headlands, 
but possessing a long line of rugged front with occasional sandy 
recesses sufficient to repel the long waste of waves which roll in 
from the German Ocean. It is fortunate in possessing so stern a 
barrier of rock, as the swell, which a continuance of easterly gales 
brings in from the main sea, is most tremendous. Still, for many 
years past, the sea has been making encroachments upon the land, 
which, indeed, from its hght shelly composition, would seem to 
have been the residue of former tides. The recesses above refer- 
red to form excellent places of deposit for the sea-ware, which is 
carefully collected and carted off by the farmer, and applied to the 
fields. Of late years, much less has come than formerly. Some 
ascribe the change to the immense amount of stone removed from 
the shore, for building dikes and drains. This practice, continu- 
ed time out of mind, has tended to lower the surface, — to present 
fewer points of seizure, if I may use the expression, to the weed, 
and fewer eddies to the waves. 

The parish on its sea line possesses neither prominency nor in- 
dentation of form deserving particular notice. It lies between the 
Friths of Forth and Tay, and immediately to the north of what is 
called the East Neuk, the eastermost point of land of what was 
called in the olden time the Kingdom of Fife. This position 
renders the temperature of the atmosphere less liable to intense 
cold. 

In former times, the excess of moisture in this parish was attend- 
ed with injurious consequences to the health of the inhabitants of 
the village. From its situation being directly below the rising ground, 
and in the course through which much of the superficial and drained 
waters flowed down to the sea, it became the seat of agues and fevers, 
and was certain to receive the visitation of every epidemic complaint 
raging in the country. Within these ten years, much has been done 
to remedy its unfortunate position. A cast from the sea has been 
brought up ; the open ditches and drains in and around covered in ; 
the streets properly levelled and metalled ; many of the old and un- 
comfortable houses taken down ; new ones with enlarged accom- 
modation within, and neat flower-plots in front, erected ; and, from 
being one of the dirtiest and most unwholesome places of residence, 
it now can bear fair comparison with most of its neighbours. It is 



KINGSBARNS. 



91 



singular that a disease similar to cholera in the suddenness of its 
attack and the destructive rapidity of its course, appears from the re- 
gister of burials to have existed exactly a century ago in the parish. 
What the population then was is unknown, but the deaths for the 
year 1733 were 58, while the average of the six succeeding years 
21|. Tradition states that it was confined to this village; that the 
disease commenced with an excruciating pain in the head ; that 
chiefly grown up persons, young and robust, as well as old and 
feeble, were attacked ; and that in a few hours death ensued. No 
name is given to the disease ; but that it was considered malig- 
nant, appears evident from this, that many were buried the same 
day they died, and none remained unburied over the next day. 

Mineralogy. — Lime and freestone, with occasional boulders of 
granite, are the prevailing kinds of rock, both on the sea shore and 
in the upper lands. Coal also appears to exist largely under- 
neath the greater part of the parish ; since both among the rocks 
at the sea, as well as on the sides of the burns on the high grounds, 
seams here and there appear. Frojn the vestiges of workings on 
the lands at and immediately above the shore, the coal, in so far as 
tow and buckets and levels go, would appear to have been wrought. 
Where it peeps out, it is at times quarried by the poor people ; of 
course it is small and brushy. By proper application it might be- 
come available to the public, since it is most likely to be a con- 
tinuation of the same strata which have for a century past been 
successfully wrought on the high grounds to the westward. But 
from the vast amount of under water in the ground, the working 
would require considerable power, and consequently a great outlay. 

Lime is burnt at the shore by the proprietor of Cambo, and his 
tenants, for agricultural and architectural purposes. As, however, 
no land quarry is opened, and the rock used is washed every tide 
by the sea, and no proper selection of stone is made, the produce 
is variable both in colour and quality. Its adhesive power is un- 
commonly great ; and were the smallest pains bestowed in tracing 
the rock back into the land, there cannot be a doubt that lime of 
excellent properties might be obtained. 

There is a great want of freestone rock in the upper part of the 
parish. This has proved a serious obstruction to forming enclo- 
sures, and draining the land ; the rock at the shore, which is the chief 
quarry, is at too great a distance, and causes so much loss of time 
and expense, that the tenants are deterred from carrying into efTect 
many an improvement. Tile-draining is on that account beginning 



92 



FIFESHIRE. 



to be resorted to. Some ironstone is also found amongst the rocks 
at the shore, imbedded in their laminae, or rolled in by the tide. A 
person has a lease of it from the different proprietors ; he employs 
a few hands in digging and collecting it, and usually ships it off to 
Newcastle, whence he brings English coal for sale. 

II. — Civil History. 

Kingsbarns was disjoined from the parish of Crail by an act 
of the Commission of Teinds in 1631. Whether any chapel for 
the administration of religious ordinances previously existed, is un- 
known. In the parish register we find it recorded,, that, in 1630, 
a contribution for the benefit of the poor was made,— which seems 
to have been paid by all classes of the people, and at successive 
times, as could be afforded. But as the date is exactly the year 
preceding the disjunction of the parishes, it seems highly probable 
that the contribution was commenced and conducted with the view 
of establishing a separate poors' fund, and forms no evidence that 
there was any church here previously. The parish records are 
wonderfully entire, running up with httle interruption to the ear- 
hest period of its independent existence, though not entering with 
any minuteness into the improvements which have been effected 
upon the conditions of the people and the habits of society. 

Land-owners. — The landed proprietors, and the amount of their 
valued rents, stand thus:— Sir David Erskine of Cambo, L. 3010, 
3s. 4d. Scots ; David Hay Balfour, Esq. of Randerstone, L. 998, 
13s. 4d.; David Monypenny, Esq. of Pitmilly, L.916; George 
Cheape, Esq. of Kippo, L. 881, 3s. 7d. ; David Lindsay, Esq. of 
Lochton, L. 216, 16s. 5d.; General Graham Stirling, L. 171 ; 
John Bell, Esq. of Kilduncan, L. 159, 10s. ; total, L. 6353, 6s. 8d. 
Scots. 

Antiquities. — There are ho antiquities in the parish of any 
consequence. In levelling and improving the braes on the sea 
shore, numerous stone coffins, rudely constructed of coarse flags, 
and containing human bones, have been found. In one instance 
only, on the occasion of lowering a small height on the road to 
St Andrews, the action of fire had been apphed, and the bones 
were found calcined and reduced to fragments, and placed in a 
hole of very small dimensions, carefully flagged. They are usually 
considered as the remains of the Scandinavian freebooters, who 
in ancient times made frequent descents upon the eastern coast 
of Scotland,— though they are not of the great size traditionally 
assigned to the men of these days.

III. — Population. 
About a century ago the number of poor on the roll was seven. 
If these bore the same proportion to the population as the regu- 
lar poor do now, the number must have been doubled. But, from 
the change of habits in the people, and the gradual abolition of 
the high feelings of independence once so prevalent, this mode of 
judging cannot be correct. My predecessor, Mr Beatson, in his 
report states, that " at the time of Dr Webster's report, the num- 
bers were 871. From the last state of the roll the numbers 
amount to 807, of whom 467 reside in the village, and the re- 
maining 340 inhabit the country part of the parish. For 30 
years the annual averages have been ]6 deaths, 22 baptisms, and 
6 marriages." When the present incumbent took up his list of 
the population in 1811 the amount was 942, — 629 in the village, 
and 313 in the country. In 1830 it was 1013, — 581 in the for- 
mer, 432 in the latter. The census of 1831, which included all 
labourers within the bounds of each parish at the time, gives 
1023, — 593 in the village, and 430 in the country. The propor- 
tion of males to females in both places is rather singular. In the 
village the former are to the latter as 249 to 344, while in the 
country they are as 214 to 216. The cause of the excess of fe- 
males in the village arises from the circumstance, that in the 
country there is seldom attached to the farm-steadings more houses 
than answer for the farm-servants and their families ; hence wi- 
dows with children, and single women, seek a dwelling in the 
former. The general and progressive increase of the population 
is owing to the great improvement during the last fifty years in 
the science of agriculture, and to the extra and steady employ- 
ment which the enclosing, draining, and extensive cultivation of 
waste lands has given. The average of births during the last 
seven years has been 29, of deaths 14, and of marriages 8f. 

One Baronet, and a retired Judge of the Court of Session reside 
upon their estates. 

During the last three years there have been 3 illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

Character, Sfc. of the People — The inhabitants are rather re- 
markable for height. When the local militia were embodied, a 
greater number of men in the grenadier company came from this 
parish than from any other in the eastern district of Fife. 

Much improvement in the condition and comforts of the people 
has of late years taken place. An inclination to render their per-

sons more neat, their houses more cleanly, and their fore-grounds 
and gardens more ornamented, is prevalent. The vast expen- 
diture of money during the late war in the country, and the 
high price given for manufactures and labour, introduced a taste 
for better living and greater accommodation. The benefits of 
this change, though for many years past the value of wages and 
the return for all produce have greatly fallen, still continue. Al- 
most every family of the labouring classes keeps a sow ; and its 
flesh, along with potatoes, which in general are abundant and 
cheap, and fish caught off the shore in summer, and herrings usu- 
ally obtained in the same quarter, and salted in the neighbouring 
towns, with occasionally meat from the butcher, — give an abun- 
dance of wholesome and nourishing food. Their habits are in ge- 
neral quiet and orderly. They are attentive to the education of 
their children, and regular in attendance upon public worship. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — As the agricultural interest is by far the most im- 
portant in this parish, the following details may be submitted : 

The number of acres within its bounds are 3057, 1 rood, 25 falls 
Scots measure; of these there are under the plough 2898 acres, 2 
roods; under wood 150 acres, 1 rood, 25 falls; and unarable 8 acres, 
2 roods ; of the latter, two might be improved ; and the remainder 
consists of old quarries and rocky ground on the sea shore. The 
wood consists of forest trees with firs as rearers, and small portions 
of shrubbery and evergreens round the mansions of the resident 
heritors. 

The arable land is divided into 18 farms, and a few pendicle 
acres at the village. These farms, from the quality of the soil, may 
be divided into two classes, — the first embracing 9 farms in the 
lower part of the parish, and having more or less connection with 
the sea shore, and having right to the ware, limestone, &amp;c. upon it : 
and the latter, consisting of 9 farms on the higher grounds, but 
having, with the exception of one, no claim whatever to the ad- 
vantages of the sea shore. The former, with the small pendicle 
acres, contains 1390 arable acres, and therefore average nearly 154| 
acres each, the largest farm containing 294 acres, and the smallest 
40. The latter contains 1508 acres, and averages are about 167 
acres each ; the largest being 386 acres, and the smallest 92. 

The quahty of the soil in the first of these two classes of farms 
is much superior to that in the second. In order, therefore, to give 



KINGSBARNS. 



95 



a distinct report upon this part of the subject, it will be necessary 
for me to consider them separately. 

1st, The soil of the nine lower farms consists of two kinds, — a 
light and sandy but active soil, along the whole range of land 
directly above the sea shore, unless perhaps toward the eastern 
end of the parish, where it is stronger, — and immediately above 
that, the ground is in general a deep black loam, in some parts 
tending to clay, and admirably adapted for close and continued 
corn-cropping. In this quarter of the country, during fully 
the last half century, the alternate system of husbandry has been 
ably followed. Under it, the first kind of soil now referred to 
is usually employed in raising turnips and potatoes, upon which 
a considerable amount of cattle are annually fed off. Upon the 
latter, these crops are more rarely taken, fallow, beans, and grass 
being interposed between the white crops. The cultivation of the 
strong lands generally runs in the sixth course, — fallow, wheat, 
beans, barley, grass, and oats, — though of late the pressure from 
low prices upon the farmer has compelled a shorter course of crop- 
ping and a more frequent introduction of wheat. Whether in 
nineteen years, the usual length of a lease, the general amount of 
production, and consequently of profit, be thereby increased, seems 
somewhat questionable. On the lighter soil, the course generally 
pursued is green crops, wheat or barley, grass for one or more 
years, and oats. This also is not seldom varied ; and after ley, 
wheat or barley are occasionally taken. The want of pasture-grass 
on these farms is remedied by the farmers taking parks for their 
young stock in the higher parts of the country. In giving a rough 
estimate of the produce of this part of the parish in corn, cattle, 
and potatoes brought to market, I give the average from 1827 to 
1831, both included,— only I may premise that the crops were, from 
cold and wet seasons, more than usually short. Of the 1390 acres 
of which the first class of farms consist, 781 acres were upon an 
average during the above five years annually in crop, and in the 
following proportions: 246 in wheat; 139 in beans; 191 in bar- 
ley ; and 205 in oats. The return was 7| bolls per acre ; the most 
productive farms giving 10, the least productive giving 6 bolls. 
This gives an amount of 6042 bolls ; and, reserving somewhat 
more than 2 bolls per acre for seed, servants' meal, household con- 
sumption, and horse-keep, there remains for market 4188 bolls of 
gram. Potatoes also are raised to a considerable extent for sale, be- 
sides the free use of them as daily food for the work-horses and 



96 FIFESHIRE. 

for fattening cattle. They are chiefly exported to London and 
Newcastle, sometimes by the grower and sometimes by the mer- 
chant. The amount annually disposed of may be 2000 bolls oi 
4 cwt. A due proportion of cattle are regularly fed olf each wm- 
ter Eight of the farms turn out from the byre, one year with ano- 
ther 90 head, weighing 36 stones each ; and the other disposes of 
about 20 three-year-olds each spring. The rent of these farms is 
partly in money and partly in grain ; with a maximum fixed ; and the 
average of the whole is L. 3, 12s. 9d. per acre. A deduction was 
a few years ago granted upon the higher rented of them; but the 
very great and continued depression in the price of agricultural 
produce would intimate that a farther abatement is necessary.  

o,d The upper division of the parish consists also of nine farms. 
The land is wholly arable, but, from the inferiority of the soil, a 
different rotation of cropping is pursued,— more land is retained 
in orass, and more is subjected to fallow. The soil in many places 
is s'trong and heavy, and in others a thin clay and muirish, lymg m 
general upon a wet bottom, and containing much water. Green 
crops cannot be successfully cultivated to a great extent. Fallow 
more largely takes their place; and when the land is enclosed, 
which is generally the case, two or more years of pasture are 
included in the rotation of cropping. The amount under corn 
upon the average of years above stated is 838 acres, m the follow- 
ing proportions: 217 in wheat; 125 in pease and beans; 183 m 
barley ; and 313 in oats. The produce per acre is 6 bolls ; the 
highest farm producing 7 and the lowest 5 bolls. This gives a total 
produce of 5028 bolls, from which, deducting for seed, &amp;c. 2 bolls 
per acre, there remain to be brought to market 3136 bolls of grain. 
About 200 bolls of potatoes annually are sold ; 35 head of cattle 
at 35 stone weight are fed off, and 28 sold from the straw-yard. 
The rent of these upper farms is upon an average L. 2 per acre ; 
the highest being L. 2, lis. and the lowest L. 1, 5s. The farms 
recently taken being more conformed to present prices, are con- 
sidered as able to pay ; while those under old leases are gradually 
reducing the capital of the tenants. The sheep husbandry is no- 
where pursued. Only a few are kept by the resident gentlemen 

for their private use. , • r i

amount of produce from the parish may be given : Under the plough 
are 2898 acres ; of these each year are sown 1619 acres. The 
amount of bolls produced is 1 1,070. Deducting seed, &amp;c. there 
are brought to market 7324 bolls of grain. Of potatoes 2200 bolls 
are sold. Of cattle 125 head, at 35 stone each, are fattened for the 
butcher, and 48 sold for the grass, from the straw-yard annually. 
The grain is computed in the old measure, and the cattle in 
Dutch weight. 

Seventy-four ploughmen hired by the year, and eleven boys are 
employed on those eighteen farms. Much of the wheat and beans 
on the low lands are sown in drills, which, along with the potato 
and turnip, give a vast deal of employment to young women in 
hoeing. About 1 13 are so occupied. In fact, from the time of 
planting potatoes, which usually begins at the end of April, until 
harvest be completed, they are seldom off the fields. Their pay- 
ment when so employed is 8d. per day, without meat ; and when 
lifting potatoes. Is. with their dinner. A good labourer with the 
spade obtains from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. per day in summer, and from 
Is. to Is. 2d. in winter. The harvest wages are, for men, L. 2, 
with some potato and lint ground, and supper meal, and for women, 
L. 1, 13s. with the above bounties. Draining is usually contracted 
for by the rood of six yards at 9d. when three feet deep, and more or 
less of course according to depth. Mechanics, such as masons, 
smiths, and wrights, get 2s. to 2s. 6d. per day. The smith generally 
contracts with the farmer to do the work by the pair of horses, at 
the cost of from L.2, 5s. to L.3, including their shoeing, the keep- 
ing up of the plough and harrows, forks, grapes, &amp;c. and every thing 
pertaining to the working but the cart. 

The breed of cattle usually preferred is the Fife. The Tees- 
water were introduced into the parish by the late Thomas Earl of 
Kelhe. His successor is returning to the old Fife breed. Though 
the former can be fed off at three years old at a much greater size 
still, as they must be high fed from birth, and require very fine 
grass, the farmers find it more profitable to retain the country 
breed. 

The steadings are almost all good in themselves, and ample in 
accommodation. The nobleman mentioned above was in this re- 
spect most liberal to his tenantry, and set an example which was 
generally followed in the neighbourhood. Of the eighteen farm-

The great employment of the people is agriculturah In the 
former Statistical Account of this parish, the writer mentions, 
in regard to this class, that there are about twenty-four extensive 
farmers whose families amount to 192 souls. Since that time many 
of the smaller farms have disappeared,— better divisions of the 
land have been made,— and handsomer and more complete stead- 
ings built. 

Fishinff.— There is no regular fishing establishment connected 
with the parish, however well situated for it. The want of a proper 
harbour, and the violent surge to which the shore is exposed in 
easterly gales, render the employment of capital in that way very 
unprofitable. During spring and summer, one or two boats carry 
on the lobster and crab and skate and hand-line fishing, steadily ; 
and occasionally in the summer evenings, the weavers and farm- 
servants go off to the fishing ; but these latter never make it an ar- 
ticle of trade, and are contented with thereby obtaining a change 
of wholesome food for their families. A number of young persons, 
from their proximity to the sea, are induced to pursue that hne of 
life. Few go into the army. Many, after serving an apprentice- 
ship in Dundee or Anstruther, as carpenters, go on board of mer- 
chant vessels in that capacity ; some go annually to the whale fish- 
ing in the north seas, and when at home during winter practise 
their trade of weavers, shoemakers, &amp;c. 

Ma7infacture.—The only branch of manufacture carried on in 
the parish is weaving. The kinds of cloth beside linen forborne 
use which are wrought are called Osnaburgh and Dowlas. There 
are thirty-one looms in constant use. The number of yards wov- 
en is about 100,000 each year. In the present depressed state 
of that trade, I am informed that, if preparing the yarn be done by 
the family, the average amount of wages, during last winter, 1831, 
is only rated at Is. per day ; while, if done by other hands, it does not 
exceed lOd. Weavers 1836 are now making Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. 
and good hands Is. 8d. per day. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
There is one village in the parish. St Andrews and An- 
struther are the two market-towns, where the gram produce is 
chiefly sold ; the former distant six and a-half, and the latter seven 
miles Corn and potatoes are shipped at both these places, and 
also at Crail, the post-town, three miles distant to the south-east. 

The reat coast-road of the county passes from south to north 
for four miles through the lower part of the parish, and through 



I 



KINGSBARNS. 



99 



the centre of the village. A private runner from Crail conveys 
letters in the morning to St Andrews, and on his return in the 
afternoon takes up letters for the south. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated in the village, 
and is conveniently placed for the population. It was built 
in 1631, and repaired, enlarged, and commodiously fitted up 
chiefly with pews for 650 sitters, at an expense of nearly L. 800, 
in 1811. The manse was built in 1765, and enlarged in 1815, 
and also in 1826. , Yet with all the repairs and additions which 
the heritors have kindly granted, it never can be made, from its ori- 
giiial defective construction, a commodious residence. The ground 
attached to the living, beside the usual allowance of garden and 
barn-yard, is, 1. the glebe, amounting to four acres Scots measure ; 
and 2. the foggage, equal to five and a-half acres, both of which 
have been drained and enclosed by the present incumbent. The 
former, from its situation, close by the village, would let at L. 4 
per acre, and the latter, at the distance of an English mile, 
might give L. 2, 10s. per acre. The stipend, exclusive of element 
money, is 14 chalders and 5 bolls, one-half meal and the otherhalf 
barley; determined by a decision of the Court of Session in 1812. 
About as much free teinds remains, and one farm, belonging to the 
College of St Andrews, is unvalued. The patronage is in posses- 
sion of the noble family of Crawford. 

There is no dissenting meeting-house in the parish. Five fa- 
milies, amounting to 21 souls, are of the Burgher persuasion, and 
attend upon a place of worship in Crail. The heads of the fami- 
ly of Cambo are Episcopalians; but their presence is very frequent 
in the parish church. 

Education. — There is one parochial and one private school. The 
schoolmaster of the former has the full salary allowed by law, L.34, 4s. 
5d. and a good dwelling-house. His garden is deficient in the le- 
gal amount by 350 square yards. The average of fees for the last 
seven years amount to L. 45 per annum. The branches of educa- 
tion taught are, Greek, Latin, French, English grammar, geogra- 
phy, writing, book-keeping, arithmetic, navigation, and land-survey- 
ing. In the private school, reading, writing, and arithmetic are 
taught. The income of the teacher is stated at L. 31. He has

position with the glebe. By the time all is finished it will htve cost fully L. 1000.

no advantage either of a free school, or of any fund by subscrip- 
tion. He rates the annual expense of each scholar at 12s. 6d. and 
3s. 9d. for books, &amp;c. A Sunday evening school has been esta- 
blished in the village for about twelve years. The number of 
young persons attending varies considerably, according to the sea- 
son of the year. The average number may be stated at 80, of 
which the larger proportion is females. The parish is well pro- 
vided with the means of education. 

Library.— T\vexQ is a library in the village, formed by subscrip- 
tion and donations in 1822. It is maintained by the payment of 
a small annual sum, and is used chiefly by the farmers in the pa- 
rish and neighbourhood. The number of volumes belonging to it 
is 500, with occasional additions by purchase, and with two of the 
periodical magazines, regularly presented by Lady Erskine. 

Savings' Bank.— A savings' bank was estabhshed in the parish 
in 1819. For the first ten years, it slowly and steadily advanced, 
until, in April 1829, its deposits reached the maximum, L, 448. 
Since that time, they have gradually decreased until the present 
time, when they stand at L. 321. The management of the bank 
is vested in the minister, and the chief depositors are the labour- 
ing classes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The poor are divided into two 
classes, those who receive regularly, and those who are only occa- 
sionally supplied ; the former are paid on every fourth Monday ; 
the latter receive allowances once in the half year, or more fre- 
quently, if any unusual donations be made, or accidental calamity 
befalls them.' The payments made to the regular poor are from 
Is. to 2s. per week. A double allowance is usually given at 
the return of the new year, and of the sacrament. Coal, a scarce 
and dear article, is bestowed at the former of these times, and is 
chiefly provided by the benevolence of Sir David Erskine and Mr 
Monypenny; when a cart load, consisting of 2 bolls or 120 stones 
is given to one, or divided among two or three families, according 
to their need. None of them are allowed to beg. Since the suc- 
cession of the former gentleman to the estate of Cambo, a system 
of most judicious benevolence has been conducted by Lady Erskine. 
In cases of sickness, medical aid is provided at the expense of the 
session. 

Taking the average of the last seven years as the basis of the 
following calculations, the regular poor amount to 14 per- 
sons, and the occasional to 12, and the expenditure upon both has 



KINGSBAllNS.

been L. 64, IDs. 9d., and upon the education of poor children 
L.6, Os. 9|d. The collections have been L.24, 19s. 3d., and lega- 
cies and donations, L. 20, 3s. Hd. annually. This last source of re- 
venue has been, during that time, much higher than ordinary, from 
bequests paid at the decease of three members of the noble family 
of Kellie, proprietors of Cambo, and by donations made at the sue-- 
cession of the present proprietor. There is a fund to the extent 
of L. 350 deposited on bond in the hands of the principal heritor. 
This sum, so far as can be traced, seems to have originated in the 
liberality of former generations, and to have been preserved by the 
rigid management of successive kirk-sessions. An annual sum is 
also derived from the rents of a portion of the seats allowed, by the 
heritors, at the repairing of the church in 1811, to be erected by 
the kirk-session, and of some other seats not required by them for 
the accommodation of themselves and tenantry. This affords 
L. 9, 18s. Hid. per annum. During the above period of years, 
two assessments in the form of contributions have been granted by 
the heritors, amounting to L. 63, lis. 5d. The small number of 
resident heritors, the reluctance to make voluntary payments by 
those non-resident, the depression of the value of all agricultural pro- 
duce for many years past, and the diminished resources of the la- 
bouring classes, have materially tended to reduce the usual means 
for the support of the poor. The high and independent character 
ot the bcottish peasantry is certainly breaking down in this part of 
the country. The other charges on the parochial funds for ses- 
sion-c erk, precentor, kirk-treasurer, presbytery-clerk, beadle, 
mortcloth keeper, and incidental expenses, are, on the average of 
the above years, L. 16, 2s. 3d. So that the total income from all 
sources during the above period has been L. 85, Os. ed., and ex 
penditure, L. 85, 5s. 4d. 2 , u ex 

mrs.-Tvo annual fairs are held in the village in July and 
October. In the olden time it was customary to lay in at the 
latter a provision of butcher meat for the winter consumption, 
which was called the Mart At that time it was numerously at 
tended by drovers with sheep and black-cattle. Now fresh meat 
may be had regularly once a-week in the village, and at all times 
may be obtained from St Andrews and Crail. The fairs have con- 
sequently dwindled down into the sale of a few household articles 
ol crockery, &amp;c. 

Alehouses -There are 5 licensed alehouses in the parish.

from any pit is about ten miles. That at Largo ward is inacces- 
sible by the muir road during winter ; and from Ely the expense 
of tolls greatly increases the value. Land coal, in fact, is only at- 
tained by the farmers and their servants having the cartage free 
of expense. The general supply is by sea, brought in dunng 
summer, and delivered at the shore. A small quantity of English 
coal is also brought in from Newcastle. The larger quantity of 
the article used comes down the Frith from Charleston, &amp;c. Dysart 
Coal is one of the heaviest articles of family consumption in this 
quarter. The summer price of the smaller kind, called chews, is 
from 5s. to 6s. per boll of 60 stones, and of great coal from 6s. to 
7s. In winter the price is heightened considerably. Were the 
road which passes through the parish from east to west, properly 
made through the Kingsmuir to the coal districts, the distance and 
conveyance would be much reduced. There is happily at pre- 
sent a prospect of the coal on the Kingsmuir itself being wrought. 
Were this the case, I know not anything that would more essen- 
tially contribute to the comfort of the lower orders of the people.

Name.—l the times of Episcopacy, as appears from old charters, 
the name of this parish was Losresk or Lathrisk.  The origin of the 
name is uncertain. In old writings, it is called Catul or Katel. 

The low grounds upon the Eden, a small stream which bounds the 
parish on the north, are supposed to have been the King's cattle- 
walk, or pasture ground,— where also is the King's goose-dub. And 
about half a century ago, there was near the village, on the land of 

• The church then stood at Lathrisk, near the west end of the parish, and had as 
aupendages two other places of worship, one at Chapel Katel, about the centre ot 
the parish, another at Clatto, in the east end of the parish. About the year lOdO, 
the parish church, with the manse and glebe, was removed and brought to the vil- 
lage of Kettle, and from that time the village seems to have given name to the pa-

Blackdikes, the ruin of a hut, which was reported to have been the 
house of the King's herdsman. It is perfectly known, that a consi- 
derable part of the lands of the parish was once the property of the 
Crown, by the forfeiture of the Duke of Albany, whose palace was 
at Falkland ; and was afterwards feued out in runrig, in eight divi- 
sions, at the rents then paid. These divisions are fully recogniz- 
ed at this day, and the rents are still paid to the King under 
the name of Crown rents. In 1695, the runrig division, with the 
unanimous consent of the parties concerned, was put an end to, 
and each proprietor's land was placed by itself. 

Boundaries—Extent— Keit\e is bounded by Falkland on the 
west; by Markinch, Kennoway, and Scoonie or Leven, on the 
south; by Ceres and Cults on the east; and by Collessie and Auch- 
termuchty on the north. The parish is of an irregular oblong fi- 
gure, about Smiles broad where broadest, but sharpening very much 
to the east and west ends, and about 8 miles in length. It may con- 
tain something more than 9 square miles, or 5100 Scots, or 6375 
imperial acres. The great thoroughfare road between the Friths 
of Tay and Forth, by Cupar, runs four miles through the parish 
The road from New Inn by Melville gate and Letham to Dundee 
runs about one mile through the parish. " ' 

Soil, c-c— The most productive parts of the parish are those in 
the course of that strath, which extends from near Kinross to the 
Guard Bridge, near St Andrews,-in which the surface isffenerallv 
level and water-fed. Yet even here the soil is extremely variable- 
sometimes there are excellent carse lands,-but at a small distance 
from these are extensive beds of sand, with a mossy surface, on a 
strong stiff clay,-or again a light and friable mould. On the rising 
grounds which lie in the direction of the parish, from the Lomond 
hil s, eastward and backward toward the south, there are excellent 
oils sometimes strong and clayey, sometimes light and friable. But 
the clate, as the ground rises, is less genial. This is manifested 
Evet thTr '""5°"-;" g--th, and coming later to maturity. 
Even the highest parts of the parish are covered with verdure, and 
afford, in summer, excellent pasture for all sorts of cattle. It may 
be lemarked, that for upwards of fifty years excepting 1826 the 

reel sadly the effects, if it be not then abundant. 

rhe chmate, for the most part, is dry and healthy, and not sub- 
ject to any local diseases. The ague is reported to have prevailed-

much on the lower parts of the parish, while it was swampy and 
often covered with stagnant water, from the overflowings of the 
Eden. But for the last fifty or sixty years, this disease has wholly 
disappeared, owing probably to the many drains which have been 
made in this and the neighbouring parishes. The lower people 
are now peculiarly liable to dropsical swellings in their limbs, owmg, 
perhaps, to the poverty of their living. 

Hydrography.— Tho Eden, the stream of which in summer is 
scarcely sufficient to turn a corn-mill, abounds with excellent red 
and white trout, and some pike and eels. As the course of the 
Eden is down a low strath, bordered with a range of hills on both 
sides at no great distance, as it has very little fall in its course, 
and was extremely winding and serpentine, it frequently overflowed 
its banks, and rendered the crops in its haughs very precarious. 
To remedy this evil, a plan was projected by Mr Cunniughame, 
the then proprietor of Lathrisk, about the year 1768, for making 
a cut in nearly a straight line, so deep and so wide as to confine 
the water, and at the same time give it all the declivity of which 
the nature of the ground would admit. But as the heritors on the 
diff-erent sides of the stream could not agree, this plan could not 
be executed in his time. About the year 1783, the late Mr John- 
stone having purchased the estate of Lathrisk, and become pro- 
prietor of both sides of the stream for upwards of two miles, exe- 
cuted the cut on an enlarged scale. A spacious canal was opened 
for the water along his property, about 15 feet wide at bottom, 
and secured on the sides by banks rising backwards to not less 
than 70 feet in width at top, and fenced behind with hedges and 
hedge-rows, which both confined the water and ornamented the 
property; and had the cut been carried on from where he ended, 
in the same capacious manner, and humouring the declivity of the 
ground, it would in all probability have answered the purpose in- 
tended,-except where, by the rising of the Eden, the reflux of 
water up ditches, and up the channels of the streamlets which en- 
tered the Eden with very little declivity, caused a very temporary 
and scanty inundation over their banks. But it was otherwise : 
some heritors next to him did nothing. Hence in floods the water 
is dammed back at that part, and overspreads the whole meadows 
or corn lands around. And the heritors farther down who en- 
tered into the idea could not at once collect the scattered waters 
into one channel; and, moreover, by accommodating the direction 
of the stream to the convenience of the diff-erent heritors with 



KETTLE. 



105 



whose properties it interfered on both sides, they lost the advan- 
tage of the natural declivity about three-quarters of a mile. In 
1829, the grounds about Kettle were four times deeply flooded. 
The late Mr Johnstone also built an elegant house upon the estate ; 
and following up or completing the plans of his predecessor, Mr 
Cunninghame, subdivided most of his farms with ditch and hedge, 
adorned them with belts and clumps of planting, and set the ex- 
ample to this part of Fife, of building commodious farm-houses 
and steadings to his tenants ; all which gave a vivacity and beauty 
to this part of the country. 

Mineralogy. — The rocks in the parish belong, chiefly, to the coal 
formation. On various parts of Burnturk, there are quarries of 
sandstone freestone. On one of these, on the north-east foot 
of Bauden Hill, when the stratum of covering earth is removed, 
we observe on the surface of the rock, numerous appearances of ve- 
getable remains apparently branches of trees of various diameters, 
curiously ramified and interwoven, as of trees fallen, crushed, and 
petrified. A large piece of petrified wood and a petrified horn 
were also found. We have no marble or slate in the parish, but 
some sandstone freestone of indifferent quality. We have also some 
quarries of the finest trap whinstone, which are capable of being fine- 
ly dressed and squared, and serve for the building of houses and dikes 
to any extent. Of these, one quarry, instead of lying in horizon- 
tal beds, rises perpendicularly in the form of a vein or dike, and 
presents in the face of the quarry the appearance of numberless 
five-sided columns, which, on being blown down with gunpowder, 
produce naturally excellent gate pillars, from five to seven feet long, 
without requiring a single stroke of the hammer to dress them. 
Another of these quarries, apparently of trap tuflfa, is famed for pro- 
ducing excellent soles for ovens, by reason of its peculiar quality, 
and resisting the action of fire. Limestone of the best quality 
]s also abundant in the parish. The quarry at Forthar, belong- 
ing to General Balfour of Balbirnie, was analyzed sometime ago, 
and found to contain 98 parts in 100 of pure lime. It is wrought by 
the proprietor; and in tirring, quarrying, mining, breaking, and 
fillmg the draw and sowkilns, &amp;c. gives employment through the 
whole year to a great number of men. The coals with which the 
hme IS burnt are brought from the proprietor's own coal pits at 
Balbirnie, and the lime is sold at 3s. the Linlithgow boll. Besides 
what is consumed in the neighbourhood,. great quantities are driven 
to Newburgh port for Dundee, the Carse of Gowrie, and other parts 
of Perthshire,— which also furnishes employment for a number of

carters. Coals also used to be dug up in Burnturk ; but these are 
now mostly given up, excepting a blind coal, which is used for 
burning lime, and is mostly carted off to Pitlessie hme-hills. Some 
ironstone also is found in the parish. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — Under this head, the writer has only to specify what 
he described in his former Account. 1. The two eminences on 
Bauden Hill and Downfield Hill, supposed to be the ruins of circum- 
vallations. 2. The eight barrows, three of which are known by the 
names of Pundler's Know and Lowrie's Know, in Forthar ground, and 
Lackerstone, in Kettle ground. There is a tradition about the se- 
cond, that when dissensions arose between families in different parts 
of the country, they met there to decide their contention by arms, 
and those who fell were buried in the tumulus. 3. The family of 
Seatons, who occupied the lands of Clatto, in the east end of the pa- 
rish, and of whose robberies and murders there are many traditional 
stories. The assailants are said to have rushed out from Clatto 
Den on the heedless passengers, and dragged them into the cavern.

Heritors and Farmers. — We have 16 heritors whose yearly 
rents ai-e above L. 50 a-year ; of whom only six reside in the parish. 
The farmers are comfortably accommodated with excellent houses, 
covered with slate and rigged with lead, and have good accommo- 
dations for their cattle, dairy, dung-courts, and shades for their 
carts, and other farm gear, and are all most respectable in their 
line. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — This is properly a corn parish, and does not af- 
ford much pasture, and there is only one flock of sheep. In the 
parish are, 3 farms of 4 ploughs ; 10 of 3 ploughs ; 12 of 2 ploughs; 
in all 76 ploughs; and about 10 pendicles,  jn-ccdiola,  — some of 



KETTLE, 



107 



these pendicles holding of the proprietors, and some of the larger 
farmers. The occupiers of these pendicles not having sufficient 
work, find employment for their spare time in drawing coals, lime, 
or metals for the roads. 

Commons. — These have all been divided and subjected to the 
plough, or planted with the various kinds of trees for which they 
were considered to be best adapted. And they now, instead of 
presenting to the eye a naked and barren landscape, enliven with 
verdure our higher grounds. At Dovan, Milldeans, Burnturk 
Common, Chapel, Forthar, and Lathrisk, there may be above 200 
acres under plantations ; but most of these are hid from passen- 
gers on the great thoroughfare road, by the rising of the ground 
which intervenes. 

Rent of Land.— The rent of land is from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2, 15s. 
peracreonthe low grounds; and from 13s. to L. 1, 12s. onthe higher. 

Wages.— The servants are generally, one man to each pair of 
horses,— an orroio man, as he is called, for looking after the cattle 
and for incidental work,— and two women ; and their wages are, for 
married men, from L. 8 to L. 10 in money, with a house and yard ; 
61 bolls oatmeal; 1 Scotch pint of sweet milk daily; their coals 
driven ; and about 24 falls of ground for potatoes. If any of them 
have a cow, or the milk of a cow, they have from L. 3 to L. 4 less 
of money. For unmarried men, from L. 8, 10s. to L. 10, 10s. 
and their victuals in the house; or if they live in a bothie, or out- 
house, they have 6 bolls oatmeal in the year, and 1 Scotch pint 
of sweet milk daily. The wages of women servants'are from L. 5 
to L. 6 a-year. Most of the greater farmers have cottagers, whom 
they call out for hire when their work requires additional hands • 
and they and others are supplied by any other hands they want,' 
from the villages. The wages of these day-labourers are, for men, 
ls.d., to Is. 6d per day; for women, 8d., without victuals. 

Husbandr7/.~There is, as is said above, very little ground let for 
pasture in the parish, except some parks at Beddies' Craigs, which 
when let for aseason, costfrom 12s. to 18s. per acre. Theotherpas- 
ture IS m the course of rotation, and is all eat up by the farm stock. 
Wence the stock m summer must always be measured by the provi- 
sion lor It, unless grass parks in the neighbourhood be taken for them, 
which IS often done for the rearing up of young stock. But in au- 
tumn, a great number of cattle is bought in to be fed on turnip 
and potatoes during winter, and sold off to fleshers when fattened. 
Ihe usual rotation is, after well-dunged potatoes, to sow down 



108 



FIFESIIIUE. 



with grass seeds among wheat, and after turnip among barley ; to 
take one crop of hay, and leave it next year for pasture ; then break 
it up again for oats. Thus a five years' rotation, three in crop and 
two in grass, is generally observed. But sometimes, with the 
stronger lands of clay or loam, a summer fallow is substituted for 
the green crop ; but by far the greater part is sown with potatoes, 
which have for some years been cultivated to a great extent, not 
only for home consumption, but for the London market; and some- 
times, if a half dunging can be had for the lands, barley is sown 
after wheat, in soils that will bear it. 

More than one-half of the parish is divided and enclosed with 
stone and lime dikes along the road sides, and elsewhere with dry- 
stone dikes, or ditch and hedge. Draining is also carried on to a 
great extent, of late ; for which nature, in many places, has given 
great facility by the sloping of the ground. The quantities of ma- 
nure made now in the farmers' straw yards would completely asto- 
nish a farmer, forty or fifty years ago. The parish produces much 
more grain, and generally of the best quality, than is sufficient for 
its own consumption, and, of course, sends the overplus to market. 
On the whole, farming seems to be as far advanced here, both in 
system and practice, the soil and climate considered, as anywhere 
else in Scotland. At an average, there may be yearly in summer, 
fallow, potatoes, and in drilled peas and beans, 340 acres; in tur- 
nip, 180 do. ; in wheat, 250 do. ; in barley, 360 do. ; in oats, 900 do. 
. Produce.— The average value of raw produce yearly raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, - 'lS, 

Potatoes, 13000 bolls at 5s. - - - - " "

Manufactures. — There are 378 hand-looms in the parish, nine- 
tenths of which are employed in weaving a kind of linen called Dow- 
las, and one-tenth in weaving window-blinds. The average value 
of linen per loom in the year is about L.51 ; and the average wages 



KETTLE. 



109 



in the week is about 4s. 6d. A moderately steady hand will make 
5s. 8d. a-week, and the value of his work will be L. 72 ; a few of the 
best hands will receive considerably more. Within these three or 
four years, a good deal of work has come into the parish from New- 
burgh, a port on the Frith of Tay ; and from other places, a good 
deal of work also goes out from this to other parishes, but not so 
much as comes into it ; and the increase of work within the last 
120 years is reckoned about 30 per cent. Many youno- women as 
well as men employ themselves on the loom. Elder women and 
widows are generally employed in winding pirns; but for these there 
is a great want of employment since the lint-wheel failed them. We 
have smiths, carpenters, wrights, and masons, sufficient for the pa- 
rish, and for helping our neighbours, and one medical gentleman. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
-The village of Kettle is situated on the flat of Stratheden, ra- 
ther low, on the south side of the Eden, the floods of which reach 
to the skirts of the village. Its appendages, Burnside and Bank- 
ton Park, which are entirely new feu-buildings, lie, the former a 
little to the south-west, the latter a little to the north-west of the 
village. Balmalcom village lies about half-a mile to the south- 
east, and Coalton of Burnturk about a mile south-east of Bal- 
malcom, on the higher grounds. 

Provisions and Market— From the vicinity of the metropolis, 
and a great many coast towns, provisions are commonly kept at 
the Edinburgh prices. At present we have neither flesher, baker 
brewer, writer, stipendiary constable, nor exciseman in the parish' 
With butcher-meat we are supplied from Cupar, six miles distant, 
or from Freuchie, in the parish of Falkland, a mile and a-half 
distant. Carts every day come from Cupar with excellent bread 
Beer is brought from Freuchie or Lethem, in the parish of Moni- 
mail. 

Ecclesiastical State.~The church has been rebuilt within the.e 
two years; it is of Gothic architecture, with an elegant tower and 
c ock. Including the purchase of the ground for a new site and 
other contingencies, it cost about L. 3000, and holds nearly 1200 
sitters. The manse and garden are in good order, A good and 
substantial manse was built in 1792, and a substantial wall was 
put round the garden in 1827. The living by the last decreet 
of modification m 1823 is 15 chalders of victual, half meal and 
half barley, at the highest fiar prices; but in Fife we have only 
one fiar for each kind of grain; and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion

elements. The glebe, though of legal measure, is one of the poor- 
est, and would not let to a tenant for L. 3 a-year. 

The Dissenters in the parish amount to about one-third of the 
whole population. 

Educaiion.— The school and schoolmaster's house have been 
lately rebuilt. They are capacious and airy buildings, and finish- 
ed in a superior style. The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, 
and, with the session-clerkship and school fees, which are very 
low, may amount to between L. 60 and L. 70 a year. Every one 
without exception learns to read. 

Poo,.._The poor on the roll for monthly supply are 30 in num- 
ber at present,— besides others who need occasional supplies. Our 
collections at the church are only about L. 20 or L. 21 a-year, and 
the heritors contribute about L. 100. 

Inns, Sfc.—ln the parish we have 10 houses licensed to retail ex- 
ciseable spirits, &amp;c.— 5 along the thoroughfare road, 4 in the village 
of Kettle, and 1 in the Coalton of Burnturk. 

Fuel— We are mostly supplied with coal from Balbirme, about 
four miles distant, at Is. 3d. a load, counted 18 stone; but we have 
Balgonie, Dysart, and Clunie within our reach, at all which coal- 
hills the load is heavier, and the price less.

THE REV. JAMES NICOL, MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 
iVawze.— In the former Statistical Account of this parish, it is 
stated that the original name of the parish was Fetkill ; but that, 
when the Earls of Rothes, whose name is Leslie, became the pro- 
prietors, they gave their own name to their possessions here, and 
the whole parish came at last to be known by the same appella- 



tion 



Extent, Bou7idaries.— The extent of the parish may be between 
4 and 5 miles in length, and from 3 to 4 in breadth. It is bound- 
ed on the west by Portmoak; on the north by Falkland; on the 
east by Markmch ; on the south by Kinglassie,— the river Leven 
bemg the boundary between LesHe and Kinglassie. The figure 
of the parish is that of a bow, the Leven being the string of it 

Topographical Appearances.~The greater part of the parish is 
now good, and the eastern part most excellent arable land ; the 
two most eastern farms, viz. Pitcairn and Cadam, having, for some 
years past, in general had the first sheaves of barley in Fife. The

undulations of the land from the Lomond Hills down to the ri- 
ver Leven, and intersected by two streams, one flowing from the 
north to the south, the other smaller stream, the Cambie, from the 
west, both falling into the Leven, a short way below Leslie House 
—give a pleasing variety to the landscape. With very little 
exception the whole lands in the parish are arable. The fields are 
well divided either by hedges or substantial stone dikes. The 
woods of Leslie House are remarkably fine ; indeed, it may be 
safely said, that no place in Scotland surpasses them, consisting of 
oak, beech, and ash, some of a very large growth. The admirer 
of rural variety will be entertained here with every circumstance of 
beauty, which he can expect from diversified nature, hill and val- 
ley, wood and water. 

Meteorology.— lr\Aev' this head, it may be only observed, that 
there has not been the shock of an earthquake within many hun- 
dred miles of this parish since the year 1815, but what was indi- 
cated by the waters of the Leven. On the 6th January of that 
year, the loch was heaved up in a peculiar manner. All the news- 
papers were carefully examined to see in what part of the country 
it had taken place ; but no account appeared for many months till 
the ice broke up, and the first arrivals from Bergen, Norway, brought 
accounts of a shock that had taken place on that very day at Ber- 
gen. Meteoric stones have fallen in this neighbourhood. 

The climate is particularly salubrious. The village stands on 
table-land, which rises from the Leven on the south ; there is, there- 
fore, a free ventilation, and the water carried off" ; so that, with the 
slightest attention paid to cleanliness, there cannot be a more 
healthy place. Certainly the most prevalent complaint is rheu- 
matism among the old, which may be accounted for by the fact, 
that when bleaching was first introduced into this neighbourhood, 
the women stood in the cold water to wash the yarn. This is now 
obviated by the improved methods of carrying on the bleaching 

operations. i • u • 

Hydrographrj.—ThQ only river of note is the Leven, which is 
the southern boundary of the parish. It issues from Loch Leven, 
and, after a run of about twelve miles, falls into the sea at the town 
of Leven. The scenery is particularly beautiful as it passes through 
the pohcy of the Earl of Rothes. Although of so short a course, 
the water is particularly valuable, there being forty-three or forty- 
five public works upon it, the falls valued at L. 1 106, 4s. The 
water being soft is well adapted to bleachfields.

Mineralogy. — There are in the parisli quarries of trap or whin- 
stone, but very hard, and the working of them expensive; although, 
since building has so mlich increased, it is wrought to a consider- 
able extent. There are also some coal mines and quarries of lime- 
stone. The coal is in the eastmost part of the parish, but is not 
wrought to any great extent. The direction of the strata is from 
east to west. 

Alluvial deposits covering whinstone, for the most part gravel 
and sand, to a great depth, run along the south side of the parish, 
— beginning at the west point at Auchmuir Bridge, and extending 
nearly the whole lengtli. The village of LesHe stands upon a ridge 
of gravel and sand, rising about 100 feet above the bed of the river 
Leven. Many of the ridges of gravel and sand that are found on the 
south part of the parish do not seem to have been accumulated all 
at once ; for in many of these there are alternate strata of very fine 
sand and brown loam. In a pit that was opened for sand for build- 
ing the new house of Strathendry, there were found in the year 1826 
some pieces of wood imbedded in the sand nearly twenty feet from 
the present surface, but in such a state of decomposition, that the 
species to which it belonged could not be recognized. 

Zoology.— Bdoxe the erection of bleachfields, Leven was the best 
trouting stream in the county. Salmon were taken in the loch. 
Trouts of a very large size, and of the highest flavour, were taken 
in the carses. They were of the weight of 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 
lbs. each. A pike was rarely taken in one of the old turns of the 
river, which measured 4 feet 2 inches long, weighing 56 lbs. Avoir- 
dupois. Eels used to be caught in great quantities in their pas- 
sage from Loch Leven to the sea. Lideed, on this account, the 
lands of Strathendry, were before the Reformation, subject to an 
annual tax of some thousand eels to the Abbey of Inchcolm. The 
eel fry come up in millions in May and June, and when full-grown 
in the loch, marshes, &amp;c. they run to the sea in autumn, especial- 
ly about Michaelmas. 

Botany.— The plantations of Leslie House are remarkably fine 
The spec.es that thrive best seem to be ash, elm, common beech, 
oak and the silver-fir. The larch does not thrive so well ; it grows 
Ireely for a time, but soon rots at the heart. On the estate of 
btrathendry, there is but very little old wood. The ash, elm, and 
sycamore, are the kinds that thrive best. The common larch also 
grows to a large size, and keeps free from heart rot. The beech 
avenue at Leslie House is well worthy of attention ; the trees are

11. — Civil History. 
The village being a burgh of barony, holding under the Earls of 
Rothes, there are two bailies and sixteen councillors. The records 
go back for nearly 300 years ; but there is nothing generally inte- 
resting in them. 

The Earl of Rothes, Robert Douglas, Esq. of Strathendry, and 
General Balfour of Balbirnie, have many exact maps of their va- 
rious properties in the parish ; and by comparing these together, a 
very near approximation may be made of the extent of arable, pasture, 
and other land, and also of the number of acres under plantation. 

Ancient Documents— Pictures.— In the depositories of the Earl 
of Rothes, there are a great number of letters and ancient docu- 
ments, relating not only to the family history and afifairs, but it is 
believed that many would be found highly interesting in a public 
point of view,— many of tliat noble family having acted a very con- 
spicuous part in the history of their country. There is a very in- 
teresting account given of the fifth Earl of Rothes, in a work edited 
by James Nairne, Esq. W. S. as one of the members of the Banna- 
tyne Club, entitled " a Relation of the Proceedings concerning 
the Affairs of the Kirk of Scotland. From August 1637 to July 
1638, by John Earl of Rothes." In Leslie House there are also 
several valuable pictures,— the fifth Earl and his Countess by 
Jamieson of Aberdeen, styled the Scottish Vandyke ; the Duke 
and Duchess of Rothes ; the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale ; 
Princess of Modena ; General John Earl of Rothes, by Sir Joshua 
Reynolds ; Archbishop Tillotson, said to be an original ; a por- 
trait by Rembrandt of himself. There is, besides these, a large 
collection of family portraits. The tapestry in the house is very 
fine. 1. The story of Leander; 2. The history of the children 
of Israel's journey through the wilderness; 3. The anointing of 
Saul, with several other pieces. 

 I may here take notice of the rooks who tenant these high trees. Their police 
is indeed very strict, and to watch their habits very entertaining, especially atthetinie 
of building their nests,— an instance of which has just come under my own notice. A 
pair fixed on a site in a high beech tree, and commenced building, they carried on their 
operations for some days with great assiduity, when one of them espying a very tempt- 
ing rafter in a neighbour's dwelling, which he seemed to think would do extremely 
well for his own, made an attempt to possess himself of it ; but his neighbour being oa 
the alert, he was for the time disappointed ; when in the after part of the day, his 
neighbours left their nest, immediately the new comer laid hold on a large twig, and 
conveyed it in triumph to his own nest. In a short time the robbed pair returned, 
missed their property, assailed tlie delinquents, in which they were joined by the rest 
of the rookery, and literally demolished the nest, and severely punished them for their 
offence with their long bills.

Family o/Rothes.—The most eminent characters connected with 
the parish have been of the family of Rothes. The Duke created by 
Charles II. j and the patent of the dukedom was only to male heirs. 
He had only one daughter, who married the Earl of Haddington. 
The Duke of Rothes was interred in the burying-place belonging to 
the family in the churchyard. 

Eminent Men.~The celebrated Dr Pitcairn was a native of this 
parish. There is a farm which belonged to him, and still retains his 
name, and the ruins of the house in which he resided. The Dou- 
glases of Strathendryare an old and respectable family in the county 
of Fife. The late Lord Reston, one of the Senators of the Court 
of Session, belonged to this family. The famous Adam Smith, 
author of the Wealth of Nations, was a cadet of the Douglas fa- 
mily. At one time, when residing at Strathendry, when t mere 
child, he was stolen by some gypsies ; and it was not till after a con- 
siderable search had been made, that he was rescued from their 
hands. The Rev. Ebenezer Erskine, one of the fathers of the Se- 
cession church, was for a considerable time tutor or chaplain in the 
Rothes family. 

Land-oiojiers.— The chief landholders are, the Earl of Rothes 
Robert Douglas, Esq. of Strathendry, and General Balfour of Bal- 
birnie. . , 

Antiquities.—Lesiie Green is said to be the scene of the poem bv 
Kmg James, styled Christ's Kirk on the Green. Although this has 
notfully been authenticated, it yetseems very probable; and by Allan 
Ramsay the scene is said to be Leslie in Fife. It is well known that 
this was a favourite hunting-ground of the gay monarch. The games- 
until very lately were kept up. On the green, there is still a stone 
called the bull-stone, considerably worn away on the sides, by the 
friction of the rope by which the unfortunate animals were made 

A fragment of a deer's horn, now in the possession of G. Indis 
was found some time ago in a bed of gravel, seven feet below the sur- 
tace. it IS nine and a-half inches round at the bottom. The whole 
horn was there, but so wasted, that no other part could be pre- 
served. Brass or rather bell-metal swords have been found; Ro- 
man and Caedonian battle-axes, the latter of stone; flint arrow- 
heads of particular fine workmanship. The Hon. Mrs Douglas of 
Strathendry has some of these, and one head of a spear, which 
seems to have belonged to a standard. 

There are several large stones erected on different eminences. 



116 



FIFESHIRE. 



Lately one of these was taken up, and search made, when a large 
stone coffin with bones in it were discovered. To this day many 
of the knowes are distinguished by particular names, as the Gal- 
lant Knowe, &amp;c. It is thought that, at the western part of the pa- 
rish, is the place where the Caledonians disputed with the Romans 
the passage of the Leven, after defeating the ninth legion on the 
Orr. Here the Caledonians were defeated, and betook themselves 
to the Lomonds ; and the Romans encamped on Balsillie heights, 
at the back of Leslie, where the mounds raised by the Romans 
are called the Balsillie Laws. 

In 1335, the dam erected to drown the Scotch in Loch Leven 
Castle, was near the junction of this and Portmoak. The existence 
and locality of this dam have been proved, by the removal of its 
foundation, in the recent operations on the Leven. 

About 1760, a stone coffin or urn was found near the Gallant 
Knowe, on Strathendry. In 1770, a tumulus, which stood near Pit- 
cairn House, was opened ; a stone chest was found, full of human 
bones, in particular, several entire jaw bones, standing east and 
west. At the east end, were found two urns of bluish clay, full of 
bones evidently calcined, and white as chalk. 

Modern Buildmgs.— These are, 1st, Leslie House. The original 
house built by the Duke of Rothes, around a court like that of the 
Abbey of Holyrood House, with a gallery three feet longer than that 
in the Abbey, hung on one side with portraits of the connections of 
the Rothes family, and on the other side with those of the contem- 
poraries and friends of the Duke,— was burnt to the ground on the 
-28th December 1763. The fourth of the square, forming the pre- 
sent house, was repaired by John Earl of Rothes in 1767. The 
house of Strathendry, belonging to R. Douglas, Esq. a very hand- 
some building, in the style of the old Enghsh manor-house of Queen 
Elizabeth's time. There are also the church built in 1820; the 
manse in 181 1 ; and several large flax spinning-mills, the first built 
about thirty years ago. 

The materials very generally employed in building are whm- 
stone for the walls, with freestone for the rybats and skews.

ber of the inhabitants of this parish was said to amount to 1130.

The cause of the great increase of the population has/been— 
the improvements in the manufactures. Fifty years ago, there 
were but two bleachfields, and those on a very small scale, now 
there are four, employing, of themselves, upwards of 140 people.

tune residing in the parish are those of the Earl of Rothes and 
R. Douglas, Esq. of Strathendry. There are four proprietors of 
land of the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards, viz. the Earl of 
Rothes; R. Douglas, Esq. of Strathendry; General Balfour of 
Balbirnie ; and John Fergus, Esq. of Prinlaws.

There is nothing remarkable in the appearance of the people, ex- 
cept in that of the women who work at the bleachfields, and who 
are of a remarkably healthy apppearance. Strangers are much 
struck on seeing them spread the yarn on the grass on a fine day, 
with their ruddy complexion and picturesque dress. 

There are 3 fatuous, 2 blind, and 3 deaf and dumb in the parish. 
Habits and Character of the People.— The habits of the people 
upon the whole, may be said to be very cleanly. Dunghills used, 
at one time, to lie on the street before every house. These are all 
now removed. If we compare the new houses of the present time, 
and the various luxuries in which the people indulge, and the clothes 
they wear with those which their forefathers enjoyed, it may in- 
deed be said that they enjoy the comforts and advantages of so- 
ciety. Yet it is by no means those who have the largest income, 
even among the operatives, that have the greatest share of these ; 
for it is often seen that those who have the best income are des- 
titute of the habits of economy. The females having been early 
taken into the public works, have had no opportunity of learning 
sewing and other things necessary to make them good housewives, 
when they become mothers of families. 

The people are generally contented with their situation ; but it 
is observed, that when a poor man becomes a keen politician, he is 
very apt to become discontented. So much time is spent in read- 
ing and debating, that work is neglected, poverty and wretchedness 
ensue. 

The people pride themselves upon being very intellectual ; and 
there is a very great deal of the profession of religion. 

Poaching in game has been carried on to a very considerable ex- 
tent. The facility of sending game to Kirkaldy and even Edin-

Manufactures. — In the town of Leslie, weaving is carried on to 
a very considerable extent, there being 260 weavers in it. The 
most of the work is supplied from Glasgow, — being plain linen and 
cotton checks. A good weaver can only earn at the rate of Is. per 
day, working twelve or fourteen hours. There are six flax mills 
in the parish, employing altogether upwards of 200 people. In 
these mills, they are employed twelve hours per day, or seventy-two 
hours in the week. The men's wages average from 15s. to 1 8s. 
per week, the hacklers from lis. to L. 1 ; these in general work 
by the piece, so that it in a great measure depends on their own 
industry and sobriety. The wages of boys and girls, from 2s. to 
2s. 6d. per week. These, when they have been in the mill 
for three or four years, are able to make full wages. Women's 
wages from 4s 6d. to 6s. 6d. per week. There are none employ- 
ed in any of the mills, so far as can be discovered, under ten years 
of age. 

There are likewise three bleachfields in the parish, the first em- 
ploying 45 hands; the second 39; the third 56. The men's wages, 
10s. per week; the womens, 5s. ; beginners, 2s. to 3s. They are 
only at work for ten hours in the day. All these employments af- 
ford a very fair remuneration and support to those who are engaff- 
ed in them.   

The bleaching is perhaps one of the healthiest employments that 
can be engaged in. The workers in the mills have by no means

the robust appearance of the bleachers, although in general they 
enjoy tolerably good health. Great attention is now paid by the 
mill proprietors to the proper ventilation of the rooms in which the 
people work. This is attended with the happiest effects on their 
health. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — The nearest market-town to Leslie is Kirkaldy, 
where an excellent weekly market is held on Saturday. This be- 
ing a stock market, it is in general well attended, and has proved 
of great benefit to the farmers and grain-dealers. It is about nine 
miles from Leslie. 

Means of Communication. — There is a daily penny post from 
Kirkaldy to Leslie. The town of Leslie is about a mile and a- 
half from the high road to Dundee through Cupar. Coaches from 
Edinburgh to Dundee, Cupar, Perth, &amp;c. pass and repass on the 
road during the summer, six or eight times every day. There are no 
toll roads in the parish. The roads are kept up by the converted 
statute labour money, and are in excellent order. The bridges and 
fences are all kept in the very best manner. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated in the most con- 
venient part of the parish, being nearly in the centre. It was built 
in the year 1820, and is in excellent repair. There are few coun- 
try churches neater both in the exterior and interior. It is seated 
for 850, but with great ease contains 1000. The free sittings may 
contain 300. The manse was built in 1811, and is an excellent 
commodious house. The arable glebe is not quite four acres in ex- 
tent; andbutindifferentland. There are nearly two acres of foggage; 
and being close to the village, it lets rather high. The present rent 
drawn is L. 18 per annum, for the whole. The amount of sti- 
pend is L. 257, 8s. 6d., including allowance for communion ele- 
ments. Number of families attending Established Church, 270, 
consisting of 1736 individuals. 

There are three dissenting chapels in the parish, and one small 
congregation belonging to the Baptist connection. Two of the dis- 
senting congregations belong to what is termed the United Asso- 
ciate Synod of the Secession Church ; the other to the Associate 
Synod of Original Seceders. Tlie ministers are paid by the pro- 
ceeds of the seat rents. Two are supposed to have L. 110, the 
other L. 70, with free houses. Number of families in the parish 
attendino- the three dissenting congregations, 183, consistmg of 



LESLIE. 



121 



1098 individuals. Number of families attending the Episcopa- 
lians, 6j consisting of 1 5 individuals. 

The service at the Established Church is in general very yveU. 
attended. The dissenting places of worship, it is understood, are 
not over-crowded ; but the writer has no access to know, the exact 
numbers of their congregations. The average number of communi- 
cants in the Established Church is 500. 

Education, — There are altogether six schools in the parish ; 
the parochial school, and five unendowed schools supported by 
school fees. In the parish school, Latin, Greek, and French, in 
addition to the other branches of education, are taught. The pa- 
rish schoolmaster's salary is L. 34; and the amount of his fees may 
be L. 18,- the emolument as session-clerk is L. 7 per annum. In 
this parish, the parochial teacher has not the legal accommoda- 
tion ; but an adequate allowance is made by the heritors. A mere 
English education is at the rate of 8s. per annum. For Latin and 
Greek from L. 1, Is. to L. 1, 5s. All persons above six years of 
age in the parish can read. 

Libraries.— There is a circulating library, supported by volun- 
tary subscription, and managed by a committee of the subscribers ; 
also a small library for the use of the children in the Sabbath 
schools. 

Poors' Funds. — The average number of persons receiving paro- 
chial aid for the last seven years is 35; of these, 1 1 have received at 
the rate of Is. per week, and 10s. in the year to assist them to pay 
their house rent. The others have a monthly allowance accord- 
ing to their families. Perhaps the clearest way to show the ex- 
penses of the poor in the parish is to give the income and expen- 
diture for one year, viz. 1832 :

is from money belonging to the session lent out on heritable 
bonds. Undercash is included proclamation monev; theVmiofL 2

the Justices of the Peace to the parish from convicted poachers; 
and sums of money paid by other parishes who have paupers re-

siding in this. Under the denomination of parish poor and month- 
ly distribution, come the weekly and monthly poor. The hires and 
fees are paid for session, presbytery, and synod clerks' fees, the of- 
ficer's salary, and some clothes for the poor. 

It is truly grievous to observe a growing disposition to take every 
advantage possible of the poors' funds, and to come upon the pa- 
rish for aid; and children willing to free themselves from every bur- 
den when their parents advance in years. 

jPairs. There are two fairs in the parish, — the spring fair, held 

on the first Thursday of April, O. S. for milch cows, and the shew 
of horses that are to travel the county during the season. The 
spring fair is always well attended. The autumn one is held on 
the 10th of October. This of late years has fallen very much off. 
At this fair, lean stock are brought forward. 

Inns and Alehouses.— There are 4 inns in the parish and about 
16 alehouses. The inns are necessary, and at present remark- 
ably well conducted. But with regard to the alehouses, or rather 
they should be called whisky shops, a great number of them are a 
perfect nuisance and the hot-beds of vice. It is no unusual thing 
for many of the whisky shops to entertain company till three or four 
o'clock on a Sabbath morning. 

Puel The fuel mostly made use of is coal. There is coal in 

the parish and immediate neighbourhood; but on account of its be- 
ing dearer than at some short distance farther away, the most of 
the coal used in the houses and public works is driven about five 
miles and a-half. The price of the coal in the neighbourhood is 
14d. per load of sixteen stones, while at a distance of five miles 
it is only lOd. the load of twenty-two stones. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
When the last account was given of the parish, the population 
was about 1212 ; at the present time it is 2749. At that time, 
there was not a spinning-mill in the parish, there are now six and 
three large bleachfields. At that time, there were six houses where 
ale was sold, but that not one person or family was supported by 
the profits of a public-house,— all having some other employment. 
Now there are 20 alehouses, and several of those who keep them 
have no other employment. The Sabbath with many of them is 
the busiest day, — not that they allow those who come to drink in 
the public-houses, but the liquor is taken to private houses, and 
the debauch carried on before wives, sons, and daughters. The 
effects of this are most demoralizing.

The manner of living has been very much altered within the 
last 40 years. In the year 1826, there was but one butcher, and 
he only killed a cow occasionally ; now there are three who kill an 
ox, each, every week, and meet with a very ready sale. Wheaten 
bread is now much more generally used than oaten. This may be 
from the most of the women being occupied either in the mills, or 
winding the pirns for the weaver. They find their time better oc- 
cupied in this than preparing food for the family, and so purchase 
at the shops. 

The improvement that has taken place in the building of the 
houses is very decided. The walls are built of neat squared whin, 
and rybats, corners, skews, and chimney-tops of ashler work of free- 
stone, the roof either tile or slate, the interior of four apartments, 
very comfortably and substantially finished. 

The greatest improvements made in the parish of late years are 
on the lands of Strathendry, by enclosing, planting, new roads, gar- 
den, and policy and house ; and the improvements are still carry- 
ing on with great spirit, in improving and reclaiming wet land. One 
instance may be stated of the result of the landlord's improvements. 
A field that usually let for L. 15 or L. 20 per annum previous to 
being drained,— the first year that it was let in grass after the im- 
provement, brought L. 85 per annum.

THE REV. THOMAS LAURIE, D D., MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish is about 3 English miles 
long, and nearly 2 broad ; bounded on the east by Kilconquhar ; 
on the west by Largo ; by part of both these parishes on the north ; 
and on the south by the sea. 

JSfame. — Its ancient name was Drumeldry. At a period less re- 
mote, that of Newhurn was assigned to it ; probably from the cir- 
cumstance of a small rivulet, which runs through a considerable 
part of the parish, having changed its course. Etymology, how- 
ever, is often fanciful and fabulous. 

Topographical Appearances. — The soil in general is fertile, and 
produces crops which might arrest the attention of the traveller 
who has visited more fortunate climes. His attention might also 
be attracted by the variegated scenery and extensive view. The 
landscape, consisting of rocks and woods and waters, and hills and 
dales, is such as a writer of romance would have delighted to fancy. 
The land is all in pasture along the whole extent of a flat sandy shore. 

H. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial register commences in 
1628, and has been kept pretty regularly. 

Land-oioners. — The chief land-owners are, Charles Halket 
Craigie, Esq. of Dunbarnie, patron of the parish, who has greatly 
embellished his lands of Hall-Hill; John Anstruther Thomson, Esq. 
of Charleton ; James Wyld, Esq. of Gilston, an enterprising and

Antiquities. — If we may credit the tradition of a remote period, 
the Culdees had a church in this parish. King Malcolm granted 
to these priests Balchrystie, where the foundation-stones of an an- 
cient edifice were dug up about half a century ago on the very 
spot where the church of the Culdees is supposed to have stood. 

Resident Land-owners. — Four of the land-owners now mention- 
ed have mansion-houses in the parish.

considerably improved. For several years past, salmon-fishing has 
been carried on in this and the contiguous parishes, but with no 
great success. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of raw produce year- 
ly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as fol- 
lows :

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — The nearest market-towns are Colinsburgh 
and Largo, each of which is a very short distance from the east 
and west part of this parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which is commodious 
and conveniently situated, was built in 1815. The heritors made 
very ample provision for the accommodation of the parishioners ; 
consequently it is capable of containing more than the whole po- 
pulation. The manse was built in 1819. The extent of the ara- 
ble glebe is 5 imperial acres, the grass glebe between 21 and 22. 
The value of both may be about L. 30 per annum. The amount 
of the stipend nearly L. 200. A process of augmentation has 
been depending before the Court of Teinds upwards of ten years. 
The average number of communicants at the Established Church 
is 180. There are now few Seceders of any description ; and the' 
sect of Independents which formerly flourished in this parish is 
gone, and the place where they were wont to assemble for public 
worship, is converted into a granary. The number of Seceding 
or Dissenting families in the parish is 3. 

Education. — The branches of education taught at the parochial 
school are, English, Latin, Greek, writing, and arithmetic. In 
1659, John Wood, Esq. of Orkie, destined that property for erect- 
ing a free grammar-school in this parish, and maintaining several 
poor scholars. The parochial schoolmaster educates and main- 
tains these poor boys, — a liberal allowance being given him for that 
purpose by the patrons of Wood's Institution. The salary which 
he receives as a parochial schoolmaster is L.29, 18s. lOd. ; and his 
fees amount to about L. 14 per annum. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor per- 
sons receiving parochial aid is 12, and the average sum allotted to 
eajh per year is L. 1, 15s. 5d. The annual amount of contribu- 



DYSAHT.

tions for their rehef is L. 28, 16s. The proportion of this sum 
arising from church collections is L. 13, 3s. 8d. ; and from other 
funds, L. 15, 12s. 4d. There is now little disposition among the 
poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief. The days when ap- 
plication for such relief was reckoned degrading have long ago 
passed away. 

Fuel. — The expense of fuel, which is coal, is the same as in the 
adjoining parishes. 

Alehouses. — There is only one alehouse in this parish. The 
number of inns, in many other parishes, has, undoubtedly, a very 
pernicious effect on the morals of the people.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. DAVID MURRAY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.—k far back as there are any records of this parish, Dy- 
st has been called by its present name. It is said to be of Gae- 
lic origin,— signifying the Temple of the Most High. 

Extent, Boundaries.— The parish is situated in the county of 
Fife, on the Frith of Forth, and is about twelve miles from Edin- 
burgh. Its extreme length is about 4 miles, its greatest breadth 
about 3, and it is about 10 in circumference. Its form is irregu- 
lar. It IS bounded on the east by Markinch and Wemyss ; on the 
west by Kirkaldy and part of Auchterderran ; on the north bv 
Kinglassie ; and on the south by the Frith of Forth 

Topographical Appearances. §-c.-The coast, which in general is 
bold and rocky, extends about two miles, and rises with a gradual 
ascent from the sea above a mile northward. 

From its situation, Dysart is much exposed to winds from the 
east; still it is allowed to be one of the most healthy districts in 
he county. There are few or no diseases peculiar to l Epidemics 
aie not frequent. When they come, they prove most fatal in Path- 
head, not so much from the situation of the village, which stands 
h.gh, being partly on a rocky and partly on a sandy foundation,-

but chiefly from the crowded state of the houses, and perhaps from 
want of sufficient attention to external cleanhness. 

Prognostics of the Weather.— T\m following prognostics of the 
weather have been collected from individuals employed in the col- 
lieries and ironstone works, viz. that before a storm of wind, a sound 
not unlike that of a bagpipe or loud buzz of a bee comes from the 
metals in the coal pits, but that previous to a fall of ram, the sound 
is much more gentle; that about twenty-four hours before a storm 
of wind or rain, there is a black damp at the bottom of the iron- 
stone pits, and through the waste; a damp so great, that a lamp wdl 
not burn ; but that, before frost, the air below is clear, and that a 
candle or lamp will burn easily. 

Hydrographij.—Theve are two mineral springs in the parish, 
both of which are perennial, and have been in high repute. The 
one is to the eastward of the town. It is much frequented by 
strangers who come for sea-bathing, and has been found peculiar- 
ly beneficial to individuals labouring under stomach complaints. It 
proceeds from the iron mines which are every where in its imme- 
diate neighbourhood, and is strongly impregnated with iron. The 
stones on that part of the beach over which it runs into the sea are 
of the colour of yellow ochre. This spring is generally called the 
Medicine Well,' and such is the estimation in which it was once 
held, that great quantities of the water were taken away, and sold 
not only in Fife, but in other adjacent counties. At differetit 
periods, it has been warmly recommended by gentlemen eminent m 
the medical profession. The other mineral spring is a little to the 
westward of the town. It is impregnated with vitriol ; it has been 
long celebrated for curing soreness and weakness in the eyes, as well 
as sores on other parts of the body; and it is still the resort of 
strangers who have those kinds of complaints. Such is its repute, 
that it is frequently put in bottles and sent to a considerable dis- 
tance, and numbers who have used it do not hesiiate to bear testi- 
mony to the great benefit they have derived from it. It is gene- 
rally called the Alum Well. 

There are two small streams or rivulets which run through the 
parish, viz. the Oar, and the Lochty. The Oar, says Mr Chambers 
in his Gazetteer, originates in a rivulet in the parish of Dunterni- 
line, which, along with others, once formed a small lake called Locu 
Oar, which is now drained, and the space converted into productive 
land. The rivulet pursues its way, and is joined by a stream fi-om 
Locii Fittie, and further down by one from Loch Gellie. Thus 



DYSART.

increased, the small river Oar continues an easterly course for some 
miles, till it joins the Leven in the parish of Markinch. 

According to the same author, Lochty is a small stream rising 
in the parish of Kinglassie, which after flowing in an easterly course 
eight or nine miles, falls into the Oar, a short way above its junc- 
tion with the Leven, which falls into the Frith of Forth. 

Mineralogy. — The minerals of the parish consist of limestone, 
sandstone, coal, and ironstone. For a long time, the limestone 
was thought to be of inferior quality, and was not much used ex- 
cept by those in the immediate neighbourhood of the quarry. Now, 
however, it is in considerable demand. The sandstone, though not 
so beautiful in appearance as that which is found in an adjacent pa- 
rish, is allowed to be of very superior quality. The claystone is cer- 
tainly inferior to that which is brought from Angus-shire ; still it 
is in great request, and is very generally used for pavement, hearths, 
&amp;c. The coal mines which are on the estate of the Earl of Ross- 
lyn consist of fourteen beds, most of which, however, are thin, and 
have been wrought out above the level of the sea. Three of the 
thickest of these beds are now working. The uppermost is five feet 
thick, the second eight feet, and the third five feet thick. At pre- 
sent, these beds are working about sixty or seventy fathoms below 
the surface. The metals cut through, in getting to the coal, are a 
sort of brownish stone, a clayey substance called by the workmen 
till; freestone ; a hard bluish stone; and a hard coarse kind of coal 
mixed with stone. Dysart coal was amongst the first wrought in 
Scotland, operations having begun upwards of 350 vears ago. \ has 
a strong heat, but being rather slow in kindling, and leaving much 
ashes, IS not so pleasant for rooms as some lighter coals. Like most 
of the minerals on the sea coast of this parish, it dips to the south- 
east one fathom in three near the shore; but is flatter as it goes 
north. It has been repeatedly on fire, the effects of which may 
still be traced by the calcined rocks from the harbour more than 
a mile up the country. 

There are five beds of ironstone. They lie below the coal, and as 
they dipm the same direction, are wrought to the west of it, where 
they come nearer the surface. The ironstone when quarried is ge- 
nerally shipped for Carron; and it is understood that a ton of it 
yields about 12 cwt. of iron. 

At different periods, numerous petrifactions have been found in 
this parish ;_an4 it may be noticed, that, for many years there 
were three petrified trees in the very heart of a rock, a little way 
to the westward of the town, the bark or skin of which resembled

pitch. Two of them were cut out of the rock lately, and carried 
away by some unknown person ; and the other, which has been con- 
verted into a pedestal for a sun-dial, is to be seen in a garden m 

the town of Dysart. 

Woods.— The plantations in this parish are not numerous. Al- 
tocrether there are about 400 acres occupied by different kmds of 
trees, such as fir, oak, elm, &amp;C.-300 acres of which belong to the 
Earl of Rosslyn, and contain some trees of considerable age. 

11. — Civil History. 
Had the Burgh records, and other documents once in the pos- 
session of the Sinclair family been preserved, it is probable that 
they would have thrown much light upon the early history of Dy- 
sart The former, however, are not preserved prior to 1623, and 
the "latter were consumed in 1715,— when, by the neghgence of a 
servant. Lord Sinclair's house was burnt to the ground. From the 
want of well authenticated sources of information, therefore, little 
can be said of the ancient state of Dysart. Indeed, there are no 
traces of its history prior to 874, when the Danes invaded 1 ite ; 
and even then, little that can be depended upon is known. About 
that time, the Danish fleet, anchored off Dysart, landed their troops 
on the sea-coast: in marching into the interior of the country, 
they fought a battle in a field about a mile and a-half north of the 

Dysart was originally a Burgh of Barony and held of Lord Sin- 
clair, but in an act of Parhament dated 1506, ordaining the burghs 
on the shores of the Forth to expend their revenues on their walls 
and ports, Dysart is included ; and from this it appears that it was 

then a Royal Burgh. p , u 

It has been ascertained that salt was made here as far back as 
the year 1450; that the salt works at that time were of great ex- 
tent ; that not only many of the principal towns in Scotland were 
supphed with salt from this port, but also that large quantities ot it 
were then exported to Holland. About that time, too, and for near- 
ly two or three centuries afterwards, the shipping interest was con- 
siderable ; maritime and domestic commerce flourished exceeding- 
ly ; malting and brewing were carried on to a great extent ; and Dy- 
sart is allowed to have been one of the principal, if not the fore- 
most trading town in the east of Fife. Prodigious quantities ot 
merchandise, we are told, were regularly exposed to sale under the 
piazzas, which then pervaded the central street ; and a square in the 
middle of the town is represented as having been in those days, 



DYSART.

what with goods and what with the merchants who attended them, a 
sight of no ordinary splendour. As an illustration of the extensive 
commerce carried on in Dysart, and of the general importance which 
was attached to it as a commercial port, it may be mentioned, that, 
about the year 1640, when part of the eastern pier had either fal- 
len or was in danger of falling, money to repair it was not only sub- 
scribed by merchants in the parish and neighbourhood, but collec- 
tions for the same purpose were made at the church doors through- 
out the bounds of the presbytery at Dunfermline, and several other 
places in the county. 

The quarrel of the Parliament of England with Charles 1. which 
took place about the middle of the seventeenth century, and which 
extended to this part of the kingdom, suggests a few particulars 
connected with the history of Dysart which are not uninteresting. 
The inhabitants of the parish generally entered warmly into the 
views of the Parliament, Numbers of them, especially of the sea- 
men "amongst whom were thirty skippers" volunteered into the ar- 
my of the Covenanters, and were engaged in the memorable battles 
of Kilsyth, Philiphaugh, Tibbermoor, and Aberdeen. Public pray- 
ers were offered up for the success of the army, and public thanks- 
givings were returned for every advantage gained. The Solemn 
League and Covenant, which at this time was publicly sworn and 
subscribed at Kirkaldy, was also sworn and subscribed at Dysart ; 
and if any were known to be indifferent in the national cause, they 
were immediately summoned before the kirk-session, and were dealt 
with as their case seemed to deserve. The people of Dysart did not 
abandon the cause they had espoused. Not only did they raise mo- 
ney to assist in carrying on the war, but furnished their proportion 
of horses, carts, and such other things as were necessary. The num- 
ber of those belonging to the parish who were killed in the different 
battles already mentioned is stated to have been 98, and the num- 
ber of those who were wounded is mentioned as considerable. In 
these circumstances, Dysart appears not to have been behind in its 
sympathies. Large contributions were made for the support of the 
wounded. Even the parish funds were devoted to the same purpose ; 
and the surviving friends of those who had been disabled or slain 
had their exigencies supplied. 

From the period which has thus come briefly under our review 
till the time of the union between the two kingdoms, there is from 
the imperfect information contained in the records a blank in the 
history, which it is not in our power to fiU up, at least with facts 



132 



FIFESIIIRE. 



sufficiently authenticated. It is well known, however, that although 
the advantages which Scotland has derived from the union with 
England, have been long and deservedly acknowledged, it was at 
first lamented as an era of misfortune to the Scottish nation. The 
trade of many of the towns on the coast of Fife was greatly depres- 
sed by it, and in almost all of them it began to languish. Dysart 
was involved in the common fate. From this time its shipping, 
which had far exceeded that of any other port on the coast, fell 
rapidly into decay, — its general commerce declined, — its trade with 
the low countries in particular fell off gradually : even the coal and 
salt trade is small in comparison of what it once was ; and Dysart 
by no means holds that rank in the scale of merchandise which it 
formerly did.  

Eminent Men. — Among the eminent characters connected with 
the parish, the following may be mentioned. The first Earl of 
Dysart was son of the Rev. William Murray, minister of Dysart ; 
and this nobleman is represented as having taken a conspicuous 
part in the counsels of Charles I. 

In Calderwood's History of the Church of Scotland, the Rev. 
WiUiam Hog, who was deposed for non-conformity in 1619, is re- 
presented as a man of considerable eminence. The Bishop of St 
Andrews tried every inethod to gain him ; sometimes he used 
threats, and at other times promises. On one occasion, he promis- 
ed him the richest living in his gift if he would engage not to preach 
against Episcopacy, but finding that every effort was in vain, he 
passed sentence of deposition and even of banishment against him. 
It appears, however, that Mr Hog did not leave the kingdom, but 
was afterwards admitted minister of Kennoway, in which parish he 
died. 

The Rev. Mungo Law was celebrated in his day, both as a 
preacher and as a man of talents. During his incumbency in the 
second charge of this parish, he had calls to various places. After 
a keen contest, he was chosen representative of the Presbytery of 

» Besides the records of the burgh, the kirk-session and the presbytery, from which 
the above information has been chiefly collected, there is a manuscript containing 
many curious facts respecting the antiquities of Dysart, of which Sir NV alter bcott 
largely availed himself in liis Tales of a Grandfather. It is the property ot the tarl 
of Rosslyn. Another is alluded to in a small pullication by Mr Charles Mackie, 
entitled Historical Description of the Castle and Chapel of Roslin. And about two 
years ago, Mr William Muir, parochial teacher in Dysart, collected, and at the re- 
quest of a few friends, printed a small hook containing many interesting facts resjjeet- 
ing the parish, the church, and the school. This gentleman, who is a distinguished 
scholar and antiquarian, has in possession many curious coins, old receipts, and au- 
tographs of eminent persons in public life.

Kirkcaldy, for the famous Assembly held in Glasgow in 1638. He 
was in Edinburgh Castle in 1650, when that fortress surrendered 
to Cromwell, and was one of the six ministers who protested against 
the surrender. He was, for some time after, a prisoner in England, 
and died in February 1660. 

Robert Beatson was born at Dysart in 1742. He was educated 
with a view to the military profession. He obtained an ensigncy 
in 1756. He was at the taking of Martinique and Guadaloupe, and 
also served in the expedition to the coast of France, and during the 
American war. He is the author of many pubhcations, among 
which are the following : — Political Index to the History of Great 
Britain and Ireland ; Naval and Military Memoirs ; Essay on the 
Comparative Advantages of Vertical and Horizontal Windmills ; 
Chronological Register of both Houses of Parliament. The Uni- 
versity of Aberdeen conferred upon him the degree of LL.D. He 
died at Edinburgh in 1818. 

Land-oio7iers— The principal land-owners in the parish are, the 
Earl of Rosslyn ; the Earl of Rothes ; Sir John Oswald of Dun ■ 
nikier ; and John Fergus, Esq. of Strathore. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers go so far back as 
1619. They consist of about twenty volumes, and are in good 
order except one volume, which, being reckoned of importance, was, 
at the request of the session, lately transcribed by the session-clerk. 

Antiquities.— Among the antiquities connected with Dysart, may 
be noticed the Red Rocks. These are nearly a mile eastward from 
the town. They bear the memorials of some dreadful convulsion, 
and are associated with the superstitions of former times. Tradi- 
tion still points them out as the place where witches were burnt; 
andm different records, there are allusions to circumstances which 
render it more than probable that tradition is correct. The scenery 
all aroimd is truly picturesque. 

About half a mile to the westward of Dysart, is the Castle of Ra- 
venscraig. It stands on a steep crag fronting the sea. It, with 
the adjoining lands, was given by James III. to WiUiam Sinclaji-, 
iiarl ot Orkney, when he resigned the title of Orkney; and ever 
since, has been the property of the family of Sinclair. Although in 
a ruinous state now, it was inhabited in Oliver Cromwell's time; 
indeed, it was the place where Lord Sinclair used to hold his court 
meetings; and the copy of a summons which his Lordship sent to 
the baihes of Dysart to appear before him is still preserved. 

Wear the Castle of Ravenscraig, three old trees stood together. 



134 riFESHIUE. 

respecting whidi two traditions have been handed down. The one 
is, that three 1rothers of the Sinclair family had encountered each 
other there during the night ; that, mistaking each other for robbers, 
they fell by each others hands : that they were buried there ; and that 
the three trees were planted on their graves. The other is, that 
all the ground about Dysart had been originally under wood, and 
that when the wood was cleared away, these three trees were left 
as a memorial of its former state. It is questionable, however, 
whether the present trees are the same which tradition refers to. . 
It is more than probable that, having fallen into decay, three others 
were planted in their room. The arms of the town of Dysart bear 
one tree; and there has long been a proverb here, " as old as the 
three trees of Dysart." 

About a mile north from the town, there is to be seen a large 
stone in the middle of a field, said to be a memorial of the bat- 
tle fought by the Danes to which we have alluded. About halt a 
mile north from this field, there is a farm called Carberry, where 
the Romans are said to have had a station, and where it is report- 
ed there was once a Roman camp, but no traces of it now reniam. 

Towards the south or lower part of the town of Dysart, there 
was anciently a small chapel, generally said to have been deduat- 
ed to St Dennis; it is still called St Dennis's Chapel: part of the 
original wall is standing ; but the building has long been used as a 

'"Near to St Dennis's Chapel, stands the old church of Dysart, Its 
remains bear all the signatures of its having been a splendid and vene- 
rable buildino-. On one of the windows, the date 1570 has been ob- 
served. The steeple and porch, however, are evidently of more 
ancient workmanship, and the heavy stone roof of the latter, and 
two sculptured stones above the door, where the statue of some 
saint was probably orte placed, refer the time of their erection to 
an earlier period than 1570. Nearly in the middle of the har- 
bour, there is a high rock called the Fort. It is said to have been 
fortified by Oliver Cromwell, but no remains of any work are dis- 
cernible on it. A receipt of Cromwell's for money received as 
lately found amongst the town's papers, and was in possession ot the 
treasurer; but, in consequence of being handed from one to an- 
other as a curiosity, it cannot now be found. 

In the middle of the town of Dysart, stands the town-house, it 
was built in 1617, and contains the hall in which the magistrates 
and council assemble for conducting the ordinary affairs of tlic 



PYSART.

burgh. Under the same roof, are the prison, the pubhc weigh-house, 
the guard-house, and the black-hole. The whole is a plain build- 
ing of strong ruble work, ornamented with a tower and spire. 
Part of it was occupied as a barrack-room by Cromwell's soldiers, 
and part of it as a magazine. Some of the soldiers, however, having 
entered the magazine with a lighted match, while in a state of intoxi- 
cation, the whole building was almost reduced to a ruin, and was 
not rebuilt for several years afterwards. 

Mansion-house, 8fc. — The only mansion-house now in the parish 
is that of the Earl of Rosslyn. It stands to the westward of the town 
of Dysart. It is a plain, but neat and commodious building, and 
commands a most beautiful view of the Forth, and of the pictur- 
esque scenery to the eastward of the town. 

About five or six years ago, a mill for spinning flax was erected 
in the parish, which employs from eighty to an hundred individuals, 
' most of whom are resident in the town. There is also a factory for 
stone-ware, which gives employment to nearly an hundred indivi- 
duals. And there is a small factory for making ropes, at which 
three or four individuals have constant employment. 

III. — Population. 
From want of proper documents, little information can be given 
of the ancient state of the population of this parish. With the ex- 
ception of Dunfermline, it has long been reckoned the most po- 
pulous in the county. So far back, indeed, as the year 1619 or 
1620, the inhabitants were so numerous, that one minister was not 
sufficient to do the work of the parish, and in consequence of this 
a second charge was estabhshed, and another minister introdu- 
ced. According to Dr Webster's report, as quoted in the former 
Statistical Account, the number of souls in 1755 was 2367, and, 
as will be seen from the census of 1831, it is now upwards of 
7000, exclusive of sailors, which amount to a few hundreds more. 
This great increase may be fairly traced to the different public 
works which have been estabhshed in the parish ; to the facilities 
afforded to feuars ; to the low rate of house-rents, and to the cheap- 
ness of fuel. 

A more particular account of the different villages in the parish 
will afterwards be given ; but in the meantime the following state 
of the population may be depended upon :

The only family of nobility residing occasionally in the parish 
is that of the Earl of Rosslyn : but there are many families of in- 
dependent fortune, and five or six proprietors of land whose in- 
come from that source varies from L. 200 to L. 300 or L. 400 a 
year. 

Dysart can boast of at least as many instances of longevity as 
any parish in Fife. There are a good many instances of people 
above eighty years of age, attending church regularly twice a day, 
not only in summer but during winter; and not many months ago, 
a respectable old man in 'his ninety-fourth year, not only attended 
church but sat in session with his brethren, and his recollections 
were as distinct as at any period of his life. 

The number of lunatics known to belong to the parish is only 
two, and they are supported in an asylum by the heritors. The 
number of fatuous persons does not exceed three or four at most. 

The great body of the people are of industrious habits ; and al- 
though from the pressure of the times, they have not had it in their 
power to enjoy those comforts which they did a few years ago, it 
would be great injustice to conceal that they have borne their pri- 
vations with more than ordinary patience— and that, upon the whole, 
they are contented and happy with their situation and circumstan- 
ces. There are a great number of very intelligent individuals 
amongst them, and not a few who are distinguished both for reli- 
gious principle and good moral practice. 

At one time, smuggling prevailed to a very great extent, and the 
common impression was, that there was no harm in it In many 
of the old houses, indeed, the smuggling holes where sea-faring 
people concealed tea, gin, and other articles, are still to be seen; 
but this degrading and sinful practice is not now known to exist, 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— This parish contains 3054 Scotch acres, the whole 
of which are arable, and under the plough,— except about 400 acres 
of plantation ground, and a park here and there let for grazing cattle. 

The trees belonging to the different plantations, as formerly men- 
tioned, are fir, oak, elm, &amp;c. all of which are regularly thinned 
and pruned, and the management of which is understood to be ex- 



DYSART. 



137 



cellent. As farm rents are generally paid partly in grain, and part- 
ly in money, it is difficult to say precisely what is the actual rent 
of arable land. It varies from L. 1, 5s. to L. 6, 6s. The average of 
the whole, however, as nearly as can be calculated, is about L. 2, 5s. 
or L. 2, 6s. per acre. 

Rent of Land. — The usual rent of grazing an ox or cow for 
the season is L. 4, and of grazing a ewe or full-grown sheep about 
16s. yearly. 

Improvements. — It is generally admitted that in no part of Fife- 
shire have greater improvements been made in agriculture than in 
this parish. Much land formerly waste has been reclaimed, drain- 
ed, and embanked. The farm-buildings are generally in the high- 
est order, being mostly all new within these few years. The system 
of husbandry pursued is that which has been most generally ap- 
proved of by those qualified to judge. The general duration of leases 
is nineteen years ; and although there is no public association in the 
parish for the encouragement of agriculture, great attention has 
been paid to the improvement of farm stock. 

As the farms are all under the plough, there are few sheep in 
the parish. The breeds of cattle generally preferred are the Fife, 
Ayrshire, and Teeswater breeds. Great attention has also been 
paid to the rearing of horses. 

The estates on which the above-mentioned improvements have 
chiefly taken place, are those belonging to Mr Fergus of Strathore 
and the Earl of Rossyln. On these estates as weir as throughout 
the parish, the leases are for nineteen years, except the burgh roods 
or acre land, which is let from year to year. 

At the time the leases were granted, they were reckoned favour- 
able to the tenants ; but from the low prices of grain of late years, 
the tenants complain that they are unable to pay their stipulated 
rents. 

Wheat, bariey, oats, potatoes, hay, and turnip are raised in large 
quantities and in regular rotation ; but the exact amount of raw 
produce raised in the parish could not easily be ascertained. 

Manufactures.— Ahout forty years ago, there were about 100 
smiths employed in the manufacture of nails. It is said that about 
12,000,000 of nails were made by this number of men, and that 
their value was not less than L. 2000. These were generally sold 
m Edmburgh and Glasgow, as well as in all the principal towns 
of the north of Scotland ; and a large proportion of them were used 
for ship-building. This branch of nail manufacture flourished ex- 



138 



FIFESIIIRE. 



ceedingly for upwards of a century ; but nail factories having Ijeen 
established in other parts of the country, greatly diminished the 
profits of the merchants here, and now the trade itself is almost 
totally discontinued. 

The same thing may be said of the manufacture of Unen cloth. 
Formerly, great quantities of it were made in the parish ; but very 
few now. 

The principal branch which flourishes at present is the manu- 
facture of checks and ticks. This branch of trade was introdu- 
ced into the parish between 1710 and 1720; it continued to in- 
crease till 1776 ; but about that time scarcely brought L. 9000 of 
yearly value. It is very different at present. The number of 
looms employed in the manufacture of this kind of cloth is 
about 2088; the quantity of cloth made is supposed to be 
31,006,720 yards; and the annual value of this quantity not under 
L. 150,236. A large proportion of this is sold in Glasgow, Lon- 
don, Manchester, Livei-pool, Nottingham and Leeds. A large pro- 
portion of it is also sent to other parts of Europe, to the Cape of 
Good Hope, and to the East and West Indies. The number of 
hands employed in this department of trade, including weavers, 
winders, and warpers, may be fairly estimated fi-om 5000 to 6000. 
Several of the manufacturers have agencies in different parts 
of the country, in Ceres, Strathmiglo, and Perth; and it appears 
from their testimony that the number of looms employed by them 
out of the parish is above 1000. 

The weavers are engaged all the six days of the week, when they 
can find employment. Some of them, indeed, are obliged to work 
from four or five in the morning till ten or eleven at night ; and after 
all their industry, will not earn more than 5s. or 6s. per week. It 
is almost needless to add, that this is but a poor remuneration for 
their labour ; that the effects of such long hours on their health 
are any thing but good, and are very adverse to mental unprove- 
ment. 

At the mill where flax is spun, the work people are employed 
from half-past five in the morning till eight at night, half an hour 
being allowed for breakfast and the same for dinner. The earn- 
ings of the female mill-spinners are from 6s. to 7s. weekly. It de- 
serves to be mentioned that the proprietors of this mill are men of 
great respectability; that they take an interest in the morals of the 
young people ; and that they will not allow the most distant ap- 
proaches to anything like vice. 



DYSART.

Navigation. — Formerly the shipping interest of the Port of Dy- 
sart was considerable, by far the greatest of any in Fife. Now, 
however, there are only a few brigs and a few sloops, and there are 
no foreign vessels to the port, except now and then one from Hol- 
land or from the Baltic, or when coals are ordered for the Northern 
Lighthouses. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Burgh. — The only town in the parish is the town or burgh of Dy- 
sart. It consists chiefly of three narrow streets, with a species of square 
in the centre. The central or High Street is full of antique substan- 
tial houses, the fronts of which are generally decorated with in- 
scriptions and dates, and in one part of it with piazzas. The piaz- 
zas are places in which the merchants in olden times exposed their 
goods to sale, but the greater number of them are now built up, 
so that the houses themselves scarcely retain a vestige of what was 
thought no small part of their ancient grandeur. 

The burgh was ktely disfranchised, owing to some informality 
in the Michaelmas elections ; and its affairs at present are under the 
superintendence of three managers, nominated by the Court of 
Session, The revenue of the burgh is about L. 500 or L. 600. The 
nearest market-town to it is Kirkaldy. 

Villages. — There are three villages in the parish, Pathhead, Gal- 
laton, and Boreland. Pathhead is in the western extremity of the pa- 
rish, at the head of a steep descent leading to Kirkaldy called the 
Path, and from thence it derives its name. It is divided into Path- 
head Proper or Dunnikier, and Sinclairton. The former or old 
town, which is of very ancient date, is built on the estate of Dun- 
nikier. It consists of three principal streets, the Back, the Mid- 
dle, and the Nether Street, at the end of which last street, is the 
house long inhabited by the family of Dunnikier. The latter, or 
New Town, is built on the estate of the Earl of Rosslyn, and is se- 
parated from the former by the great road leading to Dundee. 
The building of it commenced about seventy years ago, and ex- 
tends about a mile north, where it joins the village of Gallaton. 
The population in this part of the parish, as 'will be seen from the 
last census, is 3764. 

Gallaton is a village of considerable extent. It is divided into 
Easterand Wester Gallaton. The population of both is 1053. There 
are two traditions respecting the origin of the name. The one is, 
that under the feudal system, the field on which the first house was 
built was the place where criminals were executed. The other 



140 



FIFESHIRE. 



and more probable of the two is, that about two or three hun- 
dred years ago, a noted robber or house-breaker suffered the ex- 
treme penalty of the law here, and that, from this circumstance, it 
got the name of Gallowstown, afterwards of Gallaton, It was long 
a place celebrated for the making of nails: and when Dr Adam 
Smith resided in Kirkaldy, he frequently came to converse with the 
more intelligent nailers in this village respecting their mode of barter. 

The village of Boreland is the most inconsiderable of the three. 
It is about half a-mile to the south-east of Gallaton ; it was found- 
ed about a century ago, and is inhabited by those who are employ- 
ed in the coal works. About twenty years ago, there were fully 300 
individuals residing here ; but by the last census the population does 
not exceed 184. This arises from the coal works being carried on 
on a less scale than formerly. 

Means of Communication. — The parish enjoys ample means of 
communication with almost every part of the country. It has two 
post-offices or rather sub-offices ; Kirkaldy being the nearest post- 
town. The turnpike roads are in excellent condition. There is 
one which leads to Dundee and Aberdeen, about four miles and a- 
half in length ; another leading to St Andrews by Ceres, about 
three miles in length ; and another which branches off from the 
great road to Dundee and leads into the interior of the country, 
north from the village of Gallaton. Besides two steam-boats which 
ply regularly to Newhaven, a packet which plies three times a-week 
to Leith, and an occasional one to Dundee, no fewer than six pub- 
lic carriages travel on the turnpike roads, — two to Aberdeen, one 
to Dundee, one to Perth, one to Montrose, and one to Crail. 

The only two bridges in the parish which need to be mentioned 
are those on the water of Oar and Lochty. The one is about two 
miles and a-half from the cross of Dysart, and the other about 
three miles. 

The harbour of Dysart, the revenue of which belongs to the 
burgh, has been long and well known not to be one of the safest 
on the Frith of Forth. In winter, when the wind is easterly, 
it is extremely dangerous. The swell inside of it is so great 
that ships have been frequently driven from their moorings, and 
have been almost wrecked in it ; indeed, it is no unusual thing 
to be obliged to scuttle them. This arises not so much from 
the situation of the harbour, as from the construction of the east 
pier. Several eminent engineers and naval gentlemen have repeated- 
ly given it as their opinion, that, were part of it taken down and car- 
ried out in a different direction, Dysart might not only be made 



DTSART. 



141 



the safest and most commodious harbour on the coast, but might 
be rendered capable of admitting ships of almost every burden, and 
might even admit vessels drawing fifteen feet of water when the 
tides were at their lowest ebb. As this, however, required more funds 
than the town-council could command, it was resolved a few years 
ago to convert a quarry adjacent to the west pier, into a wet dock, — 
an undertaking which has been lately completed,- so that Dysart can 
now boast of a harbour to which none on the coast of Fife can be 
compared. The depth of water it contains is fully eighteen feet, 
and it will hold about seventeen or eighteen vessels of different 
burdens, exclusive of what the old harbour will contain. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was built in 1802. It 
is a neat plain building, is seated for 1600 examinable persons, and 
cost from L. 1800 to L. 2000. Its situation, which is at the top 
of the town, is fully as convenient for the parishioners in general, 
as any other which could have been selected, none of them being 
more than twenty minutes walk from it, except those living in the 
country, many of whom are above five miles distant. The seats 
are all private property, except a few which belong to the kirk-ses- 
sion. These last are let every half year at a very low rate, and the 
rents given to the poor. There are no free sittings for the poor. 
Dysart is a collegiate charge. The stipend of the first minister, 
as lately augmented, is 11 chalders of victual, half meal, and 
half barley, payable according to the highest fiar pricesof the county. 
He has also a chalder of salt yearly, the value of which is L. 3, 12s. ; 
lOi cwt. of coals weekly ; L. 10 for communion elements ; and 15s. 
lid. from some old buildings, called the Teind Barns, which, with 
the consent of the presbytery, were feued to Lord Sinclairabout sixty 
years smce. The minister has also a manse and glebe, and a right 
to the fish teinds. The glebe consists of four acres, and would 
brmg at present L. 20 of yearly rent. It is only about eleven vears 
smce a glebe was given. Although the house which the minister 
occupies IS about forty years old, it is not more than five years since 
It was made a manse. The former one, which was built in 1777, 
requiring some repairs,— it was thought more advisable to purchase 
the present house, which is considerably larger; to which, exchange 
the presbytery consented. The stipend of the second minister is 
10 chalders of victual, half meal and half barley, paid in the same 
manner as that of the first. He has L. 50 of money, part of which 
are included in the 10 chalders of victual; lOi cwt. of coals in 
the fortnight, and L. 5 for communion elements. He also receives 
U 25 yearly, being the interest of money mortified in the town's 



142 



FIFES 11 1 RE 



hands upwards of two hunh-ed years ago. He has neither manse 
nor glebe, nor any allowance for them. The Earl of Rosslyn is 
the patron of both charges. 

Large and increasing though the population of Dysart be, there 
are no Chapels of Ease attached to the Established Church. But 
about thirteen years ago, seven or eight individuals connected with 
the village of Pathhead, agreed to erect a place of worship at 
their own expense. It cost about L. 3000, and they have no re- 
turn for their money but the seat rents, which are far from being 
an adequate remuneration. The house was opened in November 
1823, ever since which time the ministers of Dysart have preach- 
ed in' it, and dispensed the ordinances of religion, without asking 
or receiving any emolument. The building is neat and elegant; 
it is ornamented with a spacious tower, and is seated for 970 persons. 

There are two dissenting chapels in the parish, the one belong- 
ing to the synod of Relief, and the other to the Antiburghers. The 
stipend of the minister in the Relief chapel is very small, and that 
of the Antiburgher does not exceed L. 100 yearly. Both are de- 
pendent for their livings upon the seat rents, and the Sabbath days' 
collection made at their church doors. These cannot amount to 
much, when it is considered that the usual congregation in both 
places does not exceed 800 or 900 people at most 

A few years ago, the parish was divided by authority of the Pres- 
bytery, so that each minister has now a district under his own im- 
mediate superintendence. In the east division, which includes the 
town of Dysart, the villages of Gallaton, Boreland, and the coun- 
try part of the parish, the state of matters with respect to the 
Church is as follows :

The number usually attending the parish church is from 1200 to 
1300 ; and at Pathhead it is about 600. There are about 1800 
names on the communion roll ; but of this number not more than 
600 or 700 communicate in the parish church, at each sacrament : 
and not more than 400 at Pathhead. 

There are several religious societies in the parish, viz. a Bible 
and Missionary Society, which occasionally gives part of its funds 
to the Gaelic and Hibernian Societies ; a Sabbath Evening School 
Society ; and a Society for the Education of Children. This last 



DYSART. 



143 



society does not educate the young people gratuitously ; but only 
pays one-half of the school fees, upon condition that the parents 
pay the other half. Hitherto, it has been supported by individual 
subscriptions among the heritors, and by the parishioners at large, 
and also by collections at the church doors. 

Besides these, there is a society in the town of Dysart for the 
support of indigent old women. It has existed for nearly half a 
century, and has been the means of doing much good. Its expen- 
diture has been about L. 40 yearly. 

The exact amount of contributions for religious and charitable 

 

purposes cannot easily be ascertained ; but, including collections 
made at the church doors, it is not less than L. 100 yearly. Last 
year it was nearly L. 200. Owing to the dulness of trade, and the 
low rate of wages among the labouring classes of society, and ow- 
ing to few of the heritors residing constantly in the parish, the col- 
lections made at the church doors are not so great as formerly. 

Education. — There are 14 schools in the parish, — two of which 
are taught by females,— viz. at Dysart, 4; at Pathhead, 4; at Sin- 
clairtown, 2 ; at Gallaton, 3; at Boreland, 1 ; total, 14. The paro- 
chial or rather the burgh school is conveniently situated only for such 
children as reside in the town of Dysart. The master is elected by 
the town-council, who pay his salary, amounting to L. 43, partly from 
the burgh funds, and partly from money mortified for this purpose. 
He has no dwelling-house nor garden, but he receives an allow- 
ance for them from the town. Besides the usual branches of edu- 
cation, he teaches Latin, book-keeping, and mensuration. All the 
other schools are supported by school-fees alone, except two,— one 
in Pathhead, which is endowed, and the master of which receives 
L. 120 in the year for teaching 150 children reading, writing, and 
arithmetic; and another in Boreland, the salary of which is L. 8, 
besides free house, school-house, and coals. The total number of 
children attending the above-mentioned schools varies from 700 
to 800. 

Notwithstanding the facilities for education that this parish af- 
fords, It was lately ascertained, that there are nearly 60 persons above 
the age of fifteen who cannot read or write. Judging, however, from 
the eagerness with which many parents have availed themselves of 
the advantages which have been more recently held out, it would, 
perhaps, be unfair to say, that the people in general are not alive to 
the benefits of education; and the number of uneducated children 
in the parish can, in very many instances, be traced to the low wages 



144 FIFESHIRE. 

which the labouring classes receive, and which render it almost im- 
possible for them to educate their children without assistance. 

It was already said, that the burgh school is conveniently situated 
for those children only who reside in the town. But it ought to be 
mentioned, that although the present teacher is a distinguished scho- 
lar, the youth, even within the town, are so numerous, that they 
could not be educated at all were it not for the private schools which 
have been opened. And in the landward or country part of the 
parish, which is 4, 5, and 5 miles distant from Dysart, the youth 
would not be educated at all, were it not that a school-house has 
been built by subscription in a corner of the parish of Markinch, 
supported partly by school fees, and partly by a salary paid to the 
teacher by the Earl of Rosslyn and Mr Balfour of Balgonie. At 
the last examination of this school there were 70 children present, 
amongst whom were four Latin scholars. 

The expense of education in this parish is in some cases 2d. per 
week, but more generally 3d. weekly, or 3s. per quarter for the 
ordinary branches. It is almost needless to add, that in each of the 
villages in the parish, especially in Gallaton, Boreland, and the 
landward part of the parish, an established master is required. 

Libraries, 8fc. — There are two subscription libraries in the parish, 
consisting of books of history, voyages, travels, &amp;c. There is one 
called the Mechanics' Library, and there is another consistmg of 
religious books only. The subscription to the three former is Is. 
quarterly, and to the latter Is. yearly, or a penny per month. 

There are two pubhc reading rooms in the parish, where most 
of the usual newspapers of the day may be seen. 

The only friendly societies now in the parish are those among 
the sailors, the maltmen, and the bakers. These have been long 
in existence, at least two hundred years. The funds belonging to 
each of them are extensive, and are entirely devoted to the support 
of indigent or decayed members. 

Savings' Bank. — There is also a savings' bank in Dysart, the 
accumulated fund of which is about L. 1200. The deposits in it 
are chiefly from the labouring classes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
who receive aid from the parish funds is 120, and the average al- 
lowance to each is 2s. 6d. per month. In some cases, however, 3s. 
or 4s. are given. The fund is made up by collections at the church 
door, amounting on an average to L. 90 per annum; by seat rents 
belonging to the kirk-session, amounting to about L. 30 in the year ; 
and by an annual contribution among the heritors, which varies from 



DYSART. 145 

L. 150 to L. 200 yearly. Out of this fund, two lunatics are sup- 
jjorted in an asylum. 

It must be admitted, that now and then application is made to 
the kirk-session for parochial aid, which they cannot sustain ; yet 
there is no particular disposition in this parish to seek such relief; 
and it IS but justice to mention, that there are many instances in 
which widows, with large families, and in which other individuals, 
have come forward and thanked the kirk-session for what had been 
done for them in their day of need, and have respectfully declined 
farther assistance. 

Prison.— Bysart cannot certainly boast of having a well-secured 
prison ; but there is seldom a prisoner in it. 

Fairs. — Formerly there were six annual fairs in the parish, for the 
sale of wool, white cloth, hntseed, and black cattle. These were at- 
tended by merchants from Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Stirling. 
Now, however, little remains of them but the name. They are 
almost completely deserted. 

Inns. — There are by far too many public-houses in the parish, 

not fewer than 150,— and it is almost needless to say, that their 
effects upon the morals of the people are most pernicious. 

Fuel— Coal is in great abundance, and very cheap. Twelve hun- 
dred weight, including carriage, may be had' for 5s. in almost any 
part of the parish ; and in some parts of it for less. 

. Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the pa- 
rish and that which existed at the time when the last Statistical 
Account was made out are these: great improvements in agricul- 
ture; much waste land reclaimed, drained, and embanked; farm- 
buildings greatly improved; almost total giving up of the nail trade; 
and prodigious increase of the manufacture of checks and ticks; 
comparatively little ship-building; great diminution of shipping 
fairs or public markets given up; a new church and schoolhouse 
in Dysart, and a new church and endowed school in Pathhead; a 
greatly improved harbour ; the erection of a mill for spinning flax ; 
a patent slip for repairing vessels of large tonnage ; a complete and 
sate harbour; friendly societies diminished in number; and a pros- 
perous savings' bank. Formerly almost every female was taught to 
■spm Imt, but for many years past, this practice has entirely ceased.

THE REV. JOHN MURRAY, MINISTER. 



I — Topography and Natural History. 
The whole of Abbotshall, with the exception of three farms, 
Easter and Wester Touch, belonging to Kinghorn, and Wester Bo- 
gie to Dysart,— was disjoined from the parish of Kirkaldy m the 
year 1650. 

Name.— The newly erected parish was called Abbotsliall, a 
name obviously derived from the circumstance of one of the ab- 
bots of Dunfermline having built a house here, in which he oc- 
casionally resided. The situation of the house, or hall of the ab- 
bot as it was styled, was about a quarter of a mile due west from 
the present church, and near to the centre of the Raith gardens, or 
what are still sometimes called the Abbotshall gardens. A fine yew 
tree which grew in front, and which has already stood the blast of 
centuries, will probably long serve to mark out to the inquirer the 
spot on which the mansion of the abbot was placed, f 

• This disjunction originated in an application made to the Pytyyly several 
of the herito s of the landward district of Kirkaldy, in consequence of the great ex. 
Ln of he parish, and distance of a considerable part of it from tl- f urch,_pray.ng 
tha they would appoint some of heir number to visit that part of the par sh and re- 
port whether or not another church should be built. , The records Pr"'';   
that thev willingly received this application, and appointed certan t''" ""J;'" ° 
visU te'boundro- the said landward district and to report 1-- Judgmen of he ne- 
cessitv of separating it from the other part of the parish ; as also what u as the fittest 
plaeeVhere'a new clurch shouldbe built, in the event of .heir opinion b-ng ta 
to the disjunction. It also appears from the records of presbytery, £ ate October 
31st, 1649, that this visitation was made, and that a report was given 7°"' " 
wishes of the petitioners. The eonsequci.ee was that the presbyte,  '■-"";\ 
to the Commissioners of Parliament for Su'-re"ders and I ithes tl at a d. jui.c 
should take place, which the commissioners authorized, and the whole was completed

Boundaries — Extent. — The parish being a good deal intersected 
by other parishes, is of an irregular shape ; but its greatest length, 
from the coast to the north-west, is not less than 4 miles, and 
its breadth, which varies much at different points, may average 
2. It is bounded on the north-east by Kirkaldy; on the south- 
east by the Frith of Forth ; on the south-west by the parish of 
Kinghorn ; and on the north-west by that of Auchterderran. The 
parish of Auchtertool touches it on the west. 

Topographical Appearances. — Along the coast, the grounds are 
flat and level to the distance of more than half a-mile from the sea, 
when they begin to rise into fine sloping banks, with occasional 
interruptions, for the distance of three miles; afterwards they gra- 
dually descend till they reach the extremity of the parish. 

Soil, Sfc. — The soil, as may be expected, is different in different 
parts ; but on the average is greatly superior to that of most parishes in 
Fife. Near the sea shore, it is free and healthy,— being very ge- 
nerally the soil arising from decomposed whin or trap rock, and is 
particularly favourable for raising crops of barley and turnips. Fur- 
ther back, and where the grounds begin to ascend, the soil is 
richer and stronger, being for the most part of a clayey or dark 
loamy substance, and well adapted for wheat, beans, and other 
heavy crops. Towards the extreme points, and farthest from the 
coast, the soil is, for the most part, of a cold tiUy bottom, and con- 
sequently less productive. It is very susceptible, however, of im- 
provement, and is in the immediate vicinity of coal and lime, though 
less favoured in regard to other kinds of manure than the rest of the 
parish. 

The climate throughout the whole is good, and no diseases of 
an epidemic nature can be said to prevail. To this, the washing of 
our shores by the Forth twice every four and twenty hours doubt- 
less contributes, as well as the many dry and inviting walks on all 
hands within reach of the inhabitants. At present the parish fur- 
nishes no very remarkable instances of longevity; but there are 
123 persons who have outhved three score years and ten,~of 
whom 24 are upwards of eighty, and 2 upwards of ninety. The 
most prevalent winds are the westerly, and the quantity of rain which 
tails is 33 inches, a larger quantity than usual, 31 inches accord-

ing to Sir John Sinclair being the average tliat fulls in the course 
of the year throughout Scotland. 

Hydroyrapliy, — There is no stream or water of any consequence 
running through or connected with this parish. The streamlet 
flowing from Loch Gelly, in the iarish of Auchterderran, and which 
afterwards falls into the water of Oar in the same parish, touches 
it for a little distance on the north-west, as does the Tiel on the 
south-west, and both waters are useful in turning the different mills 
w hich are situated on them. The small brook that runs from Camilla 
Loch, in the parish of Auchtertool, also bends its course through 
this parish, where it joins the Tiel previous to its falling into the 
jsea at the west bridge. In its way, the Camilla stream serves as the 
principal feeder to that beautiful and picturesque sheet of water 
known by the name of the Raith Lake. This lake, which is situated 
in the heart of the Raith pleasure-grounds, and at the hase of the 
hill on which the mansion-house is placed, was formed by the pre- 
sent proprietor in the year 1811-12, and is one of the finest arti- 
ficial constructions of the kind that is anywhere to be seen. It is 
somewhat of an oval form, about a mile in length, and at certain 
points almost a quarter of a mile in breadth. The extent of ground 
it covers is not less than twenty-one acres, and the water is at some 
places twenty-five deep. It was originally an extensive hollow, as if 
scooped out, in some measure, for thepui-pose, by the hand of nature; 
— and by filling it up at some places, and deepening and extending it 
at others, the work was in a short time completed ; a sluice is left at 
the centre, by which the lake can be filled or emptied at pleasure. 
The whole is finished in a masterly and ingenious manner, and the 
expense was very inconsiderable, considering the surface it covers, and 
the quantity of water it contains. The lake abounds in a variety of 
fishes, such as trout, perch, tamel, and eel. There are several pleasure 
boats on it belonging to the family, and the angler may find abundance 
of amusement. It is graced by some beautiful white swans, which 
may now and then be seen floating majestically along, and wild 
ducks are flying about in various directions. On every side, the 
lake is surrounded with delightfulwalks, — which, as well as the other 
walks about Raith, are, through the liberality of the proprietor, at 
all times accessible to the more respectable portion of the commu- 
nity. To strangers and others, who, during the summer and au- 
tumn months, come from different quarters of the country to view 
the fine scenery and highly decorated grounds of Railh, the lake 
is a principal object of attraction and admiration,

Geohyij and Miner alogi. — Thegfeater partof'tliis pai'ish, in com- 
moii with the district around Kirkaldy, is composed of rocks of the 
two great formations, that of the carboniferous hmestoneandthe coal 
strata, with an intermixture of trap rock. The carboniferous lime- 
stone is well displayed in the quarry of Innertiel, which, although 
not in Abbotshall, deserves notice in this place, as affording the best 
section of that strata which runs through the parish. In that quarry, 
the carboniferous limestone is in thick beds, with interposed seams 
of dark-colom-ed calcareous shale. The limestone is quite full of encri- 
nal remains; and many of the rarer portions of encrinites, viz. the 
bases, fingers, and even the bodies in a pretty perfect state, may be 
extracted from the loose shale. Trochites shewing great variety and 
delicacy in their markings are also abundant. The following species 
of encrinites following the nomenclature of Miller were met with, 
after a careful search in the shale, by a scientific friend of the writer of 
this Account, who lately resided for a short time in the parish. — 
Cyathocrinitesplanus, C. tuber culatus, C.ruffosus, C.quinquangularis, 
Platycrinites Icevis, P. rugosiis, Poteriocrinites tenuis, and Rhodocri- 
nites. Of all these Cyathocrinites tulerculatus, which Miller states to 
be rare in England, was the most common. There is, in the limestone, 
also abundance of Orthoceratites and Terehratulites, and a variety of 
other shells. The Chapel quarry, which is the principal one of the 
kind in this parish, is of limestone of the Same formation, and exhibits 
large encrinal columns, sometimes an inch and a-half in diameter, 
and Orthoceratites nearly two feet long. Some rare forms of cal- 
careous spar -are also to be met with in cavities in the limestone. 
The carboniferous limestone is much interrupted and disturbed by 
trap rocks, which rise here and there to the surface. Upon it, rest 
the coal strata which run through this district, and which contain 
valuable seams of coal. Amid this variety of fossils, freestone is 
also to be met with, and is used for the common purposes of build- 
ing. For the better sort of houses, however, and the more orna- 
mental parts of buildings, the Collelo stone, or some other of a si- 
milar kind, is generally preferred. Coal being profitably worked by 
some of the proprietors in the immediate neighbourhood, there are 
no pits open at present in this parish. The inhabitants, however, are 
well supplied with that article of fuel, and at an easy rate. The 
nearest colliery is that at the lack of the town of Kirkaldy, belong- 
mg to Sir John Oswald, where the price of coal is 7s. 7d. per ton 
of 21 cwt. At the colliery of Dysart, belonging to the Eari of 
Rosslyn, the price is 7s. ; and at the colliery of Cluny, belonging to 



150 



FIFESHIRE. 



Mr Ferguson of RaitH, the price is 6s. 5d. The Cluny coal,' though 
the most distant, is generally preferred. The price of lime at the 
different quarries is from 2s. to 2s. 4d. per boll old corn firlot, and 
the quantity sold annually is very considerable. 

Botany. — The only plants that may be called rare are Campa- 
nula rapunculoides, Listera ovata, and Drosera rotundifulia. The 
first of these is to be found on the farm of Balwearie, the others on 
the farm of Torbain. 

The trees most commonly to be met with are, the oak, beech, 
sycamore, chesnut, spruce, ash, walnut, elm, larch, Scotch fir, &amp;c. 
all of which thrive well, except the larch, which seems impatient of 
the soil, and soon becomes chaffed, and sometimes even rotten at 
the heart, against its thirtieth year. In the Raith plantations, all these 
kinds of trees and many more are to be seen in great beauty and 
perfection. Immediately in front of the mansion-house, there is 
a fine beech, which measures in circumference 14 feet; on the 
south side of the house, there are two chesnuts likewise of large 
size and dimensions. The girth of the one is 11 feet, and of the 
other 9|. A hawthorn, which stands on the east side of the gar- 
den, is well worthy of notice, being of great age, size, and beauty. 
Near the same place, and about twenty yards from the approach, is 
to be seen what is considered the purest purple beech in the county. 
Evergreens of every variety thrive well about Raith, particularly the 
Portugal laurels, many of which form fine trees of 5 feet in girth 
of bole and upwards. The whole of the plantations there, are under 
a good system of management, both as to pruning and thinning, 
and the thinnings, though seldom large, are readily purchased for 
the excellent quality of the timber. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — The antiquities of the parish are few and easily 
told. On Cormie Hill, or that eminence on which the Raith Tower 
stands, there have been found, at different places, several rude stone 
coffins, similar to what have been found in other parts of Scotland. 
Some urns have also been dug up containing human bones. On 
the part where the Tower stands, there was a small artificial mound, 
on removing which it evidently appeared to have been a burnt mould 
and many fragments of deers-horns were found in it. From seve- 
ral appearances, this hill is supposed to have been in former days a 
military station, or at all events a place of national rendezvous. 

The ruins of the tower of Balwearie, anciently the property of the fa- 
mous wizard, Sir Michael Scott, are still preserved. From what re- 

3 



ABBOTSHALL, 



151 



mains, it must have been originally of great strength, and of con- 
siderable importance. The walls measure in thickness six feet and 
a-half, and the dimensions within walls are thirty feet. It is reason- 
ably supposed to have been a square. All that is now preserved 
is the east wall,j,vhich is entire, and part of the north and south 
walls. The lower part of it has been arched, and it was probably 
used as a defence for cattle. In these more peaceable times, it is 
used for feeding cattle, which purpose it is -made to answer well. 
The height of this tower or castle could not be less than from fifty 
to sixty feet. On the roof of the building, according to tradition, 
the white-haired and venerable sage was accustomed to sit, observ- 
ing the face of the heavens, and conversing with the stars. 

Emineiit Men. — Sir Michael Scott was born at Balwearie, accord- 
ing to the most accredited accounts, near the beginning of the thir- 
teenth century, and from his earliest youth discovered a remarkable 
thirst for knowledge. After receiving such scanty rudiments of educa- 
tion as his native country at that time afforded, he went into Eng- 
land, where, at the University of Oxford, he devoted himself with 
deep apphcation to the study of philosophy. Completing his studies 
at Oxford, he repaired, according to the fashion of the age in which 
he lived, to the University of Paris, where he prosecuted with so 
much ardour the study of mathematics, as to acquire for himself 
the name of " Michael the mathematician." Nor did he, in the 
midst of these avocations, neglect the study of the sacred let- 
ters and divinity; but gaining in these branches a high reputation, 
he received the degree of Doctor in Theology. With these learned 
distinctions, Michael Scott determined on farther travels, and visit- 
ed many other countries and universities. Amongst these, he first 
sought the far-famed College of Padua, where such appears to have 
been the impression created by his talents, that his essays were no 
longer, as in France, confined within the walls of a university. His 
fame became noised abroad, and he began to publish to the world 
those predictions of future events, which were remembered in later 
times with awe and reverence in Italy.f From Italy, Michael Scott, 

M llffrnrf "I''ng to Sibbald, was in possession of the family of Scott for 
at least oOO years. To the same family belonged also Scotscraig and many other

still iiiiweaned in the pursuit of knowledge, made his way into Spain, 
where, at the University of Toledo, he had the best opportunity of 
cultivating the occult sciences, under the patronage of the Emperor 
Frederick the Second. Having perfected himself in the study of 
alchemy, he turned his thoughts to the study of aaedicine, and for 
this purpose went into Germany, where he resided for several years 
previous to his return to his native country. He arrived in Scotland 
just at that critical juncture when the nation was plunged into grief 
by the death of Alexander the Third; and, along with Sir David 
Wemyss was appointed to proceed to Norway to bring home the young 
Queen, — the result of which expedition is well known. This is the 
last occasion in which the name of Sir Michael Scott appears to 
be mentioned. Of his death nothing is recorded ; but he must have 
died soon after his return from Norway, and in extreme old age. It is 
a curious fact, that in his native parish, there are fewer stories current 
amongst the people about this extraordinary character, and his name 
is less frequently mentioned than in most other parts of Scotland. 

" Fama - -- -- -- -- 

Mobilitate vigct, vii esque acquiiit euudo."' 

From the time of Michael Scott, there does not appear to have 
been any character of note connected with Abbotshall, till the 
year 1538, when we find Thomas Scott, f a Lord of Session, un- 
der the title of Lord Abbotshall. In the year 1671, we find Sir 
Andrew Ramsay mentioned as a Lord of Session, under the same 
title. Sir Andrew continued to hold the office of a Judge till 1674, 
during which time he was twice Provost of Edinburgh. It was 
while he filled the civic chair in the year 1667, that Charles the 
Second by whom he was probably knighted ordered that the Pro- 
vost of Edinburgh should take the same precedency as the Mayor 
of London, and that no other Provost should assume the title of 
" My Lord." Sir Andrew died, and was buried at Abbotshall in 
1688. t In the year 1690, we find George Melville of Raith 

" Sir Walter Scott tells us, in a note to the Lay of the Last Minstrel, in which ro- 
mantic poem the name of the magician is embalmed, that amongst the peasantry in the 
south of Scotland, any work of great labour of antiquity is ascribed either to the agency 
of Auld Michael, of Sir William Wallace, or the Devil. 

t This Scott was doubtless a descendant of Sir Michael Scott. Abbotshall, Sib- 
bald mentions as " anciently the possession of the Scotts of Balwearie." Both Bal- 
wearie and Abbotshall have long since formed part of the Raith estate, and are now 
of course the property of Robert Ferguson, Esq. of Raith. 

J Sir Andrew Ramsay seems to have purchased Abbotshall from the Scotts. I\lr 
Andrew Ramsay, father of Sir Andrew, and one of the ministers of Edinburgli, is 
noticed as having died at his son's house at Abbotsliall in lie year 1G59; thus inti- 
mating, afj it were, that Sir Andrew Ramsay was the irst of the name to whom Ab- 
botshall belonged. Sir Andrew was succeeded in Abluitshall, according to Silbaid, ly 
liis " nevoy Mr Andrew Ramsay, and a grandson of the Laird of Whitstoun in the 
M earns."

mentioned as one of the Peers of Scotland, under the title of Lord 
Melville, Lord Raith, Monymeal and Balwearie, Viscount Kirk- 
aldy, and Earl of Melville. The family and titles are now merged 
in that of Leven, and the estate of Raith soon after passed into the 
hands of the present family. 

This parish had the honour of giving birth to William Adam, who 
arrived at the greatest eminence as an architect, which the limited 
opportunities at that time afforded by his native country would per- 
mit. Hopetoun House and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, the 
one a splendid, the other a plain structure, are specimens of his 
abilities. WiUiam Adam, it need hardly be mentioned, was the 
father of Robert and James Adam, still more distinguished for their 
genius in architecture, and who reared that splendid monument of 
their taste and names, " The Adelphi." The family is now repre- 
sented by the Honourable William Adam, late Chief- Commissioner 
of the Jury Court. 

It would be improper to omit, that that distinguished soldier and 
patriot, Sir Ronald C. Ferguson, is a native of this place. He was 
born at Raith, the seat of his family, in the year 177L 

Land-otoners. — These are five in number, and two of them have 
their principal residences here. Raith, anciently the seat and posses- 
sion of the Earls of Melville, now the property of Robert Ferguson, 
Esq. M. P. is by far the most considerable estate in the parish, 
being more than equal in value and extent to all the rest of the 
parish together. The mansion-house was originally built in the 
year 1694, by Lord Raith, Treasurer Depute, and must have been 
at that time a substantial good house. Its length is 72 feet, and 
its breadth 40. To the original house were added two wings, dur- 
ing the time of the late Mr Ferguson, which made the accommo- 
dation veiy complete, and such as became the mansion-house of so 
fine an estate as Raith. A few years ago, the present proprietor 
attached to the front of the house a fine Ionic portico, which gives 
to the whole a light and elegant appearance. In the interior of 
the house, what principally claims attention is the hbrary, which 
contains a well chosen assortment of books, both ancient and mo- 
dern,— and a cabinet of minerals, which, for richness and ex- 
tent, is surpassed by few private collections of the sort in the king- 
dom. The situation of the house is noble and commanding, and 
the extent of plantations and pleasure grounds which surround 
It IS very considerable. Near the summit of the hill on which the 
mansion-house is seated, and perhaps 400 feet above the level of 
the sea, stands the tower, which is a square building, with an inside

stair of 54 feet in length. From the top of this tower so extensive 
IS the view, that not less than parts of fourteen, some say sixteen, dif- 
ferent counties can be distinctly pointed out in a clear day. In the 
near vicinity of Raith, and a little further up the country, stands the 
mansion-house of Wester Bogie, the property of Miss Thomson, only 
child of the late James Thomson, Esq. of Wester Bogie. The house 
of Bogie is modern, and was built after a design ]y Mr Gillespie Gra- 
ham, in the form of a eastle. The plan of building is well suited 
to the situation, which is high, and surrounded with some fine old 
trees. The extent of ground is limited ; but, for its size, Bogie is 
considered one of the most desirable properties in the county.

In manners, the inhabitants of the parish are civil and discreet, 
and their external deportment is decent and respectful. They are 
inquisitive and fond of knowledge, and reading occupies a conside- 
rable portion of their leisure time. What relates to politics and re- 
ligion chiefly engages their attention, in this way. They are fond 
of speculation in the one, and of controversy in the other. Notwith- 
standing, they are good and peaceable subjects, and live together in 
friendly and Christian intercourse,

Rent of Land.— The land' rents are different in different parts. 
On the coast and about the town L. 5, and even L. 6 per acre are no- 
thing uncommon to pay for land. Further back, and a little way 
up the country, the rent may be from L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 per acre, 
and in the more remote parts, the land rents are as low as L. 1, 10s. 
and L. 1. The average of the whole may be L. 2, 10s. The 
valued rental of the parish is L. 798, 9s. 9d. The real rental may 
be about L. 7500. 

Husbandry.—The rotation of crops generally practised is sum- 
mer fallow or potatoes, after which comes wheat, then beans dril- 
led and hoed, or grass pastured two years, or the first year hay, 
and the second pasture. Grass is generally succeeded by a crop 
of oats. The rotation, however, necessarily varies according to cir- 
cumstances, and the taste of the grower ; but, with a very few excep- 
tions, the alternate cultivation of leguminous and culmiferous crops is

and weeds liad oained full jjossession of the soil, that one would 
imagine that nothing but the most imperative necessity or the woi st 
motives should induce a farmer to depart from it. In the immedi- 
ate vicinity of the town, summer fallow is now little practised, and 
potatos generally come instead, — a crop which always meets with 
a constant and ready demand. Turnips, too, are very frequently 
substituted for beans, — after which, uniformly follows a crop of bar- 
ley. Throughout the whole of this parish, agricultural operations are 
carried on with spirit and assiduity, and nowhere during the last 
forty years has the face of the country undergone a greater change. 
The farmers are, generally spealcing, men of capital-and skill, and 
there is no tried improvement in modern farming which has not 
been adopted and pursued with success. The situation of the 
parish is favourable for agricultural improvement and enterprise. 
The populous community of Kirkaldy, with its weekly markets, makes 
a ready demand for all kinds of farm produce, and there is no part 
of the parish distant from coal and lime. To those near the towns, 
the stables and streets afford a regular supply of dung at a mode- 
rate expense; and sea- weed is occasionally to be had for the trouble 
of collecting and driving. But if the farmers in this parish are thus 
favoured in regard to situation, they are no less so in regard to their 
respective landlords, who are men of liberality and discernment, and 
afford every encouragement to honest and persevering industry. 
The farms are all of that size which is favourable to improvement, 
and the leases are uniformly of nineteen years duration, -f- The 
dwelling-houses and offices are likewise good, and for the most part 
new, and the fields are all well enclosed and subdivided with stone 
walls or hedges. 

There are no sheep bred in this parish, and none to be seen in 
it except a few scores kept in the enclosures about Raith, and be- 
longing to Mr Ferguson. They are of the Cheviot breed, and 
seem to thrive well on the fine pasture on which they are fed. 
There are also but few black-cattle reared in this parish, — the land 
being too valuable to be kept long in pasture. Those preferred 
are of the Fife breed, which, in their pure state, are known by their 
black colour, length and fineness of their horns, shortness of their 

• The profit arising in the neiglibourhood of the town is very great; — L. 12, L. Ifi.

have been dug up. 

f To this, tlio iekis in the neiglibourhood of the town form an exception, — which 
are frequently parcelled out for the convenience of persons residing in the town, who 
wish to cultivate only a few acres, and are generally let from year to year witlioul

legs, and beautiful symmetry. Tiie pure Fife breed, however, is 
seldom met with, and the cattle reared in this parish are for the 
most part a mixture of the Fife and Angus or Ayrshire. The 
amount of bestial at present in the parish is as follows : horses of 
all ages, 114; milch cows, 104; black cattle, 203; calves, 30; 
pigs, 81. 

Manufactures. — The staple manufacture of this place is that of 
bed-ticks; to which, of late years, has been added a species of coarse 
half-white hnen called Dowlas, both for home and export trade. 
Linen checks for foreign consumpt have fallen into decay, from 
the greater cheapness of a similar fabric now made from cotton in 
other places. There is one manufactory for sail-canvas; one bleach- 
field for whitening and preparing hnen yarns, — a branch of trade that 
has of late years entirely superseded the use of hand-wheels, which 
were formerly so common in this and all other districts of Fifeshire, 
and which gave employment both to the older and younger members of 
families. The introduction of machinery into this branch of manu- 
fticture has not only materially increased the quantity, but has con- 
siderably diminished the expence of labour, it being produced at 
about two-thirds less than when spun by the hand labour. There 
is one factory, worked by a steam engine, for weaving a thin sheet- 
ing from linen yarn. It is considered to be well conducted, and is 
the only one of the kind in the county. The low rate of weaving 
by the hand is probably the cause why this branch of enterprise 
has not been more generally adopted. A brick and tyle-work of 
considerable extent has been very long estabhshed in this parish. 
At the same place, a pottery for maldng brown earthen-ware is ear- 
ned on. A coal gas-work, for the purpose of supplying the town 
of Kirkaldy, Linktown of Abbotshall, &amp;c. with gas, was erected in 
this parish, about two years ago. The quality of gas is considered 
good, and the quantity used throughout the year may average 5000 
feet each night, llie work is capable of affording a much greater 
supply ; but as yet gas has not been introduced as a general light for 
dwelling-houses,— being principally used for the lighting up of 
streets, public works, and shops. There are a variety of mills which 
go by water, and are employed for making flour, barley meal, &amp;c. At 
one of these, not less than from 10,000 to 15,000 bolls annually are 
made. There is also one mill which goes by water for grinding flint, 
and belongs to the same gentleman that has the pottery. Brew- 
mg was formerly carried on to some extent, but now there are on- 
ly two breweries in the parish, which manufacture nothing strong.

er than small beer. This is certainly to be regretted, as good malt 
liquor is a more wholesome beverage than whisky, which is now so 
common, and the cause of so much wretchedness and crime. The 
hig h price of wheaten bread gave rise, a number of years, ago to the 
establishment of two Societies, by which the inhabitants might be 
supplied with that important article of life at a cheaper rate than by the 
regular bakers. In so far as the cheapness of the bread is concerned, 
these societies have answered the purpose intended; but if it be the 
case, as some allege, that they have been the means of depreciating 
the quality of bread throughout the community the regular trader 
being unable to compete on equal terms with a joint stock company 
it is not so evident how far they ought to be encouraged, or whether 
in one way they have not done as much harm as they have done 
good in another. There is also a meal Society on a similar plan, 
which is of advantage to the public, by affording a ready supply of 
meal at all times, and generally at a reasonable price. 

In the conducting of the different public works in this parish, there 
is nothing particular claiming to be noticed. The usual hours of la- 
bour at all of them are ten, excepting the spinning-mills, where 
twelve hours are common. All the people employed at the diffe- 
rent works receive a fair remuneration for their labour, and, if care- 
ful, live comfortably, and frequently rear large families. The wages 
of certain operatives, however, have of late years been much re- 
duced. An ordinary weaver, for instance, on the best paid fabrics, 
will not receive above an average of 8s. per week for his own labour. 
None of the public works here are considered prejudicial to the health 
of those employed in them; the linen manufacture in all its branch- 
es being more wholesome than that of cotton, from the absence of 
any artificial heat or damp. Although it cannot be denied that the 
congregating together of so many young people of both sexes at 
spinning-mills and other public works, naturally tends to a corrup- 
tion and depravity of morals, yet it can hardly be said that the mo- 
rals of those so employed are worse than the morals of the aggre- 
gate number of others in the same grade of society in the parish. 
This may be owing to the steady principle of the gentlemen to 
whom the works belong, and the good discipline introduced by 
them into all the different departments of the business. The in- 
crease of commerce and manufactures in this parish and neighbour- 
hood gave rise, in the year 1 825, to a Society known by the name 
of the Kirkaldy Chamber of Commerce, — the intention of which 
was to unite the influence of the merchants and manufactures, and

tluis render them more useful to the communities to which they be- 
longed. It is managed by a committee of directors ; and some of 
the leading members belong to this place. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages. — The principal town or village in the parish is what is 
called the Linktown, which is situated on the west side of the bay of 
Kirkaldy, from which it is only separated by the intervening beach. 
The Linktown has only one street, which is about three quarters 
of a mile long, and forms a continuation on the west to the principal 
street of the town of Kirkaldy. It is a burgh of regality, and go- 
verned by a baron-bailie, appointed by Mr Ferguson of Raith, who 
is superior of the whole. 

The street and the lanes of Linktown are narrow, and the 
original houses are mostly low and uncomfortable. Many of the 
houses, however, have been rebuilt, and many new ones erected ; 
all of them, in point of convenience and accommodation, far exceed- 
ing the old ones. Some of the principal manufacturers in the pa- 
rish reside in Linktown, and, according to their success in business, 
it must prosper or decline. About the centre of the town, and at a 
proper distance from the street, stands the mansion-house of John 
Pratt, Esq. of Glentarkie, surrounded with its fine garden and shrub- 
beries, and which is at once a credit and an ornament to the place. 
There are a few very good shops in this part of the parish, and 
more of an inferior description, which supply the inhabitants with 
the necessaries and conveniences of life. Two annual fairs of old 
standing are still held here, one on the third Friday of April, and 
the other on the third Friday of October. The spring fair was 
formerly principally kept up by the sale of lintseed ; and the autumn 
fair, by the sale of black-cattle. Both fairs are now on the decline, 
and the principal commodity at each of them is shoes, which are 
frequently brought from a considerable distance, and sold at very 
low prices. In the Linktown, there is a jail or rather lock-up-house, 
to which the baron bailie has the power of consigning offenders. It 
is in bad repair and little used. 

The flourishing condition of trade and consequent increase of 
inhabitants induced the late Mr Ferguson of Raith, about the year 
1790, to feu property for building on a regular plan a street run- 
ning nearly at right angles with the east end of Linktown, in the di- 
rection of the parish church. This line of building, which has never 
been completed, is known by the name of the New Tawn, and 
contains about 780 inhabitants, of whom, with the exception of a 



FIFESIIIKK. 



few respectable families, almost all are operative weavers. Here are 
situated the spinning-mills of Mr James Aytoun, a gentleman of 
much enterprise and usefulness in the place. At Mr Aytoun's 
mills, not less than 120 individuals are constantly and regularly em- 
ployed. There are, besides the Linktownand New Town, several vil- 
lages in the country district of the parish, of minor note, contiiining 
in all about 197 souls. 

Means of Communication. — To all parts of the parish Kirkaldy is 
the post-town. It may also be said to be the principal market-place, 
where all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life may be had 
of the best description, and on reasonable terms. Throughout the 
whole of the parish, there is an easy communication by good roads, 
which are always kept in good repair. The turnpike roads may be 
about twelve miles in different directions, and the statute labour roads 
about two. There are three bridges in the parish ; one of them 
lately built, find the other two in tolerable condition, besides seve- 
ral small arches of less consequence. In addition to the ordinary 
carriages which frequent the different roads, there are three four- 
horse coaches which run daily through our streets from Edinburgh 
to Dundee, and four coaches of the same description from Dun- 
dee to Edinburgh ; a two-horse coach from the east of Fife to Edin- 
burgh and back again ; and a two-horse coach which runs from 
Glasgow to Kirkaldy, and from Kirkaldy to Glasgow, every lawftd 
day alternately. 

Ecclesiastical State.— It does not distinctly appear where the in- 
habitants of this parish first assembled for public worship ; but it 
was probably in some place connected with the old mansion-house 
of Abbotshall. The date of the last church, which was the only 
one previous to the present, is 1674, twenty-four years after Ab- 
botshall became a separate parish. The present church was built 
in the year 1788, and on the same spot on which the former stood. 
It is a substantial and comfortable edifice, though now too small 
for the increased population. The situation of the church, which 
is on an eminence at the back of the town, is very pretty, though 
not very convenient for the bulk of the inhabitants. It is neverthe- 
less well attended, and the congregation is very respectable. The 
average number of communicants is nearly 700. There are no 
free sittings. The Laird of Raith is patron by a charter granted 
by the Crown so far back as the time of Charles II. The manse 
was built in the year 1772, and is the first that was in the parish. Till 
that time, the clergyman had an allowance of only L. 5 for a house. 



ABBOTSHALL. [Q[ 

An awkward addition of two good rooms was made to the manse, 
at the induction of the last incumbent, now upwards of twenty years 
ago, at an expense fully equal to the half of what it would have 
cost to build a substantial new house. The house has ever since been 
in need of repair of some Idnd or other. An addition was made to the 
offices attached to the manse, in the course of last spring, which ren- 
ders them very comfortable. The stipend annexed to the cure by 
decreet of the Court of Teinds in 1811, is 100 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 
pecks, 3 lippies of barley ; 88 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 pecks, 3 lippies of 
meal ; 36 bolls of oats, and such a further quantity of victual, half 
meal, half barley, as shall be equal to 100 merks Scots money, to- 
gether with L, 100 Scots money for communion elements. The 
stipend awarded by the Court has never been realized, owing to a 
deficiency of teind, and the clergyman has never been paid more 
than a sum equal to 13 chalders, out of which he has to defray the 
expense of communion elements, — a sum totally inadequate to the 
nature of the situation and the great population of the parish. The 
glebe consists, of 61 acres, and is worth about L. 30 Sterhng per 
annum, although it has sometimes been let for more. 

Besides the Established Church, there is one dissenting or Se- 
ceding chapel, now in connection with the United Associate Synod. 
The congregation belonging to it was originally formed for the re- 
ception of Mr Thomas Nairne to be their pastor, who, we have al- 
ready mentioned, was deposed from being minister of Abbotshall 
in 1740, in consequence of espousing the principles of the old 
dissenters, relative to the existing civil government. Mr Nairne 
afterwards withdrew from the communion of the Seceders, and 
joined the Reformed Presbytery. He at length deserted their'com- 
munion, and returned to the fellowship of the Estabhshed Church, 
after making humiliating confessions to the presbytery of Kirkaldy,'

and submitting to their admonitions. In 1831 the old house 
belonging to this congregation was razed to the ground, and a com- 
modious new one built near the same spot. The minister's sa- 
lary is L. 125 per annum, besides a good house and garden. His 
salary is paid from the seat rents, &amp;c. Till lately, there ex- 
isted a remnant of that old sect of Christians, the Cameronians, 
or Mountaineers as they were sometimes termed. The house or 
rather barn in which they assembled is now occupied by a hand- 
ful of individuals, who call themselves Christians ; but what their 
particular tenets are, the writer of this account has not been able 
to learn. They have no stated pastor, and are irregularly supplied 
with sermon by itinerant preachers of various descriptions. There 
are some Baptists and Independents, and also a few Episcopalians 
who have their places of worship at Kirkaldy. A very few indi- 
viduals attend a Relief meeting at Dysart, and it is beUeved there 
are two or three individuals of the Roman Catholic persuasion, na- 
tives of the sister isle. 

The only general parochial society for religious purposes is what 
is designated " The Abbotshall Bible Society," the sole object of 
which is the raising of a fund for the circulation of the Scriptures. 
It is managed by a committee chosen from amongst various classes 
of Christians, who adopt whatever measures they consider best cal- 
culated to promote the object of the society. An annual sermon is 
preached for the benefit of its funds, alternately in the parish church 
and dissenting meeting-house, which, together with the other stated 
contributions, may bring about L. 10 or L. 15 per annum. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor in this parish 
is very considerable. Abbotshall proceeds upon the good old plan 
of supporting the poor, so far as is practicable in so populous a pa- 
rish, and exhibits a proof of the excellency of the system. The 
funds are made up of the collections at the church doors, — rents 
of a few pews in the church belonging to the session, — and a 
small annual contribution made by the heritors. The whole dis- 
bursements to the poor do not, on an average, exceed L. 130 per  
annum. There are at present 12 ordinary poor on the Session roll, 
and 7 extraordinary, — all of whom are supplied weekly according 
to their several necessities. In addition to each of these weekly 
allowances, each of the poor on the session roll receives twice in 
the year, a certain sum to assist in paying house rent, and. provid- 
ing coals. Several others who have not as yet been admitted on the 
roll, receive occasional assistance. Many more are prevented from

becoming burdens on the parish, by the hberaUty of the Raith fa- 
mily, to whom the poor of this parish are under many obhgations. 
The distributions are managed by the kirk-session without any ex- 
pense to the fund, except a small pittance to the session-clerk. The 
minister has always acted as treasurer, without fee or reward. The 
whole disbursements are examined, every year, at a meeting com- 
posed jointly of heritors and minister, — a practice which is satis- 
factory to all parties, and by which any subject which seems to be of 
importance to the interests of the parish can be considered with ad- 
vantage and effect. There are only two or three poor belonging to 
the parish that beg within its bounds. These are supplied with 
badges by a society, which was formed about a year ago, for the 
purpose of preventing vagrant begging, which the inhabitants of this 
parish formerly felt as a great nuisance. Were a society of this na- 
ture formed in every parish, and none allowed to beg but those poor 
belonging to it ; the real objects of charity would be much better 
provided for than they generally are, and much idleness and wor- 
thlessness prevented. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is 6, 
— which may be attended, at an average, by 500 children. . The 
parochial school has generally attending it from 150 to 200, and 
sometimes upwards. The branches therein taught are Latin, 
French, mathematics, arithmetic, navigation, English reading and 
writing. The schoolmaster's salary is- the maximum, and he has 
L. 5 more for teaching a hmited number of poor children. This 
sum is the interest of L. 100 which was bequeathed for the pur- 
pose by a Mrs Dundas, who once resided at Raith. At the other 
schools, the more common branches of education are almost solely 
taught, and the fees for these branches are perhaps a little less than 
at the parish school. At one of the schools, which is entirely a 
charity school, the branches taught are specified by the will of the 
donor. The number of the children 100, as well as their ages 
from six to fifteen,  are also prescribed. Sunday schools have

been for a considerable time established both in the town and 
country part of the parish; institutions that have become the more 
necessary since the introduction of spinning mills, which engage 
children before they have been properly educated, and which con- 
stantly occupy their time throughout the week. The people in ge- 
neral are alive to the benefits of education, and, with a few excep- 
tions, give their children an education according to their respective 
circumstances. It may be remarked, that amongst all classes here, 
as well, indeed, as in the whole of this neighbourhood, classical edu- 
cation is much less an object of attention than formerly. This evi- 
dently arises from the mercantile spirit of the people, which leads 
them too little to value any acquisition, but as it connects itself im- 
mediately with pounds, shillings, and pence. The consequence is, 
that from this community there are comparatively very few young 
men sent to the university, or destined for any of the learned pro- 
fessions. Last winter there was only one young man from this pa- 
rish attending a university, and seldom at any time is there more 
than two or three. 

Literature. — There are no public libraries in this parish, except 
one of an inferior description At Kirkaldy, however, there is a 
good suscription library, a circulating library, and mechanics' libra- 
ry, all of which are open to the inhabitants of Abbotshall on the 
same terms as to the inhabitants of Kirkaldy. To Kirkaldy the 
inhabitants of this parish are likewise indebted for a public reading 
room, which is well supplied with the newspapers of the day, to- 
gether with the army, navy, and commercial lists, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

Inns. — The number of hcensed alehouses in the parish is nearly 
30, a number by far too large, and which certainly ought to be 
reduced. Restraint, too, ought to be put upon them as to the 
hours during which they ought to be kept open. The justices have 
power to do both. "1 he steady exertion of these powers is what is 
wanting. 

ceive a sum between L. 2 and L. 5, or whatever more the fund will afford, the better 
to enable them to begin the world. Of the advantages to be derived by the different 
parishes from this large and benevolent bequest, it is impossible yet to speak with any 
precision. 'J"he schools have been established little more than a year, and all that can 
be said is, that the funds are managed with fidelity and economy, — that zealous and 
efficient teachers have been appointed, and that the children are well taught in those 
branches which they are allowed by the will of the donor to learn. A few years more 
will probably tell whether these institutions have not been the means of introducing 
info the different jjarishes in which they are established a number of poor families, who 
will soon obtain a legal claim to be supported by other funds besides those appro- 
priated for educating and clothing their starving children, " Where the carcase is, 
here will the eagles be gathered together."

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It is obvious to the most cursory observer, that since the last 
Statistical Account was pubHshed, this parish has made great pro- 
gress in agriculture, commerce, and all those various improvements 
connected with them. The consequence is, that wealth is much 
more generally diffused, and all classes enjoy in a greater degree 
than formerly the comforts and conveniences of hfe. What must 
ever be best calculated to promote the happiness of the labouring 
classes is, to improve their morals, and to found their virtue on its 
true basis, religion, not on metaphysical speculation, or the nice 
formed theories of state policy, but on the grand, solid, and substan- 
tial principles of Christianity. This will be found in the end not 
only the best means of promoting the individual happiness of the 
people, but the true secret of good government, — the surest bulwark 
of the state. 

Revised April 1836. 

P. S. — Even since the above was written, it is necessary to state 
that the parish has undergone many important alterations. Trade 
•has increased considerably, and so has the population. The num- 
ber of poor has in consequence increased, and of course the expen- 
diture in behalf of the poor. The congregation which met in the 
place of worship formerly belonging to the Cameronians is now dis- 
persed, and the house converted into a warehouse for flax. A new 
church in connection with the EstabHshment is in the course of 
erection, to supply the surplus population of this and the neigh- 
bouring parish of Kinghorn.

Soil, 4 c.— The greater part of the soil is clay, with a mixture 
of sand : the rest is black earth, commonly on whinstone. The 
ground of Lochgelly, cultivated to the top, is 620 feet above the 
level of the sea, while other parts of the parish to the east and north 
do not exceed 200 feet in height, and even less. The chmate is 
damp and variable. The lake of Lochgelly is three miles in cir- 
cumference. The scenery on the north, presenting banks of wood 
and rich enclosures, is beautiful. On the other sides, the scene is 
bleak, and might be much improved by plantations. The Ore 
rising, in the west, in the parish of Ballingry runs through the 
whole length of this parish, and through the parishes of Kinglas- 
sie, Dysart, and Markinch, till it goes into the river Leven, about 
two or three miles before the united stream enters the Frith of 
Forth at the town of Leven. The Ore has everywhere a flat 
course, and is a muddy stream of no great depth. It has, withm 
this parish two bridges over it, each of one arch. 

IL — Civil History. 
Land-owners.— There are 11 heritors each having a rental 
above L. 50 per annum. There are seven cess feuars, two of whom 
have each a feu rented above L. 50 per annum. 

Parochial Registers.— e have registers of baptisms and mar- 
riages only. They commence at the beginning of last century. 
It is to be hoped that the General Assembly, and the other pubhc 
bodies, will be successful in bringing the defective state of the 
Scottish registers before Parliament. 

III. — Population. 
From the time of Dr Webster's Report, till that of the former 
Statistical Account, the population was almost stationary,— varymg 
only betwixt 1194 and 1200. The population in 1821 was 1488 ; 
in 1831, 1590. 

By my last report, the village of Lochgelly contained 342 ; it 
now contains 612, so that, although our general population has in- 
creased 100, yet the country part of the population has dimmish- 
ed. Lochgelly is our only village. By the census of 1831, the 
males are 786, the females 804. 

Mr Malthus, the political economist, when reading in my former 
report, the hardships represented in the situation of our married 
labourers, wishes to change the following sentence, viz. " That 
people continue to enter voluntarily upon such a hard situation, 
shews how much the union of the sexes and the love of indepen- 
dence are principles of human nature." Upon this Mr Malthus 



AUCHTERDERIIAN.

remarks, " The gentleman should have said, instead of the love of 
independence, the love of progeny." But I feel inclined still to 
adhere to my own version. In that class, the love of progeny does 
not appear to be either intense or even very general, but the de- 
sire of procuring that independence which consists in having their 
own house, their own fireside, their own little domestic society, &amp;c. 
seems to influence them generally, and in a great degree. 

Poaching and snaring are far from being unknown here. A 
little Highland whisky, I believe, is occasionally smuggled, although 
we have far too much of our own production. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — We have no undivided commons, nor any ground 
altogether waste. All is applied to culture, to pasture, planting, 
buildings, yards, mines, quarries, courts, roads, water-courses. 
There is a great deal of wood in the parish ; and if all our planta- 
tions could have been laid out upon one general improved plan, we 
might have had nearly all the wood necessary either for shelter or 
ornament. There remains, however, still unplanted the large den 
of Cardon, a mile long, and of considerable width, and of such 
depth and goodness of soil as would grow all the most valuable 
kinds of timber. We have all the common sorts of wood. Al- 
most all our trees have been planted. Fife in general has very 
little natural wood remaining. The management of woods, though 
censiderably improved of late, is still defective. There is a neglect 
of thinning, felling, pruning, and enclosing. Sir Gilbert Elliot, 
Treasurer to the Navy, and John Sinclair, Esq. of Balgregie, were 
our first planters upon a large scale. The best wooded properties 
are those of Lord Minto, containing 102 Scotch acres; Robert 
Ferguson of Raith, 73 acres, 3 roods, 9 falls; Mrs Sinclair's of 
Balgregie, 50 do. ; Mr Reddie, Redhouse, 30 do. ; and Malcolme 
of Balbedie, the exact number not ascertained. The number of 
Scotch acres in plantation over the parish is about 500. Our 
plantations have suffered by the planters sometimes neglecting to 
suit the species of tree to the quahty of the ground. 

Bent of Land.— The average rent of arable land is, per Scotch acre, 
L. 1, 4s. ; the average rent of grazing a cow or ox L. 3 for the sea™

Rate of Wages, -c— Day labour rose during the late war, from 
Is. to 2s. 6d. and 3s. a-day. It is now Is. 6d. When maintain- 
ed by the employer, a woman is at present hired for L. 6 for the 
year, and a man for L. 12. Artisans get 12s. or 14s, a week.

Husbandry. — The Fife breed of black cattle, which is an excel- 
lent one, is kept up here, but not with the care which it requires, 
in cultivating the true breed, and keeping it separate from bad 
varieties. For droving and feeding for the home market we are 
well provided ; but there is no system observed in breeding for the 
dairy, and our milch cows are inferior. Our draught horses are 
of a good kind, neither too light nor too heavy. We breed no 
sheep. The kind of mixed farming, which is practised here, be- 
twixt the arable and pasture, requires a greater proportion of 
green crops, especially of turnip, than we yet have ; but the space 
allotted to turnips and potatoes is increasing ; and draining, so ge- 
nerally practised, will prove the best means of procuring an addi- 
tional quantity of dry ground for these crops. In under drain- 
ing, we put into the trench a mass of stones, two feet in depth, hav- 
ing a siver. The depth of the trench is commonly three or four 
feet ; but this varies with circumstances. The stones are not brought 
nearer the surface than a foot. In some districts, the stones are 
thrown into the opening without any order, and without a siver. 
This is said to hinder vermin from getting in ; but it requires a 
far greater quantity of stones than the other practice, which we pre- 
fer. Wedge-draining is as yet but little practised. While drain- 
age is universally practised, embanking and irrigation are but little 
used. There has just been finished a small embankment upon the 
Ore ; and at another place, the bed of the river has been straighted. 
Leases are generally for nineteen years. Our farms are in size 
from 50 to 300 Scotch acres. Enclosures are universal over the 
parish ; and where good stone can easily be procured, as here, this 
method of enclosing, though not so pleasing to the eye, is more 
substantial and cheaper, and more quickly got up than hedge- 
rows. From 80. to 90 years ago, Mr Sinclair of Balgregie enclos- 
ed his home farm with substantial trap or Galloway dikes ; and 
this kind of enclosure has been generally followed since, as best 
suited to this district. Our farm-steads have been much improved ; 
and those on the property of Captain Wemyss and Mr Ferguson 
of Raith are the best, and perhaps as good as the farms call for. 

The late Lord Minto introduced over his whole property an im- 
proved state of husbandry, from Roxburghshire, about twenty years 
ago. David Wemyss, Esq. of Pitkenny, when he became posses- 



AUCHTERDERRAN.

sed of his property in this parish, found it in a very rugged and un- 
productive condition, yet capable of right culture, and of produc- 
ing good crops. With other proprietors, he took an active part 
in deepening and straighting a burn, which obstructed the agri- 
culture of a large district, and affected the whole of the north 
side of his property. Here he succeeded completely, by drain- 
ing effectually the parts contiguous to the burn, and also by 
providing sufficient levels for all the other arrangements. The 
chief ingredient of the soil is clay. The surface was a good deal 
encumbered with stones, many of them of an unwieldy size, 
but all obstacles have been surmounted, and by a liberal encou- 
ragement to his tenants, and by a judicious superintendence, the 
farms are well drained, well enclosed, and well cultivated. Up- 
wards of twenty years ago, the late J, Reddie, Esq. of Redhouse, 
planted a large piece of peat moss, of about fifteen Scotch acres 
with Scotch firs. The ground was previously drained and levelled ; 
and although the moss be in several places upwards of seven feet 
deep, of a substance entirely moss, yet the trees have thriven, and 
now the place formerly so gloomy and ugly, presents a pleasant 
prospect of verdure and utility ; and the surrounding grounds, for- 
merly marshy and insalubrious, are become wholesome. 

A good many years ago, Robert Ferguson, Esq. of Raith, took 
under his management a tract of ground, at that time remarkably 
ugly, almost waste, and very unproductive. This he has converted 
into an arable farm, and adorned with thriving plantations. The 
farm itself is well enclosed, well cultivated, and very productive. 
It rents, I understand, at the rate of L. 1, 5s. the acre. The extent 
is 200 acres ; and it is pleasant to learn, that while the country is 
hereby improved, the original improver has already been indemni- 
fied for outlays, and continues to draw very good interest for his 
money. The name of the farm is East Garden, What a benefit 
to a country are resident proprietors

Potatoes, 160 acres Scots, at 40 bolls per acre. 
Turnips, 160 acres. 

Hay, water meadow, 100 acres, at 150 stone per acre. 

Pasture, one-third of the whole parish; the other two-thirds 
with the above deductions, grow wheat, barley, pease and beans, 
and oats. The quantity of oats sown amounts to perhaps more 
than that of all the other grains. 

Quarries.— We have good limestone quarries, and coal is found

in every quarter of the parish. The average output of the Cluny 
coal, belonging to R. Ferguson, Esq. Raith, has been for the last 
four years: Great coal, per year, 70,499 loads, sold at lid. per 
load, — 22 stone Dutch each load, or 24 stone 1 pound English ; 
the whole sold for home consumption. Above and under ground, 
at the colliery, 74 hands at present are employed, including men 
and boys. The quantity just now thrown out at Lord Minto's 
coal work, Lochgelly, is 900 loads per week, 21 stone Dutch, at 
lid. per load; also 400 ditto, chews, 8d. per load ; exported 300 
loads per week. Men employed, 32 colliers ; women, 12, under 
ground; men, 7, above ground. The quantity now brought up 
from Robert Wardlaw Ramsay's coal-work, Dundonald, is 133 
loads per week, at 8d. of 22 stone Dutch ; the men employed 7. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The chief village is Lochgelly. We have now useful metalled 
roads in various directions. The lines have not been well chosen ; 
but we are thankful for the roads as they are. In the present de- 
pressed state of agriculture, nothing but the improvement of roads 
could have kept us up. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is central. It was built 
in 1789 ; the manse in 1784. There are no free sittings. The 
heritors divide the area, according to their valued rent, among 
their dependents. The glebe is 14 Scotch acres in extent, and, 
including the glebe, the living is about L. 300 a-year. The pay- 
ment of the grain of stipends by the county fiars is an excellent 
arrangement. At present, the average number of communicants at 
the Established Church is 300. All our dissenters are Presby- 
terians : and there is a meeting-house at Lochgelly. About one- 
half of the population is dissenting or seceding. 

Education. — There are three schools within the parish, and a 
border school; one is the parish school, the other two village 
schools. The parish schoolmaster has the maximum salary, and 
the required accommodations. The border school, supplied with 
more than one-half of its scholars from this parish, has upwards of 
50 scholars. The other two have about 70 each : and the mas- 
ters have no salaries. The parish school has at present upwards 
of 90 scholars ; the wages 2s., 2s. 6d., and 3s. per quarter. Clas- 
sical learning is little in request, even in the parish school. The 
branches commonly taught are, English, grammatically, the English 
Bible, English collections, writing, accounts, a religious catechism, 



AUCHTERDERRAN. 



171 



geometry, mensuration, geography, navigation, book-keeping, 
church music. Considering their moderate means, the parents are 
remarkably anxious to procure education for their children, and 
none of these grow up without being put to school. Our paro- 
chial schools have been much improved by the augmenting of the 
salaries, — a measure equally wise and benevolent. 

Savinffs Bank. — A savings bank has been kept in this parish ever 
since that kind of institution was introduced into Scotland. It was 
for some years managed by Mr Greig, the dissenting minister of 
Lochgelly, and myself jointly. Upon Mr Greig's death the ma- 
nagement devolved wholly upon my family. The amount of de- 
posits has varied from L. 900 to L. 400. The persons depositing 
are all of the industrious and poorer classes. The sums deposited 
are sometimes as low as L. 1, and never of great amount. They 
are deposited with the Kirkaldy branch of the Bank of Scotland. 
It is to be regretted that this sort of institution has not become more 
prevalent. Perhaps it would become more prevalent, if, instead 
of dividing into single parishes, a number of parishes were group- 
ed together, such as those of a presbytery or a small county. The 
small county of Kinross carries on with success a county savings 
bank, kept at the county town. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Our poor are supplied from our 
collections at the church, and from the interest derived from a sum 
of money about L. 700 in the management of the kirk-session. 
But though our collections have increased, yet, for the last two 
years, the interest of our money has decreased in a greater propor- 
tion. Yet we are averse to frequent assessments ; for although our 
heritors are well inclined to our poor, we think it would not prove 
ultimately for the pubhc benefit to apply often to this resource. Dur- 
ing my long incumbency we have had only three assessments on 
the heritors for the poor, and these were for very moderate sums. 
■Our number of poor upon the monthly list runs from 15 to 
22 families. To each of these families the kirk-session distri- 
butes monthly 3s. at an average. But our greatest disburse- 
ments the session reserves for occasional charities, for sickness, for 
severe accidents, for house rents, for school wages to poor children, 
for defraying the expenses of patients going and coming to or from 
an infirmary, &amp;c. Every individual case is inquired into, and care- 
fully judged of by the session. 

Alehouses. — We have 12 of these in the parish.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
I mentioned in my last report, that a turnpike road, running from 
east to west through this district, had been projected, and even 
at that time had obtained the sanction of Parhament ; but it has 
never been executed. It was to run from the Plasterers' Inn on the 
Leven to Kirk of Beath. It was to give a shorter and better line 
of travelling towards St Andrews, Dundee, Cupar, on the one 
hand, and towards Queensferry, Dunfermline, Edinburgh, Glas- 
gow, on the other. Several roads have since been made here with 
various views, but none directly or properly laying open this great 
thoroughfare. Were the lines now referred to adopted, the other 
roads would fall into country bye roads. It is surprising how slow- 
ly even in this mercantile country improved lines of communica- 
tion are adopted. But this direction of road will, from its obvious 
benefits, still force itself upon the public attention. 

Another turnpike still more universally important, running from 
south to north, and crossing the above at right angles, is projected, 
and engrosses much attention. It is proposed to carry this road 
from Burntisland to the Inn of Farg in Strathearn, there to join 
the great Queensferry and Perth road. From Burntisland the 
line runs on to Auchtertool, from Auchtertool to Auchterderran, 
from Auchterderran to Portmoak, passing the east end of Loch- 
leven near to Scotland Well. From this, the line runs through 
part of Strathmiglo parish, near to Edenhead and to the old castle 
of Balvaird, and then joins the Queensferry and Perth road near 
the Inn of Farg. Whoever casts his eye upon a map will per- 
ceive how much space is cut off by this line, compared to that 
round by Queensferry. The district is also much more level. 

From the day when it was first ascertained that steam-vessels 
could with advantage ply the Frith of Forth, this road might 
have been expected to commence. But it was iimnediately found 
that, to have the benefit of such a road, a low water pier would be. 
necessary at Burntisland, and this became a preliminary obstruc- 
tion which has not yet been surmounted. If we compare the outlay 
that would be necessary for this plan of road to the inn of Farg, with 
outlays made upon other great roads and works, it appears compa- 
ratively trifling. The new road from Glasgow to Carlisle, for in- 
stance, is said to have cost upwards of L. 60,000. This Fife road 
could be executed for less than a third of that sum : yet the city of 
Glasgow alone derives almost all the benefit from that conveyance, 
whereas here all Scotland north of Forth would be essentially be-

nefited by rendering their travelling to Edinburgh and London, 
and all the south-east parts of the island shorter, far more speedy 
and pleasant, — not to speak of the great local advantages that 
would attend it. 

It has not yet been ascertained by experiment whether, from 
our clayey close-bottomed strong soil, spade culture could, with 
a sure prospect of remuneration, be introduced into general practice 
in farming. From the effects produced by this practice on our 
kitchen gardens, we have the fullest conviction, that the crops 
thus raised are far better than those from the plough furrow. 

We sow our grains earlier than formerly, particularly barley, which 
was wont to be sown in May, but now generally in April ; and ex- 
perience confirms the advantage of the change. - There is a full 
crop, and the grain is weightier and better ripened. 

Drunkenness, formerly rare, is now lamentably frequent, — Forty 
years ago, emigration was thought of with much reluctance ; now 
the predilection for the native spot has diminished, and emigration 
is more readily embraced. — Forty years ago, we were accustomed to 
regard increase of population as increase of national prosperity ; now 
such increase seems regarded as an obstruction. — 'Forty years ago 
we had no medical gentlemen in the parish ; at present two are 
resident. — Since the draining of our soil and marshes obtained, the 
heron has nearly disappeared, and since our district became wood- 
ed, pheasants have reached our latitude. — Forty years ago, ser- 
vants for husbandry were few in number, at present they seem re- 
dundant. — Formerly coal-hewers were inferior to other classes in 
morals and respectability, here they are now nearly on a level.— 
Forty, nay twenty, years ago, we had not one metalled road, now we 
have several. — Forty years ago, irregularity, multipUcity and con- 
fusion of weights and measures pervaded all transactions, now we 
have one philosophical and just standard.— Forty years ago, the 
ministers of the Established Church generally delivered all their 
discourses from the pulpit without reading ; now they are general- 
ly read — Forty years ago, land was sold in Fife at thirty-five years' 
purchase of the existing rental, now it sells at twenty-six years' pur- 
chase of the present rental. 

The valued rent of this parish is upwards of L. 7000 Scotch. 
The present real rent is about L. 7000 Sterling.— Forty years ago, 
rents were all paid here in money ; now they begin to be paid in 
gram, at the rate of the county fiars. — Forty years ago, resurrec- 
tionists, as they are called, were unheard of; now, even the poor

labourer is under the hardship of providing safes for the graves of his 
friends. — Forty years ago, thrashing machines were unknown to us; 
now, they are become general and so beneficial that it is difficult to 
believe how farming could be carried successfully on without them. 
— Forty years ago, the different ranks in society were distinguished 
from each other by their dress ; at present there is little distinction 
in dress. — Forty-nine years ago, I was the youngest minister of the 
presbytery, now I am the oldest.

THE REV. JAMES FERGUSSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of the parish was anciently spelt Baith and 
signifies, in Gaelic, birchwood, — of which there is not a vestige now 
to justify the etymology. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is about 4 miles long, and 
3 broad, and is of an irregular figure. It is bounded on the west 
by the parish of Dunfermline ; on the south by Dunfermhne and 
Aberdour ; on the south-east and east by Aberdour and Auchter- 
tool ; on the north-east by Auchterderran ; on the north and north- 
west by Ballingry and Cleish. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its surface is rugged and hilly; 
but there are no mountains. The beautiful hill of Beath, in re- 
gard to the excellence of its pasture, and the fine and extensive 
view it affords, is well entitled to the description given of it in the 
last Statistical Account. The Saxifraga granulata is found on it 
in abundance. 

Owing to the elevation of the parish, and to the quantity of wet 
land in and around it, the climate, during the greater part of the 
year, is cold and humid. The only lake in the parish is Loch 
Fitty not Tilly, as, by mistake, in the last account. It is about 
three miles in circumference, rather shallow, adorned with little 
scenery, and contains pike, perch, and muscle.

At present there are three coUieries in operation in the parish. 
The rocks in the hills and plains are, so far as known, of whin and 
free or sandstones. Some years ago, a lime rock was discovered 
in the west end of the parish, and partially wrought. The soils, all 
untransported, are brown earth upon whinstone, till, and moss. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oxcners. — There are thirteen land-owners connected with 
the parish, all of whom, except one, possess . property in it above 
L. 50 a-year. The principal proprietors are, the Earl of Moray, 
patron; Mr Dewar; and the Lord Chief- Commissioner Adam. 
Several others have lands of considerable extent and value. Only 
five of the heritors are at present resident. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers, consisting of mi- 
nutes of session, records of marriages, births and burials, have been 
pretty regularly kept. The earhest entries were in 1642, and were 
prefaced with a very curious and interesting account of the causes 
which led to the rebuilding of the church, — which it is thought 
proper here to subjoin.  

 " A short andjine Naration concerning the EirkofBaith, 1040 The kirk of Baith, 

a most fitt and convenient place for the situatioiie of a kirk, being upone the roade way, 
and in the just midis betwixt Kinross and Innerkethine. Sua it is to rememberit 
that tho' it be amongst the smallest, yit the name of it is amongst the antientest par- 
roches in Scotland. Wherefore, a most reverend and worthie brother, Mr William 
Scott, sometime minister at Couper, reported that the first place of meeting that ever 
the Protestant Lords of Scotland had for the covenante and Reformatione at the 
kirk of Baith. This kirk in some sorte myght be compared to Gideon's fleece, which 
was dry, when all the earth was watered. 

" When all the congregationes of Fyfe were planted, this poore kirk was neglected 
and overlooked, and lay desolate then fourteen e yeeres, after the Reformatione eixhty

Which was the caus that Sathane had a most faire name amongst them, stirring

and wounding one another, which wes the exercise of the younger sort, and the older 
sort played at gems and the workes of their calling without any distinction of the 
weeke daye from the daye of the Lord, and thus they continued, as said is, the space

III. — Population. 
In 1821, the amount of population was 729. By the census of 
1831, very accurately taken, it was 921, — males, 459 ; females, 
462. Of this amount there were 23 above 70 years of age. About 
400 of the population live in the villages of Kelty and Oakfield. 

of Mr Alexander Collville of Blair, having no relatione to doe for this poore people, 
but being only their neere neighboure, and beholding from his own windowe thair 
pyping and dancing, revelling and deboshing, their drinking and excesse, thair ryote 
everie Sabbath day, was moved by the Lord, and mightilie stirred up to undertake 
something for that poore people, and having assembled some of the speciall men ot the 
parroch, at the village of Sheills, sounded thair mindes, if they might be bold to ad- 
venture to assist and help him with horses for drawing of timber and stones, he and 
they both fearing the oppositione and discountenance of the lord and patrone of the 
paroch, the parrochiners present did give this comfortable answer, that they woud 
both doe and adventure to kntribute thair best endeavores with men and horses, for 
building of their kirk, but becaus of their povertie, they were not able to kntribute 
anie of their owne private monnie, but amongst others that were present, none was 
found more foreward with his horse and assistance than Mr Johne Hodge, tennent 
in Leuchat's Baith, of whorae I made electioue to oversee the worke and the work- 
men, and did presentLie advance him some monnie for that effect. 

" Jt pleised the Lord, so he blessed our endeavores that the worke prospered in our 
hand, and was brought to great perfectione in a short tyrae, even to the admiratione of 
the people and passengers, who marvelled to see the worke goe on so sudanlie, neither 
knowing the way nor the instruments. And becaus it wes impossible, when the walls 
were up to get the kirk slaitted in such haist, the slaittes being at Tippermoore, which 
was at sixteene miles distance; thairfor it wes thought expedient for the present yeere, 
that it should be sarked with dealles, which being done with very great diligence, 1 
thought good to send for ane old reverend brother, Mr John Row Law, minister at 
Carnocke, who after some refuisalls, without the consentof the minister of Aberdour, 
becaus into his kirk, the parroches of Dalgetie and Baith were annexed, he coud 
not undertake to preach, yet after muche intreattie he was moved to come to such ane 
effamished congregatione, in such a retyred place. The people understanding that 
sermone was to be at the kirk of Baith so unexpectedlie, and so suddenlie budded ; 
did resort from all places, and much out of everie sitie, being new fangled with such 
a suddan change, thronged in so to kirk, that thair wes scarce anie place left to raise 
up some height for a place to the pastoure. And while the pastoure was m a most 
moveing and elegant straine for the kindness and mercie of God to that people that 
hadd lived so long in darkness, it pleised the Lord out of his free and immense love 
to bring such a suddain rushe of joye upone my hart, that I had almost fainted, but 
in end remembering myseiffe, I was comforted to think that the Lord had shewed a 
pledge of his goodnesse towards me, and accepted of my weakeand unworthie obedi- 
ence, to make me instrumentall for the worke of his majestic. 1 shall not insist to 
speike anie thing at all of my actings and doings, or sufferings, to be instrumentall in 
the worke of the Lord, but one thing I must declaire, that Sathanehath beene, is, and 
will be bussie against all those that will be instrumental for the service of God. so be- 
came he my enemy in stirring up some to scourge me with the tongue,'and put grie- 
vous aspersions upone my name and reputatione ; in stirring up some to slander mee, 
as iff I had interverted something that was given by some few friendes for that proud 
use. But I declaire in the presence of God, to all after ages, that such reports are 
but false calumnies and lyes ; thair wes never suche a thing as one penny mterverted 
or withheld by me from the work of the Lord. And becaus my conscience bearcs 
mee witnesse of the honestie of my carriage therein, it is also borne m upon "ice to 
pronunce fi om God, that he who devysed to scourge me with the tongue shall be 
punished without repentance. And more, to shew my integrity, where ane promise 
that ever I had in the worke of the Lord, was from a most religious Chnstiane, « U- 
liam Breggs of Athernie, and becaus I did alwayes rest confident of the certaintie ot 
the helpe of such a religious man ; I suspendit it last of all, and would not goe to yi- 
site this worthie man without the presence of ane elder, whom I chose to be John 
Hodee, who accompanied mee to Athernie, and when wee came to Bennochie, it was 
reported to us, that he was depairted this life, which wes so ; and '' '-L'',/' "-

The number of families is 180, containing each, of individuals, on 
an average, somewhat more than 5 ; a fact, perhaps, rather uncom- 
mon ; and to be accounted for by early marriages, chiefly among the 
colliers, who earn higher wages than any other class of labourers. 
There are 4 houses at present in progress of building ; all the rest, 
amounting to 161, are inhabited. The increase of population is 
owing to the additional number of hands employed at the collieries, 
and to a system of feuing lately introduced. 

The annual average of births for the last seven years, appearing from 
the parish records, was 15; of marriages, 5; and of deaths, 13. 
But, as the deaths of alJ who are interred in the churchyard are 
recorded, although some of them are fi'om other parishes, and as 
some parents neglect to have the births of their children register- 
ed, the exact number of births and deaths cannot be ascertained. 

In general the people enjoy the advantag-es and comforts suited 
to their stations in life. In dress and the decoration of, their per- 
sons, they keep pace with the times. They are, upon the whole, 
moral and religious. There have been, as there still are, several 
instances of longevity among them. 

During the last three years there have been 4 illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — In this parish, there is not much land that is not 
capable of being rendered arable ; and by far the greater part has 
been at one period under the plough. Of late years a good deal 
has been done in the way of reclaiming waste land, and improv- 
ing such as had been neglected by bad husbandry ; and the result ' 
has been a fair remuneration.

lient of Land. — The average price of land may be stated at 
about L. 1 per Scotch acre. The value of different parts of the 
same farm differs very widely. Several farms have been for many 
years under pasture for black cattle, and pay fully as well as in til- 
lage. The state of farming is, upon the whole, rapidly improving, 
owing partly to the encouragement afforded by the landlords, and 
partly to a more judicious mode of husbandry, and greater industry 
on the part of the tenants. Paring and burning, draining, liming, 
and earlier sowing, are the more striking and beneficial improve- 
ments. 

The farm-buildings are, in several instances, pretty good, and 
suited to the value of the farms and to the district. Those on 
the property of the Earl of Moray have been lately erected. That 
nobleman has also improved the appearance and value of his lands 
by judicious plantations. And it were much to be wished, that 
some of the other proprietors, whose lands afford abundant capa- 
bility, would, in this respect, follow his Lordship's example, and that 
of the Lord Chief- Commissioner, by which means their own ad- 
vantage would be promoted, and the parish be no longer prover- 
bial for bleakness. The duration of leases is, in most cases, for 
nineteen years, which is considered to be favourable to the occu- 
pier. The productions of the parish are, oats, barley, wheat par- 
tially, peas, beans, potatoes, turnips, a little flax, and cultivated 
and meadow hay. A day-labourer earns from Is. 6d. to 2s. a-day. 
Male farm-servants are hired at from L. 10 to L. 12 per annum ; 
and female servants receive from L. 5 to L. 6 per annum. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — There are no market-towns in this pa- 
rish. The nearest are Dunfermline and Kinross, each distant about 

» From the results of experiments made, for several years past, by the writer of 
iccount, he has reason to believe that carrots sown in our kitchen gardens, about 
. n middle of May, are much less liable to the depredations of the worm, than those 
soln lt an earlier periocL It will be an additional advantage to sow them m the 
beds in which leeks were reared the precedmg year.

six miles from the centre of the parish. Blair- Adam Inn, in the 
parish of Cleish, is the post-office, nearly three miles from the manse. 
The great north road from Queensferry to Perth, one of the best 
in the kingdom, passes through the parish, a length of four miles. 
There are three public daily coaches, including the mail, travelling 
on it. The bridges are in good repair, and the parish is all. en- 
closed and subdivided, chiefly with good stone fences, called Gallo- 
way dikes. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is the only place of pub- 
lic worship. Its situation is convenient for the population, but not 
so its size, affording accommodation to only 250 sitters. It is an 
old, cold, damp, fabric. In 1808, it underwent a repair, and stands 
greatly in need of another. If the heritors consulted their own in- 
terest, and the accommodation and comfort of the people, they 
would cause its foundation to be dug up. 

In good weather the church is remarkably well attended. The 
average number of communicants is above 200, and the number is 
annually increasing. Of the population nearly 200, old and young, 
are Burgher Seceders, the only description of Dissenters in the pa- 
rish. Their number has greatly diminished within the last twenty 
years. 

The manse was buih in 1801, and a small addition was made to 
it four years ago. The glebe consists of 8 acres, and may be 
worth from L. 16 to L. 20 yearly. The teinds are exhausted, and 
the stipend is the minimum. 

Education.— The parochial school is the only one in the parish. 
Its situation is central. The usual branches of education are 
taught in it. For the last fourteen years, owing greatly to the su- 
perior merits of the teachers, Mr William Beatton, lately called to 
the parish of Kennoway, and his brother, who has succeeded him, 
It has been attended by an average of 100 scholars. The fees are, 
per quarter, for English reading, 2s. 6d. ; reading and writing, 3s. ;' 
do. do. and arithmetic, 4s. ; Latin and Greek, 5s. The school- 
master's house and school-room were lately erected, and are good 
and commodious. The salary is the maximum: the fees may 
amount to L. 30 per annum. There are very few persons in the 
parish above six years of age who cannot read. In gener'al the 
people are alive to the benefits of education. There are, however, 
some exceptions, chiefly among the colliers.

Some years ago, Francis Berry, a native of the parish, and who 
spent the greater part of his life in it, in the capacity of a small far- 
mer, in consequence of the death of his only child, a student in 
divinity, bequeathed a feu in land and houses, the fruit of honest 
industry, for educating poor children, natives of the parish. The 
property is subject to the liferent of his widow, an elderly woman. 
It is let in lease for L. 28, 10s. per annum. The kirk-session are 
appointed sole trustees. 

Poor. — The maintenance of the poor has long been alight burden. 
At present there are only 5 on the roll, three of whom receive each 
Is. a-week, and the other two, in more indigent circumstances, 
Is. 9d. each. Their wants are supplied out of the ordinary collec- 
tions, which amount to about L. 1 1 annually ; the interest of L. 100 
due by promissory-note to the session, and the dues upon marriages 
and burials.' The poor evince no unnecessary disposition to soli- 
cit parochial aid. 

Ififis, — There are one inn and four public-houses in the parish, 
and their effects are notoriously injurious to the morals of the 
people. 

irye/._The fuel used is coal, of which there is great abundance 
at a reasonable price. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The more striking variations between the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, consist in an improved mode of farming, better farm-build- 
ings, plantations, collieries, roads, population, school, and number 
of resident heritors, which is smaller. The standard weights and 
measures are in use. 

There is still much room for improvement in the way of drain- 
ing, reclaiming waste land, and planting. What might be profit- 
ably done in this last respect, is sufficiently evinced in the exten- 
sive and thriving plantations on the estate of the Lord Chief- Com- 
missioner, a gentleman to whose taste, liberality, and public spirit, 
this district, generally, is highly indebted.

PRESBYTEKY OF DCNFERMLINE, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER WATT, A.M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, Boundaries. — This parish is situated on the northern coast 
of the Frith of Forth. Its southern boundary stretches about 4 
miles along the wooded broken line of beach, that lies betwixt the 
village of Aberdour and the borough of Inverkeithing. It is near- 
ly of a triangular form, extending in length about 4 miles from 
south to north, and not exceeding in many places a mile in breadth. 
It is bounded by Inverkeithing on the west ; by Aberdour on the 
east and north ; and by a small part of the parish of Dunfermline 
on the north-west. 

Topographical Appearances. — There is a gradual ascent from 
the southern to the northern extremity, which stands about 436 feet 
above the level of the sea. From some of the higher ground on 
the estates of Fordel and Cockairney, the views are very extensive. 
They command at one sweep the whole range of the opposite coast 
from Queensferry as far as the Isle of May. 

It may be said that we have two distinct climates in this small 
parish. In the lower division on the sea coast, which is well wood- 
ed, and m a state of good cultivation, the thermometer generally 
stands some degrees higher than in the upper district, which con- 
tains an extensive coal -field, and the soil of which is of a much in- 
ferior quality. In spring, the whole parish, like most of those along 
the sea-coast, is much exposed to the chilling influence of the pre- 
vailing east winds. The inhabitants, however, are generally very 
healthy, and there is no disease pecuhar to them except some cases 
of asthma and rheumatism amongst the colUers, which are occa- 
sioned by the nature of their occupation. 

Hydrography.— There are no rivers in this parish. There is a 
lake, however, of considerable extent. It is about three-quarters 
of a mile in length, and a quarter of a mile in breadth. At the 
east end of it, stands the old mansion-house of Cockairney, the re- 



182 



FIFESIIIUF.. 



sidcnce of Sir Robert Mowbray, Knight, one of the heritors of the 
larish. On the nortliern bank, is situated the old mansion-house 
of Otterston, whence the lake derives its name, which is at present 
occupied by Lady Torrens, widow of the late Sir Henry Torrens. 
The lake and all the lands of Otterston form part of the estate 
of Sir Robert Mowbray of Cockairney. The blending of hill and 
dale, of wood and water, in this spot, renders it a scene of no com- 
mon beauty. 

There is a picturesquely situated waterfall on the adjoining 
grounds of Fordel. The stream which forms it winds its course 
for a considerable way through a darkly wooded glen, where it 
meets with the outlet of water from the great drainage level of the 
Fordel colliery, and then rushes over a broken rocky precipice 
of about fifty feet in height. Near the termination of this glen 
there is a mineral well, a minute analysis of which is to be found 
in Professor Jameson's Philosophical Journal for the year 1829. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The minerals known in this parish 
belong to the secondary series of rocks ; and, so far as they have 
yet been discovered, may be said to abound in sandstone, bitumi- 
nous shale, quartz, rock-limestone, and coal. The general dip of 
the strata is north-east, varying, in some places, from the disloca- 
tions of the minerals by dikes, which, according to their magni- 
tude, more or less derange and alter it. Sandstone abounds all 
over the parish ; but it is of more value in the southern than in 
the northern division. About the centre of the parish there is 
a thick bed of exceedingly hard quartz rock. It does not ap- 
pear at the surface, except in two or three places, being generally 
concealed by a thick covering of earth. Limestone, which con- 
stitutes the basis of the coal formation, extends regularly through- 
out the parish, under the coal. It is found about 50 fathoms 
underneath the lower bed of coal, and from the basin shape 
of the minerals, the lime seldom or ever makes its appearance at 
the surface ; but it is to be found in considerable quantities, both 
to the east and west, in the adjoining parishes of Aberdour and In- 
verkeithing. 

Fordel coal-icorks. — Coal, the mineral of the greatest importance, 
abounds in considerable quantities in this parish. The extensive 
coal-works on the estate of Fordel, the property of Admiral Sir P. C. 
H. Durham, G. C. B, form the principal feature of this parish, and 
the great source of its trade and revenue. The coal on the lands 
of Fordel has been wrought for nearly 240 years. Tliis has been 
a valuable property ; but its value is now much diminished, in con-

sequence of the great extent of coal which has been wrought out 
of it. As Sir PhiHp Durham, however, has in lease the adjoining 
coal-fields on the estate of Cuttlehill, it is certain that coal will 
'be conveyed through the parish for upwards of 150 years to come. 
And even when it is exhausted, the extensive minerals to the north, 
in the neighbouring parish, will, in all probability, be brought 
through this parish to the shipping port of St David's. From a 
recent inspection of the strata throughout this parish, and, parti- 
cularly, from a minute examination of that part of it connected with 
the mining operations, it is found that the coal-field is much in- 
tersected with dikes and dislocations, which very much elevate and 
depress the strata forming this extensive coal country. 

From the harbour of St David's, the southern boundary of the 
parish, as far north as the drainage level of the Fordel colliery ope- 
rations, — a distance of about two miles, — the strata appear some- 
what regular, dipping to the north-east. They cannot, however, 
be correctly ascertained in many places, as they have a conside- 
rable cover of earth upon them. From the latter point, northwards, 
they can be most accurately traced. 

The outlet of water from the drainage level of the Fordel col- 
liery is 120 feet above the level of the sea, and it is continued north- 
wards nearly three miles through the solid rock. During its course 
ten dikes are met with of various magnitudes ; in some places they 
do not alter the strata many feet ; in others, f hey are found 100 feet 
thick, and elevating the strata sixty fathoms. Their direction often 
varies as well as their angle of inclination from nearly a horizontal 
to a vertical position. The materials of which these dikes are com- 
posed are generally sandstone, more or less indurated with quartz 
and limestone. 

From the point at which coal is first found, the surface rises 
gently northwards, till it reaches the height of 436 feet above the 
level of the sea ; this forms the northern boundary, and the highest 
part of the parish. It is found as we proceed northwards, that the 
strata assumes a greater dip in some places, varying from 1 in 8 
to 1 in 3. In very few instances, however, do these dikes deterio- 
rate the coal in quality, but the reverse ; for as the miner ap- 
proaches these dikes, the coal becomes harder, and more difficult 
to work, and in many cases an extra expense is paid for labour. 
The coal mines in this parish were not wrought to any considerable 
extent until within the last thirty years, when the consumption of 
coal has been very much increased, particularly for steam naviga- 



184

tion. And as this coal-field produces the finest coal for that pur- 
pose, the working of it has been much more extensively carried on. 
The depth of the mining operations at the northern boundary of 
the parish is 300 feet from the surface, and that of the main drain- 
age level is only about 250 feet; consequently machinery is required 
to raise the water from the mines, a distance of about 50 feet, in- 
stead of which, had the level been carried duly horizontal, the 
whole of the coal now drained by machinery would have been level 
free. And thus had due regard been paid at first to the drainage 
level, the expensive machinery now erected on the works would, 
in a great measure, have been unnecessary. 

The coal-field of this parish extends two miles north and south, 
and one mile east and west, and forms the basin or trough of the 
coal-fields in the neighbourhood. For, upon drawing a line in a 
north-eastern direction from the point at which coal is first found 
to the extremity of the parish, it appears that the coal and its ac- 
companying strata uniformly rise to the east as well as to the west 
of that line. To the east it rises rapidly, and throws out the crop 
of the upper coals before it goes out of the parish ; the under ones 
are found on the verge of the Aberdour parish. At every dike or 
dislocation of the strata northwards, the coals are thrown further 
east, until the same coals in quality, though not the same in num- 
ber, or in thickness, are found to extend into Lochgelly parish, 
and so on eastwards, throughout the whole of that coal country. 

To the westward of this line, the same takes place, but not so 
rapidly, and this forms the most interesting and valuable coal-field 
in the western district of Fife. The same dikes and coals can be 
traced with great regularity from the east of this, to the west of the 
parish of Dunfermline, with little or no variation in the line of bear- 
ing, although they are more or less depressed by the intersection 
of diagonal dikes changing the direction of the strata. 

In order more fully to shew the metals passed through in the 
progress of sinking for coal, we shall here annex a correct section 
of the strata as taken from actual measurement.

There are thus only four workable seams of coal, named the 
Blawlowan, Coalthief, Mynheer, and Splint. — The Blawlowan is 
a soft cubical coal, it is generally used in lime-works, burns slow- 
ly, and produces white ashes. — The Mynheer is an excellent splint 
coal, burns with little ashes, is used for steam-machinery, but it is 
best adapted for household purposes. — The Coalthief is a strong 
cubical coal, free of all iron pyrites, burns clean, works large, and is 
principally used by distillers and manufacturers. — The Main S|lint 
is a very superior coal to the other three. It burns free of ashes, 
leaves a small cinder, is very bituminous, works large, and has an 
exceedingly strong flame when burning, and from its durability and 
superior quality, is considered the best in Scotland for steam navi- 
gation and household purposes, for which immense shipments are 
made all over the continent. 

Having given a short account of the coal-field of this parish, and 
its connection with those of the adjoining parishes, we shall shortly 
state the quantity of coal still remaining to be wrought. This, we 
are sorry to say, is reduced to a comparatively small extent, as may 
be easily conceived from the length of time during which it has 
been wrought. There is, it is generally believed, coal to work on 
the Fordel estate for thirty years at a moderate rate, as there still 
remains one or two coal-fields untouched, but the mining appara- 
tus not being directed in that quarter, it may be some time before 
they are explored. I am also inclined to think that there are se- 
veral great coal seams throughout the parish, particularly in the 
southern division, and which may soon be examined, especiidly those 
lying in the direction of the strath, in front of Fordel House, where 
evident proofs of a coal formation have been traced. It may bg 
sufficient at present to mention, that in the parishes of Aberdoui-, 
Dalgety, Inverkeithing, and Dunfermline, there are coal-fields

which will last many centuries at the present extent of sales, which 
may be estimated at nearly 230,000 tons. 

The average annual sales from Fordel colliery may be estimated 
at nearly 70,000 tons. The mode by which the coals are conveyed 
to the shipping harbour is by a wooden railway laid with beech and 
fir, having wood-sleepers every two feet apart. The road is laid 
double, having one fir rail below, and a beech rail above. Wag- 
gons containing three tons are drawn by one and sometimes by two 
horses, to the shipping port of St David's, and emptied into the 
vessels by machines erected for that purpose. This waggon way 
is upheld at a very great expense ; but extensive operations have 
been going on for some time, preparing a new line of road for aiT 
iron railway, which, when finished, will be an immense saving annu- 
ally, independently of the greater facility and expedition with which 
shipments may then be made. The superior quality of the Fordel 
coal is now known over the whole of Europe, and being particular- 
larly adapted for steam navigation, it has gained an ascendency over 
most of the Scotch and Enghsh coal for that purpose. Besides 
being so well adapted for all household uses, it is also much in 
request by bakers, brewers, manufacturers ; and large exports are 
made to the continent and to America, which is in a great measure 
to be attributed to the exertions of the spirited proprietor of the 
works, Admiral Sir Philip Durham, G. C. B. who has used every 
means, and has spared no expense, in proving the superior quahties 
of the Fordel coal, especially for the purpose of raising steam. 

In the present state of the coal trade in the river Forth, there is 
little encouragement to make any extensive improvements. It has 
undergone a complete change within the last twenty-five years. And 
this has been particularly the case since 1820, when a more exten- 
sive sale of English coal was introduced into the Scotch market. 
In 1824, the prices revived a little, which gave a new stimulus to 
the coal proprietors, but at present they are again much reduced. 

The following are the prices at which coals are put on board ves- 
sels at the harbour of St David's from the Fordel colliery : Best 
splint great coal, 9s. per ton ; chew coal, 6s. 6d. ; mixed house- 
hold coal, 6s. 6d. ; small coal, 3s. lOd. And even at these very re- 
duced prices it is difficult to effect the ordinary sales ; and in many 
cases coals are sold at the cost price. 

Salt-ioorks. — In connection with the colliery and railway for the 
exportation of coal at St David's, there are very extensive salt-works 
upon the best principles. There is a steam-engine for drawing the 



DALGETY. 187 

salt water at flood tides into a large reservoir, which contains as 
much water as is necessary for a week's consumption. This com- 
pletely secures the deposition of all mud and sand, so that the water 
becomes quite pure before it is used for making salt. There are 
large salt pans, which make annually about 30,000 bushels, the 
sales of which amount to about L. 1600. 

Harbours. — The harbour at St David's seems originally to have 
been very indifferently constructed, as appears from the remains of 
the old pier. Within these four years, the proprietor. Sir Philip 
Durham, has made great improvements, at an expense of nearly 
L. 2000, so that vessels of 450 to 500 tons burden can come in and 
load with safety, and command from seventeen to eighteen feet of 
water. These extensive additions were much wanted, without which 
it would have been impossible to have effected the present exten- 
sive sales. All that is now wanting is the finishing of the new railway to 
make Fordel colliery, with the harbour of St David's, one of the most 
complete coal- works in Scotland. The annual circulation of money 
at the Fordel and Cuttlehill collieries, and at the salt-works at St 
David's may be estimated at nearly L. 22,000. The number of 
men, women, and children who derive their support from the above 
works exceeds 800, or nearly two-thirds of the whole parish. When 
we consider the various advantages of which such works are pro- 
ductive to the parish, and to the neighbourhood, they reflect the 
highest honour on their benevolent proprietor, who for many years 
has received little emolument from them. The number of houses 
occupied by the families of work-people belonging to the coUiery 
is about 130. The number of men employed is 100; unmar- 
ried men and boys, 186; women and girls, 120; making a total 
of 536, actually employed. This number is independent of those 
who are engaged in the shipping of coals, in the salt-works, and 
in driving waggons, which require upwards of 50 horses. 

These people are paid every fourteen days. Their wages are 
very good ; a collier, when the work is going on well, can earn about 
3s. per day. They have likewise very comfortable houses and 
gardens, which are kept up at the expense of the proprietor. The 
only fossil remains found in the strata are some simple petrifac- 
tions of a species of fern now extinct. There are also some bi- 
valves, and other shells amongst the argillaceous schistus. In the 
upper part of the parish, there are frequently found trunks of trees, 
next to the strata beneath the moss, petrified into a soft sandstone ;

the outer part of them is generally very perfect, and is covered 
with coaly matter. 

The soil in this parish is very various. In the southern parts it 
consists generally of a deep strong loam, mixed with clay. The 
sloping banks lying to the south are of a lighter and drier nature. 
Where the coal formation commences the soil is generally wet and 
stiff and there are also a few mossy swamps covered with heath. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-otoners. — The whole lands in the parish belong to three 
proprietors, who are generally resident, viz. the Right Honour- 
able the Earl of Moray, who resides at Donibristle ; Admiral 
Sir P. C. H. Durham, G. C. B. at Fordel House ; and Sir Ro- 
bert Mowbray, Knight, at Cockairney. There has lately been 
built on the grounds of the Earl of Moray, a dwelling-house, which 
is at present occupied by P. Anislie, Esq. who acts as his Lord- 
ship's Commissioner. It has been named St Colme House, be- 
ing situated nearly opposite the island of that name in the Frith 
of Forth. 

HI, — Population. 

In 1755, the population of the parish was stated to be 761. 
Since that period it has been nearly doubled. The principal 
cause of its increase is to be attributed to the extension of the 
Fordel coal-works, and to several small feus, which have been 
granted by the proprietor on his lands in the neighbourhood of the 
colHery. ' The population in the southern division of the parish 
has greatly diminished of late. The old village of Dalgety, along 
with the parish school, and some other houses which were situated 
near the old church, have all been removed, as the properties in 
that neighbourhood have gradually come into the possession of the 
Earl of Moray, and have been thrown into his Lordship's exten- 
sive enclosures. 

The number of individuals residing in villages is as follows :

Character, 8fc. of the People. — The people in general are very 
sober and industrious. Those of them who are not employed in the 
coal-works consist principally of labourers and farm-servants. The 
colliers who compose such a large proportion of the parishioners 
are, with a few exceptions, the most sober and civilized of that class 
of the community any where to be found. They are quite a dis- 
tinct class from the agricultural population. Their prejudices, their 
domestic habits, and even their style of dress are altogether pecu- 
liar. So completely have they kept themselves apart, and so much 
have intermarriages prevailed, that for centuries back the same 
family names have generally obtained amongst them. The ame- 
liorated condition of the Fordel colliers, when compared with that 
of manyothers, is principally to be traced to the effects of educa- 
tion. Before the parish school was removed to their immediate 
neighbourhood, where it has been for upwards of thirty years, it was 
their uniform practice to maintain by subscription a teacher amongst 
themselves. This fact may be of some importance to those pro- 
prietors, many of whose colliers are so far behind the other classes 
of the community, both as regards general education and moral 
improvement. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— kgnc\i\\me is generally in a very improved state 
m this parish. Its situation affords the farmer many advantages. 
There is abundance of lime in the neighbourhood. Fuel is very 
moderate in price, and manure to any extent can be obtained from 
Leith by water carriage. As the soil, especially toward the northern 
parts of the parish, is naturally wet, draining has been much resort- 
ed to, and with the most beneficial effects. Such a complete change 
have some of the lands on the estate of Fordel undergone that a 
farm, which twenty years ago brought only a. rental of L. 1.5, now 



190 



FIFESHIUK. 



lets for L. 240. This estate lias also been mucli improved and 
sheltered by extensive thriving plantations. There are about 40 
acres of moss and swampy ground in the northern division of the 
parish, a part of which is grazed during the summer months. 

The number of acres in the parish which are either cultivated 
or occasionally in tillage is about 1005. There are about 240 
acres of wood. The average rent of land is from L. 2 to L. 3 per 
acre, and in the northern division from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2, 

Produce. — The average value of raw produce raised in the 



parish is the following :

V. — Pakochial Economy. 
Market-Towns. — The nearest market-town is Inverkeithing. 
There are no villages in the parish except the small shipping port 
of St David's. 

Ecclesiastical State. — A very handsome parish church was erect- 
ed in the year 1830. The style of the building is Gothic. It is 
seated to accommodate 500 individuals. It does great honour to 
the liberality and taste of the heritors, being one of the most hand- 
some small country churches in Scotland ; and furnishes a proof 
of the great improvement which has lately taken place in the style 
of ecclesiastical architecture. It is more conveniently situated for 
some of the parishioners than the old church, which stood close 
to the sea side, while the most populous part of the parish is about 
four miles distant. The site of the new church is about a mile to 
the north of the former one, close to the public road, which lies be- 
twixt Aberdour and Inverkeithing. It is still, however, about three 
miles from the great body of the parishioners. 

There are a number of individuals really attached to the Esta- 
blishment, who are thus unwillingly necessitated to become dissen- 
ters, on account of the inconvenient distance at which they are 
placed from the parish church. 

The old church is a very ancient building. It was for many ye 
in a great state of disrepair, and was never well adapted, from its 
uncentrical situation, to be a place of worship for the parish. It 
stands about two miles from Donibristle House, close to the se 



DALGETY.

shore. It was formerly a Cliapel of Ease to the monastery on the 
Island of Inch Colme, when the seat of the Earl of Moray be- 
longed to the abbots of that monastery. On one of the small gal- 
leries is rudely emblazoned the heraldric arms of the Earl of Dun- 
fermline, a family now extinct. Chancellor Seaton, who was creat- 
ed Earl of Dunfermline in 1605, hes interred in a part of the area 
of the church, along with some other individuals of distinction. 

A substantial and well-finished new manse and offices have also 
been built within the last five years. They are situated on the glebe, 
and are a few minutes walk from the new church. The glebe is 
12 acres in extent, and lets for about L. 1, 12s. per acre. The 
teinds of the parish are exhausted ; their amount is about 15 chal- 
ders. 

There are no dissenting chapels in the parish, and those of the 
parishioners who do not belong to the parish church, attend a 
Burgher meeting-house either at Inverkeithing or at Crossgates. 
The latter place is very conveniently situated for the coUiers, being 
only about a mile distant from most of them. The number of in- 
dividuals attending the Established Church is about 400. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish. The paro- 
chial schoolmaster has the maximum salary and the legal accom- 
modation. The other school is supported entirely by the fees of 
the scholars, and a free school-room. The expense of education 
at the parish school is, 8s. for reading; writing, 10s. ; and arith- 
metic, 12s.,— which are the only branches taught. There are no 
persons in the parish from six years and upwards who cannot read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons upon 
the poor roll is from 25 to 30, and the sum distributed is from Is. 
to Is. 6d. per week. The annual disbursement is about L. 40. It 
does not appear that compulsory assessments have ever been intro- 
duced into this parish. The three heritors have been in the habit 
for a considerable period of assessing themselves to make up any 
deficiencies in the poors' funds. Besides the weekly collections, 
there is the interest of L. 130 arising from legacies left by indivi- 
duals to the poor of the parish. Since the new church was open- 
ed, however, the weekly collections have been more than sufficient 
to meet all the demands upon the poor funds, though the number 
ot paupers is rather upon the increase. The heritors had former- 
ly to contribute about L. 10 annually. At present the rare, though 
much-wished for state of things here obtains, viz. the voluntary 
babbath day offerings of the parishioners supporting all the poor. 



192

and the aged, and the infirm amongst them. This is principally to 
be assigned to the regularity of the attendance of the heritors' fa- 
milies, and of others, since a comfortable place of worship has been 
provided. The state of complete disrejair in which the old church 
remained for upwards of thirty years had the effect of alienating 
many individuals from the Establishment, who could easily obtain 
comfortable accommodation in the numerous dissenting chapels 
in the neighbourhood. And thus many who during life had week- 
ly contributed toward the support of a dissenting place of worship, 
and towards the maintenance of its poor, have themselves ultimate- 
ly become applicants for parochial relief. This has had the effect 
of greatly increasing the demand upon the heritors ; and had they 
not come forward and assessed themselves, and had not many cases 
of indigence been supplied by the private benevolence of the pro- 
prietorof the Fordel coal-works, this parish might long ere now 
have been subject to all the numerous evils which never fail to 
attend that self-increasing evil, a legal assessment, and from 
which, we trust, it is now in the way of farther and farther re- 
ceding. And we are persuaded that in many country parishes 
this evil might have been prevented, had the non-resident heritors 
voluntarily contributed to the parish funds such a sum as might 
have been reasonably expected from them, had they been weekly in 
their places in the parish church.  Had this much to be depre- 
cated system ever been introduced into this parish, its principal 
cause must have been traced to the long period during which no 
suitable accommodation was provided for the people m then- pa- 
rish church. Much evil results from want of due attention to the 
comfort of the parishioners in this respect. It not only increas- 
es the demand upon heritors to supply their diminished poors' funds, 
and may thus lead to the introduction of legal assessments, but it 
goes directly to foster those loose principles, and to induce those 
habits of idleness and dissipation which give rise to pauperism it- 
self. For an excuse is hereby furnished to the parishioners for 
withdrawing themselves from the salutary influence of the weekly 
lessons and ministrations of the gospel, which every enlightened 
mind will acknowledge are the most efficient of all means lor pro

moting industry, frugality, and prudence amongst our peasantry, 
and for cherishing that spirit of honest independence which will 
ever associate degradation with a state of pauperism. We cannot 
say that any disposition is evinced on the part of the people to re- 
frain from applying for parochial relief. A strict attention, how- 
ever, is paid to withholding assistance from those who have any pri- 
vate sources of charity from which supplies ought to be afforded 
them. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In a small parish like this, where there are only three proprie- 
tors, and where one-half of the parish belongs to a single noble- 
man, few changes of any consequence have taken place within the 
last forty years. The effects of steam-navigation upon our popula- 
tion are very perceptible. In consequence of the increased faci- 
lities of communication with the metropolis, their original charac- 
ter has given place, in many respects, to the habits and tastes which 
more peculiarly distinguish those who are living in the immediate 
vicinity of a large town. Nothing would be of greater advantage 
to our coal population than a well-regulated savings bank. A want 
of prudence and foresight seems to be a very prominent feature 
in the character of colliers. However great may be their wages, 
they are sure to make their weekly expenditure keep pace with 
them. Any system, therefore, which would introduce habits of eco- 
nomy amongst them, might render our colliers the most indepen- 
dent and comfortable class of the labouring community.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. J. M. CUNNYNGHAME, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
JSfame. — While some have supposed that the village after 
which the parish is called, derives its appellation from a spring 
denominated St Glass's Well, others, with apparently greater 
reason, have traced the name to Gaelic words signifying the 
head of gray land. This idea seems to be corroborated by the 
large extent of inundated, marshy, and mixed surface which, al- 
though much reduced from its former size, still stretches itself to 
the immediate vicinity of the village. The preferable conjecture 
concerning the derivation of the name acquires additional support 
from the circumstance, that a locality, somewhat elevated above 
the channel, along which the water runs from the swamp alluded 
to, has received the appropriate designation of Finglassie, signify- 
ing the termination of the gray land, or mixed bog. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish of Kinglassie, some- 
what irregular in figure, is computed to be about 5 miles and 
3 ftirlongs long, by the road leading through the village from 
west to east. The breadth varies from 1 mile to 3. The total 
surface comprises about 5800 Scots acres. It is bounded on the 
east by the parishes of Markinch and Dysart; on the south by the 
latter, but chiefly by that of Auchterderran, also stretching along 
the western hmits to the north-west corner, which is touched by 
parts of Portmoak and Ballingry ; and its northern extremity is 
washed by the Leven, on the opposite side of which the parishes 
of Portmoak and Leslie meet. From this point of junction, Port- 
moak takes a small jutting to the south bank of the Leven. 

Topographical Appearances.— Twee ridges, of varied height, 
steepness, and width, run towards the east, where they assume a 
lower elevation. From the northern limits, a very considerable 
acclivity arises, which extends along the whole length of the pa- 
rish. The lands of Goatmilk, situated on this range, contam two

proximate hills of no very diminutive size. A square tower, 52 
feet from the base, was erected, in the year 1812, on the summit of 
one of those heights, and marks at a great distance the hill of Red- 
wells, whose southern banks slope towards the village of Kinglas- 
sie, in a declivity of about 160 feet. The ground on the south of 
the village, forming the middle parallel ridge, rises into a height of 
considerable, though somewhat inferior altitude, on both sides of 
which the surface gradually subsides into gentle inclinations or nar- 
row planes, whose elevation above the level of the sea is about 200 
feet. 

Soil and Climate. — Considerable variety characterizes both the 
substratum and the surface. Clay, loam, and gravel are often in- 
termingled. The greater proportion of soil is strong close-bot- 
tomed clay. The remainder is chiefly diversified by moss and sand. 
Although some localities seem pecuharly subjected to stagnant 
damps, or exposed to the severities of the weather, yet, upon the 
whole, the climate is decidedly wholesome and desirable. 

Hydrography. — The Leven, proceeding from the renowned loch 
of that name in the north-west vicinity, runs eastward, and forms, 
as has been already mentioned, the northern boundary of the pa- 
rish. Bennarty hill, in the contiguous neighbourhood, sends forth 
a stream which, acquiring accession from Bog Lochty, the marshy, 
ground to which allusion has been made, is known by the name 
of Lochty. This rivulet, intersecting the village of Kinglassie, 
glides along the dale situated betwixt the northern and midland 
heights. The Orr, which takes its rise from the loch in Ballin- 
gry parish, bearing that designation, traverses the southern level. 
These small waters can furnish the angler with perch, pike, and eels. 
They empty themselves into the Leven at a very small distance 
beyond the eastern boundary of the parish. A diminutive streamlet 
called Sauchie, which pervades a few fields in the immediate vi- 
cmity of the village, speedily joins Lochty. There are many springs, 
both perennial and occasional. 

Mineralogy.— K[t\iowg\ at no very remote period, coal-works 
were in operation, yet during several preceding years that occupa- 
tion has been entirely suspended within the parish. There is rea- 
son to believe, however, that were coal pits less numerous in the 
neighbourhood, a copious supply of this fossil could be obtained. 
In various parts, ironstone, the constant companion of coal, is 
found. Limestone was lately wrought on a moderate scale. Whin- 
stone rock is very abundant: indeed, with rare exceptions, the whole 



l. FIFESIIIIIK. 

soil overlays it. Freestone quarries have been opened. Red rotten 
rock prevails in one or two small localities. 

Zoology. — Deer are found in the parish. Pheasants are plenti- 
ful. The woodcock takes up his abode during the winter months. 
The fowl familiarly called the cock of the north is generallycon- 
sidered as the forerunner of stormy weather. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners, 8c. — In a strictly literal sense, there are 15 pro- 
prietors, from whose lands the minister's stipend is levied. But 
as one estate is the joint property of the four family representatives 
of the antecedent owner, the number of heritors may be said to be 
12. The principal of these, in point of valued and real rental, 
are Robert Ferguson of Raith, Esq. ; the elder son, a minor, of 
the deceased John Aytoun of Inchdairnie, Esq. ; Lieutenant- Ge- 
neral Balfour of Balbirnie ; and the Right Honourable the Earl 
of Rothes, patron. There are numerous feudal possessions, the 
more ancient of which generally pay to the superior the yearly ac- 
knowledgment of 7 id. per fall, or L. 5 per acre ; while those of 
recent grant are held at the advanced rate of Is. per fall, or L. 8 
per acre. The feus in the village, amounting to about 40, hold 
of General Balfour, who, by ancestral purchase, is proprietor of 
various lands, which belonged to William Aytoun Douglas, Esq. 

Eminent Men. — To those who are conversant with the his- 
torical circumstances connected with the origin of the Secession 
church, the name of the Rev. John Currie cannot be unknown. 
That devout man was inducted to the pastoral charge of this 
parish, on the 28th September 1705, and died on the 22d. Sep- 
tember 1765, in the ninety-second year of his age, and within 
a few days of the completion of the sixtieth year of his minis- 
try. He was the intimate friend and epistolary correspondent 
of Ebenezer and Ralph Erskine, who were both grieved and 
astonished that they could not persuade him to act in accord- 
ance with those views of ecclesiastical disciphne and economy 
which had led them and others to renounce subjection to the judi- 
catories of the national religious establishment. His opinions con- 
cerning the popular prerogative in regard to the election of Chris 
tian pastors are set forth in a treatise designated « Vox Popuh vo 
Dei."— Whatever estimate may be formed of that production, or of 
other writings which emanated from his pen, it is undeniable that 
the venerable author was eminently characterized by the purity 
and simplicity of his manners, and by the pious and affectionate as- 



KINGLASSIE. 



197 



siduity which accompanied the discharge of his pastoral duties. 
During the last fifteen years of his life, his ministerial labours were 
lightened, and his tottering steps sustained by the faithful and un- 
wearied services of his son William, who had been ordained assist- 
ant and successor on the 13th March 1750. In less than five 
years the son, after a protracted illness, followed the father to the 
grave, in the forty-ninth year of his age. 

Antiquities. — A pillar of hewn stone, 4 feet 9 inches in height 
above the socket in which it is embossed, 1\ inches broad, and 1 1 
inches thick, has, from time immemorial, stood upon the farm of 
Dogtown. It bears the remaining marks of some hieroglyphical 
emblems or ornamental sculpture in relief, which have been defa- 
ced by the " peltings of the pitiless storm," or the rude touch of de- 
structive man. Antiquarians have conjectured that this column 
was set up by the Danes, to commemorate the exploits of some il- 
lustrious warrior who had fallen on the spot, during an engage- 
ment consequent upon their hostile invasion of Fife, in the reign 
of Constantine II. ; while others have supposed that it was rear- 
ed by the Scots to perpetuate their successful resistance of the 
foreign foe, who had encamped on both sides of the Leven. We 
learn from the page of the historian, that those depredators hav- 
ing been prevented from uniting their forces, in consequence of 
the sudden and extensive swelling of the river, were speedily and 
effectually routed by the Scots. Goat-milk-hill constituted one 
of the links in the chain of Danish forts, which stretched from 
Fifeness to Stirling. While those positions were occupied by the 
invaders, a mill was erected on the Leven, which retains the name 
of Mill-danes. During the recent operations of levelling the chan- 
nel of that water, several heads of iron spears, a Roman sword, 
and battle-axe presented themselves. A dagger of antique appear- 
ance, 18 inches long, having a wooden handle, partially overlaid 
with brass, was lately found in a draw-well on the farm of west 
Finglassie, which was reopened after having remained shut, so far 
as can be ascertained, for centuries. 

Parochial Registers. — The most remote records of baptisms and 
sessional procedure bear the date of a. d. 1627. Those of mar- 
riage contracts commence twenty years subsequent to that period. 
Instead of classification having been always duly observed, there is aa 
occasional commingling of matters belonging to these separate de- 
partments. Unless by those familiar with obsolete manuscripts 
some of the ancient registers are not legible. For many years past.

discipline proceedings, births, marriages, and poors' funds have had 
each their distinct and appropriate register. 

III. — Population. 
The official report of Dr Webster, eighty years ago, states that the 
total number of inhabitants then amounted to 998. The Parlia- 
mentary census of 1821 represents the population at 1027; and 
that of 1831 at 958, of whom there are 488 males, and 470 fe- 
males. According to this last return, there are 224 families resi- 
dent under 198 roofs. Of those families, 66 are employed in 
agriculture; 153 in manufactures, trade, and handicraft; and 5 
in other avocations. It may not be irrelevant to mention, that, 
during a course of pastoral visitation, which was made in the 
months of February and March of the present year, when a mi- 
nute numerical survey was taken, the total population was ascertain- 
ed to be 1050 souls. Of that number, 755 are above twelve years 
of age, and 295 have not yet reached that period. 

Resident Heritors. — The country seat of one of the principal 
heritors is usually occupied by himself and family during one-half 
of the year. With this exception, and that of a small proprietor, 
there are no residing heritors. 

The annual average of births during the last seven years has 
been about 26; deaths, 13; of marriages, 11. 

Character and Habits of the People. — Sobriety, industry, and 
respect for religion are qualities, which, with few exceptions, mark 
the great mass of the population. Considerable attention is paid 
to neatness of dress and cleanliness of personal appearance. And 
in such estimation is neatness of apparel held, that the want of rai- 
ment equal in quality to that of a next door neighbour is, in some 
instances, viewed as a valid apdlogy for absence from church, not 
only when there exists no decided disinclination, but, on the contrary, 
a seeming anxiety to attend. While a commendable regard to per- 
sonal and dotnestic spruceness is often observable, yet some of those 
families and individuals occasionally discover a neglect of various 
essential branches of comfort and convenience. Now and then 
the stagnant puddle and the nauseous dunghill form a striking- 
contrast to the interior aspect of the contiguous dwelling. — On old 
handsel Monday, there is a general cessation of professional labour; 
neighbourly visits are interchanged, and raffles are practised. . 

During the three years preceding the 1st June last, the number 
of illegitimate births in the parish was 9.

IV. — Industry. 

Jgriculture. — The parish contains about 34 farms, the largest 
of which amounts in whole to 377 Scots acres. No other ex- 
ceeds 234. Three of these are below 60 acres. Smaller portions 
of land are also occupied upon nineteen years leases. Besides, two 
farms, whose steadings are beyond its limits, stretch themselves into 
the parish. Such has been the encouragement given by considerate 
and liberal landlords to skilful and industrious tenants, that the 
quantity of ground now brought under the plough can scarcely be 
estimated below 5200 Scots acres. 356 acres are covered with 
thriving plantations. The remaining 244 are unarable, being either 
overlaid with rock, steep on the surface, or laid out in roads. Not- 
withstanding the difficulties which discourage improvements,. a con- 
siderable deal of soil might, with a profitable application of capital, 
be added to the cultivated land, or to that which is already covered 
with wood. The prevailing trees are larch, spruce, fir, and ash. 
One considerable plantation abounds with excellent beech and oak. 

Rent—Ks variety characterises the soil, a diversity of rents like- 
wise obtains. The extreme rates at which land is let per Scots acre 
are, L. 1 and L. 3, 1 5s. It is a small proportion, however, which is 
leased at either of these sums; L. 1, 9s. 9d. per Scots acre may be 
considered as the average rent of arable ground. Pasturage for a 
cow generally costs L. 3, 10s., and that for a sheep L. 1, 5s. Grass 
parks usually bring about L. 2 per acre. 

Draining. — During the last twenty years nearly 300 acres have 
been reclaimed. The cultivators of the soil have of late been par- 
ticularly careful in drawing off that superabundance of moisture 
which is so inimical to the production of healthy and luxuriant 
crops. In practical attention to this department of rural economy, 
the late Mr Aytoun of Inchdairnie was very active, judicious, and 
successful. The depth of the close drains made under his direc- 
tion was determined by the nature of the soil which they were in- 
tended to improve. Some of those on strong clay are eight feet 
below the surface. 

Live-stock, Sfc. — Almost the whole cattle are of the pure Fife 
breed, of which the black horned are the most prevalent. The 
number of calves annually reared may be estimated at 300. 

In regard to farm-steadings, material improvements have taken 
place. Towards their tenantry, landlords have in this and other 
respects manifested a judicious and benevolent regard. 

With very rare exceptions, the different farms have thrashing-

mills attached ; three of these are propelled by water, and one by 
steam. This last, seven horse power, has been in operation two 
years. 

Iron ploughs are almost universally used. The mode of hus- 
bandry varies according to circumstances. Some farmers apportion 
their land in the following ratio : two-sevenths, oats ; one-seventh 
wheat and barley ; one-seventh green crop and summer fallow ; 
three-sevenths grass pastured, sometimes for three years. One 
boll is the usual quantity of oats and wheat allotted to the Scots acre, 
from which the return is often tenfold. Three firlots constitute the 
ordinary measure of barley sown on the acre, which not seldom issue 
in the production of ten bolls. The rearing of flax, which for a 
series of years had been very much given up, has of late become 
more frequent and remunerative. Three mills are employed in 
manufacturing this article. 

Rate of Wages. — A male farm-servant who is married usually 
receives as his anual payment L. 11 or L. 12 in money, 6 
bolls of meal, and about a Scots pint of milk daily, together 
with the use of a dwelling house and a small garden plot. The 
additional privilege of twenty-four falls of potatoe ground is, in 
most cases, enjoyed. Full-grown young men are often hired on 
nearly the same pecuniary terms as the former, and receive their 
victuals in their master's house. The ordinary wages of a domes- 
tic female servant are L. 5, 10s. Harvest reapers are almost al- 
ways engaged in the course of the preceding winter, and become 
bound to remain with their respective employers twenty-four law- 
ful days, or until the labours peculiar to autumn shall be complet- 
ed. The rate at which a man is hired for that season is commonly 
L. 2, 10s., and a woman L. 1, 10s. or L. 1, 15s. with lodging and 
victuals. Shearers whose houses are at hand receive a little more 
money. The highest pay given to a male is L. 3, and to a female 
L. 2. A hay-cutter earns 2s. 6d. daily. The summer hire of an 
ordinary labourer is Is. 8d. ; women employed in field labour usu- 
ally gain 9d.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Village and Means of Communication. — The only village in the 
parish is that of Kinglassie, whose present population is 375. Its 
inhabitants consist principally of weavers, and other handicraft 
tradesmen. About twenty-four looms are now in use, — several of 
which are plied by females. The comparatively small income 
arising from that occupation induced, of late years, a considerable 
proportion of men to exchange it for agricultural employments. 
There are 3 public-houses, and the same number of small gro- 
cery shops. Brewing of small-beer, ale, and porter is regularly 
carried on. Bread and butcher-meat are constantly supplied by 
professional tradesmen. Two fairs occur in the course of the 
year ; — one on the third Wednesday of May, old style ; the other on 
the Thursday immediately preceding Michaelmas, old style. An 
agricultural association, formed upwards of twenty years ago, holds 
its annual meeting here in the month of August. It consists of 
about forty practical farmers ; and its objects are countenanced by 
the membership of several landed proprietors. Last season there 
were exhibited 110 head of cattle and 43 horses. 

The village lies about six miles to the northward of Kirkaldy, 
which is the post-town. Communication with that burgh is enjoy- 
ed by means of several individuals, whose business as carriers re- 
peatedly leads them thither in the course of the week. Easy ac- 
cess to metal has, in connection with other circumstances, produ- 
ced a very material improvement on the state of the principal roads. 
But although much has been done in this respect, it must be con- 
fessed, that not a little remains unaccomplished. There are no toll- 
bars within the parochial precincts. The east end of the parish is 
intersected by the road leading from Kirkaldy to Cupar, on which 
coaches betwixt Edinburgh and Dundee run daily. It has lately 
been alfo traversed regularly by a coach betwixt the metropolis 
and Perth. There are about twelve small stone bridges. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The only place of public worship is the 
parish church. Situated within a mile of the south-west boundary, 
and distant several miles from a considerable proportion of the po- 
pulation, its locality subjects not a few to great inconvenience. But 
although some parishioners are so remote as nearly five miles ; yet 
as the village, where the church is placed, contains a third of the 
population, and as its immediate vicinity is interspersed with seve- 
ral agricultural hamlets, the ecclesiastical edifice may, upon the 
whole, be viewed as standing in the most eligible spot. The 



202 



FIFESHIRE. 



exterior of the fiibric has a heavy appearance, being nearly 90 
feet long, and of very subordinate and disproportionate dimensions 
in height and breadth. The east gable, and part of the contigu- 
ous side walls are supposed to have stood for at least two centuries. 
The remainder was rebuilt in 1773, when the whole received a 
new roof. For many subsequent years, however, the church con- 
tinued with unplastered walls, and without any ceiling. About fif- 
teen years ago, the inside underwent such repairs as have render- 
ed it a very comfortable place of worship. There are sittings for 
nearly 350. The pews are allocated among the heritors accord- 
ing to their respective valued rents, and are occupied, without any 
pecuniary remuneration, by tenants, feuars, and other classes of 
persons. A distinct appropriation of a greater number of sittings for 
such parishioners as are not connected with landed proprietors by 
any peculiar tie would certainly be beneficial ; — for it cannot be 
denied, that, although no seat rents are exacted or paid, yet the 
fear of being viewed as unwelcome intruders, by those who have 
obtained a previous occupancy, may sometimes operate as a dis- 
couragement of regular attendance. Fully foui-fifths of the peo- 
ple professedly belong to the Established Church. Of these about 
350 are communicants. The dissenting or seceding portion of 
the population are generally connected either with the United Se- 
cession church, or with the religious denomination adhering to the 
Associate Synod of Original Seceders. A very limited number are 
of the Relief and Baptist persuasions. 

The manse, which is hard by the church, was built in 1774, 
and was repaired in 1818. The glebe contains a little more than 
6 Scots acres. The stipend, augmented in 1823, is 15 chal- 
ders of victual, half meal and half barley, payable according to the 
highest county fiars. The sum of L. 8, 6s. 8d. is paid under the 
name of communion element money.  

The parochial register of 1682 acknowledges the receipt of four 
silver communion cups as the donation of Mr Melvill, formerly mi- 
nister of this parish. Those cups are still used in the celebration of 
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Each bears the following 
inscription : — " Haec quatuor pocula ejusdem ponderis et mensu- 
rse ecclesias de Kinglassie sacravit Mr Thomas Melvill non ita, 
pridem pastor ibidem." 

Education. — The parochial school is situated in the village. 

• The tcinds of Kinglassie were, a. d. 1234, mortified by the Bishop of St An- 
drews, " Deo St Margarcte et monachis de Diuifennline," as the records of that 
abbacy bear. 



KINLGASSIE.

Besides the maximum saLary, amounting to L. 34, 4s. 4id., along 
with a dwelling-house and garden, the schoolmaster annually re- 
ceives six bolls of oats, the bequest of an ancient proprietor. This 
seminary is at present attended by about 100 scholars. The or- 
dinary branches of education, including English grammar and the 
elementary principles of general knowledge, are taught with dili" 
gence and ability. Means of instruction in mathematics and clas- 
sical learning are also furnished. The principles of revealed re- 
ligion are sedulously instilled. Forty are employed in arithmetic, 
20 more are learning to write. The teacher may receive about 
L. 34 a-year of fees.  

The village has also a small female school, in which knitting 
and sewing are taught for a very moderate sum. 

On the southern boundary, there is a school, which is pretty well 
attended. Its erection proceeded from the kindness of Mr Fer- 
guson of Raith, who has allotted to its teacher a free dwelling- 
house and garden, with a yearly pecuniary allowance. 

So commendably desirous are parents of furnishing their chil- 
dren with the means of education, that there is hardly an instance 
in which an individual beyond six years of age is unable to read 
more or less accurately. To the same praiseworthy feeling, is to 
be ascribed the comparatively small number among the youthful 
portion of the population, altogether unskilled in the arts of writ- 
ing and arithmetic. Children are usually sent to school about five 
years of age ; although in several instances, distance of locality and 
badness of roads forbid that early initiation. But in these and 
other cases, some elementary training is for the most part practis- 
ed at home. 

A Sabbath school in the village is numerously attended, and 
judiciously conducted. 

Library. — Access to a small parochial library is obtainable at a 
very moderate rate ; and through the generosity of a benevolently 
disposed lady, the youth belonging to the village Sunday school are 
gratuitously furnished with the weekly perusal of interesting and 
instructive books. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— Various individuals receive a fixed 
monthly aliment, others get only occasional aid, and several house 

• The schoolmaster lately retired from the charge of the school on account of his 
aavancea age ; but is secured for life in the enjoyment of tlie legal salary, and of the 
house and garden. He is entitled to the trifling sums which arise from making up 
the 1 arhamentary census and registering voters for a Member of Parliament, 
ine acting teacher, beside the school fees, receives from the heritors annually L. 20. 
and draws the fiars price of the six bolls of oats to which reference hasecn made. '

rents are annually paid, in whole or in part. The first of these 
classes is composed at present of 12 families, more or less nu- 
merous, and requiring of course different degrees of pecuniary re- 
lief. Temporary supplies are afforded to others when visited with 
sickness, or otherwise deprived of the means of earning a liveli- 
hood. This description of beneficiaries generally comprises about 
15 families. On these different objects of parochial charity, 
about L. 72 communibus annis are laid out in the course of the 
year. 

The funds from which the poor receive relief arise from church 
door collections, land, marriages, mortcloths, erection of tomb- 
stones, and interest on bank deposits. As the means of supply are 
very much strengthened by the second of these sources, the weekly 
contributions not generally amounting to L. 13 per annum are less 
liberal than in other circumstances they would be. Although the pa- 
rishioners are the reverse of wealthy, yet handsome sums have been 
collected at church for pious and benevolent purposes. The land- 
ed property, to which reference has been made, lies in the parish 
of Abernethy, Perthshire, and was purchased in the year 1726 for 
6600 merks. What i-ent was paid at that period is not exactly as- 
certained ; but in terms of a tack granted in 1 762, it was fixed at 200 
merks. It was subsequently raised to L. 36, and afterwards to L. 50, 
with the additional obligation of discharging public burdens to an 
amount somewhat exceeding L. 6, The immediately succeeding 
lease of the poors' farm, extending to nineteen years from Martinmas 
1835, stipulates that the tenant shall annually pay L.l 00, and advance 
the various legal assessments due from the land, for which, on the 
production of discharges, he is entitled to discount out of the rent. 
As these imposts are considerable, and as the joint administrators 
for the poor incurred great expense in building a dwelling-house 
and stone fences, and in otherwise enhancing the value of the pro- 
perty, the pecuniary return has been much abridged. Beside emer- 
gencies, the regular annual drawbacks on the farm amount to 
about L. 10. 

The only marriage fee payable to the poors' fund is 2s. when 
the bride's residence is within the parish. Three parish mort- 
cloths are severally lent at 5s., 3s. 6d., and 2s. The united sa- 
laries of synod, presbytery, and session-clerks, precentor, and kirk- 
officer amount to L. 10, 10s. 

In several instances of known or suspected indigence, a strong 
aversion to receive parochial aid has been occasionally evinced, — 
while, in cases less urgent, a very different spirit has appeared.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Among the many improvements which have taken place since 
the last Statistical Account was drawn up, — the great accession 
made to the cultivated land, — the appropriation of unproductive 
wastes to valuable plantations, and the increased attention paid to 
draining, are deserving of high commendation. In consequence 
of the recent deepening and widening of the Leven water- 
course, the circumjacent soil has been rendered far less suc- 
culent, and more susceptible of melioration. Similar beneficial 
alterations are in progress on a part of the Lochty. Although 
there is no savings' bank in the parish, yet some individuals with 
laudable prudence and propriety, deposit a portion of their earn- 
ings in some of those excellent institutions which happily exist in 
the vicinity.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. ADAM CAIRNS, D.D. MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of the parish is variously written in the an- 
cient records as Dinbug, Denbuig, Dunbog, Dunbolg, and Dun- 
boig. It is evidently of Celtic derivation, and may be translated 
" the hog of the hill." Like all Celtic names, it is descriptive of 
the general character of the district. Within the memory of man, 
the low-lying part of the parish was an extensive marsh, which ran 
along the base of the highest hill in the north of Fife, anciently 
denominated Dunmore, or the great hill, though now known by 
the Saxon name Norman's Law. The Gaelic appellation, how- 
ever, is still given to the property to which the mountain belongs, 
and from this we infer that Dunbog is the original and correct name 
of the parish. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The parish of Dunbog is of irregular 
figure and diminutive extent. It ranges from south-east to 
north-west, its greatest length not exceeding 4 miles; its ex- 
treme breadth being about 1, and its least not more, perhaps, 



206 FIPESHIRFi. 

than half a mile. On the north it is bounded by the parish of 
'Flisk; on the east by a section of Abdie ; on the south by Moni- 
mail ; and on the west by Abdie. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish consists of two ridges 
or prolongations of two chains of hills that intersect this portion 
of Fife ; and of the valley enclosed between them. The north- 
ern ridffe is a continuation of Norman's-law. It is cultivated 
to the top, and produces every description of grain of excellent 
quality. From the farm-house of Higham, which is perched on 
the summit, it descends precipitously to the level carse land that 
borders the Tay from Newburgh to Birkhill, and which is gene- 
rally known by the name of the Barony. A narrow stripe of Dun- 
bog parish reaches the banks of the river, to the westward of 
Balinbriech Castle, and is called Higham Flouts. From any point 
of this northern elevation, the prospect that meets the view is of 
equal grandeur and beauty. The eye from this commanding po- 
sition takes in a vast extent of country, diversified with all the fea- 
tures of the most interesting scenery, on a scale of unusual mag- 
nitude. The rugged Grampians fill up the horizon to the north, 
towering above the intervening range of the Sidlaws, which form 
the southern boundary of Strathmore. To the westward, the eye 
follows the windings of the Tay, till it is lost behind a projecting 
shoulder of the hill of Kinnoul, and surveys almost with the same 
glance the valley of the Earn intersected by its shining river. 
Opposite, is spread out the Carse of Gowrie, smooth and level as 
a floor, and confessedly one of the most fertile districts of Great 
Britain ; and to the east appears the flourishing town of Dundee, 
and the Tay, now increased to an estuary, mingling its waters with 
those of the German Ocean. 

The southern ridge, again, is, at least in the parish of Dunbog, 
of greater altitude than the one to the north. Generally speak- 
ing, it is uncultivated and almost barren. Patches of it have in- 
deed, of late years, been brought under tillage by the use of bone 
manure ; but improvement in this way seems to be carried as far 
as nature will allow ; the prevailing character of the hill being 
rocky and sterile. The greatest, and perhaps the only, improve- 
ment of which these dreary heights are susceptible, is that which 
would be accomplished by planting them with wood ; and it is im- 
possible not to regret, and that deeply, that this very obvious and 
simple improvement had not been attended to long ago. The val- 
ley included between these hills is composed of excellent soil, pro- 



DUN130G.

lucing abundant crops of wheat, barley, oats. What was former- 
ly a noxious morass is now good and valuable land. The exact 
elevation of the hills above the level of the sea has not been as- 
certained with perfect accuracy, but the extreme height is comput- 
ed to be about 500 feet. 

The climate is mild and salubrious, and no better proof of this 
can be adduced than the robust health of the inhabitants, and the 
great old age to which many of them attain. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The hills and the basin that lies be- 
tween them are composed of whinstone or trap rock. The dip of 
such parts as have been exposed to view is nearly vertical. On the 
very summit of the hill, rolled blocks of granite are met with, some of 
them of considerable size. In the valley, the whinstone is covered 
by a rich black mould of no great depth, and through which the 
rock pierces in numerous places, forming barren spots, or snobs, in 
the midst of the best fields. The greatest portion of the soil in 
the parish is of this sort, resting immediately on the rock, or on a 
bed of gravel interposed. We have indeed a few fields of a clay- 
ey texture, and towards the east the soil becomes of much sharper 
quality, though equally productive. From the nature of the subsoil, 
the ground is easily drained, and is therefore dry and early, A 
considerable part of the arable ground consists of the reclaimed 
bog. This great improvement was effected about thirty years ago 
by the united contributions of the proprietors through whose do- 
mains it ran. Previous to the execution of this measure, an exten- 
sive tract of ground was covered with brushwood, with large stag- 
nant pools of bog water ; and in the more favourable spaces, with 
a coarse and rank grass, which afforded a scanty nourishment to the 
few half-starved cattle that waded about in search of subsistence. It 
is now converted into fruitful corn-fields. The soil, however, is soft 
or mossy, and not well qualified for growing wheat. The sub- 
soil is various. In some places, it is cold clay, in others a hard till, 
but generally it is composed of sand and gravel. In this mossy soil, 
there are still found pieces of oak trees, black as ebony, but other- 
wise in a state of excellent preservation, and which must in all pro- 
bability have lain there for many centuries. 

Zoology. — There is nothing remarkable in the zoology of this 
parish. It may perhaps be worthy of notice that a pair of starhngs 
built their nest and brought out their young last summer in the 
shnibbery of Dunbog House. The young birds were taken from 
the nest, when neariy fledged, and are still alive in the neighbour-

hood, amusing their captors with their mimic song. A few years 
ago, a fine specimen of the Strix Jlammea, or white owl, was caught 
in this vicinity, and is now stuffed and in possession of the author. 
It is so very rare in this quarter, that no person could give it a 
name, or say they had ever seen such a bird before. The speci- 
men, however, though full-grown, is evidently a young bird ; and 
we have no doubt that the white owl, which is very common in 
many parts of England, and not by any means a stranger in Scot- 
land, had bred in the woods both of Dunbog and Ayton, when 
there was more shelter for it than there is now. A few roe -deer 
frequent the hills and plantations, and are known to breed here ; 
but they are so destructive to the young corns that they will not be 
permitted to increase to any extent. Besides these, we have the 
usual sorts of game, but not in such abundance as to hurt the in- 
terests of the farmer. 

Botany. — There is very little wood in the parish. Did it pos- 
sess the benefit of a resident proprietor, this glaring defect would 
speedily be remedied. The greater portion of the parish belongs 
to Lord Dundas, who has of course little personal interest in or- 
namental improvement. But it is impossible to look on the naked 
hills, overrun with gorse and bracken, without indulging a wish to 
see them clothed and beautified with forest trees. In their present 
state, they are comparatively worthless, but were they covered with 
wood, they would not only become of much greater value to the 
proprietors in the course of a few years, but they would afford shel- 
ter both to the flocks and subjacent fields, and sensibly ameliorate 
the chmate. At no distant period, the valley of Dunbog was pretty 
well wooded ; but now little remains except within the pleasure 
ground of the old mansion-house. Even there, the trees are ra- 
pidly decaying, and a few years more will witness their total disap- 
pearance. The kinds that seem to thrive best are the plane, the 
ash, and the elm. 

II. — Civil History. 

The only historical notice of this parish that we are acquainted 
with, is contained in Sibbald's History of Fife, first published in 
1682. In a book entitled " Reliquiae Divi Andreae," by Martme 
of Clermont, who appears to have been secretary to Archbishop 
Sharpe, there are allusions to persons and places in the parish, 
which are of some use in illustrating its condition at that distant time. 

Family of Barclay of Collairney.— The most ancient and ho- 
nourable name connected with the history of Dunbog is that 
of the family of Barclay, who seem to have been proprietors 



DUNIJOG. 



209 



of Collairney for many ages — it is presumed, for not less a pe- 
riod than 500 years. We find in a list of the Lords of the Re- 
galities within Fife in the reign of Charles II., that Barclay of 
Collairney was heritable bailie of the regality of Lindores, while 
the other jurisdictions were in the hands of the Marquis of 
Tweeddale, Lords Balmerino and Anstruther, and Sir Tho- 
mas Hope of Craighall. The possession of this office implied the 
existence of great personal influence or high rank, while it con- 
ferred civil authority of the most varied and extensive description. 
This once powerful family is now extinct ; their name is scarcely 
known. About forty years ago, the estate was purchased from the 
last of the Barclays, by the late Dr Francis Balfour of Fernie, 
whose son inherits it at the present moment. The Castle of Col- 
lan-ney is now in ruins, though enough remains to attest its origi- 
nal magnitude. In the only tower that has survived the wreck of 
time, and the despoiling hand of modern improvement, there are 
two small rooms, the roofs of which are divided into numerous com- 
partments, in which are painted in vivid colours the armorial bear- 
ings of the old chivalry of Scotland. The mottos as well as the 
devices of a few are yet distinctly legible. But it cannot be ex- 
pected that they will remain long uneffaced, as no sufficient care 
can be now taken to preserve them from perishing. In the ap- 
pendix to Sibbald's history, there is a list of those natives of Fife 
who had risen to distinction in hterature or science. Among others 
he mentions " the famous William Barclay, father of John, Pro- 
fessor of the Laws at Anglers, who derives his pedigree from Bar- 
clay of Collairney in this shire." 

Estate of Dunbog.—The next place of consequence in the 
parish is the estate and mansion-house of Dunbog. This pro- 
perty formed in remote times a part of the extensive barony of 
Balinbriech, which belonged to the family of Rothes. It subse- 
quently passed into the hands of Lord Home. In the reign of 
James IV., Alexander Lord Home sold it to David Bethune of 
Criech, in whose family it remained till 1658, when it was sold to 
. James Bethune of Balfour, an elder branch of the same house. 
After passing through several other hands, it was purchased in 
1694 by Major Henry Balfour of Starr, who forfeited in the Re- 
bellion of 1715. It was restored, however, to his son, and finally 
disposed of in 1766, to Sir Lawrence Dundas, to whose descend- 
■ ant Lord Dundas it now belongs, and again forms a part of the 
f barony of Balinbriech. The vulgar tradition of the country as-

signs the building of the house to Cardinal Bethune of St Andrews. 
There is every reason to believe that it was erected by a Bethune 
of Balfour, of which house the celebrated Cardinal was a menri- 
ber. But as a decided proof that neither the Cardinal nor his 
uncle David Bethune, his predecessor in the archbishoprick, and 
who was also a son of one of the lairds of Balfour, had any thing 
to do with the erection of the mansion-house of Dunbog, it is suf- 
ficient to state, that the Cardinal was put to death in 1546, nearly 
a century before this property came into the possession of his fa- 
mily. Long before the time of which we now speak, the monk 
of the abbacy of Balmerino had a small building or preceptory on 
the site of the present house of Dunbog. It was called the pre- 
ceptory of Gadvan, tenanted in general by two or three of the 
brotherhood, whose chief occupation we presume to have been the 
culture of some 24 acres of ground attached to their cell. A 
small portion of this land is comprehended in the glebe— but it is 
principally laid out in the garden and enclosures of Dunbog. Sib- 
bald mentions also, that the parish church of Dunbog was given 
by Alexander Cumin Earl of Buchan, to the abbacy of Aber- 
brothock, in the reign of King Alexander 11. There was a con- 
siderable village here, in which a weekly market was held withm 
the memory of man. But it has totally vanished before the rapid 
extension of the farming system. 

The parish is divided among three proprietors,— Lord Dundas, 
Balfour of Fernie, and Joseph Francis Murray of Ayton. 

Parochial Rec/isters.—The parochial registers extend no far- 
ther back than the year 1666. The first entry is dated September 
23d of that year. From that period they have been kept with to- 
lerable accuracy. The records are not very Ml, but they are 
sometimes interesting, as illustrative of the manners of a former 
age, of the comprehensive charity and national usefiilness of the 
Established Church. It is impossible to glance over them without 
a feeling of surprise, at the frequency and largeness of parochial 
contributions to a great variety of benevolent purposes. Not sa- 
tisfied with the comfortable maintenance of their own poor,— with 
relieving every unfortunate person that applied to them for a little 
aid,— with paying their proportion of the expense incurred by the 
education and support of the presbytery bursar,— we find the ses- 
' sion sending collections to the most distant parts of Scotland, to 
assist in repairing the damage occasioned by fire, at that time a 
very frequent disaster, in alleviatingthe misery of the victims of such 
calamities,— in building or improving harbours, bridges, and public 



DUNBOG. 



211 



works of a like nature, — and in ransoming those of our countrymen 
who had been carried into a terrible slavery by the Sallee rovers or 
Turkish corsairs. Towards the close of the seventeenth century we 
find such entries as the following : " Given out to ane indigent gentle- 
man 6 B. Given to ane dumb man 4 B. Given to ane poorsojer 1 B. 
A collection for ane Pollonian minister 4 B. Given to a ship- 
broken man 4 B. To ane indigent gentlewoman 10 B. To a de- 
posed minister's wife 6 B. To a distressed minister L. 1, 8s. To 
ane Episcopal minister called James Spark, who came from Ire- 
land, 12 B. To Mr John Constantino, a Neapolitan and Ca- 
puchin friar, who had renounced Poperie, as he said, 12 B. To a 
suppliant John Lauder, 12 B, having lost 25,000 merks in ane ship 
coming from France to Greenock." Of another sort, we have such 
entries as these : " 1671. Given to John Rule and John Cunninham, 
two men that had their houses burnt at Sligo, 12 sh. 1675, De- 
cember 26, a voluntary contribution for rebuilding of the town 
of Kelso, which was burnt down." Some years after a collection 
is made to assist in rebuilding Newburgh, which had been burnt 
down. The instances of relief granted to individual sufferers by 
fire are almost without number. Of a class still more interest- 
ing, we may venture to give a few specimens. " In 1 678, February 
10, the minister did intimate a voluntar contribution this day 
eight days for the relief of some Montrose seamen taken by the 
Turks." Again, October 3d, 1680, " There was two acts read for 
a voluntar contribution, the one in favour of John Atchison, skipper 
in Pittenweem, his mate, Alexander Black, ten mariners and two 

I passengers, taken by Turkish men of war, and carried up to Sallee 
and there ever since slaves. The other in favour of Robert Angus, 

• skipper in Burntisland, who was taken by a Turkish man of wai- 
belonging to Algiers and was kept as a slave since."— The Bar- 

1 bary corsairs seem to have been the terror and scourge of British 

: sailors in the seventeenth century. A few years in advance we 
fall on the traces of a new enemy. « 1707, July 20, Given to 
George Hamilton, a man taken by the French pirates, and retaken 
by the Dutch, and who had five children, lOsh." Again " November 
30, this day there was given to James Forbes and his wife in 
their distress, they being robbed by the French pirates, 12 B" 
But It IS curious and instructive to remark how effectually the 

 church was made to promote the general interests of the country. 

i For example, in 1677, September 16, the minister " read an order 

. ot the privy-council, for a contribution this day eight days, for help- 



212 



I'MFESHIHK. 



ing the harbour of Eyemouth." Again, hi 1682, " A voluntary con- 
tribution is ordered for building a stone bridge over the water of 
Ness, at Inverness." And again in the same year, we find three 
acts of the privy-council quoted, ordering collections in favour of 
" the harbour at Burntisland, to repair it ; in favour of Dumbarton, 
to erect a bridge across the water of Leven ; and in favour of my 

Lord Pitsligo, for repairing the harbour at ." There are 

many more of the same kind ; but the above will amply suffice to 
shew the many practical benefits the church has been the instru- 
ment of conferring on almost every town and sea-port of our na- 
tive land. It was the practice in the seventeenth century for par- 
ties intending to be married, to enter into a pubhc contract, and 
to deposit with the kirk-session a sum of money in pledge of 
their sincerity and good behavour. The form observed is record- 
ed with amusing simphcity. As, for instance, " Contracted George 
Brewhouse and Helen Kinloch, and consigned their pledges ac- 
cording to order, that they should marry within the space of forty 
days, Ind carry themselves civillee till their marriage." It did 
happen occasionally that the pledges were forfeited for lack of 
the requisite civility, and sometimes too for other reasons, as, for 
instance, on the 28th of February 1675, there is given to the 
bursar " be Andro Law, 4 lbs. being his daughter's pledge, which 
was given because of her fail in not taking of William Buist in mar- 
riage, after being thrice proclaimed." The oldest register is 
full of proclamations, read by order of the King and Council, 
which forcibly mark the unquiet aspect of the times, and the grow- 
ing jealousy of the government, as the eventfiil era of the Revolu- 
tion approached. We shall conclude this branch of our account, 
by extracting an entry of a peculiar interest: " 1678, May 18, a 
proclamation was read from the pulpit by the minister, ordaining 
the whole heritors within the parish to cause their tenants, cottars, 
servants, and all others on their grounds to compear at Cupar on 
Friday the 2.3d of May instant, to clear and vindicate themselves 
from the late murder of my Lord Archbishop of St Andrews." 

III. — Population. 
The population of this parish has gradually but regularly de- 
clined since the end of the last century. At that time the popu- 
lation was nearly 400. By the census of 1831, it amounted to no 
more than 195, and this year it has been reduced to 170 of all 
ages which we sincerely hope will prove its minimum. This rapid 
decrease is to be attributed to the extinction of the village; and 



DUNBOG. 213 

the absorption of the small farms. There is now only one farm 
where formerly there were three or four. That the depopulating 
system has been carried much too far is now painfully evident 
to every one connected with agriculture. The farmers not only 
experience a difficulty in procuring labourers to work the green 
crop, but they find it impossible to get them at any price, and must 
have recourse to sonae unusual means of obtaining an adequate sup- 
ply.. The average number of births since my induction does not 
exceed 8 per annum ; of marriages not more than 4 ; of deaths about 
the same number.

There are no heritors or families of independent fortune resident

There are 42 inhabited houses, besides 4 bothies. 

Habits and Character of the People. — The farmers are an en- 
lightened, active, and enterprising body of men, who embrace every 
opportunity of extending their knowledge of the important subjects 
connected with the cultivation of the soil, and eagerly adopt every 
suggestion that may conduce to the improvement of the rapidly ad- 
vancing science of husbandry. Perhaps no class of men is more free 
from prejudices, —more unaffectedly kind,— more sound and steady 
in their principles,— and full of solid and useful information, than 
that of the farmer's of Fifeshire. Besides these, the only other class 
of people belonging to this parish is that of their dependents or 
ploughmen. Speaking generally, we would say of the married 
ploughmen, that they are a quiet, sober, and industrious race. 
Their lot is one of incessant toil, alleviated by few advantages. 
Their ordinary food consists of oatmeal and sweet milk, with po- 
I tatoes and occasionally pork. While young they enjoy uninter- 

■ rupted health, and exhibit in their form all the appearances of ro- 
 bust and smewy vigour. But long before old age has arrived, 
1 most of them, from perpetual exposure to the weather, are 

crippled with violent rheumatism. But no class of men, we are 

■ persuaded, labours under more blighting evils than does that of our 
ploughmen. Then- education, both religious and intellectual, is 
exceedmgly neglected from their earliest youth. There may be

found a few bright exceptions to the prevailing character of the 
body ; but it is a melancholy truth that this interesting race of our 
people has been allowed to sink into a state of great ignorance and 
debasement. One chief cause of this calamity, we do not hesitate 
to say, is the practice universal in Fife, of making the young un- 
married men live together in bothies. No sooner are boys capable 
of attending cattle in the fields, than they are sent from their fa- 
ther's house, — consigned to these wretched bothies, — and left in 
the midst of dangers to their own will. The results are grievous, 
though not more so than might be anticipated. In these hovels 
the wicked very speedily corrupt the good. The old ensnare 
the young ; and the hardened profligate leaves no effort untried 
to seduce the scrupulous and timid to imitate his reckless exam- 
ple. Until this horrid system be abolished, it will be in vain 
to expect any happy alteration in the character and condition of 
our ploughmen. Another grand cause of this flagrant evil is to be 
found in the fluctuating and wandering lives of the ploughmen 
themselves. The married men frequently, the unmarried always, 
jilt at the end of one year's service. They thus acquire vagrant 
habits and uncontrollable minds. They are never long enough in 
one place to form useful connections, — to feel themselves influen- 
ced and benefited by the exertions of the minister, — or to receive 
any sufficient advantage to their children from the care and super- 
intendence of a parochial teacher. They thus virtually cut them- 
selves off from all the blessings of Christianity and civilization, and 
in a land of light are literally roaming about in darkness. That an 
evil so virulent and so widely diffused as this can be soon or easily re- 
medied, is not to be believed. But were the masters and cler- 
gy to unite in a zealous endeavour to reclaim to better habits the 
labouring class of our people, they would, we have no doubt, da 
much good even to the present generation ; and, at all events, they 
would commence a work af improvement, which another and a 
more fortunate age would carry on and complete 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — There are in the parish about 1820 acres impe- 
rial of arable land : about 270 of hill pasture or waste ground ; 
and about 30 under wood. The average rent of the arable land 
is about L. 2 per acre ; but this varies in the majority of cases 
with the price of grain, as a considerable proportion of the rental 
is determined by the fiars of the county. The wages of unmar- 
ried ploughmen are L. 11 per annum and their board. Married men 



DUNBOG. 



215 



receive in money L. 9, a house, a bit of garden-ground, milk and 
meal, 9 bolls of potatoes, and their coals driven from the pit. 

Sheep and Cattle. — There is no particular species of sheep or 
cattle reared in the parish. The tenants buy in sheep, in the 
autumn, to put on the stubbles, and to feed off on turnip during the 
winter and following spring. The sheep are generally Cheviots, 
with a sprinkling of black-faced. This practice is universal, and 
is now carried to a great extent. By the use of bone-dust, turnips 
can now be raised, where previously cultivation was either very dif- 
ficult or altogether impossible. But where turnips can be thus 
raised, the eating them off with sheep thoroughly enriches the 
soil, and secures invariably an abundant after-crop. The cattle 
are very much mixed ; so much, indeed, that it would be no easy 
matter to say what breed predominates. For many years, the old 
Falkland breed of cattle fell into general disrepute. Short-horns 
were introduced ; and in several instances, were and are still rais - 
ed in high perfection. The opinion was, that they fattened more 
easily than the native cattle, and at an earlier age, and therefore 
were a profitable stock to the farmer. This opinion, however, is 
beginning to be questioned. It is now thought by many that the 
old Fife breed have as many good qualities as the short-horns, and 
are a much less hazardous stock. That they feed to as great a 
weight as the short-horns after they are five years old is well 
known ; and eminent judges say, that, by proper attention and care, 
they may be brought to fatten at as early an age. There is, how- 
ever, great difficulty experienced in obtaining pure blood. 

The state of husbandry is very good, as good as any where in 
Scotland. A six-shift rotation is pursued in this neighbourhood, 
viz. summer fallow or potatoes, wheat, green crop, barley, grass, and 
then oats. The great defect is the want of fences. The fields are 
all open and unenclosed. This is a serious hinderance in the way 
of improvement. The land requires rest, for it has been over- 
cropped ; the farmer is most anxious to reap the advantages pro- 
mised by sheep husbandry ; but neither of these objects can be at- 
tained until the land is properly enclosed. 

The leases universally extend to a period of nineteen years ; and 
under the system of farming which has prevailed up to the present 
time, a term of such duration was equally convenient for the land- 
lord and tenant. But now that a great and decided improvement 
in the mode of farming has taken place, and is increasing rapidly 
in all the purely agricultural districts, it will be expedient and 



216 



FIFESHIKE. 



equitable to give a considerable extension to the period of a lease. 
It is on every account desirable that the tenant should enjoy at 
least three, or perhaps four, returns of his rotation. But if by al- 
lowing the fields to lie in grass for two or three years, he extend his 
rotation from five or six, to seven or eight years, he cannot re- 
ceive this advantage unless his lease be for twenty-four years, instead 
of nineteen. No sound objection, as far as we can judge, can be 
offered to this proposed alteration on the part of landlords,— be- 
cause rents being now very generally paid according to the fiars, 
the landlords will always share in any rise that takes place in 
the value of farm produce, and because the land, under the new 
system of resting for three years out of eight, would always be kept 
in the highest order.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Newburgh is the nearest market and post-town, being distant 

about four miles. 

Ecclesiastical Stafe— The church is situated in the centre of the 
parish, and at a convenient distance from the remotest houses. It was 
built in 1 803, and is in excellent repair. It is seated for 200, allowing 
eighteen inches to a seat. The sittings are all free. The manse was 
built in 1792. A considerable addition was made to it fourteen years 
ago. It is both comfortable and commodious. The glebe consists of 
about 5 acres imperial of good land. The stipend is 14 chal- 
ders of barley, bear, meal, and oats ; but nearly L. 70 of it is paid 
in money. There is not a dissenting family in the parish. The. 
farm-servants, with very few exceptions, all belong to the Estabhsh- 
ed church. They change every year, yet there is never above one 
or two individuals among them that are members of any other de- 
nomination, which may be received as a decided proof that the 
whole body of the agricultural population are still attached to the 
Establishment. 

The average number of communicants is 135, which number 
comprehends a good many from the adjoining parishes of Flisk and 
Abdie, who always attend on ordinances in the church of Dunbog. 
The annual amount of collections for the poor do not exceed 



LEUCHARS. 



217 



L. 12. We have contributed liberally to the schemes of the Gene- 
ral Assembly for education in the Highlands of Scotland, and for 
the propagation of the Gospel in India. 

Education. — There is only one school in the parish. The ordi- 
nary branches of instruction are taught. The salary is the maximum. 
The fees are small, and do not produce above L. 15 per annum. 
There is no person in the parish unable to read and write, but very 
many who read and write very ill. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor roll is at present a heavy 
one. We have many aged persons, and two families of orphan 
children. There are 13 in the receipt of a weekly aliment. 
We very seldom give the allowance in money, but authorize the 
tenant under whom the paupers reside, to give as much meal and 
potatoes as will keep them with comfort. Our annual outlay is 
nearly L. 30. Of this sum we have about L. 12 from church col- 
lections, — the rest is drawn from money belonging to the poor. 

Fuel. — The only fuel used in this neighbourhood is coal, which is 
driven from the mouth of the pit. The nearest mines are those 
of Coul and Balbirnie, about nine miles distant. The fuel from 
both is good, and the price is moderate.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. DAVID WATSON, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. . 

Name. — The ancient name of the parish seems to have been 
Lough-yards, which is now changed to Leuchars. The low and 
level grounds, extending for miles to the east and west of the vil- 
lage, were under water for the greater part of the year, and might 
well be considered a loch before the lands were drained. The 
elevated ground in the immediate vicinity might be the yards at- 
tached to the village. According to some, Leuchars is a Celtic word 
and signifies a rushy or marshy flat. Sibbald says, the name is 
" a Locro, Pictorum magnate ejusdem possessore." 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish, from north-east to south-west, 



218 



FIFESHIUE. 



extends 9 miles ; its greatest breadth from north-west to south-east 
is 5 miles. It is bounded by the bay of St Andrews, on the east ; 
the river Eden, on the south ; by the parishes of Dairsie and Logie, 
on the west; by Forgan and Ferry-Port-on-Craig, on the north ; and 
is of a very irregular figure. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general aspect of the parish 
is that of an extensive flat rather bare of wood, for many square 
miles, — not exceeding 15 feet in elevation above the level of the 
sea. As it verges westward, however, the ground rises gradually, 
till it reaches the top of the range of hills which separates it from 
Logie, when its elevation may be about 230 or 300 feet above the 
level of the sea. These hills are a branch of the terminating range 
of the Ochils, and are called Lucklaw, Airdit, and Craigfoodie. Of 
these, the summit of Airdit only is in this parish ; but the whole 
range, of four miles extent, forms a beautiful boundary and a shelter 
to the level ground on the south-east. The land is now well drain- 
ed both by deep and surface draining; and the lighter land, at the 
east and north sides of the parish, is well enclosed for sheep hus- 
bandry, which has prevailed of late to a considerable extent, and 
is found a great improvement for such soils. 

The west division of the parish contains six farms. These are 
on elevated ground, inclining with a gentle slope, and are composed 
of soils consisting of clay, soft loam, and gravel. The soil in which 
gravel abounds, notwithstanding the thorough draining to which it 
has been subjected, retains much of its former spongy and wet cha- 
racter. 

The sea shore is flat and sandy. The tide retires from the shore 
about half a-mile on ebbing. There is no alluvial soil deposited 
by the Eden ; but the sand banks are always on the increase. The 
bar of sand at its mouth is dangerous for shipping ; and, the noise 
with which the motion of the tide over it, is frequently accompanied, 
indicates a coming or retiring storm. 

Hydrographxj.—T\ie river Eden, which forms the southern boun- 
dary for four or five miles, is navigable as far as the Guard bridge. 
Hereisasmallharbour,'which, from its commodious situation, serves 
as the emporium of this part of the country. At spring-tides, ves- 
sels of considerable burden can make their way to it without diffi- 
culty. At the Guard bridge, a few salmon trouts are caught in au- 
tumn. Near the mouth of the river, are mussel beds of considerable 
vilue. These are let by the proprietors for a period of four or five 
years, to a tenant who pays every attention to their cultivation and 



LEUCHARS. 



219 



propagation. These mussel beds furnish bait to many fishers along 
the east coast of Scotland. 

The other streams are the Moultry, which traverses the parish in 
a direction from north to south, discharging itself into the Eden, 
and the Monzie burn, flowing from the west, and joining the Moul- 
try. On both of these streams are meal and barley mills. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There is nothing remarkable as to 
the geology of the parish. The whole of the extensive flat known 
by the name of the Tents moor seems, from the appearance of its 
surface, to have been abandoned by the German Ocean at no very 
remote period. On advancing westward from the Tents moor to 
the Moultry, the character of the soil improves, till we find exten- 
sive beds of strong blue clay. In various parts of the Tents moor, 
frequent bores have been sunk to a considerable depth ; but by 
these nothing has been discovered but the same indurated sand by 
which this vast plain is so uniformly characterized. It is supposed 
that, a good way beneath the surface, a subordinate range of the 
prevaiUng rock of the high ground district to the north-west, which 
is whinstone, runs across the Tents moor in an eastern direction. 
This whinstone affords numerous excellent quarries, and is much 
esteemed both for the purposes of building and road-metalling. 

Lucklaw hill is composed of rocks of the trap formation. Augite 
greenstone, traversed by ill-defined veins of coarse calcareous spar, 
forms one prominent member in its composition, and felspar por- 
phyry another. This felspar porphyry is well exhibited by a cut 
which was made by the proprietor, on the face of the hill, many years 
ago, with a view to quarry it. Quarrying operations are no longer 
conducted, though this rock, from its extreme solidity and durabi- 
lity, cannot fail to be esteemed of considerable importance in an 
economical point of view. 

Within a quarter of a mile of the Eden, on the farm of Brock- 
lay, is a stratum of new red sandstone, which, from the coarseness 
of its texture, and the imperfect consolidation of its component 
parts, is little used as a building material. It is of a brick colour, 
and bears the marks of a rapid deposition from water, with the ma- 
terials of each successive deposit distinctly traceable. Vegetable 
impressions have been discovered, associated with this rock. The 
specimens which have been procured, we believe, are of the fern spe - 
cies ; but those that have been obtained are few. 

Deer's horns have been dug up in the Tents moor. Fossil re- 
mains of oaks of a large species have been found in the alluvial

lands situated round the village. These were found to be in a very 
entire state, and useful for domestic purposes. 

Every variety of soil, from the richest loam and clay, to the 
poorest sand or moorish clay, is found in this parish ; but no marl, 
lime, or coal. This parish seems to have been cultivated from the 
earliest times. Its productiveness is best evidenced by its affording 
teinds to the ministers of other parishes, even to the parish of Dull, 
in Perthshire. 

JYood. — In the north-east part of the parish, where the soil is ex- 
tremely light and sandy, the Scotch pines grow to a considerable 
size. This parish does not abound much in hard wood ; that which 
seems to thrive best, is the ash. Some fine old trees are found 
at Earlshall, Pitlethie, PitcuUo, and Airdit. 

II. — Civil History. 
The Earls of Southesk and the Bruces of Earlshall were the 
oldest proprietors of the greater part of the parish ; but their his- 
tory contains nothing so important as to merit a place in this work. 
The famous Alexander Henderson, who was minister of this pa- 
rish for more than twenty years, is so well known to the public, 
and his life and character so fully delineated in the late work of Dr 
Alton, that any observations of ours upon the history of that re- 
markable individual, would be superfluous. 

, Land-oioners. — The present land-owners are, 1. Colonel Lindsay, 
who has just succeeded to his much lamented father, the Honour- 
able Robert Lindsay, who purchased the estate of Leuchars from 
Sir David Carnegie; 2. Lieutenant- Colonel Long, who purchased 
Earlshall from the late Sir Robert Bruce Henderson ; 3. A. B. 
Stewart, the late purchaser of Airdit; 4. Cheape of Pusk and 
Welfield; 5. The Bank of Scotland ; 6. George Macgill of Kem- 
back, the proprietor of Lucklaw; 7. Russell of Hayston and 
Brocklay; 8. William Lawson of Pitlethie; 9. Mr Pitcairn of 
PitcuUo ; 10. Peter Walker of Muirhead. Four of the proprietors 
only are resident, and farm their own estates. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest register extant of births and 
the session records commence with the year 1665. In the register 
of births, there is a hiatus of seven years, extending from 1699- 
1705. The session minutes consist of three volumes, the first 
reaching from 1666-1737; the second from 1737 to 1762; the 
third from 1762 to the present year. No register of deaths pre- 
vious to 1766. 

Antiquities. — The chief object worthy of the attention of the 



LEUCHARS. 



221 



antiquary is the church, a view of the elevation of the ancient part 
of which, together with a description of its architecture, we are en- 
abled to embody in these pages, through the kindness of John 
M'Kinlay, Esq. Bo-ness, who is well versed in the antiquities of this 
country. This church appears to have been built at three several 
, periods. The eastern division forming the chancel consisted of a 
square building, having a semicircular apsis towards the east, in which 
the altar was placed, and is built in the style usually called Saxon, 
of which it is one of the most entire and interesting specimens to 
be found in Scotland. The second division was tlie original nave 
of the church, having an aisle projecting to the north. This portion 
of the building also is in the Saxon style, but later than the for- 
mer; and the third division is comparatively modern, being pro- 
bably not more ancient than the time of the Reformation. The 
two last divisions have been greatly altered and modernized, and are 
fitted up as the parish church, and, although neat and comfortable 
enough, do not merit any particular description. 

The eastern portion consists of two parts. The apsis or semicir- 
cular recess to the east, for the reception of the altar, is narrower, 
and not quite so high as the body of the chancel. Externally, it is 
of two stages or storeys, the lower one consists of a range of ten 
semicircular arches, with zig-zag or chevron mouldings, resting on 
plain double pillars. Above those arches, there is a band or fillet, and 
resting upon this, is a range of nine smaller arches, supported by 
short pillars, each pair of which are separated by a small intervene 
ing pier. Each of the arches connecting the tops of those pillars 
consists of two rows of stones, the lower one ornamented with the 
zig-zag moulding, and the upper one with the billet moulding. 
The pillars of this upper arcade are placed over the centre of each 
of the lower arches. There are three windows in the upper tier, 
placed in the intervals between the pillars ; they are narrow and 
round topped, and widen internally. At some distance above the 
upper tier of arches, there is a range of corbels carved into gro- 
tesque heads, supporting the upper part of the wall, which projects 
a little. The roof appears, from marks on the gable of the other 
portion of the chancel, to have been a semicone of a pretty high 
pitch,— but this has been removed, together with two courses of 
stone off the walls, to make room for a belfry erected about half a 
century ago, in the degenerate style then in vogue; and in order to 
support this mass of incongruity, a rude arch has been thrown across 
within, which partially blocks up two of the windows, and spoils the 



222 



FIFESHIRE. 



appearance of the groined ceiling. In the inside, the windows are 
decorated with pillars similar to the outside. The roof consists of 
a simple cross rib of three reeds, with two half arches meeting it in 
the centre, and groined between. Those arches spring from short 
pillars supported on projecting corbels, representing heads of ani- 
mals. A lofty arch opened from the apsis into the body of the 
chancel, and a similar one opened from thence into the nave. The 
sides of those arches are each formed of three slender pillars, the 
middle one projecting beyond the others. The arches connecting 
them above are ornamented with the zig-zag and fillet mouldings. 
This portion of the building has two windows to the south, and one 
to the north. They are ornamented on the inside with pillars, and 
rich mouldings from the soffits of the arches. The outside of this 
part of the building, like the apsis, consists of two tiers of arches, 
the lower rests upon four double and two single pillars on each 
front, and the tops of each alternate pillar connected by intersect- 
ing semicircular arches, so that the spaces between each two pil- 
lars have the form of Gothic arches. Over these arches, there is 
a band or fillet, on which is placed an upper range of pillars and 
arches similar to those on the apsis, but the pillars stand directly 
over those of the lower tier. Above this tier of arches, there is a 
range of corbels representing faces, supporting the upper part of 
the wall. The roof is high in the pitch, and the timbers are open 
to the view inside, the body of the chancel not having been arch- 
ed. Ancient gravestones form the pavement, and this portion of 
the building is now little else than a tomb. From the style of ar- 
chitecture, it is probable that this portion of the church was built 
about the year 1100, when the Saxon style prevailed. At or about 
the period of the Reformation, the two windows on the south side 
of the body of the chancel were built up, and two square windows 
with a single stone muUion in each were substituted ; and one of the 
same in the apsis ; and although they are somewhat interesting, as 
showing the degraded style which succeeded the Gothic, it were 
desirable to have them removed, and the original appearance re- 
stored. 

The original nave is probably not much later in date than the chan- 
cel ; but as it only consists of plain dead walls with a single hatched 
fillet, there is not much from which its date can be ascertained. 
From the unbroken appearance of the side walls, there does not ap- 
pear to have been any windows. It was probably lighted by windows 
in the west gable, which is now removed. A wide and lofty arch 



LEUCHARS. 



223 



opens into the aisle, the walls of which were formerly only about half 
their present height, and a similar arch opens into the more modern 
part of the nave, forming together what is now used as the parish 
church. 

Where the parish school now stands, there once was a chapel 
called St Bennet's, of which Sir Thomas Wemyss was chaplain 
at the Reformation. No vestige of it remains ; but many human 
bones are found near the spot inclosed in stone coffins ; which, 
being by no means entire, point to a remote date. To the north 
of the village, there is a curious circular elevation where stood the 
castle of Leuchars. It has all the appearance of having been artifi- 
cially formed, with a moat around it, and a deep well in the centre. 
It occupies about an acre of ground. 

There are three ruins of old mansions of a castellated form, kept 
in partial repair, — these are Earlshall, Pitcullo, and Airdit. Earls- 
hall is an interesting object. Its large, venerable hall, whose roof 
and walls are crowded with crests, inscriptions, &amp;c. is well worthy 
the attention of the antiquary, f 

The most interesting relic of antiquity that has been found in this 
parish is an earthen jar, which was discovered on Craigiehill, in the 
year 1808. This jar was found to contain nearly a hundred silver 
coins in perfect preservation. Unfortunately the jar itself was shiv- 
ered to pieces by the plough, by which it was thrown up. But 
most of the coins were secured by the proprietor, the late Hon. 
Robert Lindsay of Balcarres, where they remain. The coins are 
stamped with the heads of Roman emperors, such as Severus, An- 
toninus, Faustina, &amp;c. 

III. — Population. 
There has been very little variation in the number of inhabit- 
ants in this parish from the earliest times till now, as is the case 
in most agricultural districts. The only change upon the popu- 
lation is that of locality. The Tents moor, which of old used to 
b&amp; studded with turf built cottages, and gardens and crofts attached 
to them, is now, in a great measure, depopulated, from the extensive 
farms which have been formed upon it. Many of the former inha- 
bitants of the moors shifted their quarters to the village, and other 
parts of the parish. 

 anciently a place of strength, and one of the strongholds of the 

iarls ot bite ; dismantled, however, by the English in the fourteenth century. 
iJa  inscribed in the hall show the building to have been founded in 

1546, and finished m 1617.

Character and Habits of the People.— The inhabitants are late- 
ly much improved in point of cleanliness and dress. Their arti- 
cles of diet, which formerly consisted chiefly of potatoes and oat- 
meal, now embrace a greater variety. Instead of the homely ban- 
nock, kneaded at his own hearth, you find the cottager enjoying his 
loaf from the baker, which he accompanies with beer, milk, or tea. 
Pork and rabbit during winter, fish and cockles during summer, 
constitute at once a rich and varied diet. By furnishing manure to 
the neighbouring farmers, the villagers obtain abundant crops of 
potatoes at an easy rate. They get a certain portion of land, m which 
they deposit their own sets, and cultivate and clean the land dunng 
the summer months, which tends much to promote their health and 
enjoyment. Indeed, our villagers are in possession of many privi- 
leges and comforts which are denied to the inhabitants of wealthier 
towns; and, on the whole, they are a contented, industrious, intel- 
ligent, religious, and happy people. The demoralizing practice 
of smucrgling, formerly so extensively prevalent on the shore, has, 
bv the'operation of the excise laws, been abolished for many years. 

' During the last three years, there have been 9 illegitimate 
births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— In this parish agriculture is conducted in the most 
approved style. The deep soils undergo regular rotation by alter- 
nate husbandry. The five or six years' course is observed on the 
loams and deep clays ; the eight years' rotation suits the lighter or 
weaker soils ; by allowing the land to rest in pasture for two, three, 
or more years. On these, turnips are often flaked and eat ofl by 
sheep, which is found a prodigious improvement to the soil. 
Draining of all kinds is universally practised. By the large dram 
cut between the Tay and the Moultry, of 5 miles extent, 20 feet 



LEUCHARS. 



225 



wide, and 12 or 14 feet deep, an immense extent of rich land has 
been gained. Numerous side cuts have been made into it. Tile 
or furrow draining is also practised successfully. The only incon- 
venience from this extensive draining is the great multiplication of 
the grey rat. Inclosing by dikes of stone and lime has gone on 
with great spirit within these twenty years past, and greatly bene- 
fited the lighter soils. 

The introduction of the steam-engine into the thrashing-mills 
on two farms is found a great saving of horse power. 

The steadings are now universally in good condition, and on se- 
veral farms have very excellent accommodation for cattle. There 
is, however, still a want of cottars' houses for farm-servants, which 
obliges the farmer to crowd young ploughmen into bothies, which 
is unfavourable to their improvement in morals. It would perhaps 
remedy the evil, to distribute the young men among the famihes 
of those that are married, and lodge one or two of them with the 
tenant himself, that all may be under some superintendence, and 
be profitably employed at leisure hours. Indeed, the bothy system 
is universally reprobated. The farm roads that are not on the sta- 
tute labour books, are in the v/orst condition, especially in winter. 
This is a subject of loud complaint with those who pay so heavily 
for statute labour, and reap so little benefit from it. 

No. of acres in the parish amounts altogether to about, . 9300 Scotch acres 

under regular cultivation, and not in pasture are 6310 

poor clay, and light land, often in pasture, . 3060 
in plantations, ..... 3qq 
ia roads, yO 

Rent of Land.— Theve are 31 farms beside small feus of 
every variety of soil and size; and 140 ploughs, averaging fifty acres 
for each plough. The average rent of good land is L.'s, ] Os. per acre, 
or rather L. 1, with one-half-boll of wheat, one-half boll barley, and 
one-half boll oats. Many acres are still valued at L. 4 each. Poor 
sods are from L. 1, 10s. to 7s. 6d. per acre, the average value of 
the Tunts moor. The long tract of bents is fit for nothing but har- 
bouring rabbits, a species of stock once in greater repute" but now 
nearly extirpated, on account of its diminished value, and its de- 
predations on the neighbouring crops. About a thousand acres of 
such links may be considered not worth cultivating. The valued 

: rental is L. 10,541 Scots. The allpwed real rental at last valua- 
tion of stipend was L, 13,660, and it is thought that if the farms 
were out of lease, they could not at present bring much beyond 

 that sum. But it is difficult to ascertain the real rental, as there 

FIFE. p 



22G

are nine proprietors who at present farm their own property, and 
the rents of the farms in lease vary every year, as they are paid 

by the fiars. , , rr. 

The Clydesdale horse is most in use here, and the leeswater 
breed of cattle, crossed with the Fife, is in greatest repute. We 
have every variety of sheep,— Leicester, Cheviot, and_Highland. 
The last are fed with turnip in winter, for the butcher. The two 
first are kept for lambing in spring. 

Produce.— The average amount and value of gross produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : 



L. 22000 



Produce ofgrain from ''ao" acres at L. 7 per acre, - - 
potatoes and turnips at L. 7 per acre, - - 
hay at 7d per stone, - - " " " 
pasture land, good and bad, - - " 
fisheries, &amp;c. - - " " " 

L. 37.300 

Little flax or hay is raised for the market. 

Manufactures.— Besides the employment of about 30 families as 
masons, carpenters, smiths, tailors, shoemakers in this parish, there 
are a great many engaged in weaving. Independent of the wea- 
vers who are employed in towelling and sheeting for home con- 
sumption, there are about two-thirds who work coarse linens, chief- 
ly Dowlas, Osnaburghs, and Silesias for the Cupar and Dundee 
manufacturers, who export them for America and the West In- 
dies. Many of our young females take to the loom during the 
winter months, but in summer they prefer out -door work. Since 
the introduction of machinery, hand-spinning has almost ceased to 
be a branch of industry. A spindle of yarn will occupy a woman 
three days and a-half, for which she will earn is. ; a spmdle of 
shirting yarn will yield double that sum. The number of looms 
altogether in this parish may be estimated at about 130. Our 
weavers are most industrious, working many of them ten hours, 
sometimes even more. Before the salutary change which the weav- 
ing interest has lately experienced, the gain per day at the loom, 
with the deduction of 4d. for expenses, did not exceed 8d. Now, 
however, provisions being moderate, their labour commands a fair 
remuneration. 

An extensive distillery wa erected at Seggie, upon the river 
Eden, twenty-six years ago, and has, with the exception of this year, 
been all along in successful operation, distilling about 100 quar- 
ters of grain per day, during the cool season. Several scores of 



LEUCHAHS. 227 

cattle were annually fed within the premises. It yielded constant 
employment to about 100 workmen, who received ample wages. 
The advantages of such an establishment to the farmers in the 
neighbourhood have been fully appreciated ; as a ready market 
was afforded them for the disposal of grain. 

A saw-mill, barley, lint, and two oatmeal-mills are in the parish. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toicns.— The market-towns of Cupar, St Andrews, and 
Dundee, situated at seven, six, and eight miles' distance respec- 
tively, with daily communication by post and carriers, afford every 
advantage to the parish. for buying and seUing. 

Filiates.— The two villages,— Leuchars, with 614 inhabitants, 
and BalmuUo, a straggling village on the Dundee public road, with 
250 inhabitants,— are dry, well-aired, well-watered, and healthy vil- 
lages, with excellent turnpikes through them. 

Means of Communication.—The soil being dry, the roads' 
throughout the parish are kept without difficulty in the best repair. 
There are fourteen miles of turnpike, and nearly ten of statute la- 
bour roads. Three four-horse coaches have continued to pass 
through the parish daily from Edinburgh to Aberdeen for many 
years, but their number is now, reduced to two. Coaches run twice 
a-week by way of Leuchars between Dundee and Qt Andrews. 
Besides the Guard-bridge pier already mentioned, there is another 
at Seggie, which is chiefly for the convenience of the distillery. 

Ecclesiastical State.~The parish church, situate in the village 
of Leuchars, is distant from the east end of the parish about four 
miles, and from the western extremity nearly six miles. A more 
centrical position for the bulk of the population would be about 
a mile farther to the westward. It is a commodious, well-light- 
ed, and comfortable building, accommodating 850 sitters. There 
are not. more than a dozen free sittings in the church ; Is. 3d. 
only is the average of each seat per annum. A deep gallery, 
holding 150 persons, erected out of the poor's funds, accommo- 
dates the householders at prices graduating from 2s. 6d. to 6d. each. 
As many more are also supplied with seats, at a small rent, by the 
principal heritors, after the tenants and their cottars are provided 

The manse was built in 1806, and is still considered a respect- 
able and well-finished house, and pleasantly situated. The 
glebe, together with the garden, contains about 9 Scots acres of 
such land as would rent at about L. 4 per acre. The stipend al- 
located m 1820 amounts to 16 chalders, which, for the last four 



228 



FIFESIIIRE. 



years averages at L. 218 Sterling, with L. 8, 6s 8d. for commu- 
nion elements. 

There is only one church of Original Seceders, stationed at 
BalmuUo, with about 70 joined members, and a respectable minis- 
ter, whose stipend is of small and variable amount. But to supply 
the deficiency, his supporters have built him a small manse and a 
few offices, and granted two acres for a cow's grass. 

The attendance at the Estabhshed Church throughout the year 
is steady and full. The number of persons attending church may 
be estimated at 600 generally. The number of communicants 
average 700. Some are induced, from convenience, usually to at- 
tend the neighbouring parish churches. The number of dissen- 
ters throughout the parish is perhaps not more than 100. 

A society has been established for twelve years for promoting 
religious purposes at home and abroad, which has contributed 
about L. 40 annually. However, it is now fast declining. 

The collections throughout the year at the church door average 
L. 23, and have varied little in amount for the last twenty-five 
years. The farmers seem to prefer giving their charity to their 
cottars, with whom they are more immediately connected. The 
villagers assist their poorer neighbours in a similar way, without 
troubling the kirk-session, by rendering it the medium of com- 
munication. A mistaken idea prevails among many that the ses- 
sion funds are so rich as to require no addition to them. 

Education. — There are four schools ; one parochial and three 
unendowed. Of the latter, one is for teaching sewing chiefly, and 
English reading,— is supported by the Balcarres family, and the 
fees of the scholars. The remaining two are supported by fees 
alone. The branches taught in the parish school are, English, 
Latin, Greek, arithmetic, practical mathematics, writing, gram- 
mar, and geography. At present there are no Latin or Greek 
scholars. The amount of fees in the parochial school is L. 20 • 
do. in the Balmullo school at present L. 40 nearly. The amount 
of fees in the other two varies much. The parish schoolmaste 
-now enjoys the maximum salary; and interest of 2000 merks Scots, 
also a glebe of two acres, bequeathed by the Rev. A. Henderson. 
The children generally attend only two or three quarters in thd 
year, and pay 6s., 7s. 6d., or at most 9s. per annum each, but 
often pay weekly. No person is known to be incapable of read- 
ing, and very few who cannot write after nine years of age. There 



LEUCIIARS. 



229 



is also a flourishing Sabbath school, which has subsisted for twen- 
ty years. No additional school is needed. 

Literature. — A parish library was lately instituted by private 
subscription in Leuchars, containing some hundred volumes of va- 
rious useful and entertaining reading, calculated to promote men- 
. tal and moral improvement. 

Poor. — The multiplication of paupers is owing to the growing 
impression, that heritors are bound to support the poor. Dilapida- 
tions are annually making on the lying capital, and are in the course 
of annihilating it. The number now receiving aid regularly from 
the kirk-session is 30 persons ; occasionally, 36. The average 
number for a few years past is about 25. Average of aliment per 
week for each is Is. 3d. The annual amount of charitable contri- 
butions is L. 75; collections, L.23; land-rent, L.24; church seat 
rents, L. 12; interest, mortcloth, hearse, L. 11. 

Fairs. — Two fairs are held at Leuchars each year for the sale 
of cattle and small wares. But of late years they have been little 
frequented. 

Alehouses. — There are 6 alehouses in the village of Leuchars, 
and other 6 along the great roads of the parish. 

Fuel. — Coal is brought from Newcastle and the Frith of Forth 
by sea ; also by la.nd from the coal districts in the county. Wood 
is much used as a burning material by the villagers, who enjoy the 
valuable privilege of carrying home the debris from the plantation 
on Colonel Lindsay's estate. 

Advantage is often taken of the savings banks in the neighbour- 
ing towns.' 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since last survey, the greatest change is the enlargement of our 
villages, and the depopulation of the country parts of the parish, 
which has not been attended with an improvement in the morals of 
the people in general.

ing to one etymology, signifying " the mouth of the Keith," the 
rivulet which at this place falls into the sea; according to another, 
" the confluence of the slow misty water with the sea according 
to a third, " the entrance of the water into the sea between little 
hills," — with which last, appearances best correspond. Rosyth, 
formerly Rosaith, is said to be also from the Gaelic, and to de- 
note a tongue of land extending into the water. 

The parishes were united in 1636. The deed of annexation be- 
ing lost, nothing certain is known about the terms of the union; 
but it is said that the incumbent was to preach for two Sabbaths 
successively in Inverkeithing, but on every third Sabbath at Ro- 
syth. 

Topographical Appearances. — This parish is of a very irregular 
figure. The Ferry hills form an indented, and somewhat circular pe- 
ninsula, upward of a mile in diameter, with a neck about 300 
yards broad. From this neck of land, the parish extends west- 
ward upwards of three miles, including the harbour of Bruce- 
haven, and a small portion of Limekilns, and runs northward to 
Crossgates, A\ miles, and eastward to Letham hill, about 1 mile. 
Its general figure, exclusive of the Ferry hills, resembles two 
arms stretched out nearly at right angles, embracing a part of the 
parish of Dunfermline, and nowhere much exceeding a mile in 
breadth. At one place, the parish of Dunfermline approaches with- 
in half a mile of the burgh. The Frith of Forth is the southern and

part of the eastern boundary of the parish ; it adjoins to Dalgety 
on the east ; and is next to Dunfermline on the north and west. 

This parish may be viewed as consisting, in the south part, of 
a range of greenstone hills, not exceeding 300 feet above the level 
of the sea ; of a rising ground with a southerly exposure in the 
north part; and of a valley between, running east and west. 
There are about six miles of sea coast ; a small portion sandy, an- 
other rocky and rather high ; the remainder intermingled mud and 
rock. The bay of St Margaret's Hope, the islet of Inch Garvie, 
and the rock Bimar, which last has often been the cause of ship- 
wreck, are within the parish. 

Meteorology. — More rain falls, a few miles inland, either to the 
north or south than here, — it being observed that the clouds, mov- 
ing towards the Frith before a westerly wind, divide about Stir- 
ling, and keep the higher range of country on both sides of the 
estuary, leaving the lower grounds near it comparatively free. Some- 
times the rain is so strongly electrical, that the common electrome- 
ter for rain will charge a coated jar very smartly in a few minutes. 

Hydrography. — The adjoining Frith has strong currents during 
the flowing and ebbing of the tides, with many eddies and counter- 
currents, particularly near the Feiry, where it is about a mile and 
a half only broad. Between Inch Garvie and the north side, the 
greatest depth is about 40 fathoms ; south of that rock it is not 
more than 22. Near Bimar, there is one point where it is said to 
be upwards of 50 ; but a mile farther up it does not exceed 11, 
with a bank in the middle on which there is still shoaler water. 

There is no submarine moss known to exist on the shores of 
the parish, though frequently these are covered to a considerable 
depth, with the moss thrown into the water at Blair Drummond, 
and floated down with the ebbing tide. There is, however, a con- 
siderable concretion of the sea sand going on in several places, 
forming flat reefs, some of them covered with sea-weed, and not 
much softer than the sandstone rock. 

The water of the springs in this neighbourhood is generally im- 
pure, with a few exceptions, — carbonate of lime, and in the upper 
part of the parish, iron, being the characteristic contaminating sub- 
stances. The composition of one of them may be seen in Jame- 
son's Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for April 1829, There 
are none of these springs of note or considerable size, and most of 
them fail in dry weather. The temperature of such of them as 
have been tried is 47° or 48° F. Two burns or streamlets run 
through the parish, unite and fall into the harbour.

Geology. — With the slight exceptions of a few hill tops and 
steep faces, almost the whole of the parish is in a high state of 
cultivation. In the southern part, the soil is a decomposed green- 
stone, light on the eminences, but very fertile. More in the in- 
terior, it is clayey or sandy, having chiefly sandstone for its sub- 
stratum, but still excellent in quality. On the higher grounds in 
the north of the parish, it consists of a ferruginous sand or clay, 
or of moss, very poor, and not susceptible of much improvement, 
the effect of labour and manure upon it being in a great measure 
destroyed by the first wet season. There is a good deal of al- 
luvial soil on the banks of the streamlets running through the pa- 
rish, and in some places near the sea, a few acres of deposits of 
sand or clay. 

From the state of cultivation in which the parish is, there are 
often, in the interior part of it, no exposures of the subjacent strata 
for spaces of a square mile together. There are, however, some 
very good sections along the east and south-west sides of it, where 
it is washed by the sea ; on the north-east, where it is bounded by 
a rivulet with steep banks ; and in several quarries. 

The stratified rocks are wholly of the coal formation of the 
secondary series, in many places broken through, distorted and 
overlaid by various modifications of trap rock, usually greenstone. 

In the north part of the parish coal exists, but it crops out 
about a mile north of the town, and, in the greater part of the 
parish, the strata underly the coal, and consist of the mountain 
limestone, sandstone, slate-clay, clay-ironstone, bituminous shale, 
and a stratified whitish slate-clay or marl ; these being deeply 
buried in many places beneath the trap rocks, with alluvial matter, 
chiefly clay. The small islands and rocks in the Frith, which are 
in the parish, are wholly of greenstone. 

The stratified rocks, in the southern part of the parish particu- 
larly, bear the marks of having been acted on by a disturbing force 
producing disruption of the strata, and inclination of them in va- 
rious directions, this inclination often changing abruptly within very 
short distances. This disturbing force appears to have been inti- 
mately connected with the masses of trap rock which penetrate 
the strata in many places, and it has generally acted by depres- 
sing the strata, and causing them to dip all round towards the cen- 
tre of the mass of greenstone, in very few instances by upraising 
them, and giving them a dip away from it. 

Few simple minerals are contained in he rocks of this neigh-

boui-hood. Quartz crystals, some of them purple, steatite, sul- 
phate of barytes, felspar, and some zeolites, are found in the green- 
stone ; calcareous spar both in the greenstone and limestone ; and 
pyrites is abundant in the ironstone, slate-clay, greenstone and 
limestone. Galena and flinty slate also exist, and boulders of chlo- 
rite and mica slate, sometimes of large size, are not uncommon, 

though within these few years, four of the largest of these have 
been blasted to pieces for building materials, or for making drains. 
The greenstone rocks frequently assume the columnar form. 

Zooloff7j.—The most noted wild quadrupeds are the hare, badger, 
fox, otter, weasel, but all very scarce. Among the birds may be e°nu- 
merated the pheasant, partridge, sparrow-hawk, kite, a blue-look- 
ing hawk, the common and a white owl, raven, carrion-crow, rook, 
wood-pigeon, thrush and blackbird, both of which are much on the 
increase, fieldfare, redwing, stonechat, snow and common buntino-, 
three species of linnet, whin-sparrow, reed-sparrow, several of the 
creepers, jay, magpie, blue and yellow wagtails, chaffinch, wren, 
&amp;c.; wood-cock, snipe; green, gray and golden plovers; curlew, 
whimbrel, brown dotterel, and several more of the scolopax 
tribe ; several species of gull, the black-headed tern, pied oys- 
ter catcher, several species of duck, the teal, w'idgeon, auks, the 
plane and hooked-beaked marrots, the cormorant, heron, 'wild 
goose, swan, solan-goose, and, though very rarely, a large species of 
Anas with a red mark of a horse-shoe form on the breast. Most of 
these birds desert the place in summer and return in winter. Of 
amphibia and fishes, there are two species of seals, the porpoise 
the finner, so named from its long dorsal fin, the bottle-nosed 
whale, a much larger species of whale, salmon, sea-trout, cod, cod- 
ling, podley, seathe, flounder, skate, herring, white-bait &amp;c 
The common cuttle is frequently thrown upon the beach, and oc- 
casionally that deformed fish the Lophius of a large size. A large 
Opah was thrown on shore on the 23d July 1835, but it was 
cut into several pieces, as the first step in the process of frying, 
before it was seen by any one .who knew its value. This exceed 
ingly rare and most beautiful fish must be seen in the recent state, 
before any conception can be formed of its superb appearance

as an mgredient in rennet for curdling milk ; St John's wort Hy-

by asthmatic people, instead of tobacco, it is said, with considerable 
benefit; and infusion of agrimony is a favourite beverage with some 
old persons, instead of tea. 

From the high state of cultivation in which the parish is, it 
cannot well be ascertained what plants are attached to certain soils, 
excepting the well known distinctions of aquatic, bog, and rock 
plants. The rarer plants are usually found in the greenstone soil, 
but in general the plants do not affect soils so much as localities ; 
a plant being often abundant in one spot, while in another, under 
exactly similar circumstances, not a particle of it is to be seen. 

There are few plantations of trees, and these but of very small 
extent. When young these contain principally larch and fir, which, 
as they grow up, are thinned out to make room for the elm, oak, 
ash, and beech, planted along with them. The only trees appa- 
rently indigenous are a few alder and willow bushes on the banks 
of the streamlets. 

11, — Civil History. 
5„,./j._Inverkeithing is a Royal Burgh of a very ancientdate. It 
has a charter from William the Lion, confirming another still older ; 
and James VL, by one dated 1598, recognizes the privileges be- 
stowed by former monarchs, and declares its rights of custom, &amp;c. 
to extend from the water of Leven on the east, to that of Devon 
on the west, and as far north as Kinross. Mostof these have been sold 
or disposed of; but there are still retained th duties at the markets 
held at Kinross and Tulliebole, and the customs at North Ferry 
passage- Even Edinburgh at one time paid a triflmg acknow- 
ledgment of superiority for some parts of the Calton-hill, but it 
was bought up or fell into desuetude. According to the first print- 
ed return of the treasurer under the new regulations of burghs, 
« the funds, property, and effects" of the burgh are valued at 
L. 7437, 10s. 5d. exclusive of the town-house, jail, and "other 
property," and the debts at L. 2029. The burgh affairs are at 
present managed by a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, a

treusurer, and nine councillors. The constituency of the burgh 
for parliamentary elections is about 57 ; for the election of 
town-councillors, about 26. It sends a Member to Parliament 
along with Culross, Queensferry, Stirling, and Dunfermline. 

By a grant from Queen Mary and Henry Darnley, the ancient 
family of Henderson of Fordel, having a part of their estate within 
the parish, held the office of hereditary provost and sheriff; but 
this right was never exercised. In the ridings of the Scottish 
Parliament, the provost was entitled to ride next to the provost of 
Edinburgh. The Magistrates had the power of pit and gallows 
within their jurisdiction, that is, of inflicting the punishment of 
drowning or hanging, — in testimony of which, a rising ground fac- 
ing the town, still bears the name of the Gallow-bank, and there is 
still in it a Gallow-tower. The court of four burghs, authorized 
by James III. to draw up a set of mercantile regulations, had their 
sittings here ; and before the convention of burghs was appointed 
to be held at Edinburgh, Inverkeithing was the usual place of its 
meeting. The last assemblage of the Ciddees took place in the 
church. 

Some battles have been fought here, the last in 1651, by Crom- 
well's troops against the Scots. There is a tradition that, in the 
reign of Alexander III. the Jews proposed to establish a fortified 
commercial city on the Ferry hills, but the design somehow mis- 
gave. A document confirmatory of this is said to exist in one of 
the libraries or pubhc offices in Edinburgh. St Margaret's Hope 
is so called, because it was the place where Margaret, who after- 
wards became Queen of Malcolm HI, landed during a storm in 
her flight from England. The adjacent ferry is also named from 
her, Buchanan calls it Margaritse Portus, supposed to be from 
her frequently using it in her passage to or from the palace at 
Dunfermline. 

Ferrtj.—ki this ferry, is a flourishing village inhabited by the boat- 
men, principally, and much resorted to in summer, as sea-bathing 
quarters. The piers are unrivalled, and there is an elegant and com- 
modious mn, lately built. In old times, this ferry was subject to 
the Abbots of Dunfermline, who drew the fortieth penny of pas- 
sage money to repair their Quair, and also one-fourth to supply 
boats. The present superior of whom the ground of the village 
IS feued, ,s the Marquis of Tweeddale. Of later years, the right 
ot lerry belonged to neighbouring proprietors, the Earl of Rose-

bery, Dundas of Dundas, &amp;c. to whom a rent was paid, but up- 
wards of twenty years ago, it was vested by act of Parhament in 
trustees. The rent, under this act, once amounted to L. 2300, 
but now it yields about L. 1500 only. The currents of the tide 
here are so peculiar, that, as was proved upon trial when an at- 
tempt was made about the beginning of the century to turn off the 
old boatmen, no sailor, unless brought up upon the passage, can 
navigate the boats without much delay and risk. 

At one time, a visionary project of a tunnel beneath the Frith 
a little way above the ferry, was entertained ; and more lately, 
another of a chain bridge across it, having Inch Garvie in the 
middle for an intermediate step. There is at the ferry a battery, at 
present dismantled, erected after the visit of Paul Jones. 

Eminent Men— The settlement of the last incumbent of this 
parish is a conspicuous event in the history of the church. It took 
place in 1752, and occasioned the deposition of Mr Gillespie, mi- 
nister of Carnock, on account of his refusal to attend the meetings 
of presbytery held for that purpose. This was the origin of the 
Relief church. The parish has produced no eminent men, unless 
Admiral Greig, who rose to the chief command of the Russian 
navy, and died in 1 788, is to be accounted one. 

Land-owners.— The valued rent is L. 6866, 16s. lOd. Scots 
money, and the proprietors are rated as follows : Earl of Hopetoun, 
L. 2268 ; Sir Robert Preston's Heirs, L. 1947, 19s. 4d. ; Sir Philip 
C. H. Durham, G. C. B., L. 750, 16s. 8d. ; Rev. John Kellock

without blanks, from 1676 to the present date. The register of 
baptisms and marriages also extends from 1676 to the present 
date, though from 1676 to 1698, in the same books with the ses- 
sion minutes, and intermixed with them as they occurred, and with 
the exception of a blank from 1711 to 1748, caused by the loss 
of a book, which, according to an entry in the session minutes 
about 1755, was taken to London as evidence in a law-suit about 
1750, and never returned. There is a register of burials from 
1702 to 1708, and for 1710, and of testimonials given and re- 
ceived from 1701 to 1711. 

Antiquities. — On the top of Letham hill, there is what is said to 
be the remains of a Druidical temple. To uninitiated eyes, it ap- 
pears to be a few blocks of greenstone, somewhat circularly arranged 
on the top of a greenstone hill, where such loose fragments of the 
rock below are to be expected. In the north part of the parish, 
there is a stone 10 feet high, 2 broad, and 1 thick, with rude 
figures of men and horses cut upon it, but now much defaced, sup- 
posed to be a Danish monument. Situated on a small rock, con- 
nected by a causeway with the main-land, stands the Castle of Ro- 
sy th, noticed in the novel of the Abbot. It is a ruinous square tower, 
forming the north-east angle of what must have been a pretty large 
square of buildings. Over the gateway is a mouldered armorial 
bearing, surmounted by a crown, and M. R. 1561. On the stone 
bars of the great windows of the hall, which are evidently much 
more recent than the original loop-holes, is " F  S" and M  N" 

of persons rebuked before the congregation for swearing, drunkenness, stealing, for 
not attending public worship, for being out of doors unnecessarily, or carrying water 
on the Sabbath, for ferrying people across on the Sabbath without an order from the 
minister, for abusive language or calling names, very frequently women for scolding, 
once, a man for cursing and striking his wife, and another for consulting a " wiz. 
ard." An offender, in addition to the usual censures and fine, is ordered to learn 
to read within a year, under penalty of censure, if he shall be found " deficient in 
learning." According to order of the Lord Ordinary, there is, in 1701, a guardian 
of morality appointed in the parish, to put tlie laws in execution against immorality 
and profaneness, and there appears to have been a strict system of espionage esta- 
blished in regard to these. 

In 1702, there is a named list of the communicants, chiefly females, amounting to 
seventy-eight in all, and a few years after, a named list of elders, amounting to nine- 
teen. During this period it is customary to mark in the minutes the name of any 
stranger who may have preached, and very often the subject of his sermon. Even 
on solemn occasions, decorum was evidently not very strictly observed in those days, 
as at every sacrament there is a regular entry of a sum of money paid to the town 
officers " for keeping ofl=" tlie thronge." Many irregular marriages are also recorded. 

About 1720, the parish seems to have been in a sad state so far as morality was 
concerned, and also in the years preceding 1745, both periods of great political ex- 
citement, Offenders during the time between these dates were also exceedingly re- 
fractory and contumacious, and there appear to be good grounds for concluding that 
the present generation and their fathers have improved very much upon their ances- 
tors ni those days, at least in sobriety and decency of behaviour.

" Anno 1639." Upon the south side of the Castle near the door 
is this inscription : — 

IN DEV TYM DRAW YIS COUD YE BEL TO CLINK, 
QVHAIS MERY VOCE VARNIS TO MEAT AND DRINK. 

There appear to be the remains of a four gun battery on the side 
of the rock next the sea. This Castle is said by Sir Robert Sibbald 
to have been the seat of Stewart of Rosyth or Durisdeer, a descend- 
ant of James Stewart, brother to Walter, the great Steward of 
Scotland, and father of Robert II. There is a tradition that the 
mother of Oliver Cromwell was born in it, and that the Protector 
visited it when he commanded the army in Scotland. It is 
now the property of the Earl of Hopetoun. At the place of 
encampment of Cromwell's troops on the Ferry hills, swords 
and English coins have been dug up, and cannon shot, almost 
consumed by rust, have been found near the field of battle. In 
the North Ferry, there was once a Roman Catholic chapel, found- 
ed by Robert I., which was a dependency of the Abbey of Dun- 
fermline, and subsisted till destroyed by the English in 1651. Its 
ruins still remain, and the burial ground is still in use. Between 
the ferries is Inch Garvie, on which Sir Archibald Dundas of that 
Ilk obtained from James IV. leave to build a castle, with import- 
ant privileges. It was anciently fortified, and used as a state pri- 
son, and was repaired and mounted with cannon during the late 
war. At present, it is abandoned. Besides this building, there is 
on the west end of the rock, a ruined round tower or redoubt, and 
on the east end, what is said to be the remains of a battery,— ac- 
cording to tradition, both erected by Cromwell's soldiers. In the 
burgh there are still houses -pointed out as the town residences of 
the Rosebery and Fordel families, and it is asserted that there was 
even here a palace of David 1. An old tenement, named " the 
Inns," is said to have been the residence of Annabella Drummond 
queen of Robert III. By a charter from her husband, the magis- 
trates were to pay to her a hundred shillings a year at the feast of 
Pentecost. She"died here in 1403. The house is exempted from 
burgh jurisdiction, though in the middle of the town, and is said 
to contain, among other conveniences, a subterraneous passage to 
the sea. Numerous vaults and ruins are near it, and the founda- 
tions of the " chapel" were lately dug up. These are supposed 
to have belonged either to the Franciscans or Dominicans, both 
of whom had once monasteries in the place. When the late church 
was repaired in 1806, there was found a font made of fine sand- 
stone, which has been placed in the porch of the present church. 



INVERKEITIIING. 241 

Its form is hexagonal, the extreme breadth being a little more 
than three feet, and, with its pedestal, it is about four feet high. 
The bowl of it is a sort of hemisphere, two feet broad, and one deep, 
with a hole of about an inch diameter, pierced through the bottom. 
It had been carefully buried and surrounded with straw, the remains 
of which were still beside it, and it contained within the bowl of 
it a quantity of human bones, probably relics, and an ink-glass. 
The six angles of it are wrought into a kind of ornamental pillar, 
and on every one of the six faces, there is the bust of an angel 
with expanded wings, having on its breast, and supported by its 
hands, a shield of a triangular form with curved outlines. These 
shields contain ancient armorial bearings. By persons skilled in 
heraldry, these are said to be the arms of Scotland j those of 
David Bruce and Margaret Logie, his queen, or of Robert III. and 
Annabella Drummond, who were probably reigning when the 
font was made ; those of Gourlay of Kincraig ; those of Alderston, 
the heiress of which married the laird of Kincraig of that time' 
being, or of a Stuart Rosyth, a Clerk, a Lindsay, &amp;c.— probably 
those of Lowis of Menar, or of Loren of Harwood, or of a Fowlis, 
—the arms of Melville, old Lords of Melville in Fifeshire, or of 
Craigie of Craigiehall. The difficulty of fixing some of these more 
precisely arises from the bearings not being coloured or hatched to 
represent colouring. 

The communion cups, dated 1643, are of rather curious form 
oeing narrow and deep, with a long stalk and foot like a wine 
glass. The workmanship is rude, and they have been made in 
three pieces, and roughly soldered together.- What is remark- 
able, as shewing the state of the arts at the time, is, that there 
is a border round the foot, which appears to have been a ribband 
of metal, figured in a cress, or chased in a rolling machine, then 
turned round till the ends met, and the ring thus made rudely 
soldered to the foot of the cup, in the same manner as chased 
plate brass articles are done in the present day. The silver is 
whiter and brighter than the most of modern plate. 
_ Modern Buildings.~The town is beautifully situated on a ris- 
ing ground immediately above a small bay adjoining the Frith, with 
a south exposure. It consists of a main street, and a smaller one 
branching off it, besides some wynds. There have been many 
houses built or rebuilt within the last twenty years, so that the place 
has been considerably extended and improved. It contains a new 
Church, replacing thatwhich was burnt in 1825, a new school-house,

and a grain stock-market, all of most handsome appearance, and a 
curious and rather loftv stone pillar at the cross ; also a town-house, 
and a Meeting-house belonging to the United Associate Synod. 
There is a building intended for a Lazaretle between Inverkeithing 
and the Ferry, which, however, had been httle used for a dozen ot 
years past, and was sold last year by Government for a trifling sum, 
having a heavy feu-duty upon it,-the frigate Dartmouth, stationed 
in St Margaret's Hope, being now employed for the quarantine 
service in its stead. The buildings in this neighbourhood are ot 
white sandstone or greenstone.

By the Government census . - jg' 2400 

■ ■ ■ 182l' 2512 

■ . 1831, 3189 
Of this last return, 1569 are males, and 1620 females. 

The number residing in the burgh is 2020, being 978 males, 
and 1042 females ; in the village of North Ferry, 434, being 203 
males, and 231 females ; in that of HiUend, 279, being 146 males, 
and 133 females ; and in the country part of the parish, 458, be- 
ing 243 males, and 215 females. 

The increase in the number of parishioners between 1821 and 
1831 is 677. This great increase may be partly accounted tor 
bv the establishment of a large distillery between these periods, 
but it arose principally from a large influx of labourers employed 
about J 831, to work in the greenstone quarries supplying materi- 
als for the extension of Leith pier, and the erection of the new 
bridge at Stirling. These quarries being abandoned upon the com- 
pletion of the works, the labourers and their families have gone 
elsewhere, and it is supposed that the population is not now so nu- 

merous as in 1831. „ . , , • , i 

The number of families was in 1831, 712, of inhabited houses 
438, and of other houses, 12. The average number of a family 

nearly 4i. -j- • 

There are two persons only of independent fortune residing in 
the parish, and one of them is but a very small proprietor in it. 
There are no noblemen resident, and but one of the larger heri- 
tors. The proprietors of lands in the parish of more than L. 50 
rental, are 1 1 in number. 

IV. — Industry. 
There are 25 occupiers of land, employing sixty-eight labourers 



INVERKEITHING. 



243 



or servants, and there are 282 males engaged as retail-dealers, or 
in handicraft trades, either as masters or workmen. 

Agriculture. — From the number of heritors in the parish, and 
the accurate measurement of many of the lands being unknown, 
and also from the many subdivisions of lands, nothing approach- 
mg even to a good approximation of the number of acres in it could 
be obtained without actual admeasurement, or a very great degree of 
trouble in collecting information, often inaccurate. It may be stated, 
however, in general, that almost every piece of ground capable of cul'- 
tivation is under the plough; that there is but a very small propor- 
tion of wood, and that chiefly young ; and that there is no pasture ex- 
ceptmg a small quantity on the steepest acclivities of the hills. There 
are no commons. The lowest rent of land in the parish is L. J , 5s, 
the highest approaches L. 4, per acre ; but as many of the rents 
are partly in grain, convertible at the fiars' prices, they are of 
course variable. The average rent is nearer the higher than the low- 
er rate. From the vicinity to Edinburgh, the rate of labour, and the 
prices of raw produce and manufactures, are regulated by the 
prices there. The husbandry follows different systems of rota- 
tion. The crops raised are, wheat, barley, oats, beans and pease, 
potatoes, hay, turnips. Much waste land from moss has, of late 
years, been reclaimed in the upper part of the parish, and there 
has been a great deal of draining, some of it tile, but the most of 
the fiirmers prefer stones, as better, and also more economical. 
A good many sloop loads of manure are imported from Leith 
The leases are almost, without exception, for nineteen years. Many 
of the farm buildings have lately been erected in the most com- 
modious style; they are almost all good, and the fields are well 
enclosed with thorn hedges chiefly, though sometimes with stone 
walls. 

Quarries.-GveBustoue for building, paving, and -road-making, 
IS quarried in several places, and often sent off by sea. A good 
many years ago, great quantities were shipped from the Ferry hills 
tor paving the streets of London ; but the granite of Aberdeen is 
now preferred for that purpose. Sandstone is also quarried in two 
places, chiefly for exportation coastwise, and limestone in several 
ior home consumption, or sending to a distance by sea. These are 
wrought by the aid of gunpowder, wedges, and levers,— the work- 
men being particular in keeping a face upon the quarry. There 
are no mines. There are no coal-pits, though there are many 
closely adjoining in the neighbouring parishes. 



244 FIFESHIRE. 



Fisheries.— The herring fishery in winter was once of great im- 
portance, but for several years back it has been all but annihilat- 
ed. There is a very trifling stake-net salmon fishery. 

Produce.— 'o estimate of the quantity of raw produce raised 
in the parish can be given, for the reasons mentioned above. 

Manufactures.— There is a large distillery in which whisky is 
made, both for the English and home markets, by Coffey's pa- 
tent steam apparatus. There are also two founderies in the parish, 
where large articles are cast, and steam-engines and other machi- 
nery made. There is a tan-work, a ship-building yard, a salt-work, 
a magnesia manufactory, and a brick-work, where very excellent 
fire-bricks are made, and also chimney cans of elegant patterns, 
and other ornamental work, exactly resembhng a fine freestone. 
A mill driven by steam has also been erected for crushing bones 
for agricultural purposes. These bones are chiefly imported from 
abroad, and are exported when ground down to supply the con- 
sumption of the east coast of Scotland,-little of them being used 
in the district. There are two mills for making meal and flour, 
and a barley mill. A considerable number of the usual tradesmen 
reside in the parish, and also some weavers employed by the da- 
mask table cloth-manufacturers of Dunfermline. The distillery 
employs about 80 men when in operation, the two founderies 
from 40 to 50, and there are a considerable number of carpenters 
in the building yard. The usual time of working is ten hours a 
dav the employments are healthy and the payment good. 

Navination.-There are twenty vessels of from 20 to 100 tons 
burden belonging to the port, employed chiefly in the coasting 
trade A considerable number of foreign and English vessels 
load coal here, and some occasionally bring bark, timber, and bones 
to be ground down for manure. 

v.— Parochial Economy. . 
There is in this parish, the burgh of the same name, having, 
as before stated, a population of 2020. It has not much trade, 
the coal and stone shipped here being brought from the interior 
parts The distillery is carried on by a company. The whisky 
made is chiefly sent to the London market. Fire-bricks, and a ht- 
tle magnesia are also exported ; but there are no import or export 
merchants in the proper sense of the word. There are two villa- 
p-es. North Ferry and Hillend. . 

Means of Communication.-There is in the burgh a principal 
or assorting post-office, from which bags are daily dispatched 



INVERKEITHING. 



245 



to the neighbouring places and chief towns. At about a mile from 
the North Ferry the main road sends branches to Torryburn, 
Dunfermline, and Kirkakly, respectively running nearly three, 
and two miles through the parish, — the great north road from 
which these strike off extending through it for six miles. There 
are two four-horse coaches, which run every lawful day from Edin- 
burgh through the burgh, one to Perth, and the other to Aberdeen, 
besides the mail daily. There are two two-horse coaches between 
Dunfermline and Edinburgh, which pass within a little distance of 
the burgh. There is also an easy communication from North 
Ferry by several steam-boats to Leith, Stirling, and intermedi- 
ate ports. The bridges in the parish are small, the streams be- 
ing of a trifling description. The fences on the sides of the pub- 
lic roads in several places are certainly not the best in the parish. 
There is an iron rail-road, made about twenty-five years ago, re- 
placing a wooden one of a much older date, used for conveying 
coals from Halbeath, and stone to be shipped at the harbour. 
The length of it is five miles, one of which is within the parish, 
and three upon the very boundary between it and that of Dun- 
fermline. The harbour is a pretty good one, and may be greatly 
improved and deepened by the removal of the mud. Vessels of 
200 tons burden can load and sail from it at the spring-tides ; but 
it is generally frequented by smaller vessels. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the middle 
of the burgh. The town population are all within five minutes walk 
of it, and the greater part of the country people within two miles ; 
about an hundred may be farther distant ; but none farther than 
three miles except the inhabitants of one family in a small cottage. 
It was built in 1826, replacing the one which was partly burnt 
the year before, and is in a good state of repair. No benefac- 
tions are on record. The church has a handsome appearance, 
commodious and elegant within, and ornamented with two rows 
of pillars running through it, having arches in the style of a 
Gothic cathedral. There is a very old steeple adjoining the 
west end of it, containing a large bell and a public clock. The 
building accommodates nearly a thousand persons. It has only one 
gallery, opposite the pulpit, which is allotted to the magistrates and 
council, and four of the principal heritors ; but, by the erection of 
side galleries, which the heritors have pledged themselves to exe- 
cute when necessary, it would contain about three hundred more, 
— almost the amount of accommodation legally required for the 



246 



PIFESHIRE. 



whole population of the parish. Nearly the whole of the sittings 
are free. Two-thirds of them belong to the landward heritors, 
who give the use of them to their tenants and their servants, and 
many others. The other third belongs to the burgh, for the use 
of the inhabitants. An attempt was made to let those of the 
burgh, but so ill did it succeed, that, in the Treasurer's printed 
accounts for 1834, the sum received for seat rents, "is stated to 
be 7s." In the meantime, the people occupy these seats with- 
out ceremony. The manse was built in 1798, and has attached to 
it the usual legal accommodations, a barn, stable, byre, and wash- 
ing-house. The garden wall is six feet high, with a coping. 
There was no manse before that date, but only an allowance of 
L. 40 Scots paid for house rent. There was a small manse of 
a " but and a ben" in the parish of Rosyth, which was pulled down 
about thirty years ago,— and at that place there are still the ruinous 
walls of the church and a considerable space of burying-ground, 
around it. There are two glebes,— one for each of the united parish- 
es. They originally consisted of about 8 acres, but when excambed 
about twenty years ago, a greater quantity was given on account 
of the ground" being inferior in quality, so that, including the grass 
ground, the glebe now amounts to 12 acres, and might rent for 
about L. 40. The stipend has been thrice augmented since 1792 ; 
the last was in 1823, and is now seventeen chalders, half meal, 
and half barley, convertible at the county fiars, with L. 10 money 
for communion elements. It is understood that the free teinds are 
nearly exhausted. There is a dissenting meeting-house in the 
town, belonging to the United Associate Synod. The stipend of 
the minister is L. 130, paid from the seat rents, together with 
a house, garden, and small grass park. The patronage of the 
parish is held by Lady Baird Preston, relict of General Sir Da- 
vid Baird, Baronet. The number of famihes belonging to the 
Establishment, according to the minister's visitation list, is about 
400, containing about 1625 persons,— the usual proportion of whom 
attend public worship in the church. The communicants are ge- 
nerally about 400. The number of persons in connection with the 
dissenters residing within the parish is, according to a list of the late 
incumbent, about 1125. The ministers and the people, both of the 
Established and the Dissenting churches, maintain a friendly in- 
tercourse with each other, and show a good feeling and a Christian 
spirit. The people in their generar character are industrious and 
active, peaceable and contented, well affected, and much attached

to their ministers, and attend duly upon the public ordinances 
of religion. That are some Penny a-week Societies for mis- 
sionary and religious purposes ; and there are occasional collec- 
tions made at the church door for Highland Schools, the India 
Mission, and other similar objects. 

Education. — There is a parochial school, in which are taught 
English, writing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, French, geography, 
mathematics, &amp;c. The teacher has the maximum salary ; there 
is a good dwelling-house, and an elegant adjacent school-house. 
The school fees may amount to about L. 70. There are six pri- 
vate schools, in which the ordinary branches of education are taught, 
and in which the teachers are supported by the school fees alone. 
One is a female school for the higher and ornamental branches of 
education. There is also a Sabbath day school, which meets both 
before and after public worship, and is supported by subscriptions 
and collections, and attended by numerous scholars. The expense 
of education is moderate, being per quarter 3s. for English ; 4s. 
for English and writing; 5s. for arithmetic ; 7s. for Latin ; and the 
same for French. The number of scholars attending all these 
schools is very nearly 400. 

Literature. — There are three libraries, — a subscription, a circu- 
lating, and a congregational one belonging to the dissenters, but 
none of them contain any great number of books. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor receiving pa- 
rochial aid belonging to the Established Church, was, during last 
year 1835 43. The accounts of the current year cannot be 
made up, until the end of it. The allowances given them vary 
from 6d. to 2s. 6d. per week, proportioned according to their 
wants. The collections at the church door are upon an average, 
L. 20 annually, and the subscription or assessment upon the heri- 
tors for the year above-mentioned was L. 110, out of which there 
are L. 10 given to the dissenters in aid of their paupers. There 
are some small salaries paid to clerks, and church-oflicers. The 
heritors pay according to their valued rents. 

Prisons. — The jail is by no means secure, — several escapes have 
been made from it. Excepting a vagrant or rioter upon the streets, 
and that for a night, incarceration in this prison is a rare event. 
It is superintended by one of the town-officers. 

Fairs. — There are 5 fairs appointed to be held in this burgh, 
which were once well attended by dealers in horses, cattle, and 
merchant's goods ; but they are now merely nominal, no business 



248 



FIFESHIRE. 



being done. There is, however, one upon the first week of Au- 
gust, which is frequented in the afternoon by numbers of people 
from the country districts. There being a horse and a foot race 
for small prizes given from the funds of the burgh, there is abund- 
ance of gingerbread and sweetmeats for sale, as well as drink, with 
many of which the Yeople regale themselves and their friends in 
the public houses in the evening. 

Inns. — Including the back shops of grocers, there are '23 
houses in the burgh where spirits may be bought in small 
quantities, and drunk upon the premises. Two of them only are 
inns for the reception and entertainment of travellers. In the 
North Ferry, there are 13 such places, including the great inn, 
and a secondary one, and in the rest of the parish there are three, 
making in all 30 ; but some of these are required to accommodate 
passengers at North Ferry, and travellers upon the public road . 
from Edinburgh to Perth and Inverness. 

Fuel — The fuel is coal of various kinds, procured from diffe- 
rent pits, and at the distance of from four to seven miles from the 
burgh. The price, including carriage, may be from 5s. to 9s. per 
ton, according to the quality and distance from the coUiery. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the Statistical Account in 1793 was published, a remark- 
able difference has taken place in the parish. The state of agricul- 
ture has been greatly advanced, and the general appearance of the 
town much improved. It is rather against the interest of the burgh, 
that none of the great heritors reside within the parish. The place 
is favourable for carrying on manufactories of various kinds, hav- 
ing numerous facilities,— yet no person of capital and enterprise 
has ever engaged in trade or commerce upon a large and exten- 
sive scale. There used to be some years ago, strong political con- 
tests in the burgh, which frequently led the parties to the Court 
of Session, and when these regarded the election of a Member of 
Parliament, they were sometimes carried to the House of Commons. 
This arose from the very peculiar set of the burgh. The members 
of council continued in office during life and residence, and the 
minority could not be turned out, and their places filled up with 
more friendly adherents. The struggle between the parties was 
thus kept up, and maintained with much activity and contentious- 
ness. It is recorded in the session books, in 1720, " that the 
kirk-session unanimously twice postponed, and finally omitted the 
celebration of the sacrament at that time," « on account of the 
great animositie and disagreement that is in the place." Several

instances could be given at a latter period of the same political 
and contentious spirit. Matters are now more quietly and peace- 
ably managed. The burgh and parliamentary elections excite no 
great interest among the inhabitants.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE 

THE REV. DAVID GUILD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Auchter is said to be a Gaelic word, signifying a height, 
and Tool seems to be a corruption of Tiel, a rivulet which rises in 
the parish and runs through it ; hence Auchtertool signifies the 
higher grounds on the Tiel. It does not appear that its name has 
any alteration from that originally given it. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is about 3 miles long, 
and about 11 wide on the average, comprising 4 square miles, 
equal to 2570 imperial acres. It is bounded on the north by the 
parish of Auchterderran ; on the north-west, by the parish of 
Beath ; on the south, by the parishes of Kinghorn, Burntisland, 
and Aberdour ; on the east and north-east, it is at some points 
conterminous with the parishes of Kinghorn and Abbotshall. 

Topographical Appearances.— lis figure is irregular, but ap- 
proaches nearer to that of a parallelogram than any other regular 
figure. There is a range of hills at the west end of the parish, 
commonly called CuUalo hills; their acclivity on the south side is 
very steep, and the elevation of the highest above the level of the 
sea is 750 feet. In regard to each other, the difference of eleva- 
tion is inconsiderable. 

The climate is temperate and salubrious. The dryness of the 
soil throughout the most populous part of the parish, its moderate 
distance from the sea, and its elevation above it, must naturally 
contribute to its salubrity, and to the healthiness of its inhabitants. 

Hydrograph7j.~T\\eve are springs by which the inhabitants of 
this parish are abundantly supplied with water; some of these are 



250 



FIFESHIUE. 



intermittent ; but generally they are perennial. The former being 
produced by the excess of surface water, are commonly impure, and 
the water of course fit for few purposes; but the latter are sufficiently 
numerous and copious for the accommodation and comfort of the in- 
habitants. Some of these seem to flow from freestone, others from 
whinstone. There are no mineral springs in the parish. There is 
not a river ; but there are several perennial streams of water, which 
run through the parish, one of which runs into Camilla-loch, situ- 
ated near the east end of the parish. The loch derives its name 
Camilla from the old house of Camilla, anciently called Hallyards, 
belonging to the family of the Skenes; but acquired the name of 
Camilla from the residence of one of the Countesses of Moray, 
whose name was Campbell. It contains perch, pike, and eels. Its 
surface extends to 18 acres ; its greatest depth is 22 feet. The site 
of the loch is capable of much ornamental and not unprofitable im- 
provement. Its north side is bounded by a steep eminence cover- 
ed with furze, interspersed with spots of a rocky substance appear- 
ing through them, which nature seems to have intended for wood 
plantation, as it is fit for nothing else. There are grounds scatter- 
ed around it of the same description. These, covered with planta- 
tions, with the ruin of the ancient house of Hallyards, together 
with remaining traces of old baronial style, adjacent to the loch, 
would present to the eye a romantic and interesting aspect. 

There are two cascades, one of which is on the boundary of the 
south side of the parish. There is another contiguous to Camil- 
la loch, at the head of a deep narrow ravine, the sides of which 
are extremely steep, rising in nearly a perpendicular direction. 
They consist of rugged rocks interspersed with spots of soil, where 
some very rare plants are to be found, and, accordingly, it is occasion- 
ally the resort of botanists. The streams of water which form these 
cascades are commonly small ; but after a heavy fall of rain, or ef- 
fectual thaw of snow, they swell to a considerable extent. 

Geology and Miner alopj.— There are freestone, trap, or whin- 
stone, and limestone in the parish. The first is not in much repute, 
and is seldom wrought. The second is used chiefly for road metal, 
rarely for building. The last, which is on the property of Lord Moray, 
and of Captain Erskine Wemyss, is wrought by their tenants, and 
exclusively for their farm purposes ; none has ever been wrought for 
sale In the kinds of rocks mentioned no species of ore is found. 
There are various kinds of soil in the parish; the loamy; the 
clayey, partaking considerably of the nature of till; and the mossy.

The first is the most productive ; some parts of the second, which 
have been drained and well cultivated, are little less fruitful ; but 
by far the greater part of this kind, remaining in its original wet 
and sour state, is much less productive. By far the greater part 
of the mossy is entire moss, and has never been cultivated: from 
its great depth, and the impracticability of draining, it seems in- 
capable of cultivation. The loamy soil lies chiefly on the south 
side of the parish, where the climate is best; the clayey and 
mossy on the north and west sides of the parish, where the climate 
is worse. The loamy soil varies from less than a foot to five feet 
deep. Its subsoil is what is commonly called rotten rock, which, 
when trenched and exposed to the varieties of weather, is soon 
converted into soil apparently of the same kind with the surface. 

Zoology. — There are few species of animals here which are not 
to be found in the parishes bounding the north and west sides of 
this. The only species here not common to all other parishes, 
are a few grouse at the west end of the parish, and lapwings much 
more numerous. The heron, too, sometimes makes its appearance 
in winter. The live-stock consists almost wholly of horses and 
black-cattle. Of the former, few are purchased ; almost the whole 
of them are bred and reared by the farmers, for their farm pur- 
poses, rarely for sale ; and what are retained for farm -work are 
kept in high order, with full feeding and full work. Almost all 
the black-cattle in the parish are bred or reared in it ; few com- 
paratively are purchased for feeding ; but as most of the farmers 
cannot have bred on their farm as many as are required to be rear- 
ed for feeding and for sale, the deficiency is supplied by purchas- 
ing calves wherever they find them, in consequence of 'which the 
stock is invariably mixed ; but with regard to what is bred on the 
farms, the greatest care and judgment are exercised to obtain the 
best kind. The Fife breed is the kind generally preferred, and 
sought ; but if that breed exists pure, it is rarely if ever to be seen. 
'J here are many very good cows in Fife; but it is doubted whether 
there be a pure Fife cow in the county. But though what would 
be preferred may not be obtained, yet the care and skill in breed- 
ing the choicest kinds to be had, appears in the value to which 
the animals are brought. One farmer has of late years preferred 
the Teeswater ; a kind not known to be bred or reared in the pa- 
rish before. They came to great value; some rising three years 
old have been sold at L. 20, when markets were low. 

There is only one farm in the parish, on which any sheep 



are 



252 



FIFESHIRE. 



grazed ; and it is within the last three years, that these have been 
introduced ; they are all of the Cheviot breed. About 360 are 
purchased annually, about the month of July, and sold again at 
dilTerent times, according as they advance to condition for the 
shambles, till the whole be sold off, to give place for a new lot at 
the usual time of purchasing. They have been found a profitable 
species of stock. On the farm alluded to, the number is on the 
increase, and though the parish be rather adapted to corn growing 
than grazing, yet the success of the experiment already made, is so 
decided, and so well known, that that species of stock is likely to 
become more numerous in the parish. 

Botany. — There is a great variety of plants, among which the 
rarer species are the Imperatoria ostruthium at Camilla ruins ; 
Gac/ea lutea, Petasites alhus, Saxifraga umbrosa, Viola odorata, 
 Auchtertool Linn. A few trees, scattered throughout the parish, 
' are to be seen, but not the semblance of a plantation. However, as 
that species of improvement has lately advanced to the very boun- 
daries of the parish, it is to be hoped that it will not stop there. 
There are many places within its bounds which invite the planter, 
encouraging him by holding out to view an improvement both pro- 
fitable and ornamental. There is little doubt that the capability 
of these grounds will in course draw the attention of the Noble pro- 
prietor, whose taste, like that of his noble ancestors, for both useful 
and ornamental improvements particularly plantation is so ap- 
parent in other parts of his extensive domains. 

11. — Civil History. 
Land-owners,— With the exception of three portions of land 
held in feu from Lord Moray, amounting to twenty acres or there- 
about, the Earl of Moray and Captain Erskine Wemvss are the 
only land-owners in the parish. 

Parochial Registers.— These extend as far back as 1670 ; but 
till within the last fifty or sixty years, they have been very irregu- 
larly kept. • 1 .1 f 
Modern Buildings.— There are none m the parish worthy ot 
particular remark. The church and manse will be noticed under the 
head Ecclesiastical State. All the other houses in the parish are 
of no ancient date, and consist of farms, villagers and cottagers' 
houses, and a corn mill, which are all built with stone and lime. 
Till within the last forty or fifty years, there was but one house in 
the parish covered with blue slate ; the rest were generally covered 
with wheat straw, a few with tile, and one with gray slate. Most

of the houses that have been built recently are covered with blue

in the parish.

The only apparent probable cause of the increase of popula- 
tion, is the progress of agricultural improvement. By that and the 
increased attention to the improvement of roads, a much greater 
number of labourers is necessary for the latter, and many more, 
both of males and females, are in demand for the former now, than 
in former times, whose labour is remunerated with ample wages ; 
and though the price of their labour does occasionally rise and fall 
somewhat, yet it is much more steady and uniform than that of the 
labour of operatives in manufactures. The demand for country 
labour too, scarcely ever varies, if it does not increase. But the 
same cannot be said of the labour of operatives in manufacturing 
towns. Formerly too, females were but little employed in agri- 
cultural work; but, with the progress of improvement, the demand 
for their labour has increased so much that every farmer pre- 
fers for his cottager, the man who has daughters that will work in 
his field, for which they are liberally paid. Their labour consists 
in hoeing potatoes, in hoeing and hand-weeding turnips, and other 
drilled crops. In harvest they are employed in reaping, and of 
course receive reaper's wages. Nor are they without employment 
in winter. They are frequently employed at thrashing-mills, and 
in pulling and preparing turnips for cattle. It is obvious that, in 
this state of things, there is a tendency to induce the labouring 
classes of both sexes to resort to country villages and cottar-houses 
for residence, where employment is always to be had. The rate 
of wages, compared with the price of grain, is always high, and less 
fluctuating than in trade and manufactures ; accordingly the num- 
ber of village and cottar-houses has been increasing, and latterly 
with great rapidity.

Character, Sfc. of the People.— The people'are without any thing 
pecuUar in their manners or customs, and enjoy, in a reasonable 
degree, the comforts suitable to their respective places in society, 
and are moral and religious, regular in their attendance on divine 
service, and in their observance of the ordinances of the gospel. 

During the last three years, there were 4 illegitimate births in 
the parish.

Rent of Land.—kvev'Age rent of arable land per imperial acre 
in the parish L. 1, 9s. ; average rent of grazing, rating it at L. 2, 6s. 
per cow or full-grown ox, grazed for the season, or 10s. per sheep, 
grazed for the year, is, per imperial acre, L. 1, 3s. The real rent 
of the parish is L. '2165. 

Husbandry.— The rotations generally adopted in the parish are 
as follows: viz. First rotation, 1. green crop; 2. wheat, barley, 
or oats, with grass seeds ; 3. hay ; 4. oats. Second rotation, 
1. green crop; 2. wheat, barley, or oats, with grass seeds; 3.

Prices. — The selling price, in common years, of the different 
kinds of grain grown in the parish may be rated as follows : Wheat, 
L. 2, 13s. lOd. ; barley, L. 1, 9s. lid.; oats, L. J. 2s. 4d. per im- 
perial quarter. 

The average price of different articles of parochial produce re- 
quired for the purpose of domestic economy. — Oat-meal per im-

made with the cream in it, 6d. per imperial lb. ; eggs per dozen, 
6d. ; hens each Is. 6d. j chickens, 7d. each; potatoes. Is. 6d. per 
bushel. 

Live-Stock. — Of late years, the farmer's attention has been turn- 
ed to the rearing and feeding of black-cattle, much more than in 
former times, when the price of grain was higher. They find that 
this branch of husbandry makes a better return in money, than 
the growing of grain at the low prices, during a currency of years 
past ; while it enriches the land, by increasing the quantity of ma- 
nure. Accordingly, the growing of turnips and potatoes is now rnuch 
increased. Every farmer is desirous to have as much land in pas- 
ture, and green crop, as the nature and extent of his farm will 
allow. 

Till within these last three or four years, Httle had been done 
in draining and reclaiming waste land. There is but one farm in 
the parish, on which either of these improvements has been carried 
to any considerable extent. On the farm alluded to, much has 
been done in both. The same improvements are becoming more 
general in the parish than formerly; but the progress is slow. 
The reclaimed lands extend to 40 acres or thereby ; they consist 
chiefly of eminences formerly covered with furze, on some parts 
of which the soil was extremely thin. But the nature of the sub- 
soil renders it comparatively easy to add to its depth. The subsoil 
consists of what is commonly called rotten rock, which, when 
turned up by the plough, or any other implement, though in 
pieces similar to that of road metal, is soon reduced by the va- 
rieties of weather, and converted into fertile soil. Where the 
plough may not be convenient and efficient, the pick and spade 
can be used with complete success; and the labour, though more 
expensive, will still be profitable. In this way, the thin soil on the 
tops of knolls, in which some fields in the parish abound, might 
be deepened at a cost which the improvement would amply repay. 
The present manse garden was made of a piece of ground where 
the average depth of soil did not exceed two inches. It was 



256 



FIFESHIRE. 



trenched with the pick and the spade, planted with potatoes the 
subsequent spring, the crop of which repaid the outlay; and now 
it is excellent garden ground. 

On the farm alluded to, draining also has been carried to con- 
siderable extent, and is still progressing. Surface draining is the 
kind appropriate to the nature of the soil there, and also to the 
chief portion of land in the parish, where draining is necessary. 
On the north side of the parish it consists chiefly of clay or till, — 
on some parts, with a thin surface of softer mould. Of course, the 
efficiency of the drains depends much on their closeness to one 
another. Till of late, that method of draining seems to have been 
little understood in the parish, as it has been resorted to only re- 
cently, and there remains great scope for the extension of that im- 
provement. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is nineteen years. In 
most if not in all cases, it would be advantageous both to proprie- 
tor and tenant, to have the leases extended a few years longer. It 
would give greater encouragement to the tenant to lay out capital 
on permanent improvement, by holding out to his view a more cer- 
tain prospect of remuneration for that outlay. The nature and 
condition of the farm, the nature and extent of the improvement 
it needs, and of which it is capable, ought to determine the length 
of the lease. 

Farm-Buildings and Inclosures.—Wiih the exception of one, 
every farm in the parish is accommodated with buildings adequate 
to its value and extent, and in a good state of repair. The same 
cannot be said of farm inclosures. 

The parish is almost all inclosed, partly with stone dikes, and 
partly with thorn hedges. Part of the former is new and substan- 
tial, the rest is less sufficient. As to the hedges, there is not an 
enclosure sufficiently fenced, where a hedge is the fence. This is 
owing to the very general inattention to the proper method of plant- 
ing and training, together with the no less frequent neglect of 
cleaning. Instead of the plants being assorted, and the weak 
planted apart from the strong, they are mixed together, and thus 
the former are hurt and kept down by the more vigorous growth 
of the latter. In training, too, instead of cutting only the lateral 
growth till the hedge has advanced to the height at which it is in- 
tended to remain, the top is cut as often as the sides ; and in this 
way the hedge is converted into a thicket of small twigs, without 
stamina sufficient to resist the force of cattle attempting to pene- 
trate through it. Cleaning, too, is seldom sufficiently attended to ; 



AUCHTERTOOL. 



257 



and from these causes, together with the various accidents to which 
hedges are liable, there is not a field in the parish sufficiently in- 
closed where a hedge is the fence. In all cases, to mend a hedge 
is difficult ; but throughout this parish the hedges, in many parts, 
are so far gone, that to reclaim them effectually is impracticable. 

Quarries. — There are several whinstone quarries opened in 
the parish, for metal to the turnpike and other roads ; also a free- 
stone quarry, used sometimes for building village and other cottar 
houses. The stone is of inferior quality, and is never wrought 
for sale. There is a limestone quarry on Lord Moray's ground ; 
also one on Captain Erskine Wemyss's property, which the tenants 
are permitted to work for farm purposes exclusively; none is 
wrought for sale. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is exhibited under the 
following heads : 

Produce of grain of aU kinds, wliether cultivated for food of man, or domes- 
tic annuals, . . . _ _ J. . . 
Of potatoes and turnips, . _ . _ ' ojo 
Of hay, both cultivated and meadow, . . J200 
Of land in pasture, rating it at L. 2, 6s. for cow or fuU grown ox, or sheep 

at 10s. pastured tor the year, . . .  nmi 

Of cottagers and villagers gardens, - . '.  

Total yearly value, L. 9262 

Manufactures.— The only thing in the parish that may be con- 
sidered as allied to manufactures, is an extensive brewery in the 
village of Auchtertool, which has been long in good repute for its 
ales, porter, and table-beer. It supplies private families, inns, and 
alehouses in various places, but the greater part of its ales are 
usually shipped at Kirkaldy for London. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town.— KxvUU is five miles distant from the centre 
of the parish, where an excellent grain stock-market is held every 
Saturday; a cattle-market thrice a-year, and a weekly market for 
butter and cheese. 

Villages.— There are two villages in the parish, Auchtertool and 
Newbiggmg, the former containing a population of 329, the lat- 
ter of 75. 

Means of Communication.— There is no post-office in the pa- 
rish, nor does any post-office runner pass within five miles of its 
boundanes,-anmconvenience very much felt. However, there are 
other means of communication which the parish enjoys. L The 
turnpike road between Kirkaldy and Dunfermline runs rather 

FIFE. 



258 



FIFESIIIRE. 



more than three miles through the parish, and through the most 
populous part of it— the two villages. About six years ago, a coach 
commenced running between Kirkaldy and Glasgow on that road, 
leaving Kirkaldy at half an hour past six o'clock in the morning m 
summer, at seven in winter, and returning in the afternoon about 
six o'clock. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The situation of the church,- with reference 
to the boundaries of the parish, is central, but inconvenient for the 
greater part of the population. The villages, which contain by 
far the greater part of it, are a mile distant from the church. In 
1833, it was thoroughly repaired, and much improved. Its m- 
terior is finished in a plain, but neat style. It affords accommo- 
dation for 280 sitters, and the sittings are all free. 

The manse was built in 1812 in the cottage style, and of Gothic 
architecture. It is substantially built, handsomely finished, and 
affords sufficient accommodation. The plan was furnished by Mr 
Gillespie Graham, architect. 

The glebe, including the site of the manse and the garden, con- 
tains six imperial acres or thereby, of good dry arable land. The 
money rent, together with the value of services performed by the 
tenant, is equal to L.  5s. per imperial acre. There is no grass 
glebe. The stipend is the minimum, the funds are exhausted, and 
the sum of L. 81, 9s. is paid annually from the Exchequer, to make 
up the stipend to L. 150. 

The number of families attending the Established Church, 92 ; 
number of families attending the chapels of dissenters and seceders 
•-3 The younger branches of two of these families attend the 
Established Church. Divine service at the Established Church 
is generally well attended. The average number of communi- 
cants there is 185. The average amount of church collections yearly 
for religious and charitable purposes, L. 12, 14s. 

Mucation.-Theve are 3 schools in the parish ;-the parochial 
school, a private school, and an infant school. The branches ot 
instruction taught in the parochial school are, reading, English, 
writing, and arithmetic. Greek and Latin are very rarely requir- 
ed The branches taught in the private school, are the same as 
in the parochial school. In the inftxnt school, are taught reading 
Enffhsh, writing, arithmetic, needle-work, and knitting. 1 he 
salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 29, 18s. lOd. The 
teacher of the private school receives a gratuity of L. 15 ier an- 
num from Miss Boswell of Balmuto, at whose expense he is lui- 



AUCHTERTOOL. 



259 



nished with a school-room also. The infant school is taught by 
a female, and admits girls only between two and six years old. The 
teacher receives from Miss Boswell of Balmuto L. 20 per annum, 
together with a dwelling-house, small garden, and school-room. 
The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommodations, dwel- 
ling house, school-room, and garden. 

The rates of school fees are, per quarter, reading English, 2s. ; 
reading English and writing, 2s. 6d. ; arithmetic and writing, 3s. 
Latin, 5s. The cost of books, stationery, &amp;c. is commonly nearly 
equal to the fee. 

There are no young persons in the parish betwixt six and fifteen 
years of age who cannot read; and none upwards of fifteen years of 
age who can neither read nor write. The people in general duly 
appreciate the benefits of education, and parents in particular feel 
deep interest in the education of their children. This appears' in 
the average amount of children attending the three schools in the 
parish, 150. . - .f; 

Literature, — There is a parish library in the village of Auch- 
tertool, estabhshed in March 1824. It was established and books 
purchased, with contributions from the families of Donibristle and 
Balmuto, and- from the minister of the parish. The library, and 
all its concerns, are under the direction of such of these original 
contributors as choose to attend to it, whether one or more. The 
library is now furnished with 215 volumes, consisting of history, 
travels, voyages, and books on moral and religious subjects.- 

Savings-Bank. — A savings-bank was established in the year 1827. 
The following is a tabular view of the sums invested yearly, com- 
pared with the sums annually withdrawn, the last seven years.

It is to be regretted that the greater part of the above deposits 
belongs not to that class, for whose benefit saving banks have been 
established, viz. house-servants, day labourers and others, who have 
not means to enable them to deposit such sums as ordinary banks 
will receive ; but who may deposit in the savings bank small sums ■ 
down to Is. which may well be spared from ample wages well paid; 

Poor and Parochial Funds, — There has never been an instance-' 



260

of public begging in the parish. The poor derive their aid from 
the parish funds. Four years ago the number receiving parochial 
aid was 6. Since that date, it has never been less, and now it 
amounts to 9. To most of the number, the monthly allowance also 
is increased. There is usually some difference in the several al- 
lowances, but their average at present is 3s. per month to each 
pauper. Six of the nine enjoy, together with their money allow- 
ance, free apartments in houses belonging to the kirk-session for 
behoof of the poor, with a small portion of garden ground attach- 
ed to each. Two old persons who have no money allowances en- 
joy the same privilege. The paupers, and also a few poor house- 
holders, receive annually in winter, at the cost of the parish funds, 
as many coals as two farmer's horses can draw in a cart, which the 
farmers very cheerfully drive gratis. The value of each cartful, 
at the present high rate of coals driving included may be stated 

at 9s. 6d. or 10s. 

The yearly amount of monthly allowances and of cost of coals 
distributed, is L. 18, 16s. 6d. The sources from whence funds are 
derived to meet that expenditure, are various ; and the followmg 
is a statement of their variety and amount. The annual average 
amount of church door collections L. 12, 14s ; mortcloth dues, 
L. 2, 10s; rent of two houses, L. 4, 10s ; interest of money, 
L.4, 5s. The income apparently exceeds the expenditure, as 
from the above statement there appears an annual surplus of L. 5, 
2s. 6d. That surplus is exhausted by precentors and session- 
clerks' fees, and dues to synod and presbytery Clerk. Hitherto 
the poor have been supported by these resources. The heritors 
have never been called on for the aid of assessment. How long 
this state of things may continue, it is not easy to say. Times were, 
when parochial relief was considered as degrading to name and 
character ; but these times are gone, and the noble Scottish spirit 
of independence seems to have gone with them. In the minds ot 
many, the idea of degradation is never associated with the idea of 
parochial relief. They consider it as an heritage not discreditable, 
and bring forward their claims with a boldness that would better 
become a creditor demanding payment of a just debt. 

Inns and Alehouses.— There are no inns, but six ale-houses in 
the village of Auchtertool, certainly unfavourable to the morals ol 

the people. . , • ♦

lage of Auclitertool. One of these Collieries belongs to Lord Mo- 
ray, from which, and from collieries in the parish of Auchterderran, 
this parish is supplied. The price of coal is now advanced to a very 
high rate. The former Statistical Account states that the price of 
as many as two horses could draw easily in a cart, was then Is. 6d. 
and the same for driving them home. The same quantity of best 
coal now, driving included, costs 6s. 7d,; and of inferior coal, 5s. 8d. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The agricultural state of- the parish now is very different from 
what it was at the date of the former Statistical Account. Im- 
provement by draining and reclaiming waste land, was then scarce- 
ly visible in the parish. The implements of agriculture, particu- 
larly the plough, is much improved. The iron plough is general- 
ly used ; emulation prevails among the ploughmen ; the natural 
effects of which are visible in the state of the land, when it receives 
the seed, and in the progress of its growth till the crop be reaped. 
In few places, is foulness amongst the crops to be seen at any stage 
of their progress. 

To that improved state of cultivation, the extension of green 
crop has contributed not a little; which of late years has been ren- 
dered practicable to a greater extent, by the introduction of bone- 
dust. It is particularly well adapted to turnip crops, which en- 
ables the farmer to transfer the quantity of common manure, for- , 
merly required for turnip, to land for raising potatoes. From 20 
to. 30 acres of turnips are annually raised with bone-dust, which 
may be supposed to increase to that extent the number of acres 
of green crop. 

After the grain crops are ready for the barn, the use of thrash- 
ing-mills makes the preparation for the market speedy and easy. 
That useful piece of machinery saves much time and labour, which 
of course is beneficially made over to other work ; and when any 
casualty occurs unexpectedly, requiring grain to be sent to market, 
It IS m the power of the farmer to accommodate to the case;— within 
a few hours after warning, he can have prepared an ample stock 
tor market on the following day. At the date of the last Statis- 
tical Account, there was but one thrashing-mill in the parish ; now 
they are in general use; one of them is wrought by steam power 

But though agricultural improvement be strikingly obvious in 
most parts of the parish, and some advance apparent in the rest, 
there is still considerable scope for its further progress. In some 
places, fences need to be mended, in other places renewed, and many

.acres require to be drained. While these remain without drams, 
probably the use of the trench-plough would be beneficial. The 
soil is clay and till, and, if not broken and opened by some imple- 
ment, is quite impervious to water. Of course the surface water 
subsides no deeper than the common plough furrow ; there it rests 
at the roots of the grain plants, by which their growth is imped- 
ed, and their fruitfulness diminished. But if the impervious soil 
below the ordinary furrow were opened and broken by the trench- 
plough, a considerable portion of the water would subside to the 
bottom of its furrows, and the roots would in some measure be re- 
lieved from the pernicious effects they had been previously suffer- 
ino-. The use of the same implement would be no less beneficial 
to°the dry lands ; it would give fresh vigour and fertility by turn- 
ing up soil which had been years at rest. In some places too, 
where there is want of sufficient depth of soil, a considerable ad- 
dition would be acquired from the subsoil, consisting of what is 
commonly called rotten rock ; which, when turned up and expos- 
ed to the air, the varieties of weather, — wet and dry, soon pul- 
verise and convert into fertile soil. The period within which 
and the places where the plough is to be applied, the rotation of 
crops must in a great measure regulate ; and by considering and 
having respect to the rotation, the judicious farmer will be quali- 
fied to lay down a proper rule for himself, with regard both to 
the periods and places. 

The moderate distance of Auchtertool from the grain corn mar- 
ket in Kirkaldy, with a turnpike road between them, is very advan- 
tageous to the agriculture of this parish, and that advantage might 
be increased by altering the line of road. The road is kept in 
good repair, but the line of road is objectionable. There are se- 
veral hard pulls in it, which would be avoided by another line 
without a pull in it. The preferable line is so obvious, that the 
manner in which carriage was performed, and the imperfect man- 
ner in which roads formerly were made and kept, can alone account 
for its not being preferred at first. Carriage was then performed 
on horseback, and, as ridges were generally driest, they were pre- 
ferred as the lines of roads. 

There is also a turnpike road from Auchtertool to Kinghorn 
and Pettycur, but the numerous severe pulls in it, render it nearly 
useless for carriage. On that road, a horse would be oppressed 
with half the load that he could draw to Kirkaldy, notwithstanding 
the objection to the line of that road which has been stated. Ac- 



AUCHTERTOOL. 



263 



cordingly, the road by the West bridge tit Link-Town of Abbots- 
liall, though nearly three miles longer than the direct road, is 
sometimes preferred for carriages. It is fortunate, however, for the 
parish of Auchtertool, that the road to Kinghorn and Pettycur is 
not of such importance to its agricultural interest as that to Kirk- 
aldy, to which the chief part of the parish produce is carried for 
market. 

The progress of improvement in agriculture has contributed 
much to meliorate the condition of the people. With its progress, 
the demand for their labour has increased, and the rate of wages 
advanced accordingly ; both cottars and villagers occupy better 
houses than they did forty years Tgo. In the former Statistical 
Account, it is stated, " that men and women's wages had risen 
greatly of late ; that men-servants used to get L. 6 Sterling for the 
vear, and women L. 2, 10s., but that then a man-servant received 
L. 8, and a woman L. 3 for the year." At the present date men- 
servants get L. 12, and women L. 6, some L. 7 for the year. The 
rate of wages for the day-labourers has risen in proportion ; and in 
comparison with former times, the comforts of the labouring class 
of the community are greatly increased. 

These benefits, however, are not unmerited; for though the 
price of labour be higher in proportion to the price of grain now 
than in former times, the labour is more profitable to the farmer. 
The servant labours harder; and his work being under more ju- 
dicious and skilful direction, being more profitably applied, and 
better performed, is consequently more productive than formerly. 
The time was, when a considerable portion of time, in summer, 
was occupied by the farm-servants in pulling thistles out of the 
corn to supper their horses at night. So that, though the wages 
be advanced to a higher rate, comparatively, the labour being more 
productive, is in fact not more costly. Accordingly, the farmer's 
comfort is very much enlarged, and his style of living very -much 
altered and improved. Landlord, tenant, and farm-servant have 
each their due proportion of the benefits derived from agricultural 
improvement.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. GEORGE BREWSTER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In the old parochial Records, the name of this parish is 
written Scuny ; and must be of considerable antiquity, as we learn 
from Chalmers's Caledonia, that the church of Scuny was granted 
by Malduin, Bishop of St Andrew's, to the Culdees of Loch Le- 
ven, about the end of the eleventh century. 

Extent, §-c. — This parish extends about 4 miles in length from 
N. to S., and nearly 2 in breadth, and forms the figure of a cone, 
with its base upon the Frith of Forth. The river Leven washes 
its western boundary, and separates it from the parish of Wemyss, 
and a detached part of the parish of Markinch. Kennoway, Ket- 
tle, and Cults bound it on the north, and Largo on the east; and " at 
the north-east extremity, the three parishes of Scoonie, Largo, and 
Ceres, and the three presbyteries of Kirkaldy, St Andrews, and 
Cupar meet in one point." The ground rises from S. to N., with 
a gentle slope, and, at the highest point is about 700 feet above the 
level of the sea. There are no hills, but several swells or risings of 
the ground, which command a very extensive and beautiful prospect 
of the Forth and its southern shore. The coast, above one mile m 
length, is flat and sandy, without a rock in its whole extent, and 
forms part of Largo bay. 

The climate is in general mild and temperate, especially on the 
coast, except when the sea breeze sets in during the spring months, 
and then the atmosphere is loaded with moisture, and the wmd 
cold and penetrating. 

Hydrography. — There are few springs of good water in the pa- 
rish, and only one deserving of notice. It rises in a sandy flat, 
not far from the sea beach, and has received the name of " the 
boiling well," from its bubbling appearance as it issues through 
the sand. The discharge from this spring is copious, and the 
water of the purest quality, but its distance from the town renders 



scooNiE. 265 

it of little use. The river Leven, the only one in the county, no- 
ticed by Buchanan, issues from the loch of the same name, and, 
after flowing through a fertile vale and receiving many tributaries, 
discharges itself into Largo bay, at the town of Leven. It abounds 
with various kinds of trout, pike, and eels, and at its estuary there 
was formerly a valuable salmon-fishing;, but, owing to the forma- 
tion of some of the dam-dikes, which prevent the salmon from 
ascending the river, and also to the deleterious substances from 
the bleachfields, which are mixed with its waters, this fishing has 
been discontinued for several years. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Beds of coal, varying in thickness, 
and at different depths under the surface, pervade the whole of the 
parish; but none of the seams are at present worked. The coal upon 
the estate of Durie, which was wrought for upwards of a century, and 
was drained by a water engine, consisted of three seams, the two up- 
per, each four feet thick, and the lower eight feet. There is under- 
stood to be a fourth seam below these, called the craw coal, the crop- 
ping of which comes out about 120 yards south-east of the mansion- 
house. The third seam, called the main coal,via.s considered the best 
in the county. Considerable quantities of it used to be exported 
to Holland, where it met with a ready sale ; and it is said, even at 
this day, that the best Scotch coals in that market go under the 
name of Durie coals. The direction of the strata is from the N. W. 
to the S. E. ; with one hitch or dike below the farm house of Ban- 
beath, and another about a mile farther east. The following old 
table shows a section of Durie coal and metals, cut by a plane 
perpendicular to the streak, from the crop to the depth of forty 
fathoms.

fathoms. This bore, besides the upper seams of coal, passed 
through a stratum of ochre upwards of 4 feet thick, and three 
seams of fire clay, two of which are of the finest quality. These 
operations were preparatory to working the main coal ; but the pro- 
prietor died soon after, and his heirs are under entail. 

A bed of ochre four feet thick, lying on the estates of Durie 
and Aithernie, has been wrought for several years, of which a con- 
siderable quantity is exported. 

II.— Civil History. 

The town of Leven is a burgh of barony holding under the fa- 
mily of Durie; but, having no local government till very lately, 
it possesses no records, and there is nothing worthy of remark in 
its history. There is a very accurate plan of the estate of Durie, 
which comprehends about three-fifths of the parish ; but there has 
been no general survey of the parish. 

Eminent Men.—Oi the family of Gibson, the former proprietors 
of Durie, was Sir Alexander Gibson, Lord Durie, a Lord of Ses- 
sion, and collector of the reports, well known in the Scottish law, 
under the title of Durie's Decisions. Of this judge, a remarkable 
circumstance is recorded, which indicates a very unsettled state of 
society, and shews with what a feeble hand the authority of the 
Government was administered, when such an outrage could be com- 
mitted with impunity, and even without inquiry. In the early part of 
the seventeenth century, the then Earl of Traquair had a law- 
suit depending before the Court of Session, which was of great im- 
portance to his family ; and, having reason to beUeve that the opi- 
nion of Lord Durie was unfavourable to his interest, he employed 
Willie Armstrong, a noted freebooter of these times, to convey 
his Lordship out of the way, until the cause should be decided. 
Accordingly, when the Judge was taking his usual airing on horse- 
back upon Leith sands, he was forcibly dragged from his horse by 
Armstrong near the Figgate Whins, and carried blindfold to an 
old castle in Annandale, called the tower of Graham. Here he 
remained closely immured for three months, debarred from all in- 
tercourse with human kind, and receiving his food through an 
aperture in the wall. His friends had concluded him dead, and 
had gone into mourning, supposing that he had been thrown from 
his horse into the sea ; but, upon the law-suit terminating in favour of 
Lord Traquair,' he was brought back in the same mysterious man- 
ner, andset down upon the very spot where he had been taken 
up. Another Lord Durie, in 1652, was one of the commission- 



SCOONIE. 



ers sent from Scotland to treat with the Enghsh Parliament about 
the union of the kingdoms : and a laird of Durie of the same 
family sat in the first Scottish Parliament of Charles 11. in 1660. 

Mr Jerome Stone, a man remarkable for talent and erudition, 
was born in this parish, and of humble parents, about the year 1727. 
He commenced his career in life as a travelling chapman, and 
afterwards became an itinerant bookseller. Possessing a peculiar 
talent for acquiring languages, he became, by his own unaided exer- 
tions, one of the most eminent linguists of his time ; but died in early 
life at the age of thirty, while schoolmaster of the parish of Dun- 
keld. At his death he was preparing for the press an " Inquiry 
into the original of the nation and language of the ancient Scots, 
with conjectures about the primitive state of the Celtic and other 
European Nations and he left in manuscript the well known 
allegory, entitled, " The Immortality of Authors," which has 
been often reprinted, and is a lasting monument of his lively fancy, 
sound judgment, and correct taste. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are, Charles Mait- 
land Christie, Esq. proprietor of Durie and Scoonie, valued rent 
L. 2961, 7s. 5d. ; Captain James Erskine Wemyss, R. N. pro- 
prietor of Aithernie, L. 443, 4s. lOd; Major Anderson, proprietor 
of Monthrive, L. 470, 15s. 8d. ; James Ely the Fernie, Esq. pro- 
prietor of Kilmux and Ovenstone, L. 413, 13s. 4d. ; George 
Simpson, Esq. proprietor of Letham, L.408, 10s.; David Fleming, 
Esq. proprietor of Myreside, L. 118, lis. 4d. ; and Mr Wallace, 
proprietor of Park-hill, L. 25, 6s. The present landed rental is 
about L. G500, and the house rental about L. ] 600. 

Parochial Registers.— -The oldest volume of records, which has 
been well kept, contains the general acts of the kirk-session from 
1626 to 1642, and the particular acts from 1640 to 1655. The 
records commence again in 1667, and are brought down to the 
present time, with the exception of two blanks, one between the 
years 1746 and 1764, and the other between 1781 and 1798. This 
last blank has been accounted for by the sudden death of the ses- 
sion-clerk, who had neglected to transcribe the minutes of session 
from the note-book into the regular record ; and that note-book 
is now lost. 

Antiquities.— There are but few vestiges of antiquity in the pa- 
rish, though there is little doubt of its having been, in early times, 
the scene of mortal strife, as is testified by the near neighbourhood 
of the standing stones of Lundin. It is said in the former Statis- 



268 



FIFESIIIRE. 



tical Account, that " some stone-coffins were found to the east- 
ward of the river, with human bones, supposed to have been de- 
posited there in the ninth century, when a battle was fought upon 
these grounds between the Scots and Danes." But a more in- 
teresting relic of antiquity was opened up about fifteen years ago, 
in the corner of a field upon the estate of Aithernie, when digging 
out moulding-sand for a foundery in the neighbourhood. This was 
an ancient cairn or tumulus, containing about twenty stone-coffins, 
and formed upon the apex of a conical hill. The base of this tu- 
mulus was about forty yards square, and laid with a coating of clay ; 
and the cistvaens or coffins were constructed of rude slabs, placed 
on edge with a covering stone, and cemented with clay puddle. 
Above the coffins was a cairn of small stones, about three feet in 
depth, and over this was spread a composition of clay and sand, so 
hard that it required the aid of a pick-axe to penetrate it. In two 
of the coffins, near the end, was placed a small urn made of clay, 
and rudely ornamented, and about six inches in diameter and the 
same in depth. These urns contained a blackish substance, which 
was covered with oak-bark ; but the bark immediately mouldered 
down, upon being exposed to the atmosphere. Five of the coffins 
contained each a larger urn of similar materials, about 14 inches 
in diameter, and 24 in depth. These were placed with their 
mouths inverted upon a square stone, and were filled with calcined 
bones. In one coffin, smaller than the rest, were found a quanti- 
ty of beads made of charred wood, and about half an inch in length. 
All the coffins, except the five which held the larger urns, contain- 
ed human bones ; but a much greater quantity of these rehcs of 
mortality were scattered around the cemetery, and were protect- 
ed only by the dry stones which formed the cairn. The great 
number of uncoffined bones might warrant the conjecture, that a 
battle-field was not far distant; but the absence of all instruments 
or emblems of war, and the presence of a female corpse, which the 
beads, the usual ornaments of the British women, indicate, would 
more naturally lead to the belief, that this tumulus formed a peace- 
able dormitory of our pagan forefathers. 

Modern Buildings. — The modern buildings are, the mansion- 
house of Durie, built in 1762; that of Kilmux in ia32; and that 
of Monthrive in 1836; and five spinning-mills, and one flour-mill, 
all of modern erection. The materials used for building, especial-

upon the farm.

from the quarries of Inverkeithing and Blair. 

III. — Population. 
The population of Scoonie since the commencement of the cen- 
tury, has been progressively and rapidly increasing, owing chiefly 
to the erection of several manufacturing establishments in the pa- 
rish and neighbourhood. 

The ijopiilation in 1 755 amounted to 1 528

The present population is 2640, of whom 2163 reside in Leven 
and its suburbs, and 473 in the country part of the parish. It is 
difficult to ascertain with accuracy the average number of births, 
as few of the dissenters have the names of their children register- 
ed ; and many belonging to the establishment are equally negligent.

per imperial acre, and averages about L. 1, 17s. The grazing of a 
cow averages about L. 4 ; of an ox L. 3 ; and of a ewe or full 
grown sheep, pastured for the year, 12s. 

Rate of Wages, c. — A day-labourer receives Is. 6d. in summer, 
and Is. 4d. in winter; a mason, carpenter, or other mechanic, receives 
from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 6d. in summer, and from 1 s. lOd. to 2s. in winter ; 
an unmarried farm-servant receives from L. 1 0 to L. 1 1 per an- 
num, with board in the farmer's kitchen ; and when he lives in the 
hothie, he has the same wages, with 6 bolls of oatmeal, and a 
pint of sweet-milk per day ; a married man, who has a cow, receives 
from L. 6 to L 7, with a house, 6| bolls of oatmeal, and 6 bolls of 
potatoes, or ground to plant potatoes ; those who have no cows 
receive L. 2 or L. 3 additional, with a pint of sweet-milk per day ; 
a woman farm-servant receives from L, 5 to L. 6 with board; and 
women employed in out-door labour have 8d. per day of nine 
hours. The rate of mason, carpenter, and other mechanical work 
is as follows :— ruble building per rood of 36 square yards, from 
28s. to 32s. ; stone and lime dikes per do. 16s. to 20s. ; dry-stone 
dikes per do. 7s. to 10s. ; slating per do, 10s. to 14s. ; tiling per 
do. 5s. to 6s. 6d. ; plastering two coats per yard, 2d. The price 
of different articles, for the purposes of rural economy, which are 
in use and manufactured in the parish, is, a farm-cart with iron 
axle, from L. 10, 10s. to L. 11 ; an iron two-horse plough, L. 3, 5s.; 
iron swingle-trees, 15s. ; a pair of iron harrows, from L. 2, 5s. to 
L. 2, 8s. ; a two-horse self-cleaning iron harrow, L. 5, 5s. ; an 
iron trenching skeleton plough, from L. 5, 10s. to L. 6 ; an iron 
strip plough L. 2, 2s. ; a drill harrow L. 2, 2s. 

Breed of Cattle and S/ieep.— There are few sheep in the parish, 
and these are generally bought in the south countiy markets, about 
the month of August, either to be fed off on turnips during the 
winter, or to be kept as a breeding stock, when the lambs are sold 
in the spring, and the ewes are fattened and disposed of during the 
summer. The general breed of cattle is the native horned black 
breed of the county. About twenty years ago, this breed was in 
great request by the English dealers, to drive to the southern mar- 
kets, where they met a ready demand, on account of their kmdly 
feeding qualities, and the great weight to which they were raised 
on the English pastures. At that period, nearly one-half of 
the cattle bred in the county were taken to England in a lean 
state. But now, from the general improvement in husbandry, and 
the introduction of artificial manures, the system is completely 



SCOONIE. 



271 



changed. Most of the cattle reared in the county are fattened at 
home ; and are either consumed by our own population, or sent to 
the Edinburgh or Glasgow markets ; and some of late have been sent 
by the Dundee steam-vessels to London. Where the native breed 
has been well selected and kept pure, it has been found best adapt- 
ed far the soil and climate of this county. Unfortunately, how- 
ever, many crosses with other breeds have been introduced; and 
almost every one of these crosses has tended rather to deteriorate 
than to improve the original stock. This appears now to be ge- 
nerally acknowledged, and a desire has arisen among our agricul- 
turists to give up crossing entirely, and to confine their attention 
to the native breed of the county, as being the most profitable. 
The celebrated ox of the Fife breed, " Charlie," was bred in this 
parish, by Mr Wallace, tenant at Balgrummo. He was exhibited 
by Mr Bruce of Kennet, at the Highland Society exhibition at 
Stirling in 1833, and gained the premium given by that Society 
for the best ox of any breed, competing against the Teeswater 
and other breeds. In this parish, also, were reared by James B. 
Fernie, Esq. of Kilmux, and exhibited by him at Stirling the same 
year, the two oxen which gained the premium given by the Hio-h- 
land Society for the best pair of cattle of the Fife breed. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry generally pursued in 
this parish, is the rotation of alternate white and green crops ; and 
the soil adapted for grass is allowed to remain two or more years 
in pasture. Since the last Statistical report was published, the an- 
nual land rental has increased from L. 2000 to nearly L. 6500 ; 
and many an acre, since that period, has been brought from a 
state of unprofitable barrenness to bear luxuriant crops of all kinds 
of grain. Notwithstanding the depression under which the agri- 
cultural interest has been labouring for several years, improve- 
ments upon the soil are still carrying on with considerable spirit ; 
and some of the occupiers of wet land are rendering the soil com- 
paratively dry, by adopting the new mode of draining, called "the 
frequent drain system," and by using the skeleton trenching plough, 
invented by Mr Smith of Deanston, and improved by Mr Henry 
Thallan, blacksmith at Smiddy-green, in this parish. Major An- 
derson of Monthrive,-.and. Mr Fernie of Kilmux may be named as 
improvers on this system. 

Leases.— The duration of leases is generally for a term of nine- 
teen years ; and there, seems no reason to suppose that any change 



272

in this respect would be favourable to the occupier, except in im- 
proving leases, where the capital is all expended by the tenant. 

Farm Buildings.— OWmg to a great portion of the property m 
this parish being entailed, the farm-steadings are not generally so 
commodious as they would require to be, in order to keep pace 
with the modern system of husbandry ; but still, they are in a gra- 
dual state of improvement. The best steading in the parish was 
built in 1833 by Mr Fernie on his property of Kilmux, and cost 
nearly L. 2000. Attached to it is a steam-engine, which propels 
a thrashing machine, and also two pairs of stones for grinding oats. 

The chief obstacle to farther improvement arises from the diffi- 
culty of procuring stones for the purposes of building and drain- 
ing, there being no quarries of any consequence, except in the 
northern part of the parish, and these chiefly of whinstone.

branches of manufacture, which are at present m operation in this 
parish, with the number of individuals employed, and the requisite

Tn the spinning-mills, both adults and children are employed six 
days in the week, and work the legal number of hours, as fixed by 
the factory bill, namely, twelve hours for five days, and nine hours 
on Saturday, making sixty-nine hours per week. Males receu;e 
from 14s. to L. 1, 2s. per week; females from 5s. to 7s. ; and chil- 
dren from 2s. 6d. to 5s. 

These mills are fitted up upon the most improved construction; 
and their machinery is adapted for spinning all kinds and sizes ot 

flax and tow yarns. . 

The hand-loom weavers work by the piece, and at their own 
homes ; consequently, their earnings depend entirely upon their own 
skill and industry; but may average 12s. per week for inales, and 
from 8s. to 10s. for females. In the foundery, wages run from 12s. 
to 24s per week, and, in the other works, are nearly the same as 
those of agricultural labourers. They generally work ten hours a 
day Wages for all kinds of manufacture afford at present a fair

remuneration and support to those who are engaged in them; and 
all who are of sober and industrious habits are well able to live 
comfortably, and to bring up and educate their families in a decent 
and respectable manner. It has, however, been generally remark- 
ed, that those who receive the highest wages are commonly the 
most idle and dissipated, often neglecting both the maintenance 
and the education of their families. 

Navigation. — Belonging to the part of Leven are two brigs car- 
rying 374 tons, which are chiefly employed in the American trade, 
and five sloops of 188 tons, engaged as coasters. In 1835, 15 ves- 
sels from foreign parts, and 222 coasters, entered the harbour with 
cargoes. The imports and exports for the same year are shewn in 
the following table.

The harbour at Leven is entirely a natural one, and is formed 
by a creek at the mouth of the river. At spring-tides, it admits 
vessels of about 300 tons burden, but it is rather difficult of ac- 
cess, owing to the banks of sand, which are frequently shifting 
by heavy sea storms, or floods in the river. There is a small quay, 
lately built, where the ships are unloaded; but it is altogether in- 
sufficient for the increasing trade of the port. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toims. — The only town in the parish is Leven, with a 
population of above 2000. It lies on the sea shore, at the mouth 
of the river of the same name, and consists of two principal streets 
running parallel to each other, with a variety of bye-lanes. Weav- 
ing of linen is the staple trade of the place, and affords steady em- 
ployment to the inhabitants. A board of police, according to the 
Act of Parliament, has been established here for some years, and 
its labours are chiefly directed to the cleaning and lighting of the

Streets, and supplying the town with water. The market -towns 
of Cupar and Kirkaldy arc each nearly ten miles distant from 
Leven. 

Means of Communication.— The post-office is at Leven, where 
there are two arrivals every day. The turnpike road, which is 
well kept, crosses the parish about a quarter of a mile above the 
town : and a stage-coach passes from the east of Fife to Edin- 
burgh three times a week. There is also a communication with 
Edinburgh by a steam-boat, twice a-day in summer, and once in 
winter. The want of a carriage bridge over the river at the town 
of Leven has been much felt, there being none nearer than 
Cameron Bridge, about three miles up the river. This much de- 
sired improvement, however, is at present in contemplation, and 
it is hoped will soon be carried into execution. Near the mouth 
of the river, which was formerly crossed by a ferry-boat, there has 
been erected a handsome suspension-bridge, for foot-passengers, 
by means of which the village of Dubbyside is now, m a manner 
connected with the town of Leven. This improvement cost near- 
ly L. 500, which was raised in shares of 10s. 6d. each. A halt- 
penny is charged for each passenger; and the pontage is at pre- 
sent let at L. 85 per annum. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The old church of Scoonie stood m the 
centre of the burying ground, about a quarter of a mile from the 
town of Leven ; and what remains of it forms the family vault ot 
the proprietor of Durie. When the present edifice was built, 
about sixty years ago, the site was removed to the vicinity ot Le- 
ven, where the great bulk of the population reside ; and is about 
four miles distant from the most remote part of the parish. It was 
seated for about 700 hearers ; but, owing to the rapid increase of the 
population, the want of church accommodation began to be serious- 
ly felt, when, in 1822, the heritors in the most liberal manner, jDro- 
ceeded to its enlargement. It now contains 1000 sittings of which 
100 are set apart for the poor. The interior of the building was 
completely renewed, and there are few country churches so com- 
fortable, either for preacher or hearers. 

The manse was enlarged and repaired in 1820, and is now a 
commodious and comfortable dwelling. The glebe, arable and 
' grass together, is about 12 acres, and is let at L. 50 per annum. 
The stipend was augmented in 1830, and is 17 chalders of .c- 
tual, half meal and half barley, the average price of which for the

last three years is L. 226, 9s. 8d. with L. 10 for communion ele- 
ments. 

There is one Independent and one Relief chapel in the parish, 
the ministers of which are paid by the seat rents and the Sabbath 
collections. Divine service in the Established Church is reofular- 
ly and fully attended ; but the writer has no means of knowing 
the state of the dissenting chapels. Number of families belong- 
ing to the Established Church, 384, or 1751 individuals; com- 
municants, 738 : number of fjimilies of dissenters of all denomina- 
tions, 156, or individuals, 827 ; communicants, 410. There are, 
2 Episcopalians, and 62 who attend no stated place of worship. 

A society for general religious purposes, under the direction of 
the ladies of the parish, has been in existence for several years, 
and the average annual amount of its contributions for the last 
three years is L. 20. There is also a ladies' charitable society, 
whose expenditure for the last three years has averaged L. 24 per 
annum. The church collections for religious and charitable ob- 
jects, independent of the regular collections, have, for the last three 
years, averaged L. 8, 7s. 2d. per annum. 

Education.— Besides the parish school, there are three unendow- 
ed schools, where, in addition to the usual branches, are taught 
Greek, Latin, French, and mathematics. There is also a Female 
school, where the more ornamental branches of education may be 
acquired. The emoluments of the parochial schoolmaster are : 
salary L. 34, with L. 2 for deficiency of garden ground ; school 
fees about L. 70 ; and from other sources, as session and heritors' 
clerk, L. 20. He has also a very superior dwelling-house. The 
other teachers are supported entirely by their school fees. The 
average number of scholars attending the different schools is about 
380, which shows that the inhabitants are sufficiently ahve to the 
benefits of education ; but, though these benefits are within the 
reach of all, yet no adequate change for the better has been produ- 
ced on the conduct and morals of the people. 

There have been three illegitmate births in the parish during 
the last three years. 

I am not aware of any individual above six years of age being 
altogether unable to read, except two, and they are imbeciles. 

Literature.— A subscription library, consisting at present of about 
650 volumes, has been in operation in this parish for many years; 

• It may be worthy to remark, that the present incumbent is only Uie third P»es- 
byterian rnmistcr smce the Revolution, the Episcopalian clergyman having been al- 
lowed to retain the beneface till his death, which happened about 1717.

and a juvenile collection, chiefly of religious publications, is con- 
nected with the Sabbath school. There is also a mechanics' in- 
stitution, with a respectable library belonging to it. 

Friendly Societies.— Theve have been several Friendly Societies 
in this parish; but these institutions, though excellent as a means 
of promoting a spirit of independence, frugality, and forethought 
among the people, have been subject to great insecurity and insta- 
bility from various causes, but chiefly from errors in calculation 
on their first establishment, so that few of the old ones now re- 
main. / A Weaver's Society flourished here for nearly fifty years, 
and was long in a prosperous state ; but, owing to a greater num- 
ber of widows, than they had calculated upon, coming upon their 
roll, their funds were latterly reduced to L. 120, which, about two 
years ago, was divided among its members, and the society was 
broken up. There are at present in Leven, the Gardeners' So- 
ciety, with 130 members; the Apron Society, with 160; and the 
Society of Odd Fellows, with 50; and as all these have taken advan- 
tage of the Friendly Society Act, passed in 1829, it is to be hop- 
ed that, by judicious management, they will be more permanent, 
and productive of the important benefits which they contemplate. 
A savings' bank was instituted here in 1816 ; but it received so 
httle encouragement from those for whose benefit it was intend- 
ed, that it was soon after discontinued. A Government Annuity 
Society has been for some time in contemplation. The prelimi- 
naries are now finally arranged, and it is hoped that it will be in 
operation in a few weeks. 

Poor's Funds.— The average number of paupers upon the 
regular roll for the last three years is 15; but none are placed 
there unless those who, from age and infirmity, appear altogether 
incapacitated from ever earning a maintenance for themselves. 
A much greater number of poor receive occasional assistance dur- 
ing a temporary illness, or in winter, when there is no out-door 
work. This is given at the discretion of the minister, or elder of 
the district, which has the eff"ect of stimulating their own exer- 
tions, and tends in some measure to keep alive a spirit of independ- 
ence which, I fear, is fast fading from our population. 

The average annual disbursements made by the kirk-session for 
the last three years amounted to L. 219, 14s. Id. ; to' regular and 
occasional paupers, L. 161, 15s. 5d. ; to pauper lunatics, L. 42, 
19s. 4d. ; and to sessional expenses, L. 14, 19s. 4d. Of this sum 
the church door collections amounted to L. 62, 17s. 7d., and sun-

dries to'L. 8, 4s. 6d. The remainder was contributed by the he- 
ritors according" to their valued rents. 

Prisons, — Tliough much wanted, there is no prison in this pa- 
rish, nor even a lock-up-house. 

Fairs. — In former times, there were one fair in spring for, lint- 
seed, and one every month, from May to October, for white linen. 
Merchants attended from distant parts of the country, and linen 
cloth to a very considerable arnount was annually brought here for 
sale. These fairs, however, have now dwindled into petty mar- 
kets for toys and sweetmeats ; and, as they are often made an oc- 
casion, by many of the working-classes, for dissipation and disturb- 
ance, they may well be dispensed with. 

Inns, c-c. — There are 28 licensed houses for retailing spirits in 
the town of Leven, — a number far beyond the wants of the place, 
and which has no doubt tended much to demoralize the people. 

Fuel. — The common fuel is coal, from the pits of Wemyss and 
Kilmux. A considerable quantity of English coals is annually im- 
ported, and is generally used by the wealthier classes. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
With respect to the more striking variations betwixt the present 
state of the parish, and that which existed at the time of the last 
Statistical Account, I may generally refer to what has been already 
stated under the diiferent heads of inquiry ; and would advert 
merely to the improved state of agriculture, by which the rental of 
the parish has been more than trebled ; the excellent state of the 
turnpike and statute-labour roads ; and the great increase in ti-ade 
and manufactures. It may be proper, however, to mention also 
an improvement in the mode of conducting funerals, which has 
tended much to the comfort and convenience of the working class- 
es. When the present incumbent came to the parish, it was cus- 
tomary to have at least three services, but often more, — one of spirits 
with bread and cheese, and two of wine with cake and biscuit. 
This not only occasioned much delay, but entailed a heavy expense 
upon poor families, which, at such a season especially, they were 
little able to bear. Now the services are altogether discontinued; 
tlie procession commences precisely at the hour appointed; audit 
may be recorded to the credit of the community, that, generally, 
they entered most readily into the new arrangement.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE, 

THE REV. GEORGE MILLIGAN, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

,,OTe.— Etymology is always an uncertain subject. In regard 
particularly to the names of places, which have existed for genera- 
tions, it is often impossible to discover the causes which led to 
their being imposed, or, what is more likely, the accident in which 
they had their origin. That of « Elie" is involved in the gene- 
ral obscurity. The writer of the former Statistical Account has, 
according to' the fashion which seems to have prevailed in his 
days, as well as now, had recourse to Gaehc, the mother, as it 
should seem, of languages, and tells us, that the parish received 
its name from " A Liche," signifying " out of the sea or out of 
the water." Being ignorant of Celtic, we are unable to decide how 
far the derivation is correct. We are disposed, however, to doubt 
its soundness. For the village is not further out of the sea than 
any other part of the coast. Nay, if we may so speak,:it extends 
farther into it— the Frith of Forth being narrower here than 
in any other quarter below Burntisland. We should rather be in- 
chned to consider " Elie" as having sprung from the Greek word 
« exos" a marsh. And this is the more likely to be true, as the ap- 
pellation of " Ely" in England seems to have had a similar origm, 
and to have been given to the isle of that name, situated at a con- 
siderable distance from the sea, in consequence of the marshy na- 
ture of the surrounding country. It may be alleged that the Scot- 
tish Elie is not a marshy district; but that, on the contrary, the soil is 
dry and sandy. The argument, however, is no irrefragable answer 
to our conjecture. For one part of the parish is bounded by the 
loch of Kilconquhar, where there is a considerable portion of 
marshy ground ; and besides, the land must have been wet before 
the improved system of agriculture by draining, &amp;c. was introdu- 
ced. As a proof of this, we find that agues were at one time very 
common. But of late they have entirely disappeared— the last

case which lives in tradition having occurred upwards of twenty 
years ago ; and even yet, by digging, water is found everywhere 
near the surfjice. 

Boundaries.- -The parish is bounded by Nevvburn and Kilcon- 
quhar, on the west ; by Kilconquhar on the north; by St Monance 
on the east; and by the sea on the south. In length it extends 
about two miles, and the breadth is nearly one. It is, however, 
much intersected by the neighbouring parish — two farms at the 
distance of two miles, and one at that of three, being cut off from 
the principal divisions by portions of Kilconquhar. The cause of 
this seems to have been, that the whole of Elie originally belonged 
to Kilconquhar, and that, when the disjunction took, place about 
the year 1639, Sir William Scott of Ardross had the whole of his 
own lands, without regard to their local situation, erected into the 
new parish. In this way, the form of Burntsheils, at the distance 
of eight or nine miles, was originally intended to form part of it. 
But the absurdity of such a proposal probably caused it to be relin- 
quished : for the lands in question have always continued attach- 
ed to Kilconquhar. In those days of reform, might not a new 
division of parishes be conveniently adopted. There are no doubt 
difficulties in the way of such an arrangement, but if necessary 
changes could be accomplished, it would add much, in many places, 
to the spiritual interests of the kingdom.  

Topographical Appearances. — There are no hills, and scarcely 
Avhat can be called a rising ground in the parish. The land is 
generally flat, and along the coast, which extends nearly two miles, 
there is a considerable portion of what is called " links," — the soil 
being a bed of sand, and producing nothing that is useful. Dur- 
ing the time of the late war, rabbits were encouraged to burrow 
there, and, the price of skins -being high, considerable sums of 
money were made by the sale Of them. Some still remain ; but, 
as there is no longer the same temptation to breed, the policy 
of the farmers is now turned to rooting them out, in order to pre- 
vent the injury which they do to the crops. The shore is sandy 

" Since writing tlic above, we have met with a hint of the same kind, in the re- 
port to hist Assembly of the Statistical Sub-Committee of the Church Extension 
Committee. " To effect a remedy far these disadvantages, must of necessity require 
a lapse of time; but the Subcommittee deem it of importance, that Presbyteries 
sliouid avail themselves of such occasions, as may, from time to time, offer, by the 
rebuilding of a church, to endeavour to obtain a more favourable situation for it, and 
should also consider how far, by promoting judicious disjunctions and annexations, 
Jiiuud sacra, of detacheil and di.stant portiojs of parishes, they might not in many cases 
render the existing means of religious instruction available to a much greater extent 
tii.in at present."

and gradually shelving. There is, perhaps, no place on the coast 
of Fife better adapted for sea-bathing. Accordingly, in the sum- 
mer and autumn months, it is much resorted to for that purpose ; 
and in consequence of the great facilities opened up by steam com- 
munication, the probability is, that the numbers will be considera- 
bly increased. The village, undoubtedly, is one of the cleanest 
and most healthy anywhere to be met with ; and although, in 
a popular Gazetteer, it is said to be excessively dull, it is not 
more so than other places of the same size. There is not, indeed, 
so much trade to enliven it, as it once enjoyed, or as, under more 
favourable circumstances, it might still command. But it is a very 
desirable retirement, and will not be found deficient in society by 
such as do not depend altogether upon others for their happiness. 
Hydrography/.— parish cannot boast of any rivers. On 
the north, the boundary is partly formed by a beautiful lake, called 
Kilconquhar Loch, which is said to abound in pikes and eels. We 
are not aware, however, that many of them are taken. A small 
stream that issues from it, runs into our harbour, which might per- 
haps be profitably employed for driving machinery. Indeed, it is 
reported that a gentleman, engaged in the linen trade, lately wish- 
ed to erect a flax mill on it ; but that the trustees on the estate of 
Elie gave the idea no encouragement ; and although work might 
thus have been furnished to a few labourers, there is httle reason 
to regret, in so far as the morals of the people are concerned, that 
the proposal did not succeed. 

Harbour.— The harbour here is excellent. By those who are ac- 
quainted with sea aff-airs, it is universally acknowledged to be the 
best in the Frith, and the only one where, in certain winds which 
blow with great violence, it is possible to find a shelter. Should 
vessels happen to miss it, there is no other port which they can 
take; and the consequence is, that many mstances are on record 
of their having been driven to the coast of Norway. By the easy 
access to it, and its conveniency and safety when taken, it has 
often been the means of preserving much valuable property, toge- 
ther with the hves of many hardy seamen ; and we find from a 
representation given in to the Privy Council of Scotland in 1696, 
that three hundred of his Majesty's soldiers would have perished, 
had it not been for the protection which it afforded. The repre- 
sentation alluded to is contained in a petition laid before the 
privy- council by William Reid, bailie of Elie, and James and Ro-

bert Nairns, skippers there, praying for assistance to repair the 
liarbour, which was then in a ruinous condition.  

How much money was collected throughout Scotland for the 
purpose stated, we have no means to ascertain. But as we hear 
of no more complaints, the probability is, that it was sufficient to 
accomplish the object. In the former Statistical Account, it is stat- 
ed that this useful harbour was going fast to ruin. Since then, 
something has been done to hasten its decay, and nothing for its 
repair or improvement. It is now in a very dilapidated state ; 
from being once so accessible, it cannot, without danger, be now 
approached by those who are not fully acquainted with it ; and 
even when it is entered the anchorage is not good. The family 
of Anstruther is the proprietor.-|- For the last thirty or forty years, 

• As the paper is rather curious we give it entire. — " Act for repairing the Har- 
bour of the Elie. At Edinburgh, the tenth day of April, one thousand six hundred 
ninety and six, anent an petition given in to the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Coun- 
cil by William Reid, present bailie of Elie, and James and Robert Nairns, skippei'S 
there, in their own name and in name of the whole inhabitants of the said town, 
showing, that the ruinous condition of the harboiir of the Ehes is- witnessed by a tes- 
tificat under the hands of several skippers of the burghs of Pittenweem, Anstruther 
Easter, and Earlsferry, produced with the said petition, and the same will be abun- 
dantly testified \y many of the merchants of Edinburgh, if any doubt remain with 
their Lordships, anent the verity of the representation. It is very well known to 
their Lordships, and to the most part of the kingdom, that the harbour of the Elie Is 
the greatest refuge, and was the securest in storms, when ships are put from their an- 
chors in Leith Road and other places of the Forth, and had no other places to go 
to but that harbour, and if speedy course be not taken to repair the same, the trade 
and shipping of the kingdom will be exceedingly prejudged, and the petitioners are 
no ways in a condition, by their own proper means, to repair the same, so that the 
harbour must utterly perish unless their Lordships afford their wonted assistance, by 
granting a contribution through all the kingdom, seeing the ships and trade of the 
whole kingdom have benefit by it, and a necessity of it, the merchants in the western 
towns and shires, having their trade at Borrowstounness and Queensferry, and other 
places of the Firth; it is nottour that three hundred of his' Majesty's soldiers had 
been lost, had it not been the conveniency and safety of that harbour : And therefore 
humbly craving to the effect underwritten, as the said petition bears. The said Lords 
of his Mijesty's Privy Council having considered this petition given into them by 
the above William Reid and others, with the testificat mentioned therein, and pro-

however, the estate has been generally under trustees, either from 
minorities or from involvment, so that it has not been possible to 
do any thing for the benefit of the harbour, nor is there any 
prospect from that quarter for many years to come. Aware of this, 
some of the neighbouring gentlemen and farmers, interested in the 
prosperity of the county, and the success of agriculture, held a 
meeting at Elie in the month of May last, Mr Keith Douglas of 
Denino in the chair, where resolutions were unanimously adopted, 
expressive of the importance of the place, both for the purposes of 
trade, and as a harbour of refuge ; and it was agreed to request Mr 
Stevenson, civil-engieeer, to survey it,— reporting as to the means 
by which it might be best improved, and the expense that might be 
required ; it being understood that if his report should prove favour- 
able, immediate steps should be taken to carry the projected improve- 
ments into effect. Mr Stevenson has now given in his report, fully 
confirming the practicability of the undertaking at no very startling 
sum, betwixt L. 4000 and L. 5000. The report has been approved 
of; and the committee is now in the course of correspondence with 
Sir Windham Anstruther, and his trustees, for the purpose of obtain- 
ing their sanction ; and should their attempt be successful, it is pro- 
bable that the works would be immediately carried into effect, there 
being little doubt that the requisite sum might be easily raised, 
by the sale of shares. As the harbour, however, from being a 
place of refuge, would benefit not only the coast of Fife, but the 
kingdom at large, it should seem only fair that Government should 
assist in forwarding the undertaking. 

Meteorology and Climate.— although lying so much to the 
east, is pretty well sheltered from the east winds. In sprmg, m- 
deed, the easterly breeze, especially when accompanied with ram, 
may be unpleasant enough. But it seldom continues long ; and 
we have remarked ourselves— the same observation having been 
made to us by strangers-that in summer it is rather agreeable ; 
for in very hot weather, a sea-breeze from the east generally 
springs up towards the afternoon, and helps to moderate the tem- 
perature. During winter the cold is not excessive ; and from the 
vicinity of the sea, frost and snow, are seldom of long duration.

The village and parish are commonly very healthy. From the 
breadth of the streets, and the purifying breezes, epidemics find 
difficulty in spreading. During the period of the cholera, three cases 
occurred at different times ; and, although in one or two of them 
it showed itself in circumstances very favourable to propagation, it 
never extended beyond the person originally seized. Last winter, 
scarlet fever prevailed much to the eastward, and was very fatal. 
It did not reach us till May, and then it was confined chiefly to 
children — not above two grown up persons having been seized — and 
was on the whole mild. It still, however, continues, having made 
a slow creeping progress through the different parts of the village, 
and, as the season advances, has become rather more fatal. About 
ten children have died of it, or rather of a dropsical affection, by 
which the fever has been very generally succeeded. There are no 
rain-gages in the parish ; and we are not aware that any individual 
is in the habit of making regular observations with the thermometer 
or barometer. . 

Geology. — Lying intermediate betwixt the Earlsferry coal-field 
on the west, and that of St Monance on the east, this parish 
may be considered as a section of the- great independent coal for- 
mation. This useful mineral, however, is wrought in no part of 
it, although at a former period several pits were open; and little 
doubt can be entertained, from its geognostic relations, that it is 
not less highly favoured than its neighbours in this respect. 

Sauchur Point forms a bold projecting headland of rock, con- 
sisting of several varieties of trap, viz. greenstone, basalt, clink- 
stone, and trap-tuffa, on the west side of which, in a well-protect- 
ed bay, the harbour is situated. From this, the stratified rocks, 
consisting of sandstone, limestone, shale, and •clay-ironstone, dip 
in opposite directions. The limestone lies upon the beach, within 
the bky, but of which little more than the out-crop can be observ- 
ed. The same deposit occurs again, a little to the east of Newark 
Castle, in a bed about three feet thick, of a bluish colour, and 
confusedly mixed up with the disturbed strata of that district. The 
quality is not considered to be good, and accordingly it is not em- 
ployed at either places for any purposes of husbandry, or of mason- 
work. Along the shore, from Sauchur Point, eastward to the ex- 
tremity of the parish, all the members of the coal-field are to be 
met with, some of them inclined at an anole of 12°, others at 30°, 
ana m some mstances, they are thrown into a vertical position. 
The tuffa is a compound of all the adjacent deposits,— coal, sand-

stone, limestone, basalt, and clinkstone, mixed together, wliicli, 
with innumerable small veins of calcareous spar interlaced and 
weaved in every direction, give to the whole a variegated and in- 
teresting appearance. The imbedded portions of this compound 
mass are not generally water-worn, but for the most part sharp and 
angular pieces, varying from less than an inch to more than a foot in 
diameter. The coal measures are traversed by several trap-dikes, 
by which they are not only up-heaved, but greatly altered in texture 
at the line of junction. One of these consists of basalt, which 
having opposed a hard front to the beating of the surf, may be ob- 
served elevated considerably above the surrounding strata. It ap- 
pears as a long narrow ridge, about two feet thick, projecting into 
the sea, and distinguished easily at a distance by its deep black 
colour ; it is very compact, and contains crystals of augite. Upon 
the whole, the line of section here bears the most striking marks 
of great internal disturbance— of violent injection among the strata 
of melted subterranean matter— and of the existence of agencies 
which have long ceased to act in this quarter of the globe. Such 
as delight in the speculative department of the interesting science 
of geology, will find on this coast ample materials on which to ex- 
ercise their ingenuity, nor will it be any surprise to those who view 
nature on the great scale to find, on the opposite side of the pe- 
ninsula of Fife to the eastward of St Andrews, precisely the same 
class of phenomena in relation to the same class of rocks, as have 

been noticed above. 

The shale beds contain impressions of various arundinaceous 
plants, but few or none of the Filices, so beautifully developed on 
the corresponding deposit at Wemyss and Dysart. Stems and 
branches of trees are to be found in abundance in the sandstone. 
At Sauchur Point, a beautiful gem is met with, which forms an 
object of great attraction to the sea-bathers who resort here in 
summer. It is of a deep reddish colour, and varies from the size 
of a small grain to that of a garden pea. It is usually denominat- 
ed " the Elie Ruby," being confined to this parish, and, indeed, to 
the narrow headland of Sauchur point ; but, mineralogically con- 
sidered, it belongs, we believe, to the garnet fomily of gems, and 
of these ranks among the precious class. It is allied to the car- 
buncle of the ancients, and by modern mineralogists is termed Jl- 
mandine. Its component parts are silex, alumine, and oxide of 
iron. It does not appear, so far as can be detected, to be an m- 
gredient of any of the rocks in the neighbourhood, at least such as

are visible above the surface of the sea. It is usually washed up 
after high winds, and is found among the gravel on the beach. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Persons. — This is a production in which the parish does 
not appear to be very prolific. 

Family of Anstrutlier. — One of the family of Anstruther was 
raised to the dignity of a Lord of Session in the reign of Queen 
Anne. The first baronet of the race, Sir Wilham Anstruther, 
was also member for the county of Fife in Parliament, during 
the administration of the Duke of York, 1681; and joined in op- 
position to the court measures of that period. It appears that he 
also represented this county from 1682 to 1709, and that he took 
an active part in the proceedings — those more particularly for se- 
curing and establishing the Protestant rehgion, and the govern- 
ment, laws, and liberties of the kingdom. In the reign of Queen 
Anne he was in high favour. Report says, that she offered him 
either a captaincy of Dragoons, or the gown of a judge in the 
Court of Session, and that he preferred the latter — being less 
laborious, and better paid. If we may trust, however, to some lines 
that are in the mouth of the people, his legal knowledge was not 
held in very high estimation. 

But, besides this office, he received more substantial proofs of the 
Queen's favour, having got a charter of the baronies of Anstruther 
and Ardross, with many other lands, and also the heritable bailerie 
of the lordship and regality of Pittenweem, with the offices of Search- 
er, and giving cockets for the ports of Anstruther and Elie. The 
same charter constitutes him heritably one of the cibo cidcp, or car- 
vers, — an office which his descendant, the present Baronet, continues 
to hold. We find that he also aspired to literary fame, having written 
a volume entitled " Essays Moral and Divine." It was published 
at Edinburgh, 1701, in 4to. There is reason, however, to doubt 
whether it wejs c;dculated to do him much honour, as his friends 
did all in their power to dissuade him from publishing it ; and af- 
ter his death, his son bought up every copy that could be found, for 
the purpose of suppressing the work. 

A descendant of his, Sir John Anstruther, wrote a work on drill 

" There seems to be little similarity betwixt tlie two offices. But yet the rumour 
mriy not be without a sjjrinkling of truth, as he appears to have entered public 
life as a soldier. He had a command in the royal army when it marched into 
England, and was taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester, and a fine of 1000 inerks 
imposed upon him by Cromwell, and his estate sequestrated; which act of sequestra, 
tion was only taken off at the Restoration.

husbandry. It is understood to have been useful at the time that 
it was published, and not without merit; although, from the im- 
provements that have since taken place in agriculture, it is not now 
in much request. It continues to be remembered chiefly from a 
hon mot connected with it. On its appearance, one of Sir John's 
friends jocularly remarked, that no one could be better qualified to 
write on the subject, as there was not a better drilled husband in 
the whole of Fife. Lady Anstruther, who was a very superior 
woman, seems to have had a considerable influence with her lord. 
Another Sir John Anstruther, father of the present proprietor, was, 
for many years, one of the Judges in the Supreme Court at Calcutta. 
The probability, therefore, is that he was a man of some emi- 
nence, though it is not known that he has left any thing behind 
him as a proof of his talents. 

Land-owners.— T\\eve are only three proprietors. Of these Sir 
Windham C. Anstruther is the principal. About 7-9ths of the pa- 
rish belong to him. The other heritors are, John Anstruther 
Thomson of Charleton, and William Fortune of Muircambus. 
The latter has rather the larger valuation, and the former, although 
assessed for all other parochial burdens, pays no stipend to the mi- 
nister. All of them have much above L. 50 of yearly revenue. 

Parochial Registers.— Whsit can be said perhaps of very few other 
parishes in Scotland, registers have been regularly kept in Elie 
since 1639, the date of its erection into a parish. There is, how- 
ever, one small chasm in them, the volume which began with 1682, 
and ended at 1700, having been lost. They still contmue to be 
kept with great regularity. On his succeeding to the cure, the pre- 
sent incumbent found occasionally an indisposition to register the 
births of children, arising probably from the fees paid on the occa- 
sion But he laid it down as a rule not to baptise, till a certificate 
of registration from the session-clerk was produced ; and now this 
is so well understood- that almost no one thinks of speakmg to him 
on the subject, till this preliminary point has been settled. If any 
are too poor to bear the expense, the session-clerk either gives his 
labour gratis, or is remunerated by the session. At the same time, 
as duricT the last five years, perhaps for many before that, only one 
child of a dissenter has been born and baptized in the parish, and 
its name is also inserted in the book, the lists are as nearly com- 
plete as can be supposed. The minutes of session also exist for 
he same period, and with the same exceptions. During the early 
period thev bear evidence of an inquisition mto the manners of the

people which, it may be doubted, whether it ever was for edifica- 
tion. The spirit at least of our days would not bear it; and com- 
paring the state of morality then, with that which exists now, we 
do not seem to be far behind what is commonly considered the 
hioh and palmy days of the church. 

Antiquities. — There are no antiquities in the parish, nor yet any 
modern buildings worthy of notice. Elie House might easily be 
rendered an elegant mansion, and the grounds about it seem to 
have been laid out with considerable taste. But as the proprie- 
tor never resides there, and as there are no funds to keep them in 
proper order, both are fast going to decay.

Much about the same that it is now when there is an increase of about 400 in the 
population. 1 cannot attempt to say how this fact is to be explained. 

Within the last three years there has been one illegitimate birth. 
For two years and upwards there have been none. 

Character and Manners of the people. — The inhabitants are in 
general industrious and sober, regular in their observance of the 
ordinances of religion, and there are few places where the Sabbath 
is more becomingly and devoutly observed. It is no doubt true, 
that here, as in other parts of the country, some are neither so 
strict in their attendance in public worship, nor so correct in their 
habits as might be wished ; and what appears strange is, that the 
exceptions to the prevailing decorum are chiefly to be found among 
the female part of the population. The number, however, is 
small ; and while the old are dying out, we are not aware that any 
of the young are addicting themselves to the same disorderly prac- 
tices. It has often been remarked by strangers that on Sundays 
the church, from the cleanliness of the people, and in many in-

appearance of a city congregation. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— In the parish there are 1570 imperial acres. Of 
these, about 56 have never been cultivated, and are, indeed, inca- 
pable' of improvement : 50 acres more are under wood, consisting 
chielly of beech and Scotch fir. There will of course remain 1464, 
which are fit for the plough, and in a state of cultivation. It is 
scarcely possible to ascertain the annual rental of the whole ; for 
a considerable part of it being estimated in grain, varies according 
to the fiar prices of the county. The rent, however, may be stat- 
ed at from L. 1 to L. 4 per acre, according to quality— the average 
of that which is cultivated being nearly L. 1, 15s., so that the whole 
rental, as nearly as can be calculated, may be about L. 2562. 

Produce.— The price of grain raised yearly may be much as fol- 
lows . Wheat, barley, oats, and beans, - L. 2500 
Potatoes and. turnips, - - '/" 

Pasture, - " " _ 

L. 5200 

So that the proportion of the rental to the produce seems to be 
greater in this parish than in most others that have yet been men- 
tioned in the Statistical Account. Indeed, the rent is considered 
bv the best judges to be too high ; and this again arises from the 
pdncipal proprietor being non-resident, and the management bemg 
in the hands of those whose only object is to lay their hands on all 
the money they can get. Grazing of an ox or cow, L 3. 

Of the farm-buildings the generality are good, and there s no 
part of the county where the farmers themselves are more scilful 
than in the surrounding district. The fences,  are cl 
hedge and ditch, are in very bad order. Very httle of the land is 
capable of being properly enclosed, or a greater portion of it wouW 
be in pasture. Leases run from seven to nineteen years. Any 
thina less than nineteen is considered to be a great bar to improve- 
menl and to be equally unfavourable to landlord and tenant. \et 
2e leases of the chief estate are only for seven,-an arrangement 
for which I never heard any good reason attempted to be given. 
Notwithstanding, however, of all these disadvantages, and the dis- 
tressed state of agriculture for some years past, the farmers all seem 
tn be in very comfortable circumstances.

per atuuim, wlien they are unmarried and boarded in their master's 
house. If they are married, the money may be much the same ; 
and a house, wkh an allowance of meal, potatoes, &amp;c. is given in 
place of board. The yearly wages of a woman-servant may vary 
from L. 5 to L. 6. This year, they are on the increase — the flou- 
rishing state of trade having withdrawn many hands from field la- 
bours, and thus limited the supply. 

i/sAe-zes.— Eastward at St Monance, Pittenweem, and Cellar- 
dyke, sea-fishing is carried on to a great extent— the Edinburgh 
and Cupar markets, with many others, deriving their principal sup- 
ply of haddock, cod, turbot, &amp;c. from that quarter. In Elie, there 
are few fishermen, — scarcely more than are necessary to provide for 
the consumption of the village. But we have generally a suffi- 
cient supply of fish, excellent in quality, and in the best state, which 
forms for the poor especially, a cheap and healthy article of food. 
V, — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town.~Wie is a burgh of barony. No market, how- 
ever, is held in it, although, if the projected improvements on the 
harbour should take place, the probability is, that one both for 
grain and cattle would be immediately established : nor would any 
place be more central for a large district of country. The nearest 
market-town is Colinsburgh, at the distance of twomilesand a-half; 
Cupar, the county town, is fifteen miles from us ; St Andrews, the 
seat of a university, thirteen ; and Anstruther five. 

Means of Comm7imcation.— There is a post-office in the vil- 
lage. It is a sub-office to that at Colinsburgh. The post ar- 
rives at eight every morning, and departs betwixt six and seven 
in the evening. Much might be done for equalizing the rates 
of postage— great anomalies existing in that respect. A turn- 
pike road runs through the whole extent of the parish. Toll- 
bars in abundance. If I go to Pittenween, a distance of four miles, 
I have two to pay. If I travel in the opposite direction to Kirk- 
aldy, I have three ; whereas the neighbouring parish to the east 
though at a greater distance, has only two. There is a coach that 
passes and repasses daily in connection with the steam-boat betwixt 
Layo and Newhaven. But the great channel of communication 
IS the sea. We have two regular packets that sail weekly to Leith 
-exporting the produce of the land, and importing those articles 
ot merchandize which are requii-ed for the consumption of the 
neighbourhood. Steam, however, is the chief agent, and nothing 
has done more for opening up the coast of Fife than the application 
ot It to sailing vessels. Besides the boat already mentioned, which

in summer sails twice a day from the Chain Pier at Trinity to 
Largo, the Aberdeen and Dundee steam-vessels daily visit us twice, 
and occasionally three times, both going and returning. And were 
the harbour repaired, it is supposed that a direct steam communi- 
cation would be established betwixt this place and London. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is most conveniently situated, 
being built in the middle of the village where the great body of 
the people— nearly 1000— reside. Of the remaining fifty or sixty, 
none are above two miles distant, and the roads are good in all 
directions. The writer does not know when it was originally budt, 
probably when the parish was first erected— but it underwent a 
complete repair in 1831, and is now surpassed by none in the neigh- 
bourhood. Although simple, it has an air of elegance which strikes 
the stranger; and it could scarcely have been made more com- 
fortable either for the speaker or the hearer. Being seated for near- 
ly 600, it can easily accommodate more than the half of the gross 
population. The consequence is, that, there being room enough, 
the people, with very few exceptions, are attached to the Estabhsh- 
ment Perhaps it would have been as well, in repairing the church, 
to have added to its size ; for although there is sufficient accom- 
modation at present, no allowance is made for any mcrease of 
numbers. As the seats are divided among the heritors, they have 
allotted part of them to their tenants and families, and the rest 
are let to the inhabitants of the village. The rent may be con- 
sidered as merelynominal-ls. yearly foreach sttting-and the sum 
thus raised is spent in purchasing coals for the poor at the begm- 
ninff of winter. Even here, however, we are met with disadvantages, 
for the price being so low, families are anxious to have a whole 
pew to themselves, and would often pay willingly for more room 
than they can occupy. The only remedy hitherto found for this 
evil is, to insist that those who rent a pew shou d show how it is 
to be filled. In the galleries, a good many of the seats are tree 
The manse was built in 1824. What is of it is in very good 
repair. Unfortunately, however, it was built for a bachelor, who 
could not get it made small enough ; and the consequence is, that 
it is not « competent" for the accommodation of the present incum- 
bent and his family. He has, therefore, been obliged to apply for an

addition, in which he has had to contend with the agents of the 
principal heritor, who, although aware of the existing necessity, 
and at one time offering of their own accord a much more splen- 
did one than he desired, have now, for some cause or other, given 
the proposal a decided opposition. Still, as the manse was 
originally built without the sanction, and even without the know- 
ledge, of the Presbytery, being consequently, in the proper sense 
of the word, no manse at all, and as the necessary steps have 
been taken to obtain what is wanted, without any protest or inter- 
dict on their part, he doubts not that he will succeed in attain- 
ing the object. The glebe consists of 5 acres ; and is let at 
L. 5, 15s. 6d. per acre — the value in all being thus L. 28, 17s. 6d. 
There is no grass glebe, though it is believed that the right to 
one exists ; but it has never yet been prosecuted. 

The stipend is one of those which receive aid from Government. 
It consists of 9 chalders 6 bolls of grain— of which there are 3 
chalders of wheat, and 4 and 2 bolls of oats, the remainder being 
pretty equally divided betwixt barley and peas and beans. The 
Government allowance is L. 12, 14s. 8d. But even when all is ad- 
ded together, the stipend of the present incumbent, since he suc- 
ceeded to the living, has, on an average, been L.21 below the 
minimum. He believes that last year, owing to the fiars of wheat, 
in Fife being so low, he may boast of having had the smallest 
stipend in Scotland. 

There is no dissenting place of worship in the parish. The 
number of individuals who are members of any dissenting congre- 
gation does not, it is believed, exceed 1 2. Certainly there are not 
more than 15 j and these are divided among perhaps half a dozen 
different sects. There may also be a few who attend the mini- 
strations of dissenters, without being joined in communion with 
them. Both members, however, and occasional hearers, taken to- 
gether, cannot be more than from 20 to 25. We find also two 
or three who boast of attending no place of religious worship : but 
all the rest either are, or profess to be, attached to the Establish- 
ed Church. Divine service is always well attended. The num- 
ber of communicants varies from 330 to 380. The collections at 
the church door average L. 30 per annum. We have no Societies 
for religious purposes : but an annual collection is made for one 
orotherof theobjects which the General Assembly has taken under 
Its patronage. The average amount may be about L. 10. Sir W.

parish. Of tliese the parochial is the chief. In it leading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, and Latin are required to be taugiit. The school- 
master's salary is the maximum ; and his income as session-clerk 
may amount to betwixt L, 6 and L. 7. The fees will average 
L. 40 ; and besides this, he is in the habit of keeping boarders, 
for which the healthiness of the situation is well adapted. The 
school-house has more than the legal accommodation, but the gar- 
den is deficient. An allowance of L. 2 is made in place of what 
is wanting. One of the other schools is taught by a female. Be- 
sides reading, sewing forms one of the branches of education. The 
third is very trifling, and little known of it. But about fifty boys 
and girls from the parish attend a school at Earlsferry, where the 
wages maybe a half-penny per week cheaper. All appear to be sen- 
sible of the advantages of knowledge ; and there is nothing which 
parents labour so hard to procure as a good education for their 
children. In cases where, from poverty, nothing can be spared for 
this object, the session is ready to give assistance, always insisting, 
however, that the parents, if possible, shall give something — be it 
ever so little. There are none above fifteen years of age who can. 
not read. Perhaps a very few old people may be unable to write ; 
but all betwixt five and fifteen can either read and write, or are 
learning to do so. 

Library.— A subscription library has existed in the village for 
a considerable period. It contains some hundreds of volumes on 
the various branches of literature and divinity. New books of 
merit are constantly added as the state of the funds will admit. 
But as the yearly payment is small, and the number of the sub- 
scribers not great, it does not increase so fast as might be desired. 

Friendhj Societies.— The only institution of this kind is what is 
called the Sea Box, an association of masters of vessels and sea- 
men for their mutual benefit. It lately obtained a charter from 
the King, conferring on it all the usual privileges of a corporation; 
and, as its income, arising from land, houses, &amp;c. is large, and the 
number of widows and other annuitants small, the funds are in a 
flourishing state. It is fitted to be of great use to those for whom 
it is designed, and there is no class of men, perhaps, that require 
more the aid of such institutions. We have no savings' banks. 
And I know not that this is much to be regretted. It may be 
doubted whether they have ever been of much advantage. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
on the poor's roll is 20 ; of these some receive 8s. per month ; 
some 6s. ; some 4p. ; and some as low as 2s. 6d., according to cir- 



ELIE. 



293 



cunistances. Tlie general average may be about 6s. ; but, besides 
this, there is an insane person to be maintained in the Dundee 
asylum. This individual does not belong to the parish, but was 
forced upon us by a very rigorous application of the law of settle- 
ment. We have also the family of a man who died of cholera to 
support. To meet these expenses, there are the. weekly collec- 
tions, averaging L. 30 per annum, L. 58 arising from land vested 
in the minister and elders, and L. 15, 12s., being the interest of 
money accumulated by the session, and- lent at 4 per. cent, to the 
road trustees— the whole amounting to upwards of L. 100. From 
this sum, however, there fall to be paid half of the session-clerk's 
salary, together with that of the precentor ; what is necessary for 
keeping up the school and school-house, and the fees of the synod 
and presbytery clerk. All of these may amount to L. 25, leaving 
something short of L. 80 for the use of the poor. Occasional help 
is also given to those who are verging towards poverty, in order 
to keep them as long as possible from becoming actual paupers. 
Some houses belonging to the session are also given to the poor 
rent free. The collections at the church door are not so liberal 
as they might be, owing, principally, we believe, to a foolish notion, 
that any deficiency must come upon the heritors. By them, how- 
ever, not a single farthing has been furnished during the present 
incumbency for that object. All of them are non-resident. This 
state of matters will, in all probability, bring on, ere long, the ne- 
cessity of at least a voluntary assessment. There are some in- 
stances of a refusal to be put on the poor's roll. But we have 
met with Httle of that Scottish spirit spurning at all "assistance, 
which history or tradition records as having once existed. 

Inns.— On coming to the parish, the writer found no less than 
1 1 houses where spirituous liquors were retailed. The num 
ber IS now greatly diminished. At present, there is only one inn 
But there are four grocers, each of whom has a spirit license • and 
what IS to be regretted, they all retail spirituous liquors, more o 
ess, m their back shops or parlours. Some of them, we know dis- 
liking this part of the business, are endeavouring to curtail 'it as 
much as possible ; and we hope that all will come in time to see 
the propriety of dropping, what we should imagine could not be 
very pleasant to themselves. They are all, however, very respec- 
able We never hear of any outrages taking place ; and it is sel- 
dom that a drunk person is to be seen on the street. The writer 
l.aving been at some pains to get the number of tippling-houses 
reduced, he must do the licensing magistrates the ju tice to sav 



294 



FIl-'ESHIRE. 



that they were at all times ready to second his wishes. Whether 
an old license was to be withdrawn, or a new one to be withheld, 
they at once gave effect to his request ; and he doubts not that, in 
other places, those who have an interest in putting down such houses, 
will find thcin equally willing to forward their desires by their au- 
thority and power. Nor is there any thing that would tend more 
to the improvement of the manners and morals of the people — 
drinking being the cause of by far the greater part of the mischief 
which we have to witness and lament. 

Puel — Coals is the only fuel used in the neighbourhood. The 
whole district abounds in this valuable mineral ; and it is wrought 
at the distance of half a mile from the village. By this means, 
there being little carriage, the expense is reasonable. There is, 
moreover, a good deal imported in winter both from Newcastle and 
from Bridgeness, near Grangemouth. The price of the former is 
commonly about 15s. per ton ; that of the latter, 13s. This year 
both will be considerably higher. Towards the new year, from 
sixty to eighty cart loads are distributed among the poor,— many 
families getting them, which are not on the roll, and that receive 
nothing from the session funds in the course of the year. By this 
means, when the season is mild, as it has generally been of late, 
the people are well off, and pass the winter evenings at a blazing 
fireside. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

All accounts agree in stating that a great improvement has taken 
place in the parish, since the period of the last Statistical Account. 
By the new system of agriculture, and especially by the liberal 
employment of draining, the land has been brought into the highest 
state of cultivation ; and grounds which, forty years ago, would have 
been thought good for nothing, are now seen waving with the 
richest harvests. The houses of the cottars, we believe, are equal 
to what those of the farmers were then ; and the mansions of the 
latter surpass, both in appearance and comfort, such as the smaller 
proprietors formerly possessed. So much has already been done 
for the progress of agriculture, that little further remains to be ac- 
complished. The comfort and happiness of the labouring classes 
might no doubt be promoted by a better education than they used 
to receive, by parents accustoming their children, from infancy, to 
habits of industry, and by abstinence from the use of ardent spirits. 
There is, however, an evident improvement going on both in their 
religious feelings, and in their moral conduct.

TRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. ROBERT WILSON, MINISTER. 



I« — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, Boundaries, c. — The parish of Anstruther Easter ex- 
tends no farther than the limits of the Royal Burgh of the same 
name, and has no landward district attached. It is bounded on 
the west, by the parish of Anstruther Wester, from which it is di- 
vided by a rivulet ; on the north, by the landward district of the 
parish of Kilrenny; on the east, by the large fishing town of Cel- 
lardyke ; and on the south, by the Frith of Forth. The town is 
situated at the bottom of a small bay, from the west headland of 
which, called the Billyness, the best view of it is obtained. It has 
the appearance of a place well suited to the purposes of trade. 
The shore, though rugged and rocky, affords a sufficiently wide en- 
trance to the harbour, which is commodious and safe, being pro- 
tected by a natural break-water, as well as an excellent quay, 
from the heavy swell occasioned by the prevalence of south-east 
winds. 

Ciimate.— Along the east coast of Fifeshire, the climate, par- 
ticularly during the spring months, is generally cold, and is reckoned 
very prejudicial, where there is any tendency to pulmonary disease, 
cases of which description are rather numerous in this place. Apart 
from this peculiarity, the climate is, generally speaking, not unfa- 
vourable to health. Epidemics have not usually been very fatal, 
and during the prevalence of cholera in 1832-33, there were only 
a very few instances of it in the town. From its nearness to the 
German Ocean, the severity of the winter is moderated, the snow 
seldom lyuig long on the ground ; and in like manner, the keenness 
of the sea-breeze produces, during summer, a refreshing coolness 
even m the hottest weather. To the same cause is usually ascrib-

ed the scantiness of wood in the district, which gives it a bare and 
uninteresting appearance. 

Geology. — The rocks along the shore are chiefly sandstone, 
and are used in building, though not well adapted for that purpose, 
as they always retain a certain dampness, which indicates itself 
even in some houses that are known to have been built two centu- 
ries ago. The dip of the strata is towards the south-east. There 
is a bank covered with large boulders, apparently of granites, im- 
mediately to the east of the mouth of the harbour. The town it- 
self seems, fiom recent excavations made in building, to rest on 
stratified rocks of the description first mentioned, but apparently 
softer, and overlaid with a thick bed of clay, and retentive subsoil ; 
and hence the water derived from springs is what is called hard, 
and unfit for culinary and household purposes, until filtered and 
corrected by carbonate of soda. 

II. — Civil History. 
Anstruther Easter was erected into a royal burgh, by a charter 
of James VI. dated 18th December 1583. It does not hold 
burgage of the Crown, but feu of the family of Anstruther. An- 
struther Easter was at one time possessed of lands lying near to 
Kingsbarns. The magistrates having engaged in a law-snit with 
Sir J. Anstruther, sold their lands about the year 1770, for L. 500, 
to pay the cost of the action. The same lands have since been sold 
for L. 5000. The revenue of the burgh arises chiefly from cus- 
toms, and shore or harbour dues, &amp;c. It has fallen off" conside- 
rably since 1827. In the year ending Michaelmas 1832, it was 
L. 78, 3s., and at the same period, the debts due by the burgh 
amounted to about L. 485. The magistrates levy no taxes, except 
the cess due to government, and the customs and shore dues. 
They have the usual jurisdiction of magistrates within the royalty. 
There have been no civil causes triad in the Bailie Court 
since 1820. The town clerk acts as assessor to the magistrates, 
and his appointment is during pleasure of the magistrates and coun- 
cil. They appoint the burgh schoolmaster, procurator-fiscal, and 
town-officer. The council consists of nineteen members, includ- 
ing three bailies and a treasurer. The councillors are now elected 
according to the provisions of the 3 and 4 William IV. Like 
many other small towns, Anstruther Easter has of late years de- 
creased much in wealth and importance. Though it is still the 
best market-town in the district, its decayed condition may be 



ANSTUUTHER EA8TEU. 



297 



judged of by the single fact, that the tonnage belonging to the 
portj at the date of the former Statistical Account, was 1400, and is 
now only 964. Capital seems to be flowing steadily to the larger 
towns, and with it of course that part of the population which can- 
not find employment here. Accordingly, the value of property is 
considerably lowered, and, while old tenements are suffiered to fall 
mto ruins, the number of new erections is comparatively small. 

In the year 1710 Anstruther Easter was made a port, and a 
custom-house established. In 1827 it was made a sub-port, com- 
prehending St Andrews, Crail, Pittenweem, St Monance, and 
Elie, with the establishment of a collector, comptroller, and tide- 
waiter; having also three coast-waiters, one at each of the follow- 
ing places, St Andrews, Crail, and Elie. This custom-house can 
correspond directly with the Board of Customs ; but the accounts 
are usually transmitted to the custom-house at Kirkaldy. 

Eminent ikZew.— Anstruther Easter is the birth place of the Rev. 
Dr Chalmers, Professor of Divinity in the University of Edin- 
burgh, and of that eminent oriental scholar Professor Tennant of 
St Andrews. 

Parochial Eegisters. — The records of the kirk-session are pre- 
served from the year 1 641, down to the present time. They have 
been carefully kept, and are very legible. The register of bap- 
tisms during the same period is also preserved. Of marriages the 
record is less regular and entire. 

Ecclesiastical History. — Previous to the year 1636, the town of 
Anstruther Easter formed part of the parish of Kilrenny. At that 
period, it was erected into a separate parish, and a church built. In 
the year 1641, the first minister was settled. The succession of mi- 
nisters down to the present time seems to have been regular. Their 
names and the dates of their ordination or induction are as follows : 
Colin Adams 1641, Edward Thomson 1677, William MoncriefF 
1686, William Woodrop 1691, James Nairne 1710, John Nairne, 
his son, 1764, who had been previously assistant and successor for 
twenty-one years, and Robert Wilson, the present incumbent, 1796. 

The session records bear that presbyterial visitations had been 
occasionally held in the parish in former times, and that collec- 
tions were sometimes made in the church for public works in the 
neighbourhood,— in one instance towards the erection of a bridge at 
St Andrews. They are chiefly filled, however, with accounts of 
the disbursement of money to the poor, to church ofiicers, &amp;c. and 



298 



FIFESHIRE. 



with the administration of church discipline to those guilty of im- 
moral conduct which far exceeded in minuteness and severity the 
discipline of modern times. 

III. — Population. 
For a great length of time the population of the parish of An- 



struther Easter has varied very little. 

In 1744 it was . . . 1000 

1764 . . 900 

At the date of former Statistical Account, above 1000 

In 1831, , . . 1007 

At present it is believed that the number is considerably below 1000 

The average number of baptisms during last 7 years is, . 16 

of marriages, do. . 10 
No accurate record of the number of deaths has been kept. 

Number of families in the parish, . . . 255 



In the former Statistical Account some instances of great age 
are mentioned. At present there is one individual in the parish in 
her ninety-third year, having all her mental faculties in full vigour, 
and able to attend divine ordinances every Sabbath. 

Of the inhabitants of this parish generally it may be said, they 
are intelligent, but the vice of intemperance is by no' means rare. 
The privilege of the town as a royal burgh, in electing a repre- 
sentative to Parliament, jointly with four other towns of nearly si- 
milar size, has been against the morality of the place, and it may 
also be added against its industry. The late change in the system of 
election, and the classing of this with the large and populous towns 
of Cupar and St Andrews in the exercise of the above mentioned 
privilege, have already sensibly diminished the evils alluded to ; 
and it is hoped that the interruptions to regular industry will be 
less frequent, and the temptations to immoral conduct less abun- 
dant. Infidelity has prevailed to some extent, chiefly through the 
influence and example of one or two individuals. The natural con- 
sequence of this has followed; disrespect to religious ordinances, 
and neglect of the moral and spiritual interests of the young. It 
is believed that worship is performed in comparatively few families. 
It must, however, be added, that there is a large body of the inha- 
bitants of this parish, whose general conduct and habits entitle 
them to respect ; and that there are a few who afford good evi- 
dence of being actuated by the spirit and the principles of vital 
Christianity. 

IV. — Industry. 
Formerly ship-building was carried on here to a considerable 
extent ; but for the last ten years it has entirely ceased. There is 
a tan-work in the town, at which a considerable quantity of leather 



ANSTRUTHER EASTER. 299 

is prepared, also a brewery, and a rope and sail-work. The proxi- 
mity of the large fishing town of Cellardyke affords facilities for 
the business of fish-curing. About 600 barrels of cod are cured 
annually, besides great quantities of herrings in the month of Fe- 
bruary, when a shoal usually appears at the mouth of the Frith of 
Forth, and every person fit for labour finds employment. These 
are exported chiefly to the West India market. Considerable 
quantities of haddocks are smoked for the home-market. There 
are at present six fish-curers in the town. The vessels belonging 
to the port are eleven in number, including two packets which sail 
weekly to and from Leith ; the import being chiefly goods for the 
merchants, and the export, grain from the surrounding district of 
country. A weekly corn-market is held in the town on Saturday. 
The number of shops is considerable, greater than is necessary for 
the accommodation of the inhabitants of the parish ; but they are 
frequented by the population of the neighbourhood, and afford at 
reasonable prices the articles required for household use. There 
is a mill in Anstruther Easter for the preparation of all kinds of 
meal. 

Wages. — Wages are according to the rate usually given in the 
country, and vary of course with its commercial prosperity. Those 
of seamen, from L. 2 to L. 2, 10s. per month ; ofwrights about 3s. 
per day ; of masons 2s. in winter, and 2s. 6d. in summer ; of day- 
labourers from Is. 6d. to 2s. ; of women employed in fish-curing 
ld. per hour, in field labour Id. per hour. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — There is a post-office in the town, 
not a sorting office. The means of public conveyance are, a stage- 
coach, three times a-week, to Edinburgh, by way of Pettycur; a daily 
coach to the same city, during the greater part of the year, by way 
of Largo ; and one daily to and from St Andrews. A branch of the 
National Bank of Scotland was established in Anstruther Easter in 
May 1832. The number of tradesmen is very considerable : bakers, 
5 ; tailors, 5 ; master-masons, 4 ; blacksmiths, 3 ; saddlers, 2 ; 
tinsmith and plumber, 1 ; shoemakers, 9; wrights, 5; weavers, 6; 
butchers, 3; watchmaker, 1; bookbinder and stationer, 1. There 
are two excellent inns in the town ; houses in which ale and spi- 
rituous liquors are sold, 13— a number far too great for the wants 
of the inhabitants ; and there is no doubt that they have exercised 
a very prejudicial influence on their morals, by affording undue 
facilities to intemperance. In general, it may be observed, that 



300 FIFESHIRE. 

the necessaries and the comforts of life are abundantly furnished, 
and at a reasonable rate ; and that the expense of maintaining a 
family is materially lessened, by the constant and large supply of 
fish, brought into the town directly, or from the adjoining fishing 
station of Cellardyke. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is most conveniently situated 
in a large burying-ground, which is surrounded by an excellent 
wall. It was built in 1634; the spire was ten years later in being 
completed ; and within it is the bell bearing to have been a gift 
from Andrew Strang, shipmaster. The roof of the church was 
repaired many years ago ; and in 1834 it underwent a thorough 
repair internally, being entirely re-seated in the most commodious 
form, and having the pulpit placed in one end and a gallery in the 
other : — altogether, it is now probably one of the most elegant 
country churches anywhere to be seen. It was originally built by 
subscriptions, donations, and the personal labour of some of the 
parishioners ; and has been upheld out of the seat rent fund, care- 
fully husbanded by the kirk-session. The late repair was executed 
by means of that fund, and a sum borrowed on the security of the 
seat rents ; and it must be observed, that, there being no heritors 
in the parish, and the town poor, had the fund alluded to not 
existed, it does not appear how that repair could have been ef- 
fected. And it must also be stated, to the credit of the kirk- 
session, that they resisted, some years ago, an attempt to wrest 
from them the management of the seat-rents, and established their 
right, and have ever exercised it in a manner satisfactory to the 
whole community. The church is now seated for 630 ; the high- 
est price of sittings is two shillings, and the lowest ninepence 
each ; the free sittings are intentionally very few, that the indi- 
gent may not feel themselves degraded to the level of absolute 
pauperism. Within the church, and placed in the south wall, is 
a monument, supposed to be to the memory of one of the former 
ministers of the parish, Mr William Moncrieff. The manse was 
built in the year 1590, by James Melville, the nephew of the 
celebrated Andrew Melville, whose life has been so ably written by 
the late lamented Dr M'Crie. At that period the worthy and pious 
James Melville had the pastoral charge of what have long since 
been five parishes, viz. Kilrenny, Anstruther Easter and Wester, 
Pittenweem, and Abercromby. Having succeeded in obtaining nii- 
■ nisters to the others, he devoted himself to Kilrenny, which then 

4 



ANSTRUTHER EASTER. 



301 



included Anstruther Easter. In his Diary he says, " that the 
parishioners of Kilrenny bound themselves to build him a house, 
upon a piece of ground which die Laird of Anstruther gave freely 
for that purpose ; but he adds, it would never have been perfected, 
unless the bountiful hand of his God had made him take the work 
in hand himself." The town and landward parish scarcely afforded 
half of the building materials ; the remainder of the expense he 
bore himself, — the whole cost of the erection being upwards of 
3500 marks, or about L. 190 Sterling. It remains to this day, 
with very few alterations, and these only in the interior, if we 
except a paltry addition made to it by a former minister, not at 
all in the substantial style of the original building. The situation 
is remarkably well chosen ; the walls are of great thickness ; the 
lower story consists of three vaulted cellars ; the ceiling of the 
apartments in the second storey is as lofty as in most modern build- 
ings ; that of the third much less so. A staircase, in the form of 
a round tower, is carried up the whole height of the building, at 
the top of which there is a small apartment, commanding a very 
fine prospect, and having on the outside, chiselled in stone, these 
words—" The Watch Tower." This manse, at present far infe- 
rior to modern manses, might, with a judicious repair, be made a 
most commodious dwelling, and might remain for generations a 
monument of the judgment and liberality of one who, during his 
harassed life, was scarcely permitted to occupy it for any length of 
time together. It is ascertained that the burden of upholding the 
manse lies upon the town. 

There is no glebe, properly so called, belonging to the minis- 
ter of the parish of Anstruther Easter. The land which goes 
under that name, about nine acres, is a mortification as part of 
stipend, which is made up of several smaller mortifications; the 
tithes f. of fish brought into port; a grant of part of the bishop's 
rents out of the lands of Kilrenny ; and a sum from the Ex- 
chequer,— the amount of the whole may be estimated at nearly 
L. 200 per annum. 

The outward means of spiritual improvement afforded to the 
parishioners are, public worship on the Sabbath, forenoon and

afternoon, and occasionally also in the evening ; the yearly ce- 
lebration of the Lord's Supper in the month of May ; a Sab- 
bath evening school ; prayer meetings held once in two months ; 
and the usual visitations of the sick by the minister. The average 
yearly number of communicants for the first time is about 9. 
The communicants, in all, are about 330 ; of whom 85 are on 
the roll as male heads of families, according to the General As- 
sembly's act on Calls. The probable average amount of extra- 
ordinary collections made in the church, for charitable and mis- 
sionary purposes, is L. 8 annually. A Bible and Missionary So- 
ciety, composed of members belonging to the Established Church 
in the parishes of Anstruther and Kilrenny, has, since its forma- 
tion three years ago, distributed yearly to various missionary objects 
about L. 18. 

There are three Dissenting meeting-houses in this parish- 
Burgher, Independent, and Baptist. The families connected with 
them, belonging to the parish, are, in all, about thirty-three. There 
is also a Bible and Missionary Society, composed of members be- 
longing to the different denominations of Dissenters, whose funds 
are believed to be considerable. 

Education.— There is only one school in the parish, the 
parochial or burgh school. The branches taught are, readmg, 
writing, arithmetic, geography, and occasionally Latin. The average 
number of scholars attending the school is about 80. The school- 
house is upheld by the town, as also the teacher's dwelhng-house, 
which has a good garden attached, and was lately rebuilt. The 
teacher is appointed by the Town- Council, and he has no other 
salary than L. 5, 6s. 8d. per annum derived from the town. There 
are two mortifications, Henderson's and Walker's, of L. 4 and L. 2 
respectively, on the former of which a number of poor children are 
educated. 

Friendly Societies.— \. The Sea Box Society was formed in 1618, 
and incorporated by royal charter in 1784. The funds were 
originally raised by a subscription of 8d. in the pound of ship- 
masters and seamen's wages ; latterly by one guinea from masters, 
and six shillings from seamen ; annually. The rent of lands m 
the possession of the society amounts to about L.390 per annum, 
out of which, provision is made for decayed shipmasters and sea- 
men belonging to, or trading from the port, their widows, and 
children, and grandchildren if orphans. The management is 
vested in the shipmasters, who choose a box-master and clerk and

factor. The accounts are audited by the representative of the 
Anstruther family or by the minister of the parish, or both. This 
society is of great benefit to the parish. 

2. The Trades Box, or Burgess and Trades Poor- Box Society 
possesses land, originally purchased with money accumulated from 
donations, mortcloth dues, &amp;c. There is no annual subscription. 
It affords aid chiefly to aged and infirm freemen, whether residing 
in the town or not, and occasionally to those disabled by sickness. 
Its affairs are managed by a committee. 

Besides these two, there are four other societies, that administer 
relief to their members in sickness and in old age, and also to 
their widows, and sometimes to their children. They are, 1. the 
Merchant Mechanic Box ; 2. St Aile's Lodge of Free Masons ; 3. 
the Friendly Society ; 4. the Caledonian Gardeners' Lodge. 
They are all, so far as we can learn, under good management, and 
are of great service to many under the casualties of life. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — An assessment for the poor has 
never been resorted to in this parish. The number of the poor 
regularly receiving aid from the kirk-session funds is 18, and the 
average sum allotted to each per week is one shilling. The funds 
for this purpose arise from the contributions at the church door, 
which amount weekly to 8s. 6d. ; from the rent of lands in the 
parishes of Pittenweem and Anstruther Wester, mortified for the 
behoof of the poor, and amounting to L. 34, 10s. An annual col- 
lection is made in the church, in the month of December, for the 
purpose of providing clothing to the poor, and usually amounts 
to L. 3. Besides this, about the same period of the year, a sub- 
scription is made by the inhabitants of the town, to procure a sup- 
ply of coals for the poor, averaging L.ll. A female society was 
established this year, for aiding the destitute, and at present, 6d. 
per week to each of sixteen poor people is distributed from its 
funds. On the whole, the provision for the poor in this place ap- 
pears ample, subject of course to the usual burdens that fall on 
the funds under the management of kirk-sessions, such as salaries 
to church officers, aliment to illegitimate or deserted children, and 
relief to the occasional poor, and the idea of levying an assesment 
on householders never having been entertained, there is not that 
haste in applying for relief amongst the poor, which is said to 
exist in many parishes in Scotland.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. THOMAS ADAMSON, A. M. MINISTER. 



I Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, §-c.-Cameron became a separate and in- 
dependent parish at a comparatively modern date. It anciently 
formed part of the widely extended parish of St Andrews. The 
following is from the presbytery records : " March 12th 1645, the 
which day was produced to the presbytery the act of Parliament 
for erecting the kirk of Cameron in a parish, and designing a 
maintenance thereto, which diligence is approven of by the pres- 
bytery, and the parishioners there are seriously desired to concur 
with the presbytery, to whom the right of patronage belongs, to 
condescend upon a man for filling that place." On the 6th of May 
the following year, that is, about fourteen months after the pro- 
ducing of the act of Parliament, Mr George Nairne was admitted 
to the " new erected kirk of Cameron." , , . e 

The name of the parish was most probably taken from the farm of 
Cameron, upon which the manse and church were built. Ihere 
is a disposition by Andro Law, citiner of St Andrews, of certain 
« five aikers of his lands of Cameron, for founding, erecting, 
causing build ane kirk and kirk yard, with ane manse for the mi- 
nister, serving the cure thereat viz. Cameron: it is dated the 

' twentie day of June 1642." , . ■ i  

The parish is of the figure of a parallelogram, and is in length, 
from east to west, between 5 and 6 miles, and in breadth about 4. 
It is bounded on the north by the parish of St Andrews; on the 
east, by Denino ; on the south, by Carnbee and Kilconquhar ; and 

on the west, by Ceres. - 

Topoqraphical Jppearances.-The parish is undulating in its 
appearance; the ground rises from the north to the south boiin- 
darv, by a succession of gentle elevations, running nearly pa. allel 
to one another from east to west, with rivulets flowing between 
them The only hill is Drumcarro Craig, situated m the north-

west part of the parish, which is composed of whiiistone rock, with 
generally a thin covering of soil ; but in many places nothing but 
the bare rugged rock is to be seen. 

Hydrography.~T\\e parish is, for the most part, well supplied 
with perennial springs of excellent water, some of which issue from 
whinstone or freestone rock, others from sand. 

Geology and Mineralogy. —In almost every part of the parish, either 
coal, freestone, trap, whinstone, or limestone may be found. There 
is at present good coal got at Drumcarro. Limestone is wrought 
at Radernie and at Winthank. The lime at the former is of bet- 
ter quality than that at the latter place. From the great depth of 
the covering now above the rock at both places, the limestone 
is wrought under ground by boring the rock and blasting it with 
powder, and the stone carried out in carts to the kilns ,• but at 
Radernie a rail-road has been made last winter from the rock to 
the kilns, upon which the limestones are drawn in waggons, which 
is a great saving of labour- The roof is found to stand well, and 
to be altogether safe, notwithstanding the blasting. The covering 
above the rock is of the thickness of 35 feet, 30 feet of which is 
composed for the most part of clay, and 5 feet of bad limestone. 
The rock itself is of the thickness of 9 feet, and dips in a norther- 
ly direction one foot in three. The trap or whinstone is of excellent 
quality, and is finely adapted for making and keeping in repair the 
roads in the district. There is only one freestone quarry wrought 
for sale at present, in the parish at Hazzleden,— which is of pretty 
good quality generally ; but there are a great many wrought by the 
proprietors and tenants for building and making drains. There is a 
great difference of soil in the parish ; some parts of it is composed of 
clay, others of black earth, with a retentive substratum ; some of it 
is a poor moorish soil recumbent upon tenacious clay, or moor- 
band; other parts are of a dry nature, recumbent upon gravel or 
upon whinstone rock. In general, the northern and lower part of 
the parish is the best, though in the southern there is some good 
land. The depth of soil varies from two inches to upwards of two feet 
Botany.— Theve has been a good deal of the worst laud in 
the parish planted with larch, Scotch, and spru.ce firs, within the 
last thirty years, which greatly improves the climate and appear- 
ance of the country. In general they seem to do well where the 
soil IS of moderate depth, and not very wet ; but where it is thin 
and wet, they do not seem to thrive, and are short and stunted 
Beech seems to thrive well in this part of the country as a hede.

but tbere is bttle of it planted otberwise. There are some very 
fine beech hedges on the grounds of Kinaldie and Latbockar. 
There is a large sycamore plane at Priorletbam, the upper branches 
of which are now considerably decayed, and it is quite rotten into 
the heart in some places. The following is an account of it drawn 
up by Mr Sang, nurseryman, Kirkaldy, in September 1818. The 
Priorletbam sycamore plane-tree grows upon a rocky knoll. The 
shortness of its bole, the great spread of its top, and its general 
contour, seems to indicate that it has been alone tree from its infancy. 
Nevertheless, though it has been deprived of the shelter which 
might have been alforded by contiguous trees, it has grown to a 
great size. The bole is 12 feet in height. The girth at the sur- 
face of the ground is 26 feet, at the middle 15 feet 4 inches, and 
at the upper part, from whence the branches are set forth, it also 
girths 26 feet. The principal branches, which are ten in number, 
are like so many consideible trees, some of them being 2 feet 
diameter. The general height of the top is about 65 feet. The 
diameter of the circle over which it spreads itself is 90 feet. A 
sycamore in such a situation, and under such circumstances, will 
have grown well, if it acquired a diameter of bole of 2 feet in 100 
years ; and if we calculate its increase of magnitude at the same 
ratio, then this tree will be 300 years of age ; but when a tree is 
in its prime of growth, it acquires greater accession of solid wood 
than subsequently ; for subsequently, the capillary tubes become 
more rigid, and the circulation of the juices more languid ; and a 
limit is fixed by nature, when all accession of magnitude ceases. It 
therefore follows, that the annual layers of wood, forming the last 
2 feet of diameter, have required a greater length of time to pro- 
duce it than that immediately preceding, and I should not hesi- 
tate to allow it 150 years. But it cannot be less than eighty years 
since the tree arrived at its climax of growth. It has, during all 
that period, been in a progress of decay. At this time, many of the 
topmost branches are dead, and in several crevices of the bole 
decompositipn is apparent. Its death may be greatly accelerated 
by the moisture retained on a flat space covered with grass, some 2 
or 3 feet in diameter, on the top of the bole where the branches take 
their rise. The tree may, however, survive sixty or eighty years 
lono-er. From the above observations it will follow that the Prior- 
letbam sycamore or plane-tree cannot be of a less age than 430 
years, or perhaps nearer 450.

Thomson, Lambieletham and Wilkieston ; William Lindesay of 
Feddinch; Thomas Elder M'Ritchieof Denork; Thomas Graham 
Bonar of Greigston ; Thomas Horsburgh of Lathockar ; Alex- 
ander Purvis of Kinaldie; James Wemyss of Winthank ; and 
James H. Rigg, Drumcarro. 

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest registers of births 
and marriages is 1695, with a chasm from 1709 to 1717. They 
have been regularly kept. A most voluminous record of disci- 
pline commences in 1694, and is contiimed to 1739. 

The only mansion-house of any note in the parish is Mount 
Melville, the residence of John Whyte Melville, Esq. 

III. — Population. 
There are only three persons of independent fortune resident 
in the parish. The population of the parish has been increasing 
for the last forty years, and during the forty years before that period 
it seems to have been decreasing. The cause of the decrease 
during that time appears to have been the inclosing and letting 
in grass from year to year of a number of farms; and during the 
latter period, the high prices got for agricultural produce caused 
a number of them to be let for tillage, and consequently a number 
of more hands were required for the cultivation of the land. There 
have been likewise a good many houses feued in the parish, at West- 
field of Radernie, which is another cause of the increase in the 
population. The population may be said to be wholly agricul- 
tural and resident in the country, as the houses that are collected 
at Denhead, Radernie, and Lathones, can scarcely be termed vil- 
lages.

There are no customs, games, or amusements, prevalent in the 
parish. The people in general are sober, frugal, and industrious 
m their habits. They are cleanly in their persons and apparel, 
and their houses are for the most part neat and comfortable. 'I'here 
IS nothing peculiar in their manner of dress ; the short-gown and 
petticoat which, within these few years, were generally worn by the

FIPESHIRE. 



females, are completely exploded, and the printed gown is now 
universally seen. On Sunday, they dress very showily, and the 
merino and silk gown are quite common. Each family feeds a 
pig or two, and sometimes three in the year, the flesh of which, 
with the garden stuffs, forms a very comfortable and wholesome 
meal for dinner ; porridge and milk are the common breakfast of 
males, and tea and oat-cakes or wheaten bread' and butter, of 
females ; tea is generally used in the evening ; and for sup- 
per, either porridge and milk, or herrings and potatoes ; cheese 
is often used in the evening, and at dinner and supper. Where 
industrious habits prevail, the people may be said to enjoy 
in a reasonable degree the comforts and advantages of society, 
and are generally contented with their situation and circumstan-" 
ces. Engaged for the most part in agricultural operations, and not 
brought together in great numbers, they are not exposed to those 
various temptations with which the manufacturing population in 
large towns are surrounded, and are characterized by an independ- 
ence of mind, and decency of behaviour, which generally accom- 
pany rural life. They are intellectual, religious, and moral, and 
show a great regard for all the ordinances of religion. Poachmg 
does not prevail to a great extent,' and smuggling is altogether un- 
known. 

During the last three years there were 5 illegitimate births in 
the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Econoviy. —Mmost all the land in the pa- 
rish has the appearance of having been under the plough at a for- 
mer period, as it still retains in some places the high ridges and 
low furrows of ancient times ; but upon part of Winthank and Gil- 
merton, there is still a great quantity of heath, and the land lying 
barren and unproductive, with no appearance of the hand of man 
having ever been upon it. Land, notwithstanding the cheapness 
of agricultural produce, does not seem to be going out of cultiva- 
tion, and allowed to lie in pasture, but the reverse,— as, within these 
few years, a considerable quantity of pasture land has been brok- 
en up, and kept, I understand, profitably under the plough, and 
more will be added to that which is already in tillage.

The number of acres in the parish, therefore, is, 7144 2 3o

Rent of Land. — The rent of land varies considerably in the 
parish. The land on the north side of the parish under the 
plough may be let at from L. 1 to L. 2 per Scotch acre. On 
the south side, it may be let at from 10s. to L. 1, 6s. per do. 
The rents of the farms which are let from year to year in grass, 
vary from 2s. 6d. to L. 3 ; the average perhaps about L. 1 per 
Scotch acre. Should these farms be broken up, thoroughly limed 
and drained, and aftervs'ards laid down in grass, or only drained 
and limed on the surface, I would consider it as a very profitable 
outlay of capital, besides giving employment to a great many la- 
bourers in the district. 

The real rent of the parish arising from land, as nearly as can 
be ascertained, is L. 8600 : arising from mines, &amp;c. L. 400. 

Mate of Wages. — The yearly wages of an unmarried ploughman 
are, L.IO, 10s. or L.ll, with 6 bolls of oatmeal, and one Scotch 
pint of new milk from the cow, and one boll of potatoes of 4 cwt. 
for supper, with lodging in a bothy, and coals ; of a married plough- 
man, L. 8, with a cow kept for him during the year, or L. 10 without 
a cow ; but with one Scotch pint of sweet milk, as much ground 
as will plant half a boll of potatoes, and as much as half a peck of . 
linseed will sow, together with a house and garden. The yearly 
wages of a female servant who lives in the house are, from L.5, 5s. to 
L.7. Women who work out of doors have 8d. per day without 
victuals, from eight in the morning to six in the eveningjwith an 
hour for dinner ; taking up potatoes, 1 s. with dinner ; day-labourers 
are paid Is. 4d. in winter, and Is. 6d. in summer, without victuals, 
from eight in the morning to darkness in winter, andfrom eight in 
the morning to six in the evening in summer, having one hour 
allowed for dinner ; wrights and masons have 2s. 6d. per day for 
the same hours; smiths are generally paid from L. 1, 15s. to 
L.2, 10s. per pair of horses, not furnishing either the mould-board 
or side-plates of the ploughs. 

Live Stock. — Some years ago the Teeswater breed of cattleVas 
greatly esteemed, or crosses from that and the Fifeshire ; but 
the Fifeshire is now greatly preferred, and the pure breed sells 
at high prices. The Teeswater kind was found to be not so 
hardy, nor so easily fattened, the flesh coarser, and they did 
not attain the weight that they are brought to in England, — 
whereas the Fife cattle were found to be much hardier, easier kept 
and fattened, the flesh much more fine and delicate, and the ani- 
mal to reach the same and often more weight than the Teeswater. 

Husbandry.— T\\evc is nothing remarkable in the husbandry of 



310 



FIFESHIRE. 



the district. The common plough drawn by two horses is in daily 
use. The trenching and subsoil plough have both been tried, 
but neither are as yet in general use in tlie parish ; but I should 
consider that there could not be a greater improvement to the 
parish generally than the use of the latter ; as most of the land is 
recumbent upon a very retentive substratum, when rain falls, the 
earth soon gets saturated ; whereas were the bottom opened by the 
subsoil plough, the water would get into the land, and off by the 
drains, and thus the quantity of rain which made the land before 
unfit for tillage would never occur, and the plough would be kept 
profitably at work. Of manure, besides the common farm-yard dung, 
lime is' in constant use, and is found to be most beneficial when 
applied to land that has never been limed, or to that which has 
lain long in grass. The second and third application of it has been 
found not to be productive of so much good, but still lime can be 
beneficially applied at all times. There is an abundant supply 
of it at Radernie and Winthank, sold at from 2s. to 2s. 6d. 
per boll, old barley measure. Bone-dust has also been tried suc- 
cessfully in the rearing of turnips, but this will not prove such a 
benefit to this part of the country, from the wetness of the soil 
not admitting the turnips being eaten off by sheep, as it must be to 
the dry upland farms of Scotland. 

Improvements. — The condition of farm-buildings in the parish 
is in general good, and the offices well laid out for the various pur- 
poses of rural economy. The houses of the tenants are general- 
ly two stories high, and wide in proportion, - and most of the mo- 
dern buildings are covered with slates. In general agreements as 
to new erections and repairs, the tenant engages to drive the ma- 
terials, such as lime, stone, sand, wood, slate, &amp;c. and the land- 
lord pays for the erection of the buildings. In some instances also, 
with regard to the draining of land, the landlord pays for the open- 
' ing and laying the drains, the tenant quarrying the stones and car- 
rying them, which may be said to be for their mutual advantage. 
There is one thrashing-machine in the parish which has a steam 
power ; the rest are wrought by horses. The duration of leases is 
nineteen years, and perhaps, in a country where so much requires 
to be done, it would be better to extend the lease to a longer pe- 
riod, to encourage the tenant to improve his land, and allow him 
a sufficient time to reap the full benefit of his outlay. The greater 
part of the parish is already enclosed with hedges and dikes, and 
the enclosure of the rest is proceeding gradually. On the farm of 
South Lambielethara, the proprietor is at present opening all the

drains, the tenant being at the expense of quarrying the stones and 
driving them. Since the purchase of Kinaldie, lately, considerable 
improvements have been made by the proprietor, who has broken up 
part of the pasture, in which it has long lain, and js draining and 
liming it. He has also built a farm-steading, and made an excel- 
lent road to it. At Cameron also, a marked improvement has 
taken place within the last fourteen years, — a good road having been 
made to the farm, and a farm-house and steading built, enclosing 
the land by stone dikes, thorn and beech hedges, and by the 
drainage of the land. 

Produce. — The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as fol- 
lows: 

Grain of all kinds, . L. 14400 

Potatoes, turnips and hay, . 5700 
Land III permanent pasture, . lyoO

Total yearly value of rr.w produce raised, L. 24600 

V. — Parochiax, Economy. 
The nearest market- town is St Andrews, where there is a post- 
office and daily post, distant about 3i miles from the manse, which 
is situated about the centre of the parish. Ample means of com- 
munication are enjoyed by the inhabitants with the surrounding 
country. There is a turnpike road from St Andrews to the south 
coast, which passes through the centre of the parish, a little to the 
eastward of the manse, along which a coach from St Andrews to 
Largo passes three days a-week to meet the steam-boat from Edin- 
burgh. There is another turnpike from Newport ferry, opposite 
Dundee, to the Forth, which passes through the west part of the 
parish, and these are joined together by another at Higham Loan. 
A great improvement has taken place in the district within these 
few years, by the opening of a new line of road a little to the south- 
east of the manse, to the east, where it joins the St Andrews road 
to Anstruther at Wakefield. Formeily great inconvenience was 
experienced from the want of more direct means of communica- 
tion to the south and feast coast, as the only way at that time for 
a carriage was to go by the road leading by Balcarres dikes, which 
is now entirely obviated. There are ten bridges in the parish, and 
three leading into it, which are all in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is neariy in the centre of the 
parish, betwixt two and three miles distant from the extremities on 



312 



FIFESHIilE. 



the E. and W., and about two from the N. and S., and is in as 
centrical and eligible a situation as could well be fixed upon. It 
was built in the year 1808, and is a very plain building, covered 
with blue slate with a belfry on the west gable, and is at present 
in a good state of repair. The old church was in a very ruinous 
state before divine service was given over in it. The present in- 
cumbent has got drenched in the pulpit when preaching, and step- 
ping stones were placed along the passages, as after rain they be- 
came a complete sheet of water. The church is very neat in the 
inside, and is seated to contain 495 persons. There are none of 
the seats let j they are all apportioned to the different heritors, ac- 
cording to their valued rents, and they, with their tenants and ser- 
vants, occupy them. The manse was built to the present incum- 
bent, immediately after he was presented to the parish, in the 
year 1799, and cost L. 355. It received an addition, and got 
a repair in 1823, which cost L. 50, and is at present in good 
repair. The offices are old, and have little convenience. The 
glebe and garden, with the site of the manse and offices, con- 
tain 5 acres, 1 rood, 24 falls, Scotch, and is good land. The 
grass glebe contains 15 acres, and, except about an acre and a- 
half, is constantly in pasture ; part of it is bog, and some of it marshy 
ground, from which good meadow hay is got. The value of the 
whole may be about L. 10. The stipend amounts to 36 bolls, 3 
firlots, Specks, If hppies, barley ; 28 bolls of meal; 140 bolls, 2 
firlots, 1 peck, 2 lippies, oats ; and L. 24, 10s. 7d., with L. 8, 6s. 
8d. for communion elements. There is also payable from St An- 
drews parish, L. 144, 10s. Scotch of vicarage, the collecting of 
which is very troublesome,, being due by a great many properties in 
very small sums. There is one Burgher meeting-house situated on 
the border of this parish, adjoining the parishes of Kilconquhar 
and Carnbee, where there are a considerable population at a great 
distance from their parish churches. The number of famihes of 
Dissenters is computed at 12. 

Divine service is always well attended at the parish church. The 
average number of communicants is 450. 

Education. — There is one parochial school, the teacher of which 
has the maximum salary, which amounts to L. 34, 4s. 4id., a good 
dwelling-house and school-room, and rather more than the maxi- 
mum allowance of garden ground. The school fees may amount to 
L. 10 per annum. He also receives L. 3, 1 Os. as clerk to the heritors 
and kirk-treasurer, and L. 2, lOs. as session- clerk. There are like- 
wise two private schools, — one situated at Lawhead, and the othe 



CAMERON. 



313 



at Denhead, both depending on the school lees, and both having 
free school-rooms; a free dwelling-house being also attached to the 
latter. The branches usually taught at the parish school are, En- 
glish, English grammar, writing and arithmetic. The same branches 
are taught at the other schools. The school fees at the parish school 
are, for English grammar, per quarter, 3s. 6d. ; reading, 2s. 6d. ; 
writing and reading, 3s. ; reading, writing, and arithmetic, 3s. 6d. 
At the other schools each branch is 6d. per quarter higher. 

There are very few persons in the parish beyond the age of six 
years who cannot read and write. The people seem all very much 
alive to the advantages of education, and are anxious to give their 
children as much learning as possible. Children of paupers, and 
those whose means are very circumscribed, are educated at the pa- 
rish school gratuitously. Ample means of education are provided, 
and none of the children are so distant as to prevent attendance 
at school. 

Friendly Society.— About twenty years ago, a friendly society 
existed in the parish, but, from giving too large an allowance to 
members and widows, before the society had accumulated sufficient 
capital, it got into debt, and was dissolved by general consent. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— Theve are at present on the poor's 
roll 12 persons. The average sum allotted to each, per week, is 9d. 
There are, besides, a few who receive aid occasionally. They are 
all supported by the church collections, which amounted in the year 
ending 1835,- to L. 17, 12s.; and the rent of 2 acres 5 poles, im- 
perial of land, which was lately let by public roup at L. 7, 2s. 
In general the poor consider it as degrading to come upon the pa- 
rish, but there are instances to the contrary, where there is no 
reluctance to apply,, and no degradation felt to receive a regular 
support. 

Imis.—Theve are 8 houses in the parish licensed to sell whis- 
ky, and two where only beer is sold, which is more than are neces- 
sary for the convenience of the inhabitants. 

-Pwe/.— Plenty of coals can be procured at Drumcarro, in the 
parish, and at Largoward, bordering upon the parish, but situated 
in that of Kilconquhar,— which cost, on an average at both places, 
Is. 6d. per load of 3 cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The alteration in the appearance of the parish since the present 
incumbent first knew it, is very striking. Then, a great quantity of 
heath was to be seen from the windows of the manse, now it has 
altogether disappeared ; and instead of the comparatively barren

waste, neat enclosures and fields waving with yellow corn, meet 
the eye, allbi-ding a rich reward for the pains and industry of the 
cultivator, and producing abundance of food, by the bounty of that 
Almighty Being who governs the universe, both for man and beast. 
The quantity of wood now rising on all sides contributes to enrich 
the prospect, besides tending materially to alter the climate, in con- 
nection with the extensive system of drainage which is now pur- 
sued. 

The condition of the people is much improved. The article of 
potatoes has contributed materially to bring about this change, 
not only in affording nourishment to themselves, but in enabling 
them to acquire a considerable quantity of excellent bacon, which 
before could only be procured at mills, and at a high price. Tea 
has also become a new article of comfort and consumption, which 
the rise in the price of labour, since its introduccion into this coun- 
try, has enabled them to procure. The superior clothing, too, 
since the introduction of steam, forms another striking proof of the 
comfort of the peasantry. Formerly both the woollen and common 
spinning wheel were in constant use, now the former is never, and 
the latter is seldom to be seen, the cloth being to be had much 
more cheap in the shops than it can be manufactured at home. 

When this country was visited by that awful scourge, the Asia- 
tic cholera, by which so many millions of the human race were de- 
stroyed since 1817, meetings were held for the suppression of va- 
grancy in the district, as it was thought that vagrants, going from 
place to place, carried the infection along with them, and a con- 
stabulary police force was then appointed for its suppression, and 
is still kept up. The officer makes regular rounds with a book, in 
which entries are made by all respectable householders, of the num- 
ber, description and appearance of any vagrant, or stroUing mendi- 
cant, who may from time to time appear, with their supposed route ; 
who is thereby enabled to apprehend and lodge in jail, or pass to 
their proper places, all such vagrants and sturdy beggars as may 
he found in the district. Since this force has been appointed, the 
happiest results have followed ; the country being made free from 
those vagrants, who, when at times refused their exorbitant de- 
mands, poured forth torrents of abuse and oaths, and were not at 
all scrupulous in taking what they could lay their hands upon ; 
and our highways are now free from those exhibitions of squalor, 
filth, and deformity, with which they formerly abounded.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. WILLIAM FERRIE, D. D., MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Ceauniuchair and Kilconquhar are obviously Gaelic 
words. Ceaun signifies a head, part above, limif, extremity, termina- 
tion, luchair is a common name for a stream or rivei; especially a 
stream which issues from a lake. luchair is also applied to a fresh- 
water lake. Ceaun-Iuchair, without shiftinff one letter, signifies the 
extreme end, or upper extremity of the fresh-water lake, or the head 
or part above water. This is perfectly descriptive of the situation 
of the church, and church-yard or burying-place of this parish. It 
is an eminence on the edge, or at the head, of a fresh-water lake. 
The lake evidently at one time had covered all the low ground to 
the north and west, as well as to the south of the eminence, on which 
the church stands. Then, this eminence might very properly have 
been called the head of the lake, or part above water. Kil, as every 
one knows, signifies a cell, a church-yard, or place of worship; Kil- 
conquhar therefore signifies the cell, the burying-place, or place 
of worship at the head or extremity of the fresh water lake. On 
this spot, in all probability, there was a Druidical place of worship 
and a burying-place, long before the introduction of Christianity. 
When the old church was taken down in 1821, the foundation of 
the oldest part of it was from twelve to fifteen feet below the sur- 
face of the earth, although it was built on dry firm ground. Both 
within and without the building, to all this depth, immense quan- 
tities of human bones were found. There can be little doubt that 
this great accumulation of earth had arisen from the multitude of. 
human bodies that had been interred here. 

Extent and Boundaries.—This parish extends in length from 
Earlsferry on the south, to Bruntshields on the north, a distance of 
about 9 miles. Its average breadth is about 2 miles. It is bound- 
ed on the south by the Frith of Forth, and the parish of Elie; on 
the east, by the parishes of Abercrombie or St Monance, and 



316 



FIFESHIRE. 



Carnbee ; on the north, by Cameron and Ceres ; on the west, by 
the parishes of Largo and Newburn, and Largo bay. It contains 
about 16 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish, al- 
though somewhat irregular, is so level as to be nearly all arable. 
With the exception of Kincraig hill, the land in the south part of 
the parish is, generally speaking, flat, rising gently towards the 
north for four miles, till it reach Reres, and Kilbrachmont, which 
form part of a ridge 600 feet above the level of the sea, terminat- 
ed by Largo- Law on the west, and Kellie-Law on the east. To the 
north of Reres, a deep ravine separates the south from the north 
parts of the parish, making two nearly equal divisions. From this 
ravine, the land again rises gradually towards the north for two 
miles, till it reach its greatest elevation, 750 feet at Dunikier-Law. 
From this hill it declines towards the north for nearly two miles, 
when by a gentle acclivity it reaches Bruntshields, the northern ex- 
tremity of the parish. 

Various parts of the parish command rich -and extensive pros- 
pects. From Dunikier Law, the estuaries of Forth and Tay are 
seen at nearly equal distances, covered, in good weather, with ships 
carrying the commerce of the' country to and from every quarter 
of the globe. The land view here is very extensive, comprehend- 
ing the Angus-shire, Perthshire, and Argyleshire mountains on 
the north and west, and the Berwickshire hills on the south. 
From Reres and Kilbrachmont, but especially from Balcarres 
Craig, which projects a little more to the south, is one of the richest 
and most splendid views imaginable. Here, you look down upon 
all the richly wooded and highly cultivated lands, with the coast 
towns, and family mansions, from Dysart on the west, to Crail on 
the east ; — on the Frith of Forth with its ships and islands ; and 
beyond it, on the fertile county of East Lothian : while Edinburgh, 
with the Linlithgow and Pentland hills, terminate the view to the 
south-west, the Lamraermuir hills to the south, and the German 
Ocean to the east. 

Meteorology. — No regular meteorological tables are kept here. 
The temperature varies a little in the higher and lower parts of the 
parish, but the medium is about 47°. The climate is very salubri- 
ous, and the inhabitants are generally healthy. Diseases of an in- 
fectious nature rarely appear here. Colds and inflammatory af- 
fections may be said to be the most prevalent diseases. When 



KILCONQUHAR.

cholera morbus lately visited the country, this parish entirely 
escaped its ravages. 

We have certain prognostics of changes of weather. When 
clouds rest on Largo Law, we expect soon to have rain. When 
the wind blows from the west or north-west we have our best wea- 
ther. Wlien the sea is heard making a noise towards Ardross, or 
St Monance, we are sure soon to have bad weather from the east. 
When the same kind of noise is heard towards Kincraig, or up the 
Frith we expect the storm to abate. This noise is only heard 
when the wind is from the east. 

Hydrography. — Largo bay, which forms the S.W. boundary of 
the parish, from being protected by the bold headland or promon- 
tory of Kincraig, from the heavy seas, which roll with great fury 
along the shore in high easterly winds, affords a safe and excellent 
anchorage for ships, when detained in the Frith by E. and N. 
winds. It is not uncommon to see forty or fifty vessels of diffe- 
rent sizes, lying here in perfect safety, during heavy N. E. winds. 
In this bay stake-nets have lately been erected, and salmon are 
caught, although not -in great numbers. 

Kilconquhar loch is a beautiful sheet of fresh water, lying imme- 
diately to the south of the church and village, about two miles in cir- 
cumference, and half a mile in diameter, encircled with wood on 
the west, south, and south-east sides. This lake abounds with 
pike and eel, both of which are often caught of large size. In 
some parts it is very deep, and long in freezing. The oldest tomb- 
stone in the church-yard bearing an inscription, is upon the grave 
of " William Ballantine, laird of Kilconquhar, who was drown- 
ed skating on the loch, on the 28th February 1593, - aged 28 
years." Little or no water runs into the lake. It is supplied al- 
most entirely by springs. A clear and copious stream issues 
from it, and falls into the sea at Elie. This lake has long been a 
favourite haunt of swans.f There are thirty of these majestic

the result of their observations: Largo Law lies to the west, Kpllie Law to the east-

fowls upon it at present ; a few years ago there were fifty. The 
swans support themselves entirely by what they find in the water, 
except when it is frozen, when they require to be fed. They breed 
regularly, and would multiply fast, were it not that their nests are 
often destroyed in spring. - Wild duck, teal, and a great variety 
of water-fowls frequent the lake. In 1823, about twenty wild 
swans alighted in it during the severe weather, and remained till 
the storm abated, when they took their departure. 

No river runs through the parish, and only one brook or stream 
with water sufficient to drive machinery. This stream, which has 
different names, as it passes different places, takes its vise in the 
upper parts of the parish, and is increased by several small stream- 
lets as it descends. The water of this stream, with the assistance 
of dams, drives, in its course, five corn-mills, and one lint or flax 
mill. It falls into Largo bay, at Shooter's Point, and at its em- 
bouchure is the line of division betwixt this parish and that of 
Newburn. The streamlets, which take their rise to the north of 
Dunikier Law, run in a northerly direction, till they join some of 
the tributary streams of the river Eden, which discharges itself into 
St Andrews Bay. Copious springs, of excellent quality, are every 
where to be found in the parish, and rarely is any scarcity of wa- 
ter felt. 

Soil— There is considerable variety in the soil, but it is gene- 
rally fertile, and nearly all under cultivation. In the lowest, or 
most southerly part of the parish, it is light loam, with a mixture 
of sand. As you recede from the sea, it becomes deeper. Be- 
tween Kilconquhar and Colinsburgh, there is a strath of rich allu- 
vial soil, which extends in a south-easterly direction till it reach 
Balbuthie. From this strath to Colinsburgh it is more light and 
sandy, but sharp and fertile. All the rising ground above Colins- 
burgh, including the lands of Balcarres, Charleton, and the south 
parts of Reres and Killbrachmont, is a black loam, and being in the 
highest state of cultivation, yields abundant crops. To the north 
of Reres, the climate becomes colder, and the soil less uniform. 
Still it is, generally speaking, good, and in favourable seasons is very 
productive. From its elevation, in later seasons the crops are 
more uncertain.

' Geology.— r-The great independent coal formation characterizes, 
ihroiighout, the length and breadth of this parish. Our space, 
however, will permit us to give only a very general description of a 
district, which, both in a scientific and economical point of view, pre- 
sents a field of inquiry of the most interesting and important character. 

If a line be drawn from Kincraig Hill on the S. W. to Brunt- 
shields on the N. W., and another from Balbuthie quarry on the S. 
E. to Lingo Hill in the parish of Carnbee, about a mile and a-half 
beyond the N. E. extremities of this parish, a space of nearly 32 
square miles, will be included, every spot of which is occupied with 
some member of the coal formation, anda considerable portion of the 
whole included area, with the useful mineral itself. Three well 
marked divisions, at different levels and elevations, occur in the 
line of this course, which comprise separate and distinct coal 
fields, geographically as well as physically distinguished from each 
other. The first of these embraces the Grange or Earlsferry coal 
field, which lies along the shore, and inclines towards the sea ; the 
second includes the Reres and Balcarres coal district, inland about 
four miles, and elevated above the former upwards of 400 feet. 
Lathallan, Largoward, and Falfield coals, occupy the high table- 
land toward the northern limit of the parish, the last attaining an 
elevation of about 700 feet above the level of the sea. These se- 
parations, and elevations, of the once continuous beds of the 
coal measures, have obviously been occasioned by the interposition 
of the trap rocks, which occur so abundantly among them ; the 
principal ofwhich are Kincraig Hill, Balcarres Craig, Kilbrachmont- 
Knock, Reres Craig, and Dunikier-Law. Dislocations, and shift- 
ings, and upheavings, in every possible form and variety, are exhi- 
bited in each of the coal fields ; but, as may be naturally expected, 
these curious phenomena abound most in the upper or last division. 

Kincraig Hill, on the S. W. extremity of the parish, springs 
immediately from the beach, to the height of nearly 200 feet 
above the level of the sea. The southern aspect is nearly ver- 
tical, presenting to the surf a bold rugged front of precipitous 
rock. Here M'Dutf's cave affords an object of attention to all 
the lovers of the picturesque, while the student of geology, if 
he has courage to pursue his journey to the westward, will 
be amply rewarded for his exertions. In a line of section of 
little more than half a mile, nearly every member of the trap fii- 
mdy of rocks may be met with, basalt, greenstone, clinkstone.

amygdaloid, trap-tuffa, wacke, and clay-stone porphyry. The trap- 
tuffa and amygdaloid are beautifully reticulated by innumerable 
veins of calcareous spar, varying from a thin film, to several inches 
in thickness. The basalt is disposed in elegant columns, consisting 
ofsmall jointed pentagonal masses, which are piled upon one another 
in a regular and vertical order. These columns are sometimes 
collected into groups, which are separated from each other by 
seams or rents. The spaces between the jointed concretions are 
composed of a looser matter than the concretions themselves; and 
it is by the falling out of this less compact substance that the 
structure of the whole is so beautifully developed. Large masses 
or aggregations of columns, sometimes separate, and fall down into 
the sea, by the action of which they are broken into smaller frag- 
ments, when they are rounded and polished into a variety of forms. 
This basalt has a greyish-black colour, opaque, with a small con- 
choidal fracture, and is hard enough to cut glass, or to strike fire 
with a steel. 

Earlsferry point exhibits the same interesting appearances, be- 
tween which and Kincraig a small bay intervenes, where at low 
water the stratified rocks, and edges of the coal-field may be 
observed, in immediate contact with those of the trapean class. 
Sandstone, shale, and slate-clay occur here, all of them much al- 
tered, bat especially the shale, which is greatly indurated, having in 
some places the colour and texture of fire-brick. The slate-clay 
is converted into flinty-slate, and in such specimens the vegetable 
impressions are completely effaced. The shale contains a con- 
siderable quantity of ironstone nodules ; patches of sandstone, in 
the form of flattened globular concretions, also occur, which are 
invested with a bituminous or carbonaceous coating. The sand- 
stone affords abundance of the stems or trunks of trees, from an 
inch to several inches in diameter : the cortical part of these is 
entirely covered with regular impressions of leaves, ranging round 
them in spiral lines, and in the interior, an included portion re- 
sembling a cylinder may be observed, usually of a higher colour 
than the rest of the mass, and traversing it in a direction parallel 
to the axis of the stem. If this portion is to be considered as re- 
presenting the pith, the plants possessed of it, according to Stem- 
hauer, may justly be supposed to have constituted an intermediate 
order between the Palmaceae and Coniferse. 

Immediately to the east of this interesting series of rocks, the

KILCONQUHAR.

Grange coal-works are situated, the metals of which consist of nine 
seams; the largest being about eight feet thick. This coal-field 
is traversed by three trap dikes or veins, which have produced the 
usual effects upon the minerals, those in contact being charred, 
and in some places thrown into a vertical position. The strata in- 
cline to the west at an angle of 12°. 

As we approach the Balcarres coal-field, some very interesting 
sections may be observed, in the Den, of an alternating series of 
sandstone, shale, coal, and ironstone, and the manner in which 
these have been upheaved and altered by the igneous rocks. The 
stream, already mentioned, traverses this beautiful ravine for the 
space of nearly two miles, and has laid open the outcrop of the 
whole series, as they have been deposited one above another. To- 
wards the lower extremity of the Den, the attention is first arrest- 
ed by a projecting mass of trap-tulFa, which is very friable, and 
easily yields upon the slightest compression, its several component 
parts, consisting of shale, coal, sandstone, ironstone, clinkstone, 
basalt, varying from portions of half an inch to a foot or more in 
diameter, and which are all imbedded in a paste of claystone. This 
dike for such it may be considered, is very interesting, both by 
its great extent, stretching as it does from Kincraig Hill, to the 
opposite coast of Fife, where it may be observed to the eastward 
of St Andrews, forming the rock and spindle, and likewise by the 
proof it affords, from its composition, that it must have owed its 
origin to causes in action at a period long subsequent to the for- 
mation of the coal, and consolidation of the adjacent rocks. The 
strata dip from this towards the N. W., at an angle of 29°. The 
dip increases as they approach Balcarres Craig, where, a few hun- 
dred yards to the north, across the stream, the sandstone may be 
seen capping a mass of greenstone, and dipping nearly due north at 
an angle of 50°. Here the sandstone is very little indurated, though 
in immediate contact with the trap. Balcarres -Craig, which is a 
picture in itself, rising abruptly from the bottom of the ravine, to 
the height of 200 feet, and completely insulated from the surround- 
ing hills, consists of clinkstone split up, as may be observed on 
the south side, into tabular masses, and exhibiting on the top 
a considerable display of the columnar structure. It is of a dark 
bluish colour, close-grained, and compact, and has been mistaken 
for basalt ; but upon minute inspection, it will be found to pos- 
sess the qualities of a compact felspar or clinkstone rock. At the

entrance of tlie quarry a vein of greenstone occurs, a continuation 
in all probability of the mass noticed above. 

Balcarres Coal-field ranges westward from the Craig, dipping 
partly under it, as well as the Kilbrachmont ridge on the north. 
It consists of four seams, two of which are splint, the one 6, and 
the other '2 feet thick. The third seam, which is 3 feet thick, 
consists of common coal. The fourth is called " marl-coal," from 
the circumstance of its being split up, or separated into two seams 
by an interposed bed of that substance. A trap dike of 60 yards 
thick traverses this field from east to west, doing considerable in- 
jury to the minerals. The dip varies from 11° to an angle of 20°. 
Reres coal is nearly in the same line of elevation with that of 
Balcarres ; and has been compressed into a trough-hke form, 
stretching to about 800 yards across the edges of outcrop. This 
curious figure into which the strata have been thrown, termi- 
nating .in a semicircular end, has unquestionably been occasioned 
by the action of the trap rocks, by which it is almost surrounded. 
It also consists of four seams of coal of variable thickness. 

The upper division of the parish presents coal at Lathallan, 
Largoward, and Falfield. Dunikier-Law, the highest point in this 
range, is composed of fine grained basalt, arranged in large pen- 
tagonal jointed columns, and seems to be the centre from whence 
the innumerable dikes diverge, which have broken up into so many 
sectional patches the coal- metals of this interesting and disturbed 
district. In many places the coals are thrown upon their edges, 
dip in every direction, and at various degrees of inclination. Along 
with the varieties mentioned above, a bed of cannel or parrot-coal, 
of 2 feet thick, occurs in this quarter.  All the seams are more 
or less injured in the vicinity of the dikes ; and by the shifting and 
upheaving of the beds, much trouble and expense are occasioned 
to their respective owners. Is their gratitude to the bountiful 
. Giver and Architect of the whole rendered the less  Let them re- 
flect that by these very means, through the agency of these very 
faults and troubles, the useful mineral has been lifted from the 
bowels of the earth, and brought within their reach. Besides, 
when veins are filled, as is often the case here, with stiff clay, nu- 
merous springs are dammed up, and brought to the surface, there- 

 Falfield coal must have been worked for a considerable length of time, as an ac- 
count is to be seen at Largo House, of so many loads of parrot-coal, dnven yearly 
from Falfield to Falkland, for the use of King James VI. in his own chamber.

by facilitating greatly the process of working ; while, by means of 
the dikes of in jected matter which throw down the strata, valua- 
ble beds of coal are preserved within the field, which would other- 
wise have cropped out, and been lost altogether. " O Lord, how 
manifold are thy works  in wisdom hast thou made them all: the 
earth is full of thy riches I" 

Limestone is not so abundant in the parish as might be expect- 
ed from the geological character of the district, and what is found 
by no means bears the highest reputation. It occurs at Kilcon- 
quhar, where it has been worked for some years past, and also at 
Balcarres, and other places. At Kilconquhar, the rock is of a bluish- 
grey colour, compact or rather somewhat crystalline in structure, 
and contains abundance of encrinites and minute shells. In the 
upper district, few organic remains occur in any of the beds, which 
are all highly indurated, as well as much bleached in colour, oc- 
casioned probably by the expulsion of the bituminous matter through 
the agency of the igneous rocks. 

Travelled blocks or boulders occur along the sea shore, and still 
more abundantly in the higher districts. These consist chiefly of 
primitive greenstone, mica slate, and granite. Whatever may have 
been the cause of their transportation, whether we are to consider 
them as the result of the Noachian deluge, or regard them, with 
others, as produced and carried along by the bursting of lakes, in 
either case the agency must have been prodigious, as none of them 
are to be found in situ nearer than the Grampian mountains. The 
waters, too, which bore them along, must have swept oyer all our 
loftiest hills, or their elevation must have taken place subsequently 
to that event.

Woods or Plantations. — There are no natural woods in this pa- 
rish, but few parishes in Scotland are so richly covered with plan- 
tations. Most of the proprietors have their residences in the pa- 
rish, and round their mansions are extensive plantations tastefully 
laid out. Looking down from Reres on the inclined plain to the 
south, it appears like one richly wooded domain. The plantations 
of Balcarres, Charleton, Pitcorthie, Cairnie, Kilconquhar, and 
Elie, all seem to unite. Looking to the north from the same 
eminence, the woods around Lathallan and Gilston, with the 
thriving plantations of Kilbrachmont and Falfield, give to that 
hiffh district also a clothed and sheltered appearance. There are 
nearly 1000 imperial acres including hedge-rows under wood in 
the parish. The most valuable wood is around Balcarres, many 
of the trees being nearly 200 years old, and of large size. In 
Balcarres Den are nearly 100 acres of valuable hard wood, 
planted about eighty years ago. The trees are of great height, 
but, from being planted in a deep ravine, are little observed. The 
kinds of trees that seem to agree best with the soil and climate are 
ash, elm, oak, beech, and plane-tree. Larch, except in sheltered 
situations, does not thrive here. The genuine red pine or Scotch 
fir, which formerly used to be planted, and was a valuable wood, 
seems now to be supplanted by a soft yellow pine, having much 
the same appearance, but of such inferior quality as to be fit for 
little else than fire-wood. 

Zoology. There is nothing remarkable in the zoology. From 

our having so much wood we have great quantities of birds of all

the kinds common to the country, also a great deal of game, con- 
sisting of pheasants, partridges, hares, &amp;c. Roe deer are some- 
times seen in the plantations in the higher part of the parish, and 
there are great quantities of rabbits. There used to be two rabbit- 
warrens, one in the St Ford Links, a;nd one in the Grange or 
Earlsferry Links, hut, from the skins having fallen so much in 
price, the rabbits have been destroyed, and the greater part of the 
links have been ploughed.  

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — There are no printed nor manuscript 
historical accounts of this parish, so far as known to the writer, 
except the parochial registers, which commence in 1631, and have 
been regularly kept ever since. 

This parish originally comprehended the whole of the parish 
of Elie, and the barony of St Monance. Sir William Scott of 
Ardross, who was proprietor of all the lands now constituting 
the parish of Elie, got them erected into a separate parish in 1639, 
he becoming bound to furnish a church for the new parish, with a 
manse and glebe for the minister; and expressly stipulating, that 
the stipend then allocated on his lands, and payable to the minister 
of Kilconuhar, should continue to be so paid in all time coming. 

The late incumbent of the parish of Elie made an attempt to 
get the whole of the teinds, and raised a process before the Court 
of Session to get this agreement set aside. The heritors of Kil- 
conquhar appeared as defenders, and after some litigation the pro- 
cess was dropped. 

The present parish church of St Monance was a chapel in this 
parish previously to the annexation of that barony to the parish of 
Abercrombie in 1646. 

Burgh of Earlsferry.— burgh is very ancient. The ori- 
ginal charter was destroyed by fire in Edinburgh, and its date is 
not ascertained. A new charter was granted by James VI. in 
1589, which commences in these words : " James, by the grace 
of God King of the Scots, to all honest, good, and virtuous men 
of this land, aither cleriks or laiciks, greeting. Wit ye because we 
understanding the burgh of Earlsferry of old, past memory of men, 
was erected into ane free burgh, with ail privileges, liberties, free- 
doms, and immunities," &amp;c. By this charter all its privileges 

• Rookeries are encouraged here to a very liui tful extent. Crows are aUowed to mul- 
tiply so much as to prevent almost entirely the sowing of spring wheat, which would 
otherwise be cuHivated to a considerable extent, our light soil being well adapted for 
It. Wherever it is now sown, it is devoured by crows alighting in thousands upon 
It, and tearing up the seed just when it begins to point through the ground in spring.

were renewed and confirmed. The origin of tliis burgh is as- 
cribed to Macduff Thane of Fife, who, when fleeing from the 
usurper Macbeth, was obhged to take shelter in the cave already 
mentioned in Kincraig-ness, where, remaining in concealment for 
a time, he received great kindness from the fishermen of this vil- 
lage, who afterwards ferried him across the Frith to Dunbar. In 
return for these kind attentions, Macduff is said to have got Mal- 
com III. betwixt 1057 and 1093, to erect the village into a royal 
burgh, calling it Earlsferry, with the privilege, that the persons of 
all who should cross the Frith from this place should be inviolable, 
or safe from their pursuers, and that no boat should be allowed to 
sail in pursuit of them till they were half way across. A consi- 
derable trade seems at one time to have been carried on here. 
By the charter, the provost and bailies are authorized to hold two 
annual fairs and two weekly markets, and to levy dues and cus- 
toms. The want of a proper harbour, however, must always have 
been a great drawback to the trade of this place. Since the erec- 
tion of a pier, and the formation of a harbour at Elie, which is 
just adjoining Earlsferry, the trade has naturally been transferred 
to that port, and these weekly markets and annual fairs have long 
been discontinued. The burghs of Earlsferry, Falkland, Newburgh, 
and Auchtermuchty, some time prior to the Union, were reheved 
from the burden, as it was then esteemed, of sending commis- 
sioners, whom they were obliged to pay, to represent them in Par- 
liament. Being thus by their own desire disfranchised as burghs, 
they are now, with the other villages in Fife, thrown into the county 
constituency.. 

The minister of this parish had his manse and glebe at Earls- 
ferry, and resided there till 1717, when land was allotted for a 
glebe at Kilconquhar, and a manse built upon it. The proprietor 
of the estate of Elie gave the glebe at Kilconquhar in exchange 
for that at Earlsferry, which he bequeathed to the kirk-session of 
Elie, for behoof of the poor of that parish. The circumstance of 
the minister residing at Earlsferry, may account for the mscrip- 
tion of Macduff's Cross being engrossed on the title-page of the 
first volume of our parochial register.  

Mansion Houses.— There are six family residences in the pa- 
rish, viz. Balcarres, Kilconquhar House, Charleton, Lathallan, Fal- 
field and Cairnie.

The real rent of the parish is about L. 9000 per annum. 
None of the heritors have so low an income as L. 50 per an- 
num. 

The only noble family connected with the parish is that of 
Balcarres. 

The Earl of Balcarres is patron of the parish, and titular of the 
teinds. 

Family of Lindesay. — The first authentic mention of the family 
of Lindesay is in the time of David I. in 1188, when two brothers, 
Walter and William de Lindesay, stood high in this King's favour. 

The house of Lamberton sprang from Walter de Lindesay, and 
is now extinct in the male line. The last lineal descendant in the 
female line is the Duchesse d'Angouleme. The house of Craw- 
furd sprang from William. His descendants distinguished them- 
selves in Scottish history, and one of them was created Earl of 
Crawfurd in 1398. 

The family of Balcarres branched off from that of Crawfurd in 
1558, in the person of John, second son of David, eighth Earl of 
Crawfurd, Knight of Edzell. This John settled at Balcarres, which, 
with several other estates, were erected into a barony in 1592. 
He was one of the Octavians or secret council of eight, in whom 
the control of the Exchequer, and administration of public af- 
fairs, was vested after the death of Chancellor Maitland. His son 
David was created first Lord Balcarres, and his grandson Alex- 
ander first Earl. Alexander took an active part in favour of the 
exiled monarch, and died at Breda in exile in 1G60, immediately 
before the restoration of Charles H. His body was brought 
home and interred in the chapel at Balcarres. This chapel was 
built by David first Lord Balcarres, who was interred here, as also 
Alexander, already mentioned, Charles, Colin, Alexander, and 
James, all Earls of Balcarres, and the Honourable Robert Lind-

"say, second son of Earl James, to whose family the estate now 
belongs. The present proprietor is Colonel James Lindsay, late 
representative in Parliament of the county of Fife. 

The Earl of Balcarres is now a British peer, and resides on his 
estates in England. 

Sir Henry Lindesay Bethune, the proprietor of the estate of 
Kilconquhar, is also sprung from the noble family of Crawfurd, 
and represents the Lindesays of Pyatstone. Sir Henry was lately 
created a Baronet for his distinguished services in Persia, where, 
by his singular energy and ability as a soldier, he mainly contri- 
buted to place the present Schah on the throne. Sir Henry is 
now at the court of Persia, and holds a high command in the 
Persian army. 

The family of Gourlay, proprietors of Kincraig, have possessed 
this property upwards of 500 years.

The females exceed the males nearly 8 per cent., but the males 
bear a much nearer proportion to the females in the rural districts 
of the parish than in the villages. In the former, the females ex- 
ceed the males only 6 per cent., in the latter 11 per cent. This 
may be accounted for, by single women finding cheaper houses 
and more employment in the villages than in the countrj

The person who died in 1829 above 100 was a female who was 
born in this parish, and whose name and birth are recorded in our 
session books. She was one hundred years and four months when 
she died. She kept an inn or public-house in Colinsburgh for 
more than seventy years. She was of a placid cheerful disposition, 
was temperate, but said that she had never been particular as to 
what she ate or drank.

There are 655 families, counting each separate lodging a family, 
which make 4 for each family. Many single persons, however, 



330 



FIFESHIRE. 



occupy separate lodgings, so that families, properly so styled, must 
be considerably larger. 

The language spoken here, especially by the young, is better than 
in most parts of Scotland. This is owing chiefly to our having 
good schools, and the youth being in general better educated. 

There is nothing particular in the appearance, the manners, or 
customs of the people. They enjoy in a reasonable degree the 
comforts and advantages of society, and are generally contented 
with their condition and circumstances. It may be mentioned as 
a proof of the regularity of their conduct, that during the last 
twenty-three years, which is the period that the present incumbent 
has resided amongst them, there has not been an instance of a 
person belonging to this parish having been brought to a justiciary 
trial. 

The comfort in which the inhabitants live may appear from the 
circumstance of our bakers using annually about 1000 quarters of 
wheat in bread; and our butchers killing and selling weekly upon 
an average 12 animals, including bullocks, sheep, lambs, veal, &amp;c. 
Besides which, about 600 pigs are yearly fed and used by cot- 
tagers and others. Several families, too, in the higher ranks, use 
their own mutton, lambs, &amp;c. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture, according to the most improved system, is prac- 
tised here ; and in few parts of Scotland does the same extent of 
land produce so much corn, and other varieties of food. The 
whole parish except a few rocky spots, and what is covered with 
wood and roads, and about 200 acres of links, is either under til- 
lage, or laid down for pasture in an improved state, after being 
enclosed and drained. 

The system of cropping generally followed in the lower part of 
the parish is a rotation of four years, consisting of two green and 
two white crops, viz. first year grass ; second, oats ; third, potatoes, 
beans, or turnips ; fourth, wheat or barley with grass seeds ; wheat 
being commonly sown after potatoes, and barley after turnips. 
Where the green crop has been potatoes in the one rotation, it is 
generally turnips in the other, so that potatoes and turnips, wheat 
and barley, seldom occur more than twice or thrice on the same 
fields during the currency of a nineteen years lease. 

In the upper part of the parish, much of the land is laid dowii 
in grass for pasture, and when ploughed, a less regular rotation is 
followed. Little wheat is sown. Two crops of oats are frequently 
taken after grass ; and barley is generally sown after potatoes and 
turnips. 



KILCONQUHAR. 



331 



There are 28 farms of above L. 50 yearly rent ; 84 ploughs, all 
drawn by horses, no oxen being employed in husbandry here. 
Each plough has two horses, and each farm a spare horse, making 
about 200 horses employed in cultivating the soil. All the far- 
mers are in the practice of rearing young horses. These may be 
stated at one annually for every three working horses upon the 
farm ; and as they are not generally sold till they are three or four 
years old, they may be reckoned about equal in number to the 
others, making about 400; besides which there are about 30 
carriage and riding horses, making in all about 430 horses in the 
parish. 

About 250 cattle are annually fed upon turnips, and about an 
equal number on grass, so as to be fit for the butcher. A con- 
siderable part of these are bought by dealers from a distance, who 
drive them to the Glasgow or Dundee markets. Young cattle 
and milk cows may be about double that number, making about 
1500 cattle, young and old, in the parish. The kind of cattle 
bred here is the Fife, with a mixture of Teeswater in some in- 
stances. Considerable attention is paid to the breeding of cattle. 
The east of Fife Agricultural Society hold their meetings in Co- 
linsburgh, and give premiums to encourage breeders. Few sheep 
are kept except in parks round gentlemen's houses. Cheviot sheep 
are those most generally kept.

Masons and carpenters get from '2s. to 3s. per day. 

Farm Buildings. — Farm houses and offices are generally abun- 
dantly commodious, and kept in good condition. 

Fences. — In the lower part of the parish, where the soil is rich 
and constantly under crop, there are few enclosures ; they are con- 
sidered to be hurtful by harbouring birds, and by occupying land 
which would otherwise be made productive. In the upper part, 
where the land is more frequently pastured, it is generally enclos- 
ed with stone dikes, which are kept in good repair. 

Manufactures. — There are no spinning mills nor public manu- 
factures in this parish ; 235 persons are employed in weaving, 120 
males, and 115 females. The webs are generally got from Kir- 
kaldy, Kirkland, or Dundee, ready for the loom. Manufacturers 
in each of these places have agents here, for giving out, and tak- 
ing in the work. The kinds of cloth worked here are doulasses, 
checks, and sheetings. About fifteen young men in Earlsferry 
are employed in weaving sheetings from 3 to 4 yards broad, at 
which they can earn from 3s. to 4s. a day. 

The average earnings of all the weavers, male and female, in the 
parish may be about 8s. per week, or L. 4888 per annum. A 
great proportion of the men employed in weaving have also been 
bred to the sea. From thirty to forty used annually to go to the 
whale-fishing in summer, and return to the loom in winter. From 
that fishery having been so unsuccessful of late years, few now go 
to it. About twenty or thirty now go in the months of J uly and 
August to the herring fishing on the north-east coast of Scotland. 

All the manufacturing part of the population reside in the vil- 
lages. There is not a weaver in the whole of the landward part 
of the parish. 

Tan and Currying-works.— There is a tan-work in Kilconquhar, 
and a currying-work in Colinsburgh, carried on by the same com- 
pany, in which leather is manufactured to the value of L. 14,000 
or L. 15,000 per annum. From twenty to twenty-four men are 
employed in these works, to whom about L. 15 are paid weekly in 
wag es. 

• The following list will give a view of the professions and occupations of part of 
the inhabitants who have not been mentioned : 1 surgeon ; 1 writer ; 3 cloth-mer- 
chants 13 grocers ; 12 gardeners ; 9 bakers ; 3 butchers ; 16 tailors ; 29 shoen.akers ; 
50 wri'-l ts • 18 masons f 1 3 blacksnuths ; 1 tinsmith ; 2 saddlers ; 3 coopers ; 2 slat- 
ers risTationer ; 1 hous; painter ; 22 sailors; 12 public-houses; 90 persons employ- 
ed at coal works.

V, — Parochial Economy. 

Colinsburgh is a post-town, in which there is a weekly market 
for grain, attended by farmers and corn-dealers in the neighbour- 
hood. The corn is sold by sample, and is chiefly bought for ex- 
portation to Edinburgh, Glasgow, &amp;c. Besides the weekly mar- 
kets, there are two fairs annually for cattle in Colinsburgh, one in 
June and one in October. When the Agricultural Society meet 
in March to award their premiums, there is also a public market 
at which many cattle are sold. 

Bank.. — The Commercial Bank of Scotland have an agency 
here, which does a good deal of business. A Justice of Peace 
Court is also regularly held here. 

Means of Communication. — Two stage coaches pass daily 
through the parish, one from Anstruther to Edinburgh by Petty- 
cur, another from Anstruther to join the Largo steamer, which 
carries passengers to Edinburgh twice a-day in summer, and once 
a-day in winter. 

Excellent turnpike roads run in all directions through the pa- 
rish. The great road from the east to the west of Fife along 
the south coast, passes through it. Colinsburgh is a regular 
stage on this road. Here there is a good inn, with post-chaises 
and horses. There is also another line of turnpike road that runs 
from south to north, and which, in the northern parts of the parish, 
branches off in various directions leading to St Andrews, Cupar, 
Dundee, &amp;c. Carriers from this go weekly to Edinburgh, Kir- 
kaldy, St Andrews, Cupar, and all the towns on the coast. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which stands in the 
village af Kilconquhar, was built in 1820 and 1821. The plan 
was furnished- and the building erected by Messrs Dickson, ar- 
chitects, Edinburgh. It is a handsome building in the Gothic style 
of architecture, with a tower 80 feet in height. The church is 
conveniently situated for four-fifths of the population, but extreme- 
ly inconveniently for the inhabitants of the northern part of the 
parish, the extremity of which is at least seven miles distant. The 
church contains sittings for 1035; 50 sittings are allotted to the 
poor. 

The inconvenient situation of the church for the inhabitants of 
the northern parts of the parish has led to the erection of a chapel 
at Largoward, which was opened for public worship in September 
1835, and which, since that time, has been regularly supplied, by 
the presbytery furnishing supply the one Sabbath, and the minister 
of the parish providing it the other. A subscription has been made 



334 



KIFESHIRE. 



for supporting a preacher, who may reside in tlie district, and of- 
ficiate regularly in the chapel. This chapel is on the confines of 
two other parishes, Carnbee, and Cameron ; and within two miles 
of it is a population of upwards of 800, who are, some of them, 
seven, and all of them more than two miles, from their own parish 
churches. This is a locality where a new parish ought to be erect- 
ed, and to which the attention of the Royal Commissioners is now 
solicited. 

The manse and offices were built in 1815, and are in good con- 
dition. The glebe contains 12 acres, including the space occu- 
pied by the manse, offices, garden, &amp;c. The land is good, and 
may be worth L. 30 or L. 35 per annum. The stipend is J 7 chal- 
ders, one-half meal, and one-half barley, with L, 10 for communion 
elements. 

The number of persons belonging to the Established Church 
is 2300. Divine service, both in the church and chapel, is well at- 
tended. The number of communicants belonging to the Esta- 
blished Church is 1110; the number generally present at the 
time of the communion about 1000, 

Dissenters. — There are four dissenting meeting-houses in the 
parish, besides a small Baptist meeting. There is also a meeting 
house in Cameron parish, just on the borders of this, which hasas 
great an attendance of the inhabitants of this parish, and is as con- 
veniently situated for them, as any of the others. These meeting- 
houses contain as many sittings as would accommodate every man, 
woman, and child in the parish, allowing 18 inches to each. They 
contain upwards of 2700 sittings. Not 200 of these are let to, or 
occupied by, persons belonging to the parish. The number of dis- 
senters in the parish, young and old, of all denominations, is 361. 
The meeting-houses in the parish belong, two to the Relief, one to 
the United Associate Synod, and one to the Independents. The 
one in Cameron belongs to the United Associate Synod. One of 
the Relief meeting-houses in Colinsburgh, and the United Asso- 
ciate meeting-house in Kilconquhar, were some years ago sold for 
debt ; but by some arrangement they are still kept up as places of 
worship, and have ministers. The other Relief meeting-house in 
Colinsburgh is now faUing into ruins, and is almost deserted. The 
Independent meeting-house, although actually situated in this pa- 
rish, which runs close to the village of Elie, was built, and is sup- 
ported, so far as it has support, chiefly by persons in Elie. A very 
small number attend it. What stipends these ministers receive is 
not known. They must be very small. 



KILCONQUHAR. 



335 



There are 3 families of Episcopalians in the parish, and 51 
persons belonging to no religious communion, although some of 
them occasionally attend the Established Church. 

We have a society for church purposes, composed of members 
of the Established Church, which distributes annually about L. 30 
for the support and extension of the gospel. 

Education. — There are six schools in the parish. Th e parochial 
schoolmaster in Kilconquhar has a salary of L. 34, 2s. 4d. being 
the maximum. The heritors also allow a salary of 100 merks for 
a school at Largoward, where the chapel is built. The other four 
schools have no salary. There is also a female school at Kilcon- 
quhar. The number of scholars attending all the schools is about 
450, or a sixth part of the population. 

The branches taught in the parish school are English, writing, 
arithmetic, Latin, Greek, French, book-keeping, geography, al- 
gebra, Euclid's Elements, trigonometry, mensuration, navigation. 
The number of scholars studying Latin in this school for the last 
two years has been '28, in 1834 the number was 33. This school 
is remarkably well taught, and the teacher Mr M'Laurin, having 
a commodious house, has 16 boarders from different parts of the 
country. An usher is kept to assist in teaching this school. In 
the other schools the more ordinary branches only are taught. The 
people in general are alive to the benefits of education. All the 
children are within easy reach of some of the schools, and are 
taught to read and write. 

Friendly Societies. — There were several friendly societies in the 
parish, but, from miscalculation of the allowances to be made to 
their sick and poor members, they have all been broken up. 

Savings Bank. — We have a savings bank, but, from there being 
now a branch of the Commercial Bank in Colinsburgh, few com- 
paratively speaking take advantage of it. 

Poor. — The average number on the regular poor's list for the 
last ten years has been 36. About two-thirds of these either are 
Dissenters, or have been Dissenters. These proportions have been 
nearly the same for the last twenty years. The Dissenters here 
do not provide for their poor, nor do they contribute any thing to 
the poor's funds of the parish. If they give any thing to the poor, 
It is unknown to the kirk-session, and must be confined to those of 
their own communion. They give nothing to any of the poor of 
the Establishment. 

The following table will show the amount and application of 
disbursements for the poor, for the last seven years : —

The average amount of collections for the poor at the church 
door, for the last seven years, has annually been L. 66, Is. 4d. 
The interest of money belonging to the kirk-session L. 38 ; pro- 
clamation dues, L. 2, 4s. 3d; mortcloth do. L. 3, lis. 9d., making 
in all L. 109, 17s. 4d. The remaining sum has been raised by 
a voluntary contribution from the heritors according to their va- 
lued rents. 

Prisons. — There is a jail in Earlsferry in a very wretched state, 
but fortunately we rarely have occasion to use it. 

Observations. 
Local Advantages.— This parish has many local advantages. 
Being near the sea, we are abundantly supplied with all the varie- 
ties of fish caught on the coast. We have a plentiful supply of 
coals, which are sold at the mouth of the pit, at 5s. per single 
horse cart-load. We have a much greater quantity of all kinds 
of agricultural produce than can be used in the parish. 

Improvements. — Since the date of the former Statistical Account, 
great improvements have been made in agriculture, particularly in 
draining and turnip husbandry. Buildings of every description are 
greatly improved, especially farm-houses, which, from being gene- 
rally small and covered with thatch or tile, are now large and com- 
modious, and finished in a style that would have bfeen thought 
extravagant forty years ago. Thrashing-mills are now universal, 
wherever the farms are of any considerable extent. There are 
23 thrashing mills in the parish, which are still driven by horses. 

A new era is commencing for the lessening of labour, by the in- 
troduction of steam engines. There are as yet only six steam en- 
gines in the parish, and only one of these is applied to a thrashing 
mill, namely, at the farm of Balniel Den, the property of Colonel 
Lindsay. It may safely be predicted, that, before another half 
century elapses, it will be as uncommon to see a thrashing mill 
driven by horses, as it now is to see corn thrashed with flails. 

The number of persons qualified to vote for a Member of Par- 
liament is 70.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE.  

THE REV. ROBERT SWAN, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

From authentic documents refered to by Sir John Connell in 
his History of Tithes, Abercrombie or Abercrumbin appears to 
have been a parish so far back as 1174. 

Ancient and modern name of the parish. — From that time and 
it cannot be ascertained how long before till 1646, the original 
name was uniformly and exclusively given to it. Towards the 
close of that year, an addition which it then received, quoad sacra, 
mduced upon it a twofold and less determinate designation. The 
addition alluded to was the barony of St Monan's, the property 

• There were several concurring circumstances which recommended and facilitated 
this annexation. The parish church of Abercrombie, of great but unknown antiqui- 
ty, had become so rumous as to be totally unfit for a place of worship. In the baronv 
of St Monan's, there stood invitingly the unoccupied chapel which went by the same 
name, greatly ddapidated in some of its compartments ; yet with so much of it en- 
tu-e, and under cover, as to make it serviceable if such an arrangement could be ef. 
fected as a parish church for the people of Abercrombie, being nearer to the bulk 
ot the inhabitants than their original place of worship, while it was also much nearer 
than their own parish church, to such inhabitants of Kilconquhar, as were situated 
in the south-eastern parts of the parish,, and adjoining to Abercrombie. In these 
circumstances, the idea appears to have been taken uji by Sir James Sandilands of St 
Monans, and cordially entered into by the Presbytery, of having his barony, with its 
ready made church, disjoiiu'd from the parish of Kilconquhar, andannexed to that of 
Abercrombie, in which there was now no church that could accommodate the pa- 
ruhioners. The other great heritor, my Lord Abercrombie, also a Sandilands and 
near relation of Sir James, saw this to be a desirable arrangement. It removed no 
doubt his usual place of worship to a considerably greater distance than before • but 
It was obtaining a substantial edifice for that purpose, and abandoning one inconven 
ently situatea for the parish at large, and hastening to ruin. 

It was expressly stipulated by the competent parties, that the arrangement fbrief- 
y referred to  should be without prejudice to the minister of KilconqtZr, who was 
to draw as hitheito the temd. of St Monan's barony ; and the minister of Ab xrombie

of Sir James Sandilands, in the immediately adjoining parish of 
Kilconquliar. 

For some time after the annexation, the parish was designed in 
the Presbytery records, " Abercrombie with St Monance." In the 
course of years, Abercrombie was gradually dropped, and St Mo- 
nan's came to be the sole designation. 

Soon after the induction of the present incumbent. May 1804, 
Abercrombie, agreeably to the wish of the principal heritor, was 
revived as the proper name of the parish, and applied to it in all 
public documents. 

The village of St Monan's takes its name from a hermit 
or religious recluse, belonging to a neighbouring monastery Pitten- 
weem, who, in the sixth century, when eremite devotion was 
more prevalent than now, is said to have had his abode here. The 
precise spot pointed out as his habitation, is now sheltered by the 
tiles and gray eaves of a byre, situated in a snug recess amongst the 
banks, walls, and ruinous tenements at the west end of the village, 
with a dusky-coloured mass of rock hard whinstone overhanging 
it behind, and a stair or gulley winding past it in front. This 
parish is situated upon the northern shore of the Frith of Forth, 
nearly opposite to North Berwick Law, and about midway be- 
twixt Fifeness and Leven-water, from each of which it is about ten 
miles distant. 

Boundaries and Figure.— It is bounded by the parishes of Elie 
and Kilconquhar on the west, that of Carnbee on the north, and 
north-east, of Pittenweem on the east, and by the Forth on 
the south. The parish forms nearly a parallelogram ; its breadth 
from east to west an English mile, its length from south to north 

a mile and a-half. 

Topographical Appearances.— Therek a very abrupt ascent from 
the low and rocky beach, consisting of sandstone and limestone, to 
the arable part of the parish. This arable land, in about a quarter of 
a mile, declines to the north ; it afterwards reascends gently, till it 
reaches its highest elevation at the farm-house and steading of 
Abercrombie. 

From this point the ground falls in all directions, stretching 

nance in a parish, and Sir James Sandilands desired to secure what he conditions 
to that purpose." After various other steps of procedure, the business was closed, 21st 
of October 164C , and accordingly, 20th December that year, it was duly intniiated, 
that the next day, and in all time coming, the place of meeting for service shall be at 
the kirk of St Monan's, because, &amp;c. &amp;c.

north-west, almost in a dead level, to the extremity of the parish. 
There are, however, undulations of the surface which give beauty 
and variety to the landscape, now greatly improved by the thriving 
and well disposed plantations of Sir Ralph A. Anstruther. 

The climate is mild and salubrious. In winter and early spring 
there are occasionally violent gales from the south-east, of several 
days continuance. The effect of these is the detaching and bring- 
ing ashore an immense quantity of sea-weed, which the farmers 
on Sir Wyndham Anstruther's estates secure with great alacrity, 
as making excellent manure. 

Hydrography.— In striking contrast to our southern boundary, 
the majestic Forth, we have, as our boundary on the west and 
north-west, the small stream anciently called Inweary, rising in 
adjacent marshes in Kilconquhar parish, and, after a course of two 
miles, faUing into the Forth close by the old church of St Monan's. 

On the north-east we have the burn of Dreel, arising in the 
heights of Baldutho, and after a course of five or six miles, with 
Carnbee and West Anstruther parishes on the left bank, and Aber- 
crornbie and Pittenweem on the right, falling into the Forth at 
West Anstruther. 

There are several perennial springs in the parish, the water 
excellent, and well adapted for all domestic purposes. The rain- 
ing connected with the coal is said to have drained some of the 
prmcipal wells. There is a spring within high- water-mark, and 
supposed to be of a ferruginous quality. 

Geology.— The position of the rocks along the sea shore is 
much diversified, and their stratification very varied. The geo- 
logical history and character, or probable origin of the rocks, in 
their various dips and bearings, the present incumbent does not 
pretend to give in scientific phrase. But if there be a feature es- 
pecially prominent in the rocks, which bristle upon our formidable 
shore, it is, that, consisting of sandstone, limestone, and till, they 
run out from the land in parallel ridges, of different elevations. 

The direction of these ridges is from N. E. to S. W., and their 
dip to the S. E. in various angles to the horizon. 

A wider opening than occurs in general betwixt these ridges, 
about 200 feet presents an obvious and natural harbour, oppo- 
site to the middle of the village. The sides of this inlet, in- 
stead of dipping like consecutive ridges in one direction, expand 
and mutually fall back, forming a spacious entrance, of which due

advantage has been taken in forming the harbour, afterwards no- 
ticed. 

Coal — There are said to be six seams of coal in the barony of 
St Monan's, splent and cherry. Those seams range in thickness 
from 18 inches to 7 feet. In former times the coal here was 
wrought to the depth of ten fathoms; but it had been given 
up for twenty-five years, when it was resumed, about nine years 
ago, the shafts being driven to the depth of 27 fathoms. For 
eighteen months, the working of the coal has been wholly aban- 
doned, owing to the tacksman not having capital to meet the re- 
quisite outlay, and the engine not having been judiciously placed. 
Wrought in an effective manner, it might have afforded employ- 
ment for one hundred persons. The number actually employed 
is said not to have exceeded thirty. It is believed that a person 
or company of capital and enterprise, might make the coal here a 
very profitable concern. » 

There are understood to be several seams of coal in the lands 

of Abercrombie. 

Limestone.— i:heve is abundance of limestone in the immediate 
vicinity of the village, and held to be of excellent quality. So 
rapidly, however, is it found to dip to the south-east, and so deep is 
the tirring required, that the working of the limestone has not been 
found to pay. It was also much against the burning and sale of 
the lime, that the working of the coal came to be finally abandon- 
ed. 

The limestone rock, or dike, as it is technically termed, goes very 
deep, and is understood to be continued under and across the vil- 
lage, till it reappear, with very prominent features, running like the 
other ridges on each side of it, on to the sea. 

/roTistone.— Ironstone is found in considerable quantities upon 
the beach. There are regular bands or bars of ironstone imbed- 
bed in the till ; but it is chiefly found in the form of small stones, 
of one or two pounds weight. The proportion of iron to the whole 
of the ironstone is from 18 to 12 cwt. in the ton. The tacks- 
man of the ironstone receives for it, when shipmasters take it as 
ballast, 9s. per 24 cwt. 

Soils.— T\\e nature of the soil is well described by the late in- 
cumbent. It is a light loam, and friable, with very little clay, all 
quite free of stones, and very fertile and manageable. It is pe- 
culiarly well adapted for green crops, but yields all the usual crops 
in abundance.

II. — Civil History. 

Ancient or Modern Accoimts.—The most ancient original docu- 
ment connected with the parish that I have seen, is a charter 
granted to the feuars of St Monan's by Sir WiUiam Sandilands, of 
date 1622. One of the most important clauses in this instrument, 
IS that by which the « said bailies, council, feuars, and inhabitants 
of our said town of St Monance, their heirs and successors, shall 
be holden and restricted to repair, beet and uphold the kirk and 
kirk-yard dikes of St Monance, in timber, slate, lime, and glass, 
sufficiently, as effeirs, in all time coming." This clause, as we shall 
see, was not lost sight of by the heritors of future days. 

Occurrejices, fc— The most memorable occurrences with us 
are losses by sea, from swamping of boats and other accidents. In 
the course of the present incumbency, now running thirty-three 
years, four boats have perished with five valuable lives in each, one 
with four, and another with three. 

These boats' crews are generally composed of near relations, and 
hence the catastrophe becomes the more afflicting to survivors. 

It often falls to the minister to intimate such disasters. Sus- 
picions have probably been already awakened; and his appearing 
at an unusual hour, confirms the worst fears, and produces the 
most heart rending lamentations. 

It would seem a sanctifying of these severe dispensations, that 
they awaken and bring into substantial exercise a great deal of 
good feeling,— not only among the parishioners, but throughout the 
country at large. Upon occasion of a late signal catastrophe, in 
which our neighbours at Pittenweem deeply shared, there were up- 
wards of L. 700 subscribed for the families of the suff-erers. Gen- 
tlemen in the neighbourhood not only gave their money, but their 
humane and particular attention, to the best disposal of the funds 
which were raised. Much praise is due on this account to Sir 
Kalph Anstruther, Colonel Lindsay, Mr Smythe, Mr Nairne and 
others. ' 

Eminent Characters.-Theve is one person of note in Bri- 
tish history, connected with the parish, if not by birth, by 
residence and burial. Lieutenant- General David Leslie He 
was son of Lord Lindores in Fife, and, according to Sibbald, 
History of Fife, Cupar edition, 1803, p. 335, created Lord 
Newark by Charles 11. The name of Newark had belonged to the 
residence of Sir James Sandilands, who was also designed of St

Monan's. The property having become David Leshe's by pur- 
chase, he was, in 1661, ennobled by the name of this acquisition. 

The writer of this account has always understood, that this is 
the General Leslie who made so distinguished a figure in the un- 
happy civil wars in the middle of the seventeenth century. He 
defeated Montrose at Philiphaugh, 13th September 1645, for 
which acceptable service the Parliament voted him 30,000 marks, 
and he completely suppressed the civil war in Scotland in 1647. 
When Cromwell invaded Scotland, 1650, Leslie had the chief com- 
mand of the Scottish army, in which capacity he sustained a signal 
defeat. The history of this catastrophe battle of Dunbar is well- 
known. Suffice it to say, that no blame can be imputed to the Ge- 
neral. Like Fabius Maximus, he was maintaining a commanding 
situation, which put Cromwell's army almost entirely in his power; 
but he allowed himself to be importuned out of his fastness, and 
precipitated into a battle by the inconsiderate zeal of the Committee 
of Church and State, and the consequence was, his disastrous 
overthrow, 3d September 1650. Justice was done to the abilities 
of the unfortunate general, who was acquitted of misconduct, and 
restored to the command from which he had been suspended for 
a time. 

There is to be found in Douglas's peerage a high testimony to 
Leslie's character, under the hand of Charles IL whom some of 
the General's enemies had endeavoured to prejudice against him, 

10th June 1667. . 

Chief Land-owners.— The chief land-owners of the parish are. 
Sir Ralph Abercromby Anstruther, Bart., of Balcaskie, and 
Sir Wyndham Carmichael Anstruther, Bart., of Anstruther and 
Carmichael. Neither of them have their residence in the parish, 
— Sir Ralph's mansion being situated in the adjoining parish of 
Carnbee, and Sir Wyndham's in that of Elie. There is not much 
difference in their respective valuations. Sir Ralph's being L.1486 
Scots, and Sir Wyndham's L.1207, 13s. 4d. Scots. Their actual 
rent roll I have not ascertained, but should suppose it to amount 
to about L. 2200 a-year. 

Mr Mackie has a feu of three kcres holding of Sir Wyndham. 
He pays of stipend 2 quarters, 1 bushel, 2 pecks of barley. Mr 
Elder has a feu of about 7 acres, holding of Sir Ralph, but pays 

no stipend. ti i i f 

There is only one other landholder in the parish. He has but 
a few acres, and there would appear to be no stipend exigible.

Registers. — The earliest entry in bur parochial registers is 16th 
April 1597. It is very brief, and not very legible. It appears to re- 
cord the settling of an account. Matters of discipline are often be- 
fore the session, and the discipline extends to all manner of delin- 
quencies. The first volume, commencing as just stated, ends in 
1638; the second begins 1641, and ends 1660; the third begins 
1664, and goes on to 1681. There is then a blank till 2d No- 
vember 1689, when volume fourth begins with the ordination of 
Mr Walter Wilson. From that time to the present day, the mi- 
nutes of session have been kept regularly, and the cash-book carried 
on along with them occasionally. This has been the case, indeed, 
from August 1689, to August 27th 1789. From that date the 
minutes have been kept distinct from cash concerns, there being a 
current book for each. The first trace that I can perceive of a 
marriage register is in 1684. There are only three entries of births 
and baptisms before 1707. From that period there is a more 
regular register of marriages and baptisms, and also of burials. 
There is an heritors' book besides those strictly sessional, and all of 
them during the late and present incumbency of session-clerk have 
been kept with commendable accuracy. 

Antiquities. — Our most noted antiquity is the church, which 
will be afterwards adverted to. As to other antiquities, our report 
must be almost wholly negative. The old ruinous mansion-house 
of Newark is an interesting object, but there is nothing peculiar in 
its structure. 

The situation is striking : Standing directly south''and north, its 
southern gable has closely opposed to it a precipitous rock, which 
rises high above the level of the sea, so that there is no passing 
betwixt the wall and the precipice. The northern half has a roof 
in tolerable repair. The ground storey is occupied by dark vaults. 
The middle and upper storeys afford comfortable dwelling-houses 
to the servants upon the farm of Newark. They did so at least 
till of late. In the opposite extremity of the parish, nearly a mile 
and a-half from the house of Newark, there is still to be seen the 
old and ruined parish church of Abercrombie, abandoned as a 
place of worship for 190 years. It stands in a sequestered and 
romantic situation, nearly in the centre of the original burying- 
ground, and close upon Sir Ralph Anstruther's enclosures and plan- 
tations. It is the burying-place of the family of Balcaskie, and of 
the minister of Abercrombie and family. A few families of the 



FIFESniRE. 



adjacent tenantry still use the burying-ground, Abercrombie being 
the oldest remembered site of their ancestors. 

III. — Population. 

Population in 1775, by return to Dr Webster, 780 
in 1790. - - 832 

in 1821, - - 912 

in 1831, - - 1110 

The increase within the last ten years is partly to be accounted 
for by the working of the coal ; since the coal ceased to be 
wrought, there has been a marked diminution of the population. 

There are about 130 of the population in the country, and 884 
in St Monan's. 

Births. — The average of births cannot be given with so much 
certainty, as were desirable,— from the neglect of many parents in 
giving in their children's names for registration. But the whole 
number from 1828 till 1833 inclusive, is 59, which gives an ave- 
rage of 9f for each year. 

The average of deaths in six years, appears from a register 
which was for some time kept by the minister, to be 19i. 

Families.— T\\e number of families in the parish by the minis- 
ter's last visiting hst is 248. 

I do not know more than one bachelor above fifty years old m 
the parish, but there are at least 12 widowers of that age, and 
there are 19 unmarried females above forty-five. 

In 1828, there died in the parish, in his ninety-second year, in 
full vigour both of body and mind, a respectable farmer, whose an- 
cestors and himself had occupied the same farm on the Aber- 
crombie estate, for nearly 300 years. His name was John Cow- 
per, and his son Robert still keeps possession. 

There are two male parishioners of ours, at present boarded m 
the Dundee Lunatic Asylum. The "board of one of these unfor- 
tunate persons is defrayed out of his own funds, that of the other 
by the kirk-session and heritors. We have three fatuous persons 
at home, not strictly under coercion, and all of them maintained 
by their respective families without parochial assistance. These 
last mentioned were born without apparent defect either of body 
or mind. Their present unhappy state is to be ascribed to very 
severe sickness in early life. 

• There is every reason to believe, that it is of this stationary family, that the ad- 
mirable William Cowper of Olney thus writes to one of his friends, Mrs Courtenay.J 
" While Pitcairne whistles for his family estate in Fifeshire, he will do welMt lie 
will sound a few notes for me.. I am originally of the same shire, and a family or 
my name is still there."— »,r Ditmkr. Courier, Janumy 11, 1822.

There are no blind, deaf, or dumb in the parish. 

Character and Habits of the People. — The people on the whole 
are most industrious, and enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts 
of society. In most of the fishermen's families, there is at times a 
striking air of comfort. For the wet, hungry, and weary fisher- 
man at sea since two or three o'clock in the morning there is 
a blazing fire, and a clean substantial breakfast set out, to which 
he sits down with much relish and enjoyment. The ordinary food 
of the peasantry at their meals is oatmeal, potatoes, fish, and in 
most families, in the country part of the parish, a little pork of 
their own rearing-. 

During the last three years there have been 4 illegitimate births 
in the parish.

Produce. — The average gross amount of grain raised in the pa- 
rish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is, say 

Wheat, barley, oats, beans, L. 2700 

Potatoes and turnips, . J7oO 

Hay cultivated, . . . 600 

Pasture, . . 330 

L. 5380 

Rent. — The rent of land varies from L. 1, 14s. to L. 3, 4s. per 
imperial acre. The greater part of the rent is paid in grain, and con- 
sequently fluctuates according to the county fiars. The average 
rent of the parish under cultivation may be taken at L. 2, 5s. per 
acre. A lease of twenty-one years has just expired ; the rent was 
one-half boll wheat, do. barley, do. oats, and L. 1, Is. The same 
farm is now let at an equal amount of grain, and L. 1, 3s. per acre. 
For pasturing a full-grown ox or cow during the season, L. 3. 

Husbandry. — The usual rotation upon easy land is grass broken 
up for oats; oats followed by potatoes or turnips. If potatoes, wheat 
succeeds, the wheat laid down with grass. This is used for one 
year for cutting grass or hay, and pastured perhaps for a year, and 
again broken up for oats. Such is the outhne of our husbandry. 
As the soil is lighter or stronger, there occur of course varieties of 
culture. Upon the whole, it coincides entirely with the agriculture 
of the surrounding district. 

For potatoe ground to the people of St Monan's the farmer re- 
ceives 2s. for the row of 100 yards, provided the people aff'ord the

manure. If he afford ground, labour, and manure, he draws 4s. per 
100 yards. The best manure, that which fishing towns afford, is 
estimated at 5s. a load. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 

Farm-Buildi7igs. — The farm-buildings are in general commo- 
dious and in good repair. There are some of the recently erecl 
ed steadings uncommonly extensive, convenient, and substantial. 
The inclosures being in general hedge and ditch, there are few 
of them sufficient fences, otherwise there would be a greater pro- 
portion of the land occasionally in pasture. 

With the exception of the undivided common above-mentioned, 
there are no waste grounds to reclaim. Draining has been and is 
still successfully carried on. 

IVages. — A good labourer receives from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. per day. 
Lifting potatoes Is. a-day and dinner. Harvest wages Is. 6d. a-day 
from breakfast. The whole harvest for men, L. 2 with bounties, 
viz. potatoe and lint ground, with supper meal. The whole harvest for 
women, L. 1, 13s. with bounties as above. Mechanics, such as ma- 
sons, Wrights, &amp;c. have never under 2s. a day, and 2s. 6d. in sum- 
mer. The common rate of wages for farm-servants is about L. 10, 
with a house, 6 bolls of oatmeal, 3 chopins of milk, with potatoe- 
ground. Female servants receive L. 3 in the half year, exclusive 
of tea-money. 

Quarries. — We have a quarry of excellent freestone, but with 
too much superincumbent earth to pay the working of it. 

Fishery. — This is one of the principal fishing stations on the 
east coast of Scotland, and, including men, women and children, 
it may afford their chief occupation to about 300 individuals. The 
children, before they are able for harder work, go in great numbers, 
and to a distance of some miles, to gather bait. The women bait the 
lines. The men, including boys from fourteen to eighteen, go a-fish- 
ing. The herring-fishery is the great concern with our people. There 
is a partial herring-fishery, comparatively near to our own shores, in 
the winter and spring months. But it is the Caithness or north coun- 
try fishing which forms the great object of attention to our people. 
From the latter part of June, and to the middle of July, they are 
in a bustle of preparation. The number of the boats fitted out 
is twenty-six, at fifteen tons each. The complement of men for 
each boat is five, in all 130 for twenty-six boats. St Monan's 
does not furnish that number. There may be two men to each 
boat, strangers, finding employment in our boats. These are cal- 



ABERCROMBIE. 



347 



led half-deal men, from the limited proportion they receive of the 
profits, which is reasonably so limited, because, while they furnish 
their own nets, they have no property in the boats. The follow- 
ing may be taken as a tolerably accurate statement of the cost of 
fitting out one of our principal boats for sea. Boat with all her 
tackling and appurtenances, L. 85 ; 20 nets at L. 4 each, L. 80 ; 
provisions, L. 30. Every net is about 50 yards long, and fifteen 
score meshes wide, 32 meshes in the yard, the mesh 1 j of an inch. 
The engagement which our people enter into with the fish-dealers 
is for six weeks ; but the bargain is understood to have been im- 
plemented by the fishers of any one boat when they have caught 
250 barrels, in howsoever short a time. 

Cod-fishing for export is carried on to a considerable extent here. 
The packing furnishes employment and maintenance to many fe- 
males. This fishing, however, is of very limited duration. When 
the herring disappear in the end of winter, it ceases of course, as 
it is with herring-bait that the cod are taken. 

The cod, when cured, are sent to the London and Liverpool 
markets. Haddocks, turbot, cod, &amp;c. are, in their several seasons, 
sent in great quantities to the Edinburgh market, and also supply 
our own adjacent country by means of cadgers and fish-women. 

Besides 26 boats of about 15 tons, there are perhaps 14 yawls 
of 7 tons. 

Manufactures. — We have only four weavers in the parish, and 
these have sometimes other occupations. 

The working of nets is a very general occupation among the 
young. They will make at the rate of 9d a day. Kelp has long 
ago ceased to be a profitable concern, nor has there been any made 
these many years. We have in St Monan's a very extensive malt- 
ing and brewing concern. 

Navigation. — There are two trading vessels belonging to the 
port ; a schooner seventy-eight tons old register ; a sloop be- 
longing to the same owners, forty tons old register. These vessels 
are chiefly employed in the coasting-trade. It is very seldom that 
we are visited by foreign vessels. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

St Monan's can hardly be called a market-town, in the proper 
sense of the word. It is a burgh of barony holding of Newark. 
It has three bailies, a treasurer, and fifteen councillors. The feu- 
ars choose the baihes, and the bailies the councillors. There are 
twelve constables annually chosen. 



348 



l-'IFESHIRH. 



Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Pittenweem, about 
a mile and a half distant; it is also the nearest post-town. 

Village. — The only vestige of a village in the parish, exclusive 
of St Monan's, is Abercrombie. It contains the manse and offi- 
ces, two farm-houses with their extensive offices, a wright and a 
smith's respective shops, with the dwelling-houses of these trades- 
men, two houses for married farm-servants, others being lodged 
in a bothie and two houses besides, occupied by persons connect- 
ed with the place. 

There is no post-office in the parish, but the London and Edin- 
burgh mail arrives at Pittenweem every morning about half-past 
six, and leaves the same place at seven in the evening. There 
are nearly two miles of excellent turnpike road along the north- 
east boundary of the parish, and about the same extent along the 
shore from east to west. 

Means of Communication. — The Balcarres coach starts from An- 
struther for Pettycur at eight in the morning, Monday, Wednes- 
day, and Friday, throughout the year ; and from 2, Princes Street, 
at ten a. m. for Anstruther, every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sa- 
turday. There is a daily coach for a great part of the year from 
Anstruther to Largo, where there arrives twice a-day a steamer 
from Newhaven. There are many steamers coasting along, every 
lawful day in summer, and affording great facilities for intercourse 
■with the metropolis. 

A carrier from Crail to Edinburgh passes and repasses every 
week, and generally one from Pittenweem to Cupar, the county 
town. 

Bridge. — In Sir Ralph Anstruther's pleasure grounds, there isavery 
handsome stone-bridge over the stream which separates the parish 
of Abercrombie from that of Carnbee. The plan was given by Mr 
Burn, and does credit to the taste of that distinguished architect. 

Harbours. — There is a tolerable harbour at St Monan's. 
It is formed by the natural opening before adverted to page 339, 
and by a strong pier running nearly in a direct line from the shore, 
then gradually bending towards the west, in the form of a quay, 
of considerable elevation. — What chiefly merits observation is the 
great depth of water. At tream-tides, when full water, it is from 
18 to 20 feet deep at the entrance, and in ordinary floods, from 13 
to 15. Though by this depth it is capable of admitting vessels of 
Inu'den, none such frequent it, except in the summer months, and 
then but very seldom, and when " freighted to the place, for the 



ABERCROMBIE.

entrance says my predecessor is narrow, between two ridges of 
rocks, the bottom rough, and thereby difficult and dangerous. 

Our chief imports are coal and Hme ; and exports, potatoes, cured 
cod, and herrings. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently situated 
for the great bulk of the population, viz. the inhabitants of St 
Monan's, but very much the reverse for the minister and his fami- 
ly. The original parish church, abandoned to ruin these 190 
years, was about five minutes walk from the manse. But when the 
chapel in the barony of St Monan's came to be used as the pa- 
rish church, the manse and offices remained where they had ever 
been, and hence their inconvenient distance of a full mile from the 
place of worship, since 1646. The manse was rebuilt from the 
foundation, 1795-6, and in 1818-19, an addition made to it, and 
a complete set of offices erected. Upon either of these occasions, it 
might have seemed obvious to remove the manse and offices to the 
vicinity of the church. But in 1796, the aged incumbent, attach- 
ed to the localities of Abercrombie, does not appear to have 
wished for a change, and when the enlargement of the manse and 
new offices were thought necessary, in 1819, there were, from the 
minority of the two great heritors, legal difficulties in the way of a 
change of site, which prevented the removal, however desirable, 
from being carried into effect. Partly surrounding the manse, en- 
larged as above, there is an excellent garden, most substantially 
inclosed, and a good set of offices. The glebe, which is two-thirds 
substantially enclosed with hedge and ditch, consists, inclusive of 
the site of the manse and offices, of 9 acres, 3 roods, and 31 falls, 
Scotch measure. The stipend is as follows : —

ment Bounty. The glebe now exceeds the measurement given by 
my predecessor, 1 acre, 3 roods, and 29 falls. This is owing to 
an excambion, in which the minister got quantity for quality. The 
glebe is now much more convenient for the minister than former- 
ly. He draws a rent for the grass in the church-yard. 

To return to the church itself, after this view of the temporali- 
ties of the benefice, it is said, I believe on good traditional autho- 
rity, to have been built about the fortieth year of David IL's reign. 
1369. His father Robert 1. had died 1329. Tradition says, 
that David and his Queen, narrowly escaping shipwreck on the 
" stormy frith," had found a landing on the shore, hard by St 
Monan's, and that, as an expression of gratitude for their delive- 
rance, they had caused to be erected a chapel to St Monan, the tute- 
lary saint of the place. By David's charter, dated Edinburgh, he 
grants to this chapel the lands of Easter Birney in Fife, and some 
lands in the sheriffdom of Edinburgh. James HI. gave it to the 
Black-friars. It had afterwards a convent at Cupar annexed to it, 
and both it and the convent were annexed by James V. to a con- 
vent at St Andrews. 

The condition which this well known fabric exhibited ten years 
ago had been its condition for ages. 

Situated at the west end of St Monan's, and separated from it 
by a small brook, and within fifty yards of what is shown as St 
Monan's Cell, it exhibited a beautiful specimen of Gothic archi- 
tecture, in the form of a cross, with a steeple of hewn stone 
in the centre, square so far, and terminating in aspire of eight sides. 
There remained no vestige of building from the steeple westward ; 
but to the north and the south of it, were to be seen the unroofed 
remains of a transept, or wings, at right angles to the body of the 
fabric. The main part of the building, extending eastward from the 
spire, with vaulted roof, as well described by my predecessor, and in 
Sibbald, was used, as above-mentioned, as the parish church. How- 
ever interesting to the antiquarian, it was most uncomfortable 
as a place of worship ; damp, cold, its walls covered with green 
mould, and presenting altogether an aspect of chilling desolation.' 
In 1772, the late incumbent, in respect of its uncomfortable and 
ruinous condition, raised a process for repairs before the Presby- 
tery, and obtained a decreet against the heritors for repairs, ex- 
tensive and substantial. 

The heritors conceived that this was not an expense with which 
they ought to be burdened, forasmuch as the feuars of St Mo- 



ABERCROMUIE. 



351 



nan's, by their charter as above quoted, were bound to uphold 
the fabric. The heritors accordingly had recourse upon the 
feuars — the latter resisted, and the matter came before the 
Court of Session. The feuars were found liable to uphold the 
building in terms of their charter. They did therefore apply a 
repair, but very partial, and by no means amounting to what had 
been decerned by the Presbytery, " and nothing more," says my 
predecessor in 1790, "has yet been done." Down to 1825, it 
continued the uncomfortable decaying fabric above described. 

But a great deal has now been done. Early in February 1826, 
the present incumbent brought the state of the church before the 
Presbytery. A visitation in the usual form took place, the heri- 
tors being competently represented, and tradesmen attending, ac- 
cording to citation. Upon thorough inspection, the tradesmen for- 
mally condemned the church. The heritors' representatives crav- 
ing delay, the Presbytery did not immediately decern. Another 
nieeting was appointed, against which the heritors engaged to have 
the opinion of Mr Burn, architect. This gentleman being applied 
to, visited the church, and with strong professional enthusiasm, de- 
precated the idea of its being abandoned to ruin, and gave his de- 
cided opinion as to its capability of being repaired into a beautiful 
specimen of ecclesiastical architecture, and a place of worship sin- 
gularly well adapted for seeing and hearing. This report coinciding 
with the previous views of the heritors, and approved by the Pres- 
bytery, was immediately acted upon ; and after all the tedious forms 
connected with so great a work, we were, in June 1828, put into 
occupation of one of the most beautiful places of worship of which 
the country can boast. There was a lofty communication opened 
under a splendid arch betwixt the main building and the area of 
the steeple. The side-wings to the north and south, forming the 
transept, were raised to the height of the principal building, and 
finished in the same style with the original roof. The pulpit was 
removed to the west end, immediately in front of a magnificent Go- 
thic window. There were opened four similar windows in the south 
wall, and two in the north, and we were provided with a commodi- 
ous vestry behind the church. 

The heritors abandoned the claim they had upon the feuars for 
upholdmg the fabric; but thought it reasonable that, as an in- 
demnification for the great sum laid out by them, not less than 
L. 1730, they should receive a moderate seat rent from the feuars. 
This arrangement consented to by the feuars still subsists, one 



352 



FIFESHIRE. 



of the most reasonable instances that can be conceived of seat 
rents drawn by heritors. It appears the more reasonable in the 
following views ; that the rents have been twice reduced ; that they 
are now only Is. a sitting; and tliat, besides the original sum of 
L. 1730, the heritors, upon two different occasions, 1829-1836, 
■ have come forward, and at an expense, 1st, of L. 40, and 2d, of 
L. 17, have ordered a strengthening of the roof by additional 
couples, for the removal of apprehensions, in regard to the safety 
of the building. 

This unfortunate state of matters, in regard to the church, 
makes it somewhat difficult to say, who are or are not members of 
the Established Church. We are in a transition state. Respect- 
able parishioners are still absenting themselves. But we are 
not aware of many having joined Dissenting congregations. There 
is no Seceding or Dissenting place of worship in the parish ; nor 
are there now, we should think, above twenty-five grown up per- 
sons in the bounds who acknowledge any dissenting minister as 
their adopted pastor. The church is seated for 528 ; deduct free 
sittings for the poor 36 ; preserved for heritors, their families, and 
their servants, farmers, their children and servants, the elders and 
minister's, and schoolmaster's seats, 200 ; there remain for letting, 
292 ; an ample supply for the parishioners, and considerably ex- 
ceeding the number of applicants. 

The number of persons of all ages attending the Established 
Church, we cannot, in present circumstances, state with accuracy. 
But, without reference to our late alarms, we might say, towards 
300. There should be many more, and we lament that there are 
not. Clerical means are used to augment the attendance, but we 
are apt to have offered as excuses, the difficulty of hearing, the want 
of decent clothing, the coldness of the church, especially in winter, 
—artiHcial heat, by means of stoves or otherwise, never having 
been introduced. 

The average number of communicants may be given at 210. It 
is low compared with the population. Many are absent at sea, 
when the sacrament is dispensed in summer, and when we have it 
in February, when the men are at home, it falls in with the throng

There is in the parish an Abercrombie and St Monan's Bible

it has greatly declined from its original efficiency, and seems verg- 
ing to total extinction. 

Education. — We have one parochial school. The average num- 
ber attending was given in at last examination at 51 boys and 35 
girls = 86. The schoolmaster has the legal accommodations, and 
the maximum salary. His fees are, reading per quarter, 2s. ; writing 
2s. 6d. arithmetic, 3s. ; Latin, 5s. ,• no additional charge has hither- 
to been made for English grammar or geography. The fees may 
amount to L. 25, or L. 30 a year. The parochial schoolmaster, 
altogether propria motu, carries on efficiently and acceptably a 
Sabbath evening school. There is another school in St Monan's 
upon the teacher's own adventure. I do not understand his 
fees or the branches taught to be different from those of the 
parochial school. He is of the Established Church, his num- 
bers 67. There has been recently established in the parish 
by Lady Anstruther of Balcaskie, an infant school, which is also 
supported by her ladyship, and promises to be of great benefit 
to the place. None of the children at other schools in the pa- 
rish, cost less than 2s per quarter, none more than 5s. There is 
no quarter of the parish so distant from school, as to be a bar to 
attendance. There are no additional schools required. But a 
sewing scAooZ might possibly be of advantage. From the irregular 
attendance of children at school the people here might be thought 
less alive to the benefits of educatioh than they really are. But 
they are so dependent upon the services of the children in some of 
the fishing departments, that they are constrained to keep them 
from school when they would be glad that they could attend it. 
Manyparents, however, are culpably remiss in enforcing atten- 
dance. 

Friendly Societies.— friendly societies we have the following: 
The Sea-box Society, supposed to have been instituted about the 
time of the union of the Crowns. Its articles are fair and judicious, 
but too numerous and complicated for insertion, and it were diffil 
cult to make a selection. There is one important improvement 
which the society have recently sanctioned. While they pronounce 
It necessary, that sea-faring people shall always constitute a clear 
majority of the members of the society; and while they find coun- 
tenance in this from the practice of the generality of friendly so- 
cieties, they resolve, "that, with the preference specified, persons, of 
whatever occupation, shall be alike eligible as to admission, and 
equally so, with regard to the benefits, as well as the offices and 



354

honours of the Sea- Box Society, conforming to their regulations," 
&amp;c. The society's funds are represented as in a flourishing state, 
and answering the end of the institution. 

There is also distinct from this, the Brotherly Society,' insti- 
tuted July 1821. 

Savi7i/s Bank.— There are two savings banks, one of a good 
many years standing ; the other instituted December 1835. With 
reo-ard to it, I have been informed that its deposits in the National 
Bank, Anstruther, amount to about L. 2per week. There is also 
a female savings bank, reported to be doing well. The invest- 
ments in these banks are by the fishing and labouring classes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The heritors and session have a re- 
gular meeting every half year about the middle of June and the 
middle of December, when they audit the treasurer's accounts, ad- 
just the poor's roll for the ensuing half year, and come to a deci- 
sion upon matters of parochial business. 

Our average, taken half yearly, from 1st January 1835, to 31st 
December 1836, gives us of pensioners 19, at 3s. 2d. nearly per 
month. 

The session's yearly income from all sources, from 1st October 
1835, to 30th September 1836, amounts to L. 39, Is. 9id. ;  ses- 
sion's expenditure for the said year L. 91, 5s., leaving a deficit, 
supplied by the heritors in voluntary assessment, L. 52, 3s. 2id. 

Prisons.— There are two prisons in St Monan's, under one roof, 
one on the upper floor of the town-house, the other on the ground 
floor. They are equally well secured ; the lower, by much the 
more dismal of the two. Prisoners are committed to the one or the 
other according to their pre-eminence in dehnquency. The ma- 
gistrates imprison as sudden emergency calls for it; but they do 
not impose fines, except with the- formalities of a regularly con- 
stituted court. So far as I have occasion to hear, imprisonment 
is a rare occurrence. 

Inns, 4-c.— As this pl ace is no thoroughfar e, there can hardly be

said to be in it one traveller's inn, where there is regular stabling 
or posting. But there are too many ale-houses, and their effect 
upon the morals of the people is highly unfavourable. 

Fuel. — Fuel is an expensive article here. Coal, exclusive of toll, 
may be stated at Is. Od. the load of 22 stone ; Is. 4d. if toll be in- 
cluded ; a cart load of 4| stone laid down at Abercrombie, with 
hire and toll included; would stand 8s. bA. It is a coal at four 
miles distance that is referred to, — Earlsferry. Sir Ralph An- 
struther has lately opened a coal in the neighbourhood at Is. a 
load of 22 stone. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
There is one variation of rather an unpleasant kind betwixt the 
present state of the parish and people, and that which subsisted 
at the time of the last Statistical Account. They are certainly less 
shy than formerly in applying for and receiving parochial aid. 
My predecessor says, " There are now upon the poor's list three 
persons and two orphans." At present there are nineteen. There 
are no indications of such an increase of poverty as can account for 
this difference. The truth is, that the spirit of independence, 
which shrunk from being troublesome in coming upon the fund, 
is now greatly broken down. It is natural to think that the fine 
edge of delicacy will be blunted as the number of receivers increase, 
to keep one another in countenance. Whatsoever is given, how- 
ever, is received thankfully, and it is so far consoling that pauperism 
has not been upon the increase these some years. It is, at the same 
time, a compensating fact, that our collections, though still extremely 
moderate, are very far beyond what they were forty years ago. 
Within these last twenty years, there has been a marked improve- 
ment in the style of the farm-houses and farm offices in the parish. 
It seems to be no unwarranted assertion, that the people are im- 
proving in general intelligence, and in their acquaintance with the 
truths of religion.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS AND SYNOD OF FIFE, 

THE REV. JAMES ROGER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name and Etymologij. — The parish ofDunino, pronounced- by 
the mhabitants Dununie, is of more consideration for its antiquity, 
neighbourhood, and recent rapidity of improvenient, than for its ex- 
tent, or value as a section of its county. The reporter to Sir John Sin- 
clair on this parish first assumes that its name is Den-ino, which 
it is not ; and then proceeds to account for its derivation from 
words signifying " a village on a large and deep den." But there 
has not been, time out of mind, any thing which can be called a 
village in the parish : and the " den, so deep and large," is no- 
thing more than the beds which have been formed by two little 
streams, which after their union are able to turn a saw-mill. For 
fifty-four years after the commencement of the parochial register 
in 1643, the name of the parish is uniformly spelt Duynyno, Du- 
nynow, or Dunnonow, the first syllable always being Dun, till 1697, 
when it was first corrupted into " Dennino." 

The highest eminence in the parish is 1 furlong north of the 
church, scarcely 300 feet above the level of the sea, and on which 
tradition relates there was a nunnery ; and the foundation stones of 
it were removed, twenty-two years ago, during the present minister's 
incumbency. There is as much evidence that the parish received 
its name from the nunnery, as can generally be obtained m cases 
of this kind. The register of the priory of St Andrews, append- 
ed to the second volume of Mr Pinkerton's History, and drawn up 
about the year 1250, shows that the ancient names of places in 
this parish and neighbourhood are Gaelic. Martine of Clermont, 
Secretary to Archbishop Sharpe, in his " Remains of St Andrews," 
written in 1685, calls the parish of Dunino, " the Rectory of 
Dunnenaucht," or the hill of young women, evidently referring to 
the nunnery. The same author gives a copy of a charter granted 
by the Archbishop of St Andrews, so far back as October 4, 1479, 



I 



DUNINO. 357 

in which Dunino is called « Dynnenoch," precisely of the same 
import. 

Sititotion and Extent. — This parish, including Kingsmuir, ap- 
proaches to a square form, about 3 miles long, and as many broad. 
The church is 4 miles south-east of St Andrews, which town is si- 
tuated North Lat. 56°. 19'. 33"., and West Long. 2°. 50'. from the 
Observatory at Greenwich. Dunino parish is bounded by St An- 
drews and Cameron parishes on the north and west; by those of 
St Leonards and Kingsbarns, on the north-east and east ; by Crail 
parish, on the east and south ; and by Carnbee, on the south. It 
lies 13 miles east of Cupar, the county town ; the same distance 
south-east from Dundee ; and 37 miles north of Edinburgh. The 
highway from St Andrews to Anstruther, an extent of nine miles, 
bisects the parish, and forms the eastern angle of the peninsula, or 
provincially, the East Nook of Fife. 

Climate.—The effect of the proximity of .Dunino to the sea- 
coast, added to the recent drainage of the ground, the application of 
calcareous and putrescent manures, the inclosing by stone fences in 
every part but Kingsmuir, the partial shading by plantation,— and the 
wmd blowing two-thirds of the year from the south-west, and only 
one-third from the cold north-east,— has been of much advantage 
not only to the soil, but to the inhabitants. The writer of the for- 
mer Account mentions that, from thirty to forty years before his 
time, " scorbutic disorders" prevailed in the parish. These were 
obviously caused by want of sufficient lodging, clothes, and food- 
The writer of the former Account, adds, that, in his time, « rheu- 
matism and hysteric complaints were the chief disorders." An in- 
stance of rheumatism may no doubt here still occur as in other 
places ; but certainly the complaint is not general. Hysterical af- 
fections are here unknown : and intermittent fevers have vanished. 
Though the chalybeate fountains, eulogized in the former Account, 
and of which no trace remains, were still available, they would be 
held useless, from the general health of the present inhabitants. 

 Greoy, Mineralogy, and Hijdrograpluj.— The parish of Du- 
mno IS situated on the north-east part of the great coal basin of 
bcot and, supposed to be 90 miles long, and 33 miles broad. It 
IS believed that a square mile of this space will answer the demand 
yearly. Coal began first to be used in Scotland, near Dunferm- 
line, in Fifeshire, about 1215. On every estate in the parish, are 
vestiges of coal- working at some former period ; and very frequent- 
ly at the surface, appears bituminous schistus or blaes, denoting 



358 ' FIFESHIRE. 

the presence of this mineral. No coal is at present wrought in 
the parish, from a belief it would not pay the expense ; and no- 
thing is more difficult to calculate than the profits of coal-working. 
The strata unexpectedly may be disturbed by mounds of stone, or 
may wholly break off or dip beyond reach. Beside the upland path to 
the church from Bridge -end, there is a projection of disintegrated 
trap, provincially ratcliel or rotten-stone ; across which, are some 
narrow vertical veins of felspar. Proceeding up Dunino burn- 
side southward, a few projections of red sandstone, in regular 
strata, appear. Farther upward, the bed of the burn becomes 
limestone, and in that proximity the coping of the ministers' out- 
field glebe under the surface is also limestone. Here also, a stra- 
tum of coal, 3 feet thick, has been discovered 32 feet under the 
surface, dipping considerably towards the north. The regulation 
as to finding coal in glebes gives httle encouragement to the incum- 
bent. His operations may be suspended by the presbytery or any 
heritor, till, after paying expenses, he deposit his profits in some 
bank or other sure place, and have only the interest of his deposit 
for his pains. Some mineralogists assert that coal under limestone 
is not good, but under sandstone excellent. Now two-thirds of the 
rocks in this parish are sandstone, not of a large grit called con- 
glomerate, but small, and often very white, without tinge of ferru- 
ginous mixture. The exports from the sandstone quarries of 
Mylnefield, four miles west of Dundee, have brought to the pro- 
prietor large sums of money. The sandstone quarries of Dunino 
are as durable in the material, finer in the texture, and better 
coloured than those of Mylnefield. Were these Dunino quarries 
placed within the county of Middlesex, near the great southern 
metropolis, their value would be incalculable. Some years ago, on 
the farm of Tosh, in this parish, on a search for marl, there was 
discovered a considerable quantity of steatites or soap-rock. Had 
this mass of steatites been preserved, it would have contributed to 
form a manufactory of porcelain. A mile east from the junction of 
the three rivulets alluded to above, as passing through the parish, 
and on the south bank of their united stream called the Kenly 
Burn, is a cavity containing excellent specimens of stalactites, or 
dropstone. Along the shore of the German Ocean, to which the 
Kenly surrenders its waters, is a mass of marble rock, that would 
suffice to build three of the largest cities in the empire. There 
may be seen " cochlece marincB," and other shells imbedded in the 
limestone rock. A small part of those marble rocks have been 



DUNINO.

burned into lime, to manure the adjacent fields. When the mar- 
ble is polished, it presents a beautifully striated appearance of yel- 
low and white, and might be made a lucrative article of com- 
merce. Except on the clay soils of Stravithy Mains and Kings- 
muir, where an ochreous mixture is sometimes found, the water in 
the rest of the parish passing through a sandy soil is excellent. 
Our fountains in summer are not only cool, but, in their ordinary 
state, may be compared with those of the most celebrated purity 
— containing not more than three parts in a thousand of saline 
particles and vegetable matter. Over the fields of Dunino parish, 
may sometimes be found agates and chalcedonies, and fragments 
of light blue whinstone or trap, or of black whinstone or basalt ; 
but there is nothing to throw light on any of the two fashionable 
theories of geology. Ironstone or haematites is not uncommon in 
the parish. Recently, a person collected forty tons of that mine- 
ral from the side of the rivulet which turns Stravithy-mill, and sent 
it cost free to Newcastle as ballast. 

Zoology — We have all the usual domestic fowls and ordinary 
birds. Of the two species of Scottish deer, the stag and the roe, 
only a few of the last mentioned peaceful and timid kind occa- 
sionally visit the parish ; and so do a few pheasants and foxes. 
The vast colonies of rabbits described in the former Statistical Ac- 
count are now nearly extirpated. It appears from an old charter, 
that, one hundred and fifty years ago, moorfowl abounded in 
Kingsmuir, but they have been expelled by the progress of agri- 
cultural improvement. An attempt was made, a few years ago, 
to rear a stock of goats of the Angora kind in this parish. 
They were fed with clover in summer, and with hay and tur- 
nips in winter, and were very prolific, the female generally 
having three kids at a birth. But they were so mischievous in 
their habits, and their milk in so little request in a healthy 
district like Dunino, and at a distance from a great town, 
that in five years they were disposed of as unprofitable. There 
is abundance of pigeons in the parish, of which the minister has 
annexed to his benefice the principal dovecot. Before 1617, 
any-'person at pleasure might erect a pigeon-house, and probably 
the minister's dovecot was constructed prior to that period. Af- 
terwards, by law, it was incompetent to build a pigeon-house, unless 
there was a quahfication in the builder, of ten chalders of grain in 
heritage within two miles of the dovecot, or unless it was purchas- 
ed from a licensed proprietor. Had it not been for the penalty 



360 



FIFESllIRE. 



of L. 11 Scotch, or 18s. 4d. Sterling, for the first offence of break- 
ing into a dovecot or shooting a pigeon, and double that sum for 
every subsequent offence, the race had been extinct. Complaints 
have been made against the acts of Parliament supporting dove- 
cots; but it is with the complaints against pigeons as against 
crovys, people think of the grain devoured, without reckoning on the 
benefit received. Pigeons pick up much grain that would be lost, 
may destroy insects in the soil, and certainly feed on wild mustard 
seed that deteriorates the crop. Sixty-eight pairs, besides keeping 
up the stock, may furnish yearly an hundred pairs of young to be 
disposed of at 5d. or 6d. a pair ; and pigeon dung is a most valuable 
manure. It is sown in Persia with the hand over the corn-fields, 
to great advantage. For the last seven years, the minister of the 
parish has manured his garden with it not sparingly, but as co- 
piously as with the usual animal or vegetable dung; and not only 
what is sown or planted prospers generally, but duringthat space, no 
instance has occurred of ihe insect touching the gooseberries. 
Amidst the modern improvements of conveying speedy intelligence 
by telegraph, by steam navigation and railroads, it is singular that 
the plan of letter- carrying by pigeons has not been attempted in 
Britain, so common at the present day in oriental countries. It is 
well known that a pigeon when young can easily be domesticated. 
The Turks of Aleppo, in Syria, carry on a correspondence with 
the city of Alexandria in Egypt, with our common domestic pigeons 
of bluish plumage. They are conveyed in cages to show them 
the route ; the letter is rolled up under their wing, and in an hour, 
barring accidents, the pigeon courier arrives at his home destina- 
tion, over a space which would require four days travel to a human 
express. 

From experiments made by the writer of these pages, he has 
reason to believe, that hares never go far from their native spot. 
The same observation applies to blackbirds, and perhaps to game 
of every kind. The redbreast, supposed by some to migrate dur- 
ing the warm months, lives in the minister's garden all the sum- 
mer over. 

II. — Civil History. 
All the Scottish historians assert, that, on the land-side of St 
Andrews, was a large district, called " Cursus Apri," or the Boar's 
chace, and there is a considerable village, three miles east of that 
town, still called Boarhills. One of the old names of St Andrews, 
too, was Mucross, the promontory of the Boars. John Major re- 

.3 



DUNINO. 361 

lates, that the boar's chace was conferred by Alexander the Brave, 
about the year 1107, on some religious establishment in St An- 
drews; and Martine of Clermont describes this space as what 
would now amount to from eight to nine English miles long, and 
from six to seven miles broad. It may appear strange that this 
forest was permitted so near the gates of a city, the primacy of 
the kingdom. Dr Southey, in his Travels through Spain, men- 
tions a " Sierra de Busaco," a desert about Busaco, of four miles 
circuit, to preserve the solemnity of the enclosed religious esta- 
blishment; and Caesar, in his sixth book of the wars of Gaul, states, 
that, m Germany, it was usual to have a wilderness round every 
city, to avoid a sudden incursion of the enemy. Perhaps reasons 
more probable than either of the above might be assigned why this 
waste was allowed to remain so near St Andrews. The bishop of 
that diocese could cultivate no part of this " Cursus Apri" before 
he had a grant of it from King Alexander, as, prior to this, it might 
be royal hunting ground ; and part of it that was cultivated, unde- 
niably, as appears from the chartulary of Aberbrothock, paid sti- 
pend to the Culdees of lona. Beside this, at the time of the 
grant, the diocese of St Andrews not only included many of the 
most fertile parts of Fife, Angus, and Mearns, East and West 
Lothian, and the Carse of Gowrie, but twenty-seven Scottish 
nobles held their lands as its vassals. The Bishop of St Andrews, 
who was but a liferenter, might consider the agricultural improve- 
ment of the " Cursus Apri" as a matter of very inferior conse- 
quence. In 1244, ohe hundred and thirty-seven years after the 
royal grant, some agricultural stir had arisen in the " Cursus Apri," 
then held by the Archdeacon of St Andrews of his superior, the 
Bishop. This waste extended farther south than the parish of 
Dunino, and included it; and the register of the priory of St An- 
drews, among other places in this vicinity within the "Boar's chace," 
mentions the following now belonging to this parish, namely, " In- 
dunnenochen," certainly Dunynach or Dunino.—" Balecately," 
novvBalcaithly; " Bale," now Bely; " Pittendruch and Strath- 
latha," now Pittendruch and Stravithy; " Kinaldin," now Kinal- 
dy. Pittairthy, Kingsmuir, and Primrose, are of far later origin. 

Dunino had become a parish in 1458, according to Maitland's 
History, " when it was annexed by Bishop Kennedy to support a 
collegiate church in St Andrews." It must have, however, been 
afterwards disjoined from, the college church, now called St Leo- 
nards ; yet there are still two farms belonging to that parish, and 



362 



FIFE8HIUK. 



unconnected with any other part of it, on the north-east border of 
Dunino. 

The parish of Dunino was once much more extensive than at 
present. It contained the estate of Bonnyton adjoining on the 
north, and which lately rented at L. 530 a-year ; and it contained 
on the west, the farm of Brigton, containing 222 acres imperial, 
and worth now L. 300 annually. Of late years, it has been con- 
tended by Mr Hannah, proprietor of Kingsmuir, that his proper- 
ty, consisting of 844 acres Scotch, does not lie in Dunino parish, 
but in that of Crail. This theory has not the slightest founda- 
tion. Kingsmuir had originally belonged to the Earl of Fife, but 
was forfeited to the Crown. It wa bestowed by James V. on 
a gentleman, for assisting to carry military stores to France, 
about the year 1540; and in 1600, there is an infeftment in favour 
of the same gentleman's family. Latterly, Kingsmuir became part 
of the town's revenue of Crail, and afterwards was purchased by 
the town's revenue of Leith. It became again the property of the 
Crown, and, posterior to the Restoration, was gifted by Charles 
II. to a follower of his fortunes. Colonel Borthwick, and who, in 
1683, is stated, by the kirk-session register, as also proprietor of the 
estate of Dunino. In 1710, according to Sir Robert Sibbald, it 
was wholly waste. In 1727, according to the presbytery record, 
it contained but four families, the pastoral care of which people 
was then annexed by the presbytery to the parish of Dunino. This 
pastoral charge has since been twice repeated by the presbytery, 
the last time so recently as the year 1829. The poor in Kings- 
muir have been regularly supported by the parish of Dunino. The 
father and uncle of the present proprietor of Kingsmuir, in eleven 
of their leases, assert that Kingsmuir lies in Dunino parish ; and 
in a part of Kingsmuir sold by them to the then proprietor of Bal- 
caithly, it is declared thrice in the charter of conveyance, that 
Kingsmuir is situated in Dunino parish, and there is no opposite 
evidence whatever. The present proprietor of Kingsmuir's name 
is inserted in the baptismal register of Dunino. A few years ago, 
the heritors of Dunino raised an action before the Court of Ses- 
sion against the proprietor of Kingsmuir, to find the property, 
quoad temporalia, in the parish of Dunino, and both the Outer and 
Inner House decerned in favour of the heritors. At last, weary 
of the contest, both panics withdrew, each paying his own ex- 
penses. But neither the United College of St Andrews, who are 
patrons of Dunino parish, nor the minister of Dunino, had any 



DUNINO. 363 

hand in the withdrawal ; and they are determined to retain 
Kingsnuiir as part of Dunino parish, which, in case of a hew aug- 
mentation, has funds to benefit the church Hving, at least L. 60 
a-year. 

Parochial Registers. — When the restoration of Presbyterian go- 
vernment was ratified by Parliament in 1641, parochial registers 
were recommended to be kept. From April 30, 1643, in a re- 
gular series to the present period, there are eight volumes of pa- 
rochial records in tolerable preservation. There is a register of 
deaths since the year 1752. For many years after 1643, near- 
ly the whole heritors and principal tacksmen were elders, — an ex- 
ample worthy of imitation at the present day. The office of the 
elders was no sinecure, nor were they shy of using their authority. 
It appears that they were not only the protectors of good morals, 
but assumed a civil and criminal jurisdiction. In 1660, two men 
and four women were convicted on their own confession, of 
" promiscuous dancing," that is, of dancing together at a mar- 
riage. They escaped with being " sharplie rebuked ;" but the 
poor piper John Moore, from the next parish of " Carnbie," who 
acted as minstrel on that occasion, was obliged " to put his hand 
to the pen," not to repeat the offence, " under a penalty toties quo- 
ties," which would now be equivalent to a couple of pounds Sterling. 
Moreover, on the following Sunday, "he was humbled on his knees 
before the pulpit in face of the congregation," in public penance for 
his conduct. In 1649, " Alexander Brune was put into ihejoggs 
from the second bell to the last bell before sermon on forenoone, 
and afterwards entered on the place of repentance for the sin of un- 
cleanness with Elpeth Berown." Though it be stated in the re- 
cord, that during the above period, the Presbytery on several oc- 
casions issued their pastoral admonitions against prevailing vices, 
yet delinquencies were frequently brought before the kirk-session, 
which would be deprecated in these latter and less zealous days. 
Weavers are sometimes cited for carrying home their webs to their 
customers on Sundays, and millers are cited for grinding corn, and 
reapers for cutting down corn on that holy day. In 1652, the 
kn-k-session of Dunino not only acted as civil and criminal judges, 
but were patrons of the parish, and settled the minister. Thus, 
May 30th of that year, it is stated in the record, " that after the 
afternoon's exercise, the minister intimated out of the pulpit to the 
people, that the elders had nominate and chosen unanimously, Mr 
Alexander Edward, Regent in the Old Colledge, to be minister of 



FIFESHIRE. 



their said parish and, accordingly, on Wednesday, 13th October 
following, the presbytery did meet at the church, " for admission 
of Mr Alexander Edward to the function of the ministrie, and they 
did admit him." Notwithstanding the active oppression of Arch- 
bishop Sharpe in Fifeshire for eighteen years, no county in Scot- 
land was more zealous for Presbyterianism against Episcopacy; and 
during that period, according to Wodrow's history, the inhabitants 
of " Dunyno," for their opposition, were fined in a sum that would 
now be equal to L. 1200 Sterling. 

Eminent Men. — John of Fordun, author of the Scotichronicon, 
the oldest Scottish historian, is said to have resided for a consider- 
able time in this parish, — which is the more probable, that he was 
a native of St Andrew's diocese, of which Dunino formed a part. 
He spent much of his time in journeying. He travelled over the 
three kingdoms, in quest of information ; and his history may be 
called that of the world, as well as of Scotland.  

John Winram, Subprior of St Andrews under the excellent and 
comely Lord James Stuart, eldest of the three illegitimate brothers 
of Mary Queen of Scots,— after the celibacy of the clergy had 
been done away by the establishment of the reformed faith — was 
married to the widow of the proprietor of Kinaldy, in this parish. 
Both Knox and Buchanan assert, that Mr Winram was appointed 
by Cardinal Beaton to preach a sermon in the church of St An- 
drews, on occasion of condemning to death the pious Mr Wishart. 
Knox gives notes of the sermon, and Beaton was offended at 
Winram treating a heretic more mildly than he thought a heretic 
deserved. Buchanan in his history, gives Winram an appropriate 
text, which he must have had from report, as it is not to be found 
in Scripture. 

Mr James Wood, who, according to the parish record, " as mi- 
nister of Dunonow, preached his valedictorie sermon, May 10, 
1646," previous to his becoming minister of St Andrews, was one 
of the Commissioners who brought over from the continent. King 
Charles H., at the era of the Restoration. Mr Wood is said to 
have been the brother of the proprietor of Stravithy. 

Land-owners. — The heritors of the parish are as follows, in the 
orders of their valued rents : Mr Douglas of Dunino and Balcaithly; 

 His reflections on the fair part of the creation, arising from the marriage of 
King David II. with Miss Logic, whose dispositions were the counterpart of her 
beautiful face, and handsome person, are very unchivah-ous, " femiua fax Satanae, 
rosa fetens, dulce venenum."

Mr Cleghorn of Stravithy ; Mrs Mouat of Pittalrthy ; Mr Purves of 
Kinaldy; Mr Hannah of Kingsmuir, and the Kirk-session of Elieon 
the south coast. All those properties have come into the possession 
of the families of the present land-owners, within the last thirty-two 
years, save Pittairthy, Kingsmuir, and Primrose. It is said that 
Pittairthy, forfeited to the Crown, was sold by Royalty to the Earl of 
Glencairn, and has continued in a younger branch of that illustrious 
family till the present day. Kingsmuir has been at least eighty- 
one years in the family of Mr Hannah. Primrose was a section sold 
from Balcaithly, within the last forty-six years. 

Antiquities, — Until within thelast few years, there were three war 
castles or fortalices in the parish. One was on the east of it, over- 
hanging the south bank of the Kenly, called the Castle of Draffan, 
supposed to have been built by the Danes, who often invaded the 
east coast of Fife, and slew one of the Scottish kings at Crail. 
The second was the Castle of Stravithy, a little west from the 
centre of the parish. It is described by Sir Robert Sibbald as 
entire, about a hundred and twenty-seven years ago ; it was a regu- 
lar fortalice, situated in a bog with ditch and drawbridgeand, 
according to the son of a feuar who lived hard by, was surround- 
ed with ornamental walks and lofty trees, some of which trees at 
present remain. The bog has been drained, and the site of the 
castle been converted into corn-land. The third is the Castle 
of Pittairthy, built on a declivity towards the south part of the 
parish, and commanding a wide prospect of the German sea. 
Though it has long been unroofed and unrepaired, it may defy 
the assault of the elements for centuries to come. This structure 
appears to have been erected at two separate periods. The west or 
first built is a large square tower, the date of erection uncertain. 
Near the west top, was a keep or donjon, very common in those 
military abodes, with a strong iron grating across an opening in the 
wall, to serve for a window. The whole under part is vaulted, 
which probably served for cellars, kitchen, and bed-rooms. The 
upper part of the castle is perforated with holes, by which to an- 
noy the besiegers. The east or modern part, according to the 
inscription on it, was built in 1653, by Sir William Bruce of Kin- 
ross. It contained only a baronial hall, and two sleeping apart- 
ments, stone-paved. 

About one furlong and a third north of the church, on Dunino 
Uw, from which it has been shown the parish probably derives its 
name, the ruins of a nunnery were dug up and removed in the 



366 



FIFESHIRE, 



year 1815. The height of the walls is unknown, but the struc- 
ture consisted of unhewn stones, cemented with mortar, instead 
of lime. The internal space was formed into two divisions, and 
the door fronted the east. 

There are three stones nearly close to the west wall of the mi- 
nister's garden, which seem to have been part of a Druidical circle. 
This is rendered probable by several circumstances. There, the ris- 
ing sun may be seen ; and a few yards westward, is part of a sand- 
stone rock artificially tubulated, in which, tradition relates that the 
priests of the Druid faith collected dew on the first day of May or 
Bel-tien, and sprinkling the people, pronounced a blessing on them 
from the God of Fire, that is the sun in the firmament, which they 
ignorantly worshipped. A short mile westward is a farm mention- 
ed in the register of the priory of St Andrews in the thirteenth cen- 
tury, still csiWed Pi ftan-druidh, the grave of the Druids, vulgarly 
Pittendriech. 

From the chartulary of Aberbrothock, it appears that, in 1242, 
Stravithy estate, in this parish, paid stipend to tlie Culdees at 
lona, and afterwards to some disciples of the Romish faith, which 
appears to have continued at Dunino, notwithstanding the zeal of 
presbyteries, till near the Union. For within the last ten years, 
some copper coins of Charles I. and II., and William and Mary, 
were found in a grave in the churchyard, which money, it is sup- 
posed, had been destined to pay the passage of the party interred, 
out of purgatory. 

Twenty years ago, two coins, one gold, and the other silver, struck 
in the reign of Philip II. of Spain, were dug up, the one in the 
parish, the other in the neighbourhood. Both of these coins had 
probably been brought by the vessels of the Armada that were 
stranded on the coast of Fife. They were sent to an eminent an- 
tiquary in Dundee. 

In spring 1836, in afield belonging to Balcaithly, in this parish, 
there was torn up by the plough an urn containing probably the 
reliques of some Roman chief.

The annual average of births, &amp;c. for 1834 and six years pre- 
ceding, was as follows : — 

Births, - 11 

Marriages, - 3 

Deaths, - - 32- 

There are 71 persons occupied in agriculture, and but 15 in 
retail trade and handicraft. There are 99 males above twenty ; 
12 beyond seventy ; and 1 nearly ninety. Within the last twenty 
years, 2 died above ninety. There are 78 families living in 74 
houses, at very nearly 5 in a family. Two new houses are in the 
progress of building, and there is no uninhabited house. There 
are no blind or deaf in the parish ; and three, a man, woman, and 
child, in separate families, are insane. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish of Dunino may be described as wholly agricultural. 
A corn-mill stands on the estate of Stravithy ; and it may_be noti- 
ced, that the roof of the mill is supported by oak rafters that once 
covered Cardinal Beaton's proud castle at St Andrews. This 
corn-mill is of powerful operation, and skilfully manufactures into 
meal, at lOd. Sterling, a boll of oats of the old Scottish measure. 
Within seventy years, there were five corn-mills in the parish, one 
on every estate save Kingsmuir, to which all the farmers were 
bound for multure. These astrictions are now unknown. 

The extent of the different properties in the parish in Scotch 
acres, and the rent in the year 1836, may be found in the follow-

As Kingsmuir lay waste in the seventh year of Charles II. when

Cromwell's prior valuation was fixed as the standard of estimation, 
— deduct from L. 3122, the present rent of the parish, — the pre- 
sentment of Kinirsmuir, and the balance is L. 2822 ; so that the rent 
of Dunino parish has increased above fourteen times in 169 years, 
— the valued rent in Scotchmoney being L, 2334, 6s. 8d., orL. 194, 
10s. eid. Sterling. 

The plantations have increased since the former Account was 
drawn up, 210 acres; and, deducting 120 acres for ground still 
waste that may be cultivated, 2444 acres have- been added to the 
cultivated soil. 

The value of live-stock on the farms, including horses, black-cat- 
tle, sheep, swine, and poultry in 1836, amounted to L. 5670 ; im- 
plements of husbandry, including eleven thrashing machines, 
L. 1800; total, L. 7470. Value of stock forty-three years ago,

It is stated in the former Statistical Account, that the soil is 
" adapted chiefly for oats and barley ;" but there is now raised 
more value of wheat than barley, and the quality is excellent. The 
fiars for wheat were first struck in 1649, as appears by the Sheriff- 
Court books of Fife; and that year, the boll of wheat was so high- 
priced as L. 1, Os. Ifd. Sterling. The Chevalier barley, as well 
as the common kind, is in general use ; but though estimable 
for its great weight, it is costly, by requiring a rich soil, and 
■ hazardous in late seasons, requiring six weeks longer to mature, 
after sowing than ordinary barley. In 1643, by the Fife fiars, a 
boll of " bear" was 10s. Sterling. Several sorts of oats, as the 
Drummond and Tartar kind, are tried. The potato oats, from 
their speedy arrival at maturity, bid fair to be preferable. The 
boll of " aits and meall," by the Fife fiars in 1643, was 8s. 4d. 
SterlincT. Flax is nearly discontinued in the parish, and will be 
'so genenilly, when calcareous manures are introduced. Cotton, too, 
in many respects, supplies the use of flax at a much cheaper rate ; 



DUNINO. 



369 



and where linen is wanted, fabrics of that kind from Ireland can 
be purchased at a far lower price by the farmer, than by home ma- 
nufacture. Every advantage which can be derived from good agri- 
cultural seeds is studied. The eleven thrashing-mill; and other 
implements of husbandry are generally of the best construction. 

The breed of black-cattle, neat-limbed, horned, and of a dark 
colour, common at Dunino and over the county, and called the 
Fife breed, is celebrated. This race is known to have originated 
from the bounty of James VI. of Scotland. That monarch, on 
his accession to the English throne, had drawn largely on his for- 
mer neighbours at Falkland, to support his royal dignity ; and to 
remunerate them, he selected and sent down a race of excellent 
black-cattle, from the early cultivated region of south Britain, 
which have been improved for two centuries, in the luxuriant pas- 
tures of Fifeshire. At Dunino, cattle of the yellow or spotted Ayr- 
shire breed, may also be found ; but the Fife breed is most ap- 
proved for fast feeding in grass parks, dm-ing summer, and the 
cows of that race are distinguished as milkers. In the parish, about 
190 sheep of the Linton and Biggar or Northumberland breed, 
are fatted for the owners' tables, or sold to the butchers in the 
neighbourhood. 

Except in Kingsmuir, there are only two farms under L. 50 of 
rent, the rents of the other farms running from L. 100 to nearly 
L. 600. On Kingsmuir, the rents of farms proceed in a regular gra- 
dation from L. 5 to L. 33. A domain like Kingsmuir, beginning to 
emerge into agricultural importance, may be well cultivated as at 
present by small tenants. A man and his family with twelve acres 
will raise far more corn and cattle in proportion, than he who rents 
nmety~six acres, because he must employ strangers to assist him. 
A tacksman on a large scale on the east part of Kingsmuir has recent- 
ly exhibited such proofs of enterprise, as to show, that if he and a 
few other similar tacksmen had the whole 844 acres in their hands, 
they would improve them, more quickly at least, than small te- 
nants. Seventy years have not elapsed since the best farmers here 
had but a thin partition between their bedrooms and bestial. Now, 
the principal tenantry either inhabit houses of two stories, or a 
handsome house of one storey; in both cases, with a suitable es- 
tablishment of offices. Straw roofs for cottages are going into 
disuse, and slate or tile roofs are generally adopted. 

The great promoter of agricultural improvement in the parish 



;70 FIFESHIRE. 



of Diinino, was the public-spirited Sir William Areskine of Torry, 
predecessor and relative of Captain Areskine Wemyss, at present 
Member of Parliament for the county of Fife." About 1767, Sir 
William, as proprietor of the estate of Dunino, made the same fe- 
licitous attack on the asperities of the soil, as he had previously 
done on the rebels in America. In Sir Robert Sibbald's descrip- 
tion of Fife, which was published about 1710, he says, when you 
come to the east moors of Fifeshire, by which he meant Kingsmuir, 
the first place which'attracts attention is the castle of Stravithy ; 
Dunino estate, Sir Robert Sibbald held unworthy of notice. At 
this period, the conterminous heritors had a right " to dig feal and 
divot" on Kingsmuir, and to " pasture their cattle ;" which usages 
were bought up, by granting them sections of land in recompense. 
The rest°of the parish, like Kingsmuir, lay open and uninclosed, 
and the whole bestial of the forty-four farms, in addition to those of 
Kingsmuir, were in autumn sent forth, as at present in Iceland, 
for promiscuous pasture,— though the act of James VII. had ex- 
isted for ninety years, prohibiting such destructive practice. It 
was in this state of agricultural barbarity, that Sir William Ares- 
kine commenced his operations. He enclosed his whole estate 
with substantial stone fences five feet high ; and ditches along 
side of them were superadded. He introduced wheat, potatoes, 
and turnips ; and these two latter crops were so scarce in the east 
of Fife, that at night they were plundered, like apples from an 
orchard. The horses were shod not only as formerly on the fore 
feet, but also on the hinder feet. Metal plates were appended to 
the timber ploughs, as mould boards ; the cart wheels of solid wood 
were abandoned ; recourse was had to the saddler, instead of the 
flax-dresser, for harness ; large stones which impeded agricultural 
operations were removed from, the fields; the crooked ridges were 
made straight ; and plantations were formed to shelter the higher 
grounds. For some years the tacksmen of Dunino were looked 
up to, as presenting to the public, experimental farms. 

Such an example was not lost. The properties of Kinaldy, 
Pittairthy, Balcaithly, and the most of Stravithy, have been in- 
closed with stone fences, and in general substantially drained. 
The empire of bog-plants is on the wane, and the parish, de- 
scribed in the former Account as " wet and spongy," will soon, 
in every part, deserve tlie opposite character. The rents, as has 
been shown, are moderate ; the tenants are in good terms with 



DUNINO. 



371 



their landlords ; and one tenant occupies the farm entered upon 
by his grandfather seventy years ago. The loss by corn-merchants 
is a theme on which some farmers dwell. Here, there is a persua- 
sion, that, without corn agents, farming would be at a stop. 

Ninety-one years ago, at the time of the last Rebellion, the scanty 
crops raised at Dunino could scarcely find market. There was no 
wheat, and the oats were kept for support of the family ; the barley 
or rather bear was given, the one-half for rent, and the other half 
of the rent was paid by cattle. One-fourth of the bear was given 
in kind to the brewer in the parish, for beer to the family, and the 
other fourth was sold for cash either to him, or to some of the 
thirty- three brewers in St Andrews, to buy gin or brandy, which 
then and long after, were delivered in large quantities from con- 
traband ships on the coast. What clothes the family of the 
farmer required were manufactured by themselves. A great part 
of business was transacted by barter.. 

Plantations. — The plantations in the parish, wherever formed, 
are prosperous. Those beside the two streamlets consist of a va- 
riety of hard-wood trees. The other plantations are of larch or 
Scotch fir. Some parts of the plantations have of late been 
cut down ; but it is hoped they will soon be replaced by a new 
stock. 

Valued Rent. — The valued rent of Stravithy estate is somewhat 
larger than that of Dunino apart from Balcaithly, to which it is 
now united; so that in the 7th of Charles II., the property must 
have been superior. It fell in the rear by Sir William Areskine's 
improvements ; but the active skill of the present proprietor has 
well nigh raised it to its former pre-eminence, — though the soil be 
often less grateful than that of Dunino estate, which is sandy or 
alluvial,— whereas the other is in many places rather a stiff clay. 
The proprietor of Dunino deserves praise for the handsome ac- 
commodation he has afforded, and is still affording, to his tenantry, 
and the proprietor of Stravithy for his flourishing plantations, the 
drainage of his fields, and the handsome cottages he has erected, 
for the servants of his principal tacksman. The proprietor of 
Kinaldy, on the northern part of his estate, separated from this pa- 
rish only by a rivulet, has erected a splendid establishment of farm 
buildings. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Dunmo possesses good public roads, and near markets. There 



372 



FirERllIRE. 



is a turnpike road crossing the parish from St Andrews to An- 
struther, which are both sca-ports — and have both a weekly market 
ibr grain— the distance from four to five miles. Yearly, there are 
15 horse and black-cattle fairs, within seven miles. We are sur- 
rounded by post-offices ; one is within three, another four, and an- 
other five miles. Other three post-offices are within seven miles. 
There is a curricle which plies thrice a week across the parish, 
from Anstruther to St Andrews. From St Andrews to Cupar, the 
county town, a distance of eleven miles, two coaches run weekly ; 
in a like space, they go twice to Dundee, the same distance as Cu- 
par. The fuel used in the parish is coal, which may be found sea- 
borne at either of the adjacent towns above-mentioned, or at the 
coal mines in the interior of the country, not more distant than 
those towns. 

7„„s._There are two inns in the parish, which are sources of 
no intemperance. 

Ecclesiastical State— The stipend of Dunino was augmented 
in 1709. About forty-two years ago, Dr Brown, then incumbent, 
received a considerable addition. The former and present mini- 
ster received also an augmentation, and the living, beside the sti- 
pend victual payable by the fiars, includes 63 old Scotch bolls, half 
oatmeal and half barley, at L. 85, 13s. Id. of surrendered teind, 
which, with a manse and offices erected about fifteen years ago, 
and 23 acres of glebe, may amount to L. 260 a year. The 
present incumbent, Mr Roger, is the eighth minister of the pa- 
rish since 1697, when Mr Knox, a relative of the great Re- 
former, John Knox, was inducted into office. The church of Dunino 
was built in 1S26, and is a neat Gothic edifice, with an altar-win- 
dow in the west gable. It contains thirty-two pews, designed for 
six sitters in each, but might hold seven, in all 224. The area 
in the church has been divided by the sheriff as under :— The 
patron, the United College of St Andrews, had the first choice, 
the minister next, and the heritors according to their valued rent. 
The parochial schoolmaster has a pew, and all the other pews are 
proportionally annexed to the estates, and divided among the far- 
mers and their dependents, excepting eight pews in front of the 
pulpit and adjoining, which are let by the kirk-session, and these 
form the sacred tables at the communion season. The number of 
commutiicants generally is from 130 to 160 ; but upwards of 
200 have been known to communicate. The church is centri- 



DUN1N0. 



373 



cally situated, and there are but two or tliree families of Se- 
ceders. 

Poor's Funds. — The poor's revenue at Duuino requires no long 
recital. There is but a single pauper on the kirk-session fund, at 
2s. a-month; but the heritors have, since autumn. 1834, contribut- 
ed, according to their valued rent, L. 6, 4s. 5d. to support other 
four paupers, at 2s. or 3s. a-niontli each, as circumstances re- 
quire, with an additional boon out of this sum to buy coals. The 
kirk-session fund consists of the following items : a small sum for 
church seat-rent; a tax on the use of the mortcloth, and the pro- 
clamation of marriage banns; penalty on illegitimate births in 
certain cases and two illegitimate births occur perhaps twice in 
three years; the proceeds from collections at the church door, and 
from money deposited at interest,— forming a small total annually 
of about L. 9, 8s. 7d. From this little capital fall to be paid, be- 
sides the pauper, the session-clerk, precentor, kirk-officer, the sy- 
nod and presbytery clerk, and presbytery officer. Thus the pro- 
vision for the poor, and for the whole kirk-sessional business of the 
parish, does not exceed L. 15, 13s. a-year. 

Education — There has never been but one parochial school in 

According to the parish register in the year 1643, a declaration was issued by 
the Presbytery of St Andrews, to be published in every parish within their bounds, 
and which was confirmed by the General Assembly, the tenor whereof follows : " That 
the wofui ignorance, rudeness, stubbornness, incapacity seen among the common peo- 
ple, proceed from wantof schools in landward, and not putting bairns to school where 
they are— therefore it is ordained that all possible means be used, that there be a 
school m every congregation, and that where there is one already, every one that hath 
chddren put them to school, if past seven years old— if the parents be poor, that the 
knk-session take order for paying the schoolmaster either out of the poor's box, or 
by a quarterly collection — but if the parents be able, then let them be obliged both 
to send.their bairns when the session gives order, and not to remove them till the 
Session be acquainted." In the spirit of this wise detlaratiou, it is said in the regis- 
ter, that « Tuesday, 6th June 1643, the minister, with the heritors of the parish and 
elders of the session, did convene at the kirk : there was lent out of the box for ad- 
yancement to _Mr James Richardsone, reader, for bypast service, 108 merks," that 
is, L. 6, Sterling: " As also it was ordained that Mr James should begiune his school 
on Moonday next, and that he should have a hundredth pound a year," that is, 
I. 8, 6s. _8d. Sterling, " and that the same should be payed to him at two terms 
in the yeir, viz. Whitsunday and Martinmasse." Whatever the school fees were, this 
was a handsome salary ; for, being twenty four years before the seventh year of Charles 
11., when the valued rent taken by Cromwell was confirmed as the standard of va- 
luation, the L. 100 Scotch in the parish might be equal to L. 1400 Scotch now. or 
U 1 16, 13s. 4d. After the act passed in the reign of William III. 1C96, " settling

to a prohibition of attending school. In 1805, two years after the new act m favour 
of parochial schoolmasters was framed, a schoolmaster of Dunmo, a licentiate of 
the Scottish church, qualified not only to teach the ordinary branciies of education, 
but French, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, had the school fees raised to him, which had 
declined by the gradual influx of money into the kingdom. The quarter fee for

PRESBYTEKY OF KIRKCALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. DAVID BELL, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, SC. — The village of Kennoway, which in all probability 
gave its name originally to the parish so called, is built along the 
top of a ridge which forms the head of a very sweet little glen, or 
den, as it is commonly called. Of this situation, the name Kenno- 
way, as derived from the Gaelic language, is said to be exactly de- 
scriptive : Kean-nan-uiagh, signifying " the head of the den." 

The parish of Kennoway is, in figure, nearly an oblong ; ex- 
tending about 3 miles from east to west ; and upwards of 2 from 
south to north. It is bounded on the south and west, by the parish 
of Markinch; on the north, by that of Kettle; and on the east, by 
that of Scoonie. 

Topographical Appearances. — In its general aspect, the parish 
of Kennoway is a sloping bank, ascending from south to north : 
having the surface abundantly and beautifully diversified, however, 
by irregular and gently rising heights, and corresponding declivi- 
ties. " The prospect from almost every part," as is accurately re- 
marked in the former Statistical Account of the parish, " is exten- 
sive and beautiful ; commanding a distinct view of the Island of 
May, of the Bass Rock, of Inchkeith, of the shipping on the Forth, 
of the coast south of the Forth, from Dunbar to the west of Edin- 
burgh, including the Lammermoor hills," and part of thePentlands. 
" From the north part of the parish, which reaches the top of the 
bank, there is one of the most extensive views imaginable, taking in 
not only the fore-mentioned prospect to the south, but compre- 
hending almost all Fife, and a great part of the counties of Angus, 
Perth, and Stirling, and of the Grampian mountains." In the cot- 
house of Lalathan, situated on nearly the most elevated point of 
the ridge, is said to be the highest hearth-stone in the county. 

Meteorology. — The mean temperature of the atmosphere, taken 
at ten o'clock, a. m. for six successive years, is as under : — ■

1833, 53.1 183G, 53.3 

Climate. — The climate is, on the whole, far from being unpro- 
pitious. The atmosphere is, for the most part, mild and dry ; the 
harvests are earlier than the general average of the county ; and 
the healthiness of the situation has been long noted and abundant- 
ly experienced. 

Hydrography. — A few small rivulets or burns, some of which 
intersect the parish in different directions, while others form consi- 
derable portions of its boundaries, are the only water scenery of 
which it can boast. None of them are of any note : — but that which 
entering the parish on the north, near Balnkirk, and following a 
circuitous course, till it meets another little stream on the south- 
eastboundary, atthehamletof Kennoway-burns, — whence thus aug- 
mented, it proceeds about a mile to the southward, to fall into the 
Leven, — is worthy of special mention. It is so, from this circum- 
stance, that, passing close to the village of Kennoway, its banks 
there are high, winding, and beautifully diversified ; in some places 
steep and rocky, jutting out into rugged points, which bring the 
opposite sides into near contact ; in other places, more sloping, and 
of course leaving a wider space between ; and everywhere, finely 
covered with wood. The channel of the stream at this place, with 
the enclosure formed by its elevated banks, receives the name of 
the den, which, though not on a large scale, is certainly a piece 
of scenery possessing many features of great beauty. 

Mineralogy.— The south part of the parish is incumbent upon 
freestone rock of a soft quality, which dips towards the south-east. 
Upon the high ground, on the north part of the parish, the soil is 
incumbent on a ridge of whinstone, which lies in the direction 
nearly east and west. 

The soil is of various qualities, and mostly all arable. On the 
south and east, it is principally light fertile land; in the centre, it 
is loam and clay, upon a retentive subsoil ; and on the north, upon 
the rising ground, there is a small proportion of dry loam, incum- 
bent upon the whinstone rock. 

This whinstone, at various points, has been quarried and used 
for building ; but more commonly for road -metal. Freestone to 
a trifling extent is wrought in the den, also for the purposes of 
building ; but it is coarse and soft, and apt to moulder down, when 
exposed to the weather. 

There are some beds of red keel found in the den ; and they 

4

have been occasionally worked ; but, iieing only two inches thick, 
and not affording an adequate remuneration, nothing has been done 
in them for a number of years past. 

On the western boundary of the parish, there is a patch of peat- 
moss ; and towards the eastern boundary, beds of coal at various 
depths are found, some of which have been wrought, with scarcely 
any intermission, for nearly fifty years past. The line of dip of 
the strata lies in the form of a crescent. Towards the east of the 
coal-field, it dips to the south-east, and towards the west, it ap- 
proaches to south-west. The dip of the strata is about one foot 
in twelve. Slips or fissures, generally running in a straight direc- 
tion from east to west, are found frequently to interrupt the seams 
of coal, throwing them up or down to a distance, varying from a 
few inches to eight feet. 

The following journal shows the metals with their depths re- 
spectively, which have been gone through to reach the seams of 
coal at present wrought, lying upwards of fifty-four fathoms from 



the surface.

II. — Civil History. 
Literary Production. — A rare and very curious work, " Com- 
prehending a Chronicle of the most remarkable events in Scot- 
land, particularly in Fife, from 1649 to 1671, and containing va- 



378 



FIFESHIRE 



luable genealogical notices of almost every faniHy of note in this 
part of the country," has been generally ascribed to a Mr John 
Lamont, proprietor of Easter Newton in this parish. The work 
was first inibhshed in 1810, by the late Mr Constable, under the 
title of " The Chronicle of Fife." Another edition was printed 
at Edinburgh in 1830, under the title of " The Diary of Mr John 
Lamont of Newton." In the prefatory notice to this second edi- 
tion, doubts are expressed as to whether the author of the Diary 
" possessed the small property of Newton, in the parish of Ken- 
noway," as Mr Constable had stated, and as has generally been 
supposed : and we are sorry to say, as detracting from the little li- 
terary fame, to which the parish, through this channel, might be 
conceived to be entirtled, that, on instituting an inquiry into the 
matter, by a careful perusal of the kirk-session records, and by re- 
ference to the inventory of the titles of Easter Newton, now the 
property of Miss Balfour of Kingsdale, the doubts that have been 
entertained are too well founded.  

Land-owners, — The chief land-owners are, Mrs D. Bethune, 
of Balfour, who is proprietor of the lands of Kennoway and Trea- 
ton ; Miss Lundin, proprietor of Auchtermairnie and Gallovvhill ; 
General Balfour of Balbirnie, proprietor of Lalathan and Dal- 
guinch ; Miss Balfour, proprietor of Kingsdale ; C. M. Christie, 
Esq. of Durie, proprietor of Drummaird ; Miss Wallace, proprie- 
tor of Newton Hall ; J. B. Fernie, Esq. proprietor of Kilmux ; 
Mrs Paston of Barnslee, proprietor of the lands of Brunton ; Mr 

 Through the kindness of Messrs Stevenson and Yule, W. S. Edinburgh, a 
friend to whom we applied was permitted to inspect the inventory of the titles of East- 
er Newton ; and we learn from him, that the first writ in this inventory is a charter 
of Adjudication and Novodamus, by James Law of Urunton the superior of Easter 
Newton  of those lands, to John Lamont, skipper in Largo, who took infeftnient 
thereon, and recorded the same in the general Record, 1st October and 2jth Novem- 
ber 1695. This was evidently the first proprietor of Easter Newton of the name of 
Lamont, as the former owner of the lands was Euphemia Durie, widow of the Rev. 
Robert Mercer, minister of Kennoway. The next proprietor after the said John 
Lamont, in the course of the progress, is James Lamont, his eldest son. 

Now that John Lamont. who thus first became proprietor of Easter Newton in 
169.5, and was succeeded in the property hy his son, James Lamont, could not be the 
author of a Diary which had commenced, if not earlier, at least in 1649, is evident 
from the particulars which follow. In the register of rnarriages and births of this 
parish, the marriage of John Lamont of Newton to Mary Lundin is recorded in 
1697 ; and again the marriage of John Lamont of Newton Easter to Margaret Wat- 
son, is recorded in 1698; subsequently, the baptisms of eight children, the fruit of 
this second marriage, are recorded, the youngest named Robert being baptised on 
the loth January 1715 ; and so late as in M'.VA, a silver communion cup, as the in- 
scription on it bears, was presented to the parish of Scoonie, by Mr John Lamont of 
Newton. 

A comparison of the dates must satisfy every one that John Lamont, author of the 
Diary, conld not be the person of the same name who was proprietor of Easter New- 
ton in this parish.

Parochial Register. — The date of the earliest entry in the pa- 
rochial register, is supposed to be in 1 634. The figures after anno 
at the top of the page have been removed through decay of the 
paper ; but an entry, about half way down the same page, bearing 
the date 1635, is perfectly distinct. After this, on a subsequent 
page, comes July 1638 ; and though the book in which these dates 
are found, is not in a state of very good preservation, yet the details 
of the transactions of the kirk-session, given with great minuteness, 
and often showing an extreme degree of vigilance and rigour in the 
exercise of authority, may be gathered from the last-mentioned 
date, v\ith few, if any exceptions, continuously down to December 
1675. From this time, however, to 1690, a period of about fif- 
teen years, there is an entire blank ; and the same thing'occurs be- 
tween 1755 and 1761. From this last date, up to the~ present 
time, the records are entire. 

What could have occasioned the blanks above referred to, it is 
impossible to say determinately : but the probability is, that the 
minutes had been originally kept, and that the books which con- 
tained them have been lost : for the volumes preserved are filled 
with minutes of transactions in regular succession, and the blanks 
occur in both cases between the conclusion of one volume and the 
commencement of another. 

Mansion-Houses. — The only mansion houses in the parish _ are 
those of Auchtermairnie, Kingsdale, and Newton Hall ; of which 
the two last-mentioned are modern buildings ; and the materials 
employed in their construction were brought from neighbouring 
parishes. 

HI. — Population. 

In the former Statistical Account of the parish, written in 1793, 
it is remarked, that the number of the people and houses seems to 
have been nearly the same for centuries ; and in regardto the vil- 
lage of Kennoway, containing about one-half of the whole inhabi- 
tants, it is observed, that " very few houses wereknown to have 
been built on a new foundation." The population of the parish 
at that time, seems to have amounted to nearly 1300. 

Within the last forty years, however, the village and parish, re- 
taining nearly the same relative proportion in point of numbers, 
have made a very considerable increase of their population. In the 



380 



FIFESHIU K. 



village many new feus on ninety-nine years leases have been obtain- 
ed and built on, principally along a new section of the line of road 
leading this way from Kirkcaldy to Cupar : — and in other parts of 
the parish, the number of dwelling-houses has been gradually en- 
larged, chiefly in the same way. 

The increase of population adverted to has been owing prin- 
cipally, it is presumed, to the gradually improving condition of this 
part of the country in general ; and may, perhaps, be in some 
measure assigned to the establishment and growing prosperity of 
several manufactories in the near neighbourhood. A number of 
individuals find constant viork at Cameron Distillery, and the Haugh 
Spinning-mill, which are both m Markinch parish ; and the exten- 
sive manufacture of linens carried on, by wealthy individuals and 
companies, in most of the surrounding district, supplies the weavers, 
of whom there are a great many here, with regular employment. 

The amount of population at each census, taken at different pe- 
riods under the direction of Parliament, is as follows : 

In the year ] 801, .1466 

1811, . J517 

1821, . 1649 

1831, . 1721 • 

It is worthy of notice that, at the time of this last census, the 
number of males exceeded that of females by 9 ; there being of 
the former 865, and of the latter 856. 

Of the population residing in villages, there were at the same 
time in that of Kennoway, 862 ; in that of Star, 232 ; and in that 
of Baneton, 125 ; making in all 1219 ; and in the country there 
were 502.

deaths, . . • . . . .29

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards, is 10, of whom only three are at present resident in 
the parish. 

• This number of 1721, ought to have been increased, we presume to think, by 
234, the amount of population on the lands of Dalguinch, &amp;c., in the west end of 
the parish, which are an annexation qnaud sacra to Markinch. The census of popu- 
lation by order of Government is unquestionably a purely civil matter ; and, there- 
fore, the whole of the inhalitants of the parish quoad civi/io, ought to have been stated : 
—the more especially as the population on the lands of Duniface, in IMatkinch ]a- 
rish, which are an annexation quoad sacra to Kennoway, was also included in the 
Markinch list.s.

Character of the People. — The people, in their general habits, 
are industrious, cleanly, and economical ; and their circumstan- 
ces are, for the most part, comfortable. In behaviour, the great 
bulk of them are worthy of commendation, as being sober, peace- 
able, decorous, and upright. Some few exceptions have, no 
doubt, always existed ; and these have of late years, it is to be fear- 
ed, been very considerably increased. Drunken brawls, and acts of 
wanton mischief, committed during the night by persons under the 
excitement of spirituous liquors, have, for a few years past, been 
frequent and outrageous beyond all former precedent in the history 
of the place ; and at this moment, a general movement is making 
by the respectable part of the community, to put an end, if pos- 
sible, to such things, by having the perpetrators of them uniform- 
ly prosecuted and punished ; — to take steps towards which, indivi- 
duals who have been aggrieved have hitherto felt a great reluct- 
ance. The grand remedy, if it could be applied, would be to lay 
a restriction on the improper use of ardent spirits. Drunkenness 
is certainly the prevailing vice amongst us ; and is the originator, 
or at least inciting cause, to almost every mischief. Imprisonment 
for violent assault under its influence has of late been in two in- 
stances inflicted.. 

" A considerable proportion of the inhabitants of this parish," 
says a discerningand impartial observer, who has livedlong amongst 
them, the Rev. Dr Fraser, " appear to me to discover their own 
share of Scottish acuteness and intelligence. I have often seen 
evidence also of their readiness to assist each other ; particularly 
by personal service, in times of affliction." 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The number of acres in the parish, standard im- 
perial measure, may be stated at 3750. Of these, 3470 are under 
the plough ; 30 have never been cultivated, remaining constantly 
waste or in pasture ; and 250 are under wood. Larch and Scotch 
firs are the kinds of trees that have generally been planted ; but 
enough of hard-wood of various kinds has been here and there in- 
terspersed, to prove by its healthy and vigorous growth that the 
soil is congenial to its produce.

Rent of Land. — The rent of land varies from 15s. to L. 3. The 
average may amount to L. 1, 10s. per imperial acre. The ave- 
rage rent of grazing an ox or cow is about L, 3. Till of late, 
there were few or no sheep in the parish ; but Mr Robert Ballin- 
gall, an intelligent and enterprising farmer, who is tenant both of 
Wester Treaton and of Newton of Kingsdale, has, within these 
two years, introduced them, and has at present a flock of between 
13 and 14 scores. 

Wages. — The wages of the best day-labourers, until about six 
months ago, when they were considerably raised, had continued 
for eight or ten years past, both in winter and summer, at Is. 4d. 
a day. Masons' and wrights' wages, during the same period, va- 
ried from l'2s. to 14s. a week, in summer, and from 10s. to lis. 
in winter. The wages of farm-servants have continued, for a long 
time, very stationary. Married men of this description receive from 
L. 9 to L. 10 in money, 6 bolls of meal, a pint of milk a day, as 
it comes from the cow, 8 bolls of potatoes, a free house and gar- 
den, and coals driven. Young or unmarried men receive from 
L. 9 to L. 1 1 in money ; and get their meals in the farm-house. 
When these latter are in a bothie, they receive 6| bolls of meal, 
and a pint of sweet milk a day. Women employed in farm-work 
receive from 7d. to 8d. per day of nine hours. 

The cattle reared in the parish are generally the native breed 
of the county. The chief characteristics of the Fife breed are 
their being mostly all black, with white horns, rather long in the 
legs, long and straight in the back, with broad hooks ; their hav- 
ing a fine silky skin, and prominent eyes. They are generally 
kindly feeders ; and are much esteemed by the butcher for the 
excellent quality of the beef, as well as for the great quantity of 
tallow to the size of the carcase. The cows are for the most part 
profitable milkers; producing a great quantity of butter from the 
milk. 

Some attempts have been made to improve the Fife breed by 
crossing the cow with a Teeswater bull. The oflspring of this 
cross are nearly as valuable at three years old, as the pure Fife 
breed is at four. They are more easily fattened, and when kept till 
five years old, they are as heavy as the pure Teeswater breed at 
the same age. 

The crops generally cultivated are wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, 
and turnip, with a small proportion of beans. The rotations com- 

3

monly observed vary according to the nature of the soil. Upon 
the stronger soils, the following are practised : Summer fallow, 
wheat, beans, barley, hay, oats. Summer fallow or potatoes, 
wheat, hay, pasture, oats. Summer fallow, wheat, barley, hay, 
oats. 

Upon the lighter soils, the following are in use : viz. turnips or 
potatoes, barley or wheat, hay, pasture, oats. Turnips or potatoes, 
barley or wheat, pasture, pasture, oats. 

The high prices during he late war gave a stimulus to the im- 
provement of the soil ; and at this day, the exertions of the tenan- 
try have by no means slackened. Although suffering much, as 
they have done for a number of years past, from the very low state 
of the market, yet it appears as if their utmost efforts have been 
used to raise an increased quantity of produce, so as to indemnify 
themselves for the depression of price. By the improvements that 
have been thus introduced, the fertility of the soil has been much in- 
creased. It can safely be averred, that now a fourth more pro- 
duce is raised from the soil than was obtained twenty years ago. 
This has been chiefly brought about by improved rotations of crop- 
ping, by draining and liming, and by the use of artificial manures, 
such as ground bones and rape dust. 

The drainage of the soil, hitherto, has been accomplished in 
most cases by deep drains cut across the field at the top of the 
spring; but a new system has now been put into practice, which, 
if properly executed upon that portion of the parish which lies on 
a retentive sub-soil, will very much increase its value, and render 
it fit to carry all kinds of green crops. This new system, which 
is called the frequent-drain system, has been borrowed from Mr 
Smith of Deanston. It is executed by cutting small drains up every 
six or every twelve ell furrow, as occasion requires, from two and a- 
half to three feet deep, with small spades used for the purpose. At 
the top, the drains are of the width of a common spade ; and at the 
bottom, the small spade is used to cut them out four inches wide ; 
and a scoop finishes the process, by clearing out the loose earth at 
the bottom. The drains are, after this, filled to within eighteen inches 
of the surface, with stones broken to the size of road-metal ; and 
these stones are then covered with a turf. After the field has been 
gone over with these drains, it is ploughed by a trenching skeleton 
plough, sixteen inches deep,— which opens the hard sub -soil below, 
and allows the water to percolate to the drains, so that the land is 
rendered perfectly dry.

Farms are generally let on lease for a period of nineteen years. The 
farm -buildings, with few exceptions, are by no iTieans commodious. 
In too many instances, the occupier is fettered for want of suffici- 
ent accommodation for his bestial. Most of the land in the parish 
is inclosed, but many of the fences are by no means substantial. \ 
A very excellent and commodious steading was built in 1832, by 
Miss Balfour on her farm of Newton of Kingsdale. It is built of 
freestone, and covered with slate. The thrashing-machine is pro- 
pelled by a high-pressure steam-engine of six horse power. There 
is another thrashing-machine propelled by steam power in the pa- 
rish, on the farm of Wester Treaton, the property of Mrs D. Be- 
thnne of Balfour. 

The greatest improvement which has recently been made in the 
parish, in agricultural matters, was executed by the late Captain 
Lundin on his estate of Auchtermairnie. By cutting ditches and 
planting hedges, — by draining and liming, — by removing embank- 
ments and levelling, — by planting and transplanting trees, — by 
building steadings and making roads, he nearly doubled the value 
of his property in the course of sixteen years. The appearance, 
also, of his estate in this time, was improved, perhaps, more than 
any other part of the county of a similar extent. 

This gentleman, whose many virtues, both private and pubhc, 
will render his memory long dear, died in the prime of life, after 
an illness of only a few days, in the month of November 1832. 

Coal Mine. — It has been mentioned, that, in the eastern part of 
the parish, coal at different depths is found, and that it has been 
wrought with little intermission, for nearly fifty years past. The 
seams which have hitherto been chiefly dug are those marked No. 
III. and IV. in the journal before given. These seams were lat- 
terly wrought on what is called the long-wall method. After leav- 
ing sufficient pillars at the pit-bottom, every inch of coal, with the 
interjacent bed of black stone, was cut out progressively forward, 
and the whole superincumbent strata allowed to crush towards the 
stone or rubbish taken from the coal, which was used for gobbing 
the excavation. This coal was laid dry by a day-level of 350 fa- 
thoms in length. 

The seams above-specified having been nearly wrought out, the 
proprietor of the mine, J. B. Fernie, Esq. of Kilmux, a gentleman 
of great enterprise, well known, especially, as an eminent agricul- 
turist, and to whom the writer of this account is indebted for the 
information he supplies, both in regard to coal and agricultural 



KKNNOWAV. 



385 



matters, — has lately sunk a pit to a depth of more than 54 fa- 
thoms, where coal, marked VII. and VIII. in the journal, is found 
to the thickness of 5 feet 2 inches, with an interjacent bed of grey- 
stone 9 inches thick. To draw the water from this pit, an engine 
of forty-seven horse power has been erected. The coal, which 
has now been wrought for several months, is found to be of good 
quality, and it-is believed that the field is extensive. There are 
at present between 40 and 50 coUiers employed. 

Raio Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce rais- 
ed in the parish may be stated as under : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, for food of man and beast, L. 9000 0 0 

potatoes and turnips, . . . 1000 0 0 

hay cultivated, .... 700 0 0 

land in pasture, .... 1 200 0 0 

mines and quarries, chiefly coal, . . 2300 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce, L. 14,400 0 0 

Manufactures. — Besides two grind ing-mills for oats and barley 
in the parish, there is also a lint-mill for scutching flax, a plash- 
mill for washing yarn, and a spinning-mill for spinning tow. The 
three last-mentioned are on a very small scale, employing together 
not more than 18 or 20 hands. All the mills are driven by water. 

At the time when the former Statistical Account was written, 
it is remarked, that there was then, " a considerable quantity of 
coarse linen made in the parish, which was sold brown ; and some 
also of a better quality, which was bleached and sold at the sum- 
mer markets in the neighbourhood." This species of goods was 
commonly known by the name of Silesias, and there were not a 
few individuals in this place who, in a small way, were engaged in 
the manufacture of them. The trade was for a long time brisk 
and profitable, but it entirely failed on the introduction of mill- 
spinning, through the consequent great reduction on the price of 
manufactured goods. 

There are still a great many weavers in the parish, not fewer 
than 300 male and female, connected with whom, at least 150 
hands more, find employment as winders. But the business now 
is all transacted by agencies, on account of wealthy manuftictur- 
ing companies or individuals in the surrounding district. There 
are none in this parish. 

The species of goods now manufactured are dowlas sheetings 
of various widths, from three yards and under, Tweels, and a few 
diapers and Darlingtons. The quality varies from 700 to 1000 
dowlas. The number of spindles woven in a year may be stated

at 68,000 ; and the average wage of each weaver at 7s. a week : — 
but a good and dihgent worker will, without difficulty, make twice 
that Sinn. 

There are not fewer than 69 hands employed as shoemakers 
in the parish. The produce of their joint labour is of course 
much more than is requisite for meeting the wants of the neigh- 
bourhood ; and the surplus is, for the most part, carried to the ad- 
jacent market-towns, chiefly to Dundee, to supply the shoe-shops. 
A small proportion is also disposed of at the principal fairs in the 
neighbourhood. 

Reed Society. — The operative weavers of Kennoway, or at least 
the great majority of them, sensible of the advantages that might 
be derived from having the use of an extensive and proper assort- 
ment of reeds ; after having been, for a number of years, members 
of a society in the neighbourhood, instituted for promoting this 
object — about three years ago formed themselves into an associa- 
tion for the same purpose, denominated the " Kennoway Reed 
Societ}'." The sole object of this society is to serve its members 
with reeds of any given order and breadth. It is open at all times 
for the admission of workmen properly qualified and recommend- 
ed, who are of good character, and living within two miles of the 
village of Kennoway. The entry-money is 3s. 6d. for one share, 
and a member may hold as many shares as he pleases. A certain 
rate is paid for the use of each reed, according to the description 
it is of, and according to the amount of spindles it is employed in 
the weaving of. 

This society is found to be of great benefit to its members. Of 
these, there are 122, holding in all 199 shares. The number of 
reeds which the society is possessed of, is 560 ; the average price 
of each of which, when new, might be 5s. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — There are no market-towns in the parish, but 
the access to Kirkcaldy and Cupar is easy, each being about nine 
miles distant; the former in a south-westerly, and the latter in a 
north-easterly direction. The means of communication, in every 
part of the parish, are easy, the roads being in general good. Of 
these, there are about two miles of turnpike. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church, in the 
village of Kennoway, renders it convenient for by far the greater 
part of the population ; there being in that village, and within the 
compass of about half a mile around it, upwards of 1100 inhabi- 



KENNOWAY. 



387 



tants. The distance of the church from the most remote extre- 
mities of the parish is between two and three miles. 

The age of the church must, from its structure, and the height 
to which the surrounding burying-ground has accumulated above 
its foundation, be very great; but there are no means of ascer- 
taining the exact period at which it was built. The lintel of a 
door, which is supposed to be of the same date with an addition 
that had been made to the original edifice, has 1619 inscribed on 
it. The present state of repair of the church, however, notwith- 
standing its great age, is exceedingly good. Perhaps it is to be 
regretted, considering its size, as compared with the population, 
that it is so good ; and that such a sum as nearly L. 200 was ex- 
pended in putting it into its present comfortable state, so lately 
as in the summer of 1832. The number of sittings in it is 463 ; 
while the number of families belonffinof to the Estabhshment in the 
parish is 288; and that of individuals of all ages 1027. The 
number of names on the communion roll at present is 507, from 
which, if 28 be deducted for the old and infirm, who cannot attend 
church, there is left still the number 479. This exceeds the num- 
ber of sittings in the church by 16. There are no free sittings. 

An excellent and commodious new manse, with offices and gar- 
den wall, was built in 1833, on a new and very eligible site, about 
five minutes walk from the church. The glebe consists of about 
7 acres, and may be valued at L. 20 yearly. The stipend, which 
was augmented in 1832, amounts to 16 chalders, with L. 10 for 
communion elements. 

There are two Seceding congregations in the parish, the places 
of worship of which are both also in the village of Kennoway. 
An unpopular settlement about the middle of last century gave 
occasion to the erection of the elder of these two congregations, 
which is connected with the United Associate Secession Synod. 
The present minister of this congregation, who was ordained to his 
charge upwards of forty-two years ago, is the learned and pious 
Rev. Donald Eraser, D. D., well known as the biographer of the 
Erskines, two of the fathers of the Secession, and as the author 
of other popular works. In his congregation, by particulars which 
he kindly furnished for this account, the number of members is 
428; besides whom, there are of the young with a few other hear- 
ers about 290. It is to be noticed, however, that about one-third 
«f the whole reside within the bounds of other parishes. The 



388 



FIFF.SHIUK. 



amount of stipend is L. 120, with a comfortable clwelling-house 
and garden. 

The other Seceding congregation in the parish, which is in 
connexion with the Original Burgher Synod, has been in existence 
smce 1800. The number of its members is under 200, of whom 
about one-half reside within the parish. This congregation is at 
present without a minister ; but the stipend of the one who lately 
left them for another situation was . L. 75, with a dwelling-house 
and small garden. • 

There are, besides those attached to these two congregations 
of Seceders, a very few individuals within the parish, belonging to 
the Relief and Independent denominations. The proportion 
which the whole number of Seceders and Dissenters taken together, 
bears to the number of those attached to the Established Church, 
is very nearly as 19 to 23. Among all denominations, the places 
of worship are in general well attended. 

Societies for Religious Purposes. — A society, denominated the 
Kennoway Female Bible and Missionary Association, was formed 
here in 1814; and another, styled the Kennoway Bible and Mis- 
sionary Association, was instituted in 1819. Their annual pro- 
ceeds average together rather more than L. 30. All denomina- 
tions concur in these institutions. 

Education. — Besides the Parochial School, which is attended 
on an average by 120 scholars, and is most efficiently taught, 
there are two unendowed schools in the parish, one of which is a 
female one :— and the children in the village of Star, in the West 
end of the parish, enjoy the benefit of a school which is taught 
just beyond the boundary. There are thus very few who can be 
said to be inconveniently situated with respect to the means of 
education. The parochial teacher has the maximum salary, with 
the legal accommodations. The amount of his school fees may 
be between L. 30 and L. 40. 

The list of fees for the parochial school is as under : English 
reading, 2s. 6d. per quarter ; reading and writing, 3s. per do. ; 
arithmetic, 4s. ; Latin and other branches, 5s. 

Library. — The only circulating library in the parish, is a juve- 
nile one connected with the Sabbath schools. It contains about 
400 volumes, which are mostly very small. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was instituted for the parish 
and its vicinity in September 1834; the business of which has 
ever since been conducted principally by the writer of this Ac- 



KKNNOWAY. 



389 



count. The amount of sums under L. 10, deposited up till this 
date, is L. 420 ; and the number of depositors at present is 83. 
Since the bank was opened, sixteen sums of L. 10 each, amount- 
ing in all to L. ] 60, have been removed at various times ; and the 
most, if not the whole of them, lodged in other banks. The Na- 
tional Bank of Scotland, at whose office in Kirkcaldy the money 
belonging to our savings' bank collectively is lodged, most gene- 
rously allows L. 4 per cent, interest on it; and the same rate is 
allowed to the depositors in the savings' bank individually ; the 
interest in this latter case being calculated for pounds only, omit- 
ting odd shillings ; and for months, omitting odd days. 

Equitable Deposit Society. — A society was begun in May 1835, 
entitled the Kennoway Equitable Weekly Deposit Society, each 
member of which pays Is. weekly. When a sufficient sum has in 
this way been collected, four shares of L, 30 each are drawn by 
ballot, and those receiving them give security that they will pay 
4 per cent, interest thereon, in addition to continuing their weekly 
payments, until such time as all the members shall have drawn 
their shares respectively. The sum collected from the commence- 
ment of the association to the 26th December 1836, amounted to 
L. 882, 18s. 2d. 

Poor and Parochial Bunds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 22 ; and the sum allotted to each per 
calendar month varies from 2s. 6d. to 8s. 8d. The average an- 
nual amount of contributions, for the last five years, for the relief 
of the poor, has been L. 77 ; of which, L. 34 have been collected 
at the church door; L. 5 have come from mortcloth and marriage 
dues; and the remainder has been obtained by voluntary assess- 
ment of the heritors. 

For a considerable number of years past, a sum of between 
L. 30 and L. 40 has been raised in addition to the above, by ex- 
traordinary collections at the doors of the church and meeting- 
houses, and by donations from non-resident heritors, for the pur- 
pose of distributing about new-year time, amongst individuals and 
families of the poorer class, but who are not generally on the 
poor's roll, a quantity of coals and meal, and occasionally some 
other little necessary. By help of this fund also, for several years 
past, the spinning of flax has been obtained for some of the old 
people, who can find no other employment. Dressed flax is at 
present kindly supplied, as needed, by a mill -spinner in the neigh- 
bourhood, who allows 6d. per spindle for spinning it. To this 



390 



FIFESHIRE. 



the fund adds another 6d., so that the spinner receives Is. for 
her work, while the fund loses id. on each spindle. The sum 
earned in this way, by even a good spinner, is very small ; but 
whatever it may amount to, it is the fruit of labour, and it is prized 
as such. 

Fairs. — Two annual fairs are held in the village of Kennoway, 
the one in April, and the other in October. No business has for 
a lonof time been done at them. 

Inns and Alehouses. — 'There are no less than 13 houses in 
the parish licensed to sell spirituous liquors and ales. If so 
many can make profits by such a traffic, there is great reason 
to fear, that by far too much money is spent in them, and that an 
increase of intemperance must be the result. The unnecessary 
multiplication of such places of resort is much to be deprecated ; 
for, besides affording facilities to those who are already addicted 
to drinking, it sets additional and powerful temptation to the worst 
of all vices, in the way of those who are sober and industrious. 

Fuel. — Coal abounds in all the neighbourhood, and after what 
has been already said in regard to its being found of good quality, 
and wrought in the parish, it is scarcely necessary to add, that 
this is the fuel universally used. At Balgrie colliery, in the pa- 
rish, from which the great majority of the inhabitants are supplied, 
it is sold at present at 8s. 4d. per ton.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JOHN M'LACHLAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name and Boundaries. — The name of this parish is of Gaelic 
origin, the word Weem or Wemyss signifying a cave, manifestly 
in allusion to the number of caves on the sea-shore. It is bound- 
ed by the parish of Dysart, on the west ; by Markinch, on the north 
and east ; and by the Frith of Forth, on the south. Its length 
from south-west to north-east is about 6 miles ; and its breadth 
about I2 : in whole, it contains about 9 square miles. 



WEMYSS. 



391 



Topographical Appearances. — The ground immediately above 
the sea-shore is, in some places, considerably elevated, and rises 
with a gentle slope to the north, and also to the west. Along the 
sea-shore, there is a line of rocks which extends a good way into 
the sea, even at low water-mark. The whole beach is very rocky, 
and may well be designated iron bound. 

Climate. — The climate, upon the whole, may be said to be good. 
The air, as might be expected, is, during the winter months espe- 
cially, keen and bracing, and at all times the temperature of the 
atmosphere is sensibly felt to be colder than that of districts five or 
six miles up the country. 

Alineraloc/y. — This parish rests upon rocks which belong 
wholly to the coal formation. From the river Leven, even as 
far west as Wemyss Castle, the strata are composed of dark red 
sandstone of various degrees of hardness, colour, and durability. 
From Wemyss Castle, along the shore and western boundary, there 
are twelve workable seams of coal, of the aggregate thickness of 
89 feet 5 inches. The rocks between these seams of coal are, 
shale, sandstone, slate clay, and argillaceous iron-stone, in bands 
and balls. These rocks alternate in beds of very various thick- 
ness. There is also a seam of yellow ochre, but not a particle of 
limestone ; neither is there any greenstone or whin belonging 
to the strata. The shore, however, is thickly strewed with bould- 
ers of it, and the soil when pierced to any depth abounds with 
them. 

The quantity of fossil organic remains belonging to the vege- 
table kingdom, is immense. Whole forests of fossil trees have 
been discovered in the beds of shale immediately above some of 
the coals, many of them of the most perfect form. The bodies of 
the trees are always composed of sandstone, although found in 
shale, while the bark, and sometimes the cellular tissue, round 
the pith, is composed of clear cherry coals ; and they are found in 
every variety of size, form, and position. And with regard to the 
soils, they are as various as the rocks on which they rest, being 
' in some places only a few feet thick, and consisting of decom- 
posed sandstone, while in others they extend to a depth of from 
30 to 40 feet, consisting of a strong matrix of dark-coloured clay, 
which is quite impervious to water. 

Wood. — The appearance of the parish within the last forty years 
has been greatly improved, in consequence of the great number of 
trees that have been planted in various quarters of it, and which 



392 



PIFESHIRE. 



are in a very thriving condition, and which sheltefr and benefit the 
crops. In tlie neighbourhood of Wemyss Castle, tliere is a num- 
ber of very old trees of various kinds, and which have grown to a 
large size, clearly showing that when trees arc properly attended 
to, they will grow and prosper even near the sea-shore. 

II. — Civil History. 

Plan.— There is in the possession of the family of Wemyss an 
excellent map or survey of the whole of the parish. 

Land-oimer. — The sole land-owner of the whole parish is Cap- 
tain James Erskine Wemyss, R. N., and Member of Parliament 
for the county of Fife. 

Eminent Men. — Under this article may be mentioned Sir Mi- 
chael Wemyss of Wemyss, who, along with Sir Michael Scott of 
Balweary, in the parish of Abbotshall, were sent as ambassadors 
to Norway by the Estates of the kingdom in the year 1290, on the 
death of King Alexander III. to bring home Princess Margaret, 
grand- daughter of the late King, and undoubted heiress of the 
crown of Scotland. They went to Norway as directed, but the 
Princess died at Orkney, on her passage to Scotland. 

There is in the Castle of Wemyss, as a memorial of this embassy, 
a large silver basin, which was given by the King of Norway to Sir 
Michael Wemyss, and which is now used to hold the water on 
baptismal occasions. 

The Rev. George Gillespie also was connected with this parish, 
and was ordained minister of it in April 26, 1618. He was the 
son of Mr John Gillespie, who was sometime minister of the gos- 
pel at Kirkcaldy. He was called by way of distinction, " The 
renowned Gillespie;" and was the first who was admitted by 
a presbytery in that period, without an acknowledgment of the 
bishops. He was one of the four ministers who were sent as com- 
missioners from the Church of Scotland to the Westminster As- 
sembly, in the year 1643. ,In that capacity we are told he distin- 
guished himself greatly, and showed that he was a man of great 
talent and learning, so much so, indeed, that few could equal, 
and none surpass him. On his return from Westminster, he was 
engaged in most of the public affairs of the church, imtil 1648, 
when he was chosen Moderator of the General Assembly. Dur- 
ing his whole life, he was most firmly attached to the great work 
of the Reformation, and continued so till his death. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of the records of Session 
commences 1645, and is regularly kept from 9th March 1692, 



WRMYSS.

down to the present time. From 26th August 1689 to 9th March 
1692, there is a deficiency, the reason for which is thus noticed 
in one of the records : " The reason why the pubhc regis- 
ter in this parish is lame for that period, is, that there was no 
settled minister after Mr Ker was deposed by the secret counsell 
in the foresaid month of August 1689 untill Mr Archibald Rid- 
dell was settled in October 169 J ;" and that during this inter- 
val, " the register was keeped by the Countess of Wemyss, and not 
delivered to the session :" It is farther added "that Mr Ker, student 
of Divinity and Professor in St Leonard's College, St Andrews, 
was admitted minister of Wemyss September 8, 1686, and de- 
posed 26th August 1689, for not reading the ' proclamation and not 
praying publicly for King William and Queen Mary.' " The old- 
est register of baptisms begins in 1660, and that of contracts and 
marriages in 1662. With the exception already noticed, they are all 
regularly and accurately kept from their commencement. The 
number of the whole is fourteen volumes. 

Antiquities.— Vndev this article, we may notice the remains of 
two Popish Chapels, the one at Methil-mill; and the other, a lit- 
tle beyond West Wemyss. There are also the ruins of an old 
castle, usually called Macduff s Castle, situated a little to the east 
of East Wemyss. It is said to have been built by Macduff, who 
was created Earl of Fife about the year 1057, and on whom King 
Malcolm Canmore bestowed some peculiar marks of regard. It 
must have been once a place of great strength, judging from the 
two square towers, and a part of the wall, that still remain. It is 
built on an eminence near the sea shore, having a very command- 
ing view; and thre are few strangers who come to this part of the 
country, without paying a visit to the old castle. 

The Castle of Wemyss, too, the seat of the family of Wemyss, 
deserves notice. It is a large and magnificent building. It is si- 
tuated a little to the east of West Wemyss, on a cliff between 30 
and 40 feet above the level of the sea. Beyond West Wemyss, is 
the Chapel Garden, so denominated from the circumstance of a 
Roman Catholic Chapel having been built there, some of the re- 
mams of which, as already noticed, are still standing. Beside it, 
IS the residence of Thomas By water, Esq. factor on the estate. 
The whole forms a most delightful romantic spot, the sight of which 
could not but amply compensate the admirer of the picturesque, 
even although he had gone a journey of twenty or thirty miles, for 
the sole purpose of visiting this terrestrial paradise.

The increase may be attributed to various causes. 

The people, in general, marry at an earlier period than former- 
ly ; and this holds true in a very marked manner among the fish- 
ermen in Buckhaven. Besides, there is the large manufacturing 
establishment at Kirkland, under the firm of Neilson and Com- 
pany, and which has been long in a very thriving and flourishing 
condition, and which employs a great many hands. And in the 
coal department, which has also been extended, a good many 
houses have been lately built for the accommodation of the col- 
liers, some of whom have come from other parts of the country.

they are quick and intelligent. The other two are also females, 
and belong to one femily. They are both young, the one being 
about two, the other four years of age. 

Habits and Character of the People.— OHsite years, a new acti- 
vity and a new stimulus pervade all classes of the people. And I 



WKMYSS. 



395 



have great pleasure in being enabled to remark, that over the 
length and breadth of this large and populous parish, education 
and knowledge have spread themselves among all ranks and clas- 
ses. The people as a body have long been distinguished for their 
quietness and general good conduct ; and may justly be said to be 
an industrious, contented, decent, and church-going population. 

IV.— Industry. 
Rent of Land. — The rent of land varies from L. 1, 10s. to 
L. 4 per acre. Some farms are let wholly in money, some at a 
grain rent, and some partly grain and partly money, according to 
the fiars of the county. The grazing of a cow for the season is 
L. 3, 10s. ; and for two year olds and one year olds, in the same pro- 
portion. 

Eeal Rent. — The real rent of this parish is L. 6000. 
Agriculture. — 

The number of Scots acres may be about 4000 
Under tillage, . . . 28451 

Uncultivated, . . . 1134, of 

which there are in wood . 500 acres, and 

the remaining . . 654 acres are in Units, roads, 

villages, &amp;c. 

Mines. — There are four coal-pits in this parish, one ironstone 
pit, and one ochre pit. The Wemyss coal-pit employs 140 
men, 24 boys, and 42 girls. The yearly produce is about 40,000 
tons. The selling price of the spHnt is 8s. 6d. per ton. This pit is 
sunk upon the main seam, which is 9 feet thick, and has been 
wrought to the depth of 100 yards below sea level, through the 
whole length of the parish, and has been working constantly for 
the last two centuries. The next working is the parrot or gas 
coal, which is wrought level free, no machinery being necessary. 
It employs about 20 men, and is sold for 10s. per ton. The 
other two pits are wrought exclusively for land sale ; they employ 
about 50 men, 20 boys, and 7 girls. The ironstone working era- 
ploys about 35 men and 3 girls. The ochre pit is but newly 
commenced. The whole number of people employed in mining 
and mining operations may amount to 300 men, 170 of whom 
are colliers, 44 boys, and 52 girls. Their operatio ns, however, 
require the employment of many other hands, such as smiths, 
Wrights, masons, &amp;c. They all receive their wages every two 
weeks, the payment of which is upwards of L. 400. 

There are several very powerful engines employed in this very 
extensive coal establishment. And it is but justice to add, that 



39G 



FIFESIIIRE 



all the recent improvements in mining machinery have been here 
very successfully and advantageously introduced and applied, and 
are all under the very active and efficient management and direc- 
tion of Mr David Landale, mining engineer. 

Fisheries. — This branch of industry deserves notice. The fish- 
ing station at Buckhaven is well known, and of late years has 
greatly increased. There are 170 men employed in this trade, 
and all belong to, and reside in Buckhaven. They have no fewer 
than 144 fishing boats of various dimensions. Generally about 
the beginning of July, they set out to the north, to Helmsdale, 
Fraserburgh, and Wick, the great herring-fishing stations, where 
they stay for about two months. It may well be said, that they 
are a most industrious and hard-working class of men, and are 
truly entitled, not only to protection, but to every countenance and 
encouragement.

It will be seen by the above statement, that the value of the 
nets belonging to the second class of boats is greater than that of 
the first class, because three sets of nets are necessarv to the se- 
cond class, while only two are required for the first and third.

Mamfactu'es. — The principal manufacture is that of hand-loom 
weaving, in which both men and women are employed. In the 
large manufacturing establishment at Kirkland, under the firm of 
Neilson and Company, there are 109 persons engaged in flax- 
dressing; 283 employed at the spinning-mill; 48 in the bleaching 
department; and 241 in the cloth manufactory; in all, 681, in- 
cluding men and women, boys and girls. This large and exten- 
sive work is lighted with gas, and is, for plan, and order and re- 
gularity, a model for any similar erection. As far as the health 
and morals of the people are concerned, it is conducted in the 
best possible manner. It is not only the wish of the proprietors 
that the work people's children should be properly educated, but 
they are really and truly so, in all the common branches ; and 
particular attention is also paid to their instruction in the great 
principles of Christianity, by a well-qualified and efficient teacher. 
And fewer applications for parochial relief have come from the 
people employed at this work, than from any other quarter of the 
parish. 

The extensive works now noticed consume annually 1000 tons 
flax and hemp, from which is spun 280,000 spindles of flax, tow, 
and hemp yarns, two-thirds of which are made into canvas, sheet- 
ing, dowlas, ducks, sacking, and other fabrics ; and about one- 
third of the yarn is sold. The yearly amount of wages may be 
about L. 17,000. 

There are four considerable manufacturers in East Wemyss, 
and one in Buckhaven, who, it is computed, consume annually 
242,320 spindles, which are made into ducks, dowlas, and sheet- 
ing, amounting to 1,202,625 yards of cloth for the home and 
foreign market. Weavers' wages, including winding, may amount 
to L. 10,000 annually. 

East Wemyss was long distinguished for the manutkcture of 
Imen, which has, for some time past, been superseded by those 
above-mentioned . 

Salt— Since the tax on salt was taken off, the number of saltpans 
has been greatly reduced. At Methil, where there were formerly 



398 



FIFKSIIIUE. 



nine, there are now none ; and at West Wemyss, where there were 
formerly seven, there are only two, and at present one of them is 
not working. 6200 bushels may be about the annual average of 
salt made for the last three years, the average annual value of 
which may be about L. 470. This forms at once a very striking 
contrast to the quantity of salt made in this parish, previous to the 
abolition of the salt duties ;— for in 1818, 1819, and 1820, the 
annual average sales of salt made at west Wemyss and Methil, was 
.50,400 bushels. The salt made here is excellent, and obtains a 
ready market. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — There are no market-towns, properly so cal- 
led, in the parish. The nearest is Kirkcaldy, which is about six 
miles from the parish church. 

Villages. — There are seven villages, which are named as under : 
1. East Wemyss, in which is the parish church ; 2. West Wemyss; 
3. Buckhaven; 4. Methil; 5. Kirkland ; 6. West Coaltown ; 
7. East Coaltown. The four first are built on the sea-shore, and 
are rather more than a mile from each other. West Wemyss is 
a burgh of barony, having for its management two baihes, one 
treasurer, and a number of councillors. Buckhaven is a large and 
extensive fishing station. Kirkland is an extensive manufac- 
turing establishment, under the firm of Neilson and Company ; 
and East and West Coaltowns are inhabited by colliers, and who 
are all in the employ of Captain Wemyss. 

Means of Communication. — The turnpike road from Kirkcaldy 
to Cupar iDy Kennoway runs through the north part of the parish, 
and is very good. The other roads, which are kept in repair by 
means of the statute labour money, have been much improved of 
late, although they are not by any means so good as they should 
be. 

Although there is no post-office, yet we have every facility for 
communication, as there is a runner or post-boy from Kirkcaldy 
to Leven every morning, and again from Leven to Kirkcaldy in 
the afternoon. There are two carriers in Buckhaven, who go to 
Kirkcaldy every week, the one on Tuesday and the other on 
Friday. There is also a carrier in East Wemyss, who goes to 
Kirkcaldy twice every week, Tuesday and Friday. And there is 
a woman, who goes every lawful day, carries parcels, and tran- 
sacts any business with which she may be intrusted. 

Harbours. — There is a good harbour at Methil. The pier was 



WEMYSS. 



399 



considerably injured a good many years ago, by a very violent 
storm. There is also a good harbour at West Wemyss, for the 
accommodation of vessels engaged in the coal trade. The erec- 
tion of a new pier and harbour to be set down at the west end of 
Buckhaven, was agitated some two or three years ago. Several 
engineers inspected the ground, and were employed in making a 
plan of the undertaking; but nothing has, as yet, been done. Could 
it be carried into effect, it would be of great utility to the fisher- 
men of Buckhaven ; and from the eligibility of the site, it could 
not fail to be a place of resort for boats and ships in distress. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is in East Wemvss, 
and is as conveniently situated for the great body of the people as 
it could well be. It is an old building in the form of a cross. 
The date of its erection cannot be ascertained. It has undergone 
several repairs ; and, although the construction is bad, yet, upon 
the whole, it is a decent and comfortable place of worship; It 
has sittings for about 1000 persons. It is by far too small for the 
parish. From 900 to 1000 communicate annually. The people 
are very attentive to the ordinances of religion. 

The manse was built in 1791, and is a good and commodious 
house. The offices are also good, and there is a large garden. The 
glebe consists of 7 acres and 15 falls, Scots measure, and is as 
excellent land as any in the parish. The stipend is 17 chalders, 
half meal and half barley, converted at the rate of the highest 
fiars in the county, with L. 10 for communion elements. There 
are some rocks and sea-weed or ware, that belong to the cure. 
Captain James Wemyss is sole heritor. The presentation is in 
the gift of the Town- Council of Edinburgh. 

There is a Dissenting meeting-house in connection with the 
United Associate Synod, situated on the links of Buckhaven, about 
two miles from the parish church. The clergyman's stipend is 
L, 110 per annum, with manse and garden. The present minis- 
ter is the Rev. Robert Pollock. The congregation is respectable, 
and divine service is well attended. 

The following persons have been ministers of this parish since 
the Revolution: Archibald Riddell, 1691 to 1697; Thomas 
Black, 1697 to 1698; James Grierson, 1698 to 1710; John 
Cleghorn, 1711 to 1744; Harry Spens, 1744 to 1780; William 
Greenfield, 1781 to 1784; George Gib, 1785 to 1818. 

The present incumbent was ordained minister of Alva, presby- 



400 



I'iFESHlRli;. 



tery of Stirling, 22cl April 1813, and translated to Wemyss, 4th 
February 1819. 

Catechist. — In 1705, the Earl of Cromarty, out of regard to the 
memory of Margaret, heiress and Countess of Wemyss, and Coun- 
tess of Cromarty, mortified a small sum of money for founding a 
salary to a catechist, for catechising and instructing the colliers 
and salters and others in the parish of Wemyss. The gift of pre- 
sentation is in the family of Wemyss ; and the presentee is tried 
and admitted by the minister and kirk-session. The present ca- 
techist is the second who has ever been appointed ; his salary is 
L. 50, 16s. ll/gd. a year.

Education.-The parochial school is in East Wemyss. The 
teacher, who is a licentiate of the church, has the maximum salary 
viz. L. 34, 4s. 4id., and L. 1, 15s. Vd., for the want of the legal 
quantity of garden ground. He is also session-clerk, the perquisites 
of which may average L. 20 a year. The school fees may amount 
to L 25 per annum. All the common branches are taught here, 
as also Latin, French, and mathematics. There are six other 
schools in the parish, all unendowed, except the school at Ku-kland, 
which is partially endowed, as the company, besides the school 
fees, give L. 30 a year by way of salary. Nearly 800 young per- 
sons' are receiving instruction in various branches of education, at 
the different schools. And if there are any in the parish above 
fifteen years of age, or even above ten, who cannot read, the fault 
lies with the parents. There is an educational machinery m mo- 
tion that is not surpassed in any parish; and all the teachers, seven 



WEMYSS. 



401 



ill nuuiber, are distinguished for their zeal, and efficiency, and di- 
ligence and success, and all, except one, belong to the Established 
Church. 

Under this head, we have to remark that the late Mr Archibald 
Cook, Kirkcaldy, who died in the beginning of 1832, and who 
was a native of this parish, left property to a very considerable 
amount. His widow is liferented in the whole of it, which, after 
her decease, comes to this parish, and is to- be applied solely to 
educational purposes. During the lifetime of Mrs Cook, the 
ministers of Dysart, Kirkcaldy, Abbotshall, Leslie, and Wemyss, 
act as trustees, and have already entered on their office. After 
her death, the trust devolves on the presbytery of Kirkcaldy. 

Libraries. — Asubscription library was instituted in East Wemyss 
in 1817, and contains upwards of 300 volumes, consisting of di- 
vunty, history, voyages, travels, &amp;c. exclusive of reviews and ma- 
gazines. There are, besides, three other libraries in the parish. 
There is one in Buckhaven, one in West Wemyss, and a trades- 
man's library was lately instituted in East Wemyss. 

Sabbath Schools. — There are Sabbath evening schools in all the 
villages, and the young people attending them are accommodated 
with books, chiefly religious, according to their age and capacity. 

Inns. — There is no want of inns or alehouses in the parish. 
Their increase has kept pace with the increase of the population. 
Men cannot be compelled to be religious; but such a tax can 
and ought to be put on strong liquor, as would necessarily oblige 
them to be sober and temperate. 

 Friendly Societies.— There is in this parish the Generous So- 
ciety, which was instituted in 1793 for sick and aged members. 
Each member pays 3s. of entry money, and Is. a quarter, and is 
not entitled to receive any benefit till he has been six years a 
member, and paid his quarterly accounts for that period. A mem- 
ber when sick or unable to work at his lawful employment, receives 
4s. a week for a limited time. Those on the superannuated list 
receive 2s. a week for life. This Society has been the means of 
doing much good to the members, and of preventing pauperism. 
There is an annual procession of its members. It is modelled or 
based upon the plan recommended by the Highland Society of 
Scotland. Its funds are in a flourishing condition, which is a 
strong evidence of the correctness of the principles on which it is 
founded. 

Savings Banks.— A savings bank was established in East Wemyss 
about thirty years ago. The yearly investment may be about L. 210,

MlSCELLiSNEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 

The enlightened and liberal views that have taken place, in all 
departments of industry, have extended themselves to the culti- 
vation of the soil ; and since the publication of the last Statistical 
Report of this parish, the most approved methods of agriculture 
have been introduced. The farmers are industrious, intelligent, 
and persevering, and possess a comprehensive knowledge of hus- 
bandry in all its departments. They have spared no expense, and 
grudged no labour, in order to draw forth, in rich abundance, the 
capabilities of the ground. They have, accordingly, attended to 
draining, which has been well and wisely denominated the basis 
and foundation of all agricultural improvement; and they are 
more and more impressed with the indispensable necessity of a 
proper and regular rotation of green cropping, in order that the 
land may be properly cleaned and p4-epared for a white or gram 
crop. There is, therefore, less fallow than formerly, and a greater 
quantity of potatoes are planted. More live-stock are kept and 
reared, and a greater quantity of turnips raised. More atten- 
tion is also paid to liming, which had been hitherto too much ne-

glected, and which never foils to give a new stimulus to soils that 
had begun to lose their vegetative and productive powers. The 
great wish and study, in ftict, just now is, to have as great a 
breadth of wheat sown down as possible, because this has been 
found, for a considerable time past, the best remunerating crop. 
Great care, however, must be taken not to carry this wish too far, 
because if it were, it could not fail to have an eflPect the very re- 
verse of what was intended. 

I have only farther to remark, that I know no obstacle or dis- 
couragement even to the still greater improvement of the farms in 
this parish, except one, and .that is the great quantity of game that 
abounds, such as hares, and pheasants, and rabbits, &amp;c. No 
doubt this great evil has been gradually diminishing for some years 
past ; but still there is plenty of room for farther improvement, 
which, it is hoped, will not be lost sight of. In every district 
where game is carefully preserved, and allowed to multiply and 
mcrease, no greater bar or obstacle to agricultural improvement 
can be named. 

N. B. — Since the above report was written, and given in up- 
wards of a year ago, I have to notice that a post-ofFice has been 
established in the village of East Wemyss. The new pier and 
harbour, to which allusion is made in the body of this report, in 
reference to Buckhaven, are in a state of great forwardness. The 
expense of this very important undertaking is to be about L. 4200, 
of which the Board of Fisheries, withr that liberality that has al- 
ways characterized their transactions, are to give about L. 3000, 
and the fishermen of Buckhaven are to implement the rest. The 
contractors are the Messrs Mathieson, builders, Glasgow, who, as 
far as they have gone, have executed the work in a most substantial 
and efficient manner. 

I have also to record, that on the 6th of June last, the founda- 
tion stone of a church, in connexion with the Establishment, was 
laid in the village of Methil, the expense of which is to be L. 1030. 
It IS now far advanced; so much so, that it will be open for public 
worship about the beginning of March. This new erection is to 
contam upwards of 800 sittings, and will accommodate the inhabi- 
tants of Methil, Kirkland, Methil-hill, Links of Buckhaven, and 
those of Inverleven, a remote and detached portion of the parish 
of Markmch, the whole including a population of upwards of 1700. 

The pier at Methil is also begun to be repaired, the expense of 
which is to be upwards of L. 1800.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. DAVID COUPER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— Tn name of this parish was anciently Wester King- 
horn. Tradition accounts for its present name by saying, that the 
small island, which forms part of the west side of the harbour, was 
originally peopled by a colony of fishermen, whose dwelling was 
destroyed by fire. But the ancient name of the town was Bart- 
land or Bertiland, which has passed through various forms into 
Burntisland. The etymology is uncertain, but is probably to be 
found in the Gaehc. "There is no doubt that the parish has de- 
rived its present name from the town. 

Extent, Boundaries.— The parish extends about 21 miles from 
east to west, and about 2 miles from north to south. Its whole 
extent may be about 5 square miles. It is bounded on the east 
by Kinghorn ; on the west, by Aberdour ; on the north, by both 
these parishes ; and on the south, by the Frith of Forth.  

Topographical Appearances.— The surface is very varied and 
uneven. The southern part of it presents a Series of ridges of 
different elevations, running from east to west, and parallel to one 
another. The first is that which rises from the sea ; the next, 
that which is called the Schoolhill, and sometimes Mount Plea- 
sant. Between these two, is situated the greater part of the town. 
The next is that on which the village of Kirktoun is situated. 
These three ridges are of very inconsiderable height; but the suc- 
ceeding one rises abruptly, about the middle, to an elevation of 625 
feet above the level of the sea. The hill thus formed is called 
the Bin, and is about half a mile from the shore. It has two tops, 
which, being on the south side very bare and rugged, present a 
fine contrast to the cultivated fields below. To the northward of 
this ridge, the parish presents an interesting variety of hill and 
dale. The eminences are somewhat irregularly scattered, and 



BURNTISLAND.

vary considerably in appearance and elevation. The highest are, 
Orrock Hill and Dunearn Hill. The latter is the highest land 
in the parish, being 695 feet above the level of the sea. The view 
from it is uncommonly extensive and magnificent, embracing, it 
is said, portions of fourteen counties. 

The town stands on a peninsula, which projects a considerable 
way into the Frith, and is very picturesque in its appearance. 
There are about three miles of coast, one-third of which is sandy, 
and two-thirds rocky. At the western boundary there is a small 
cave, to which at full tide there is no access. 

The climate is exceedingly salubrious, and epidemics are rare. 
Hydrography. — There are few streams in the parish. The 
most interesting is Starly Burn, which flows off the large field of 
limestone belonging to the Carron Company, and, after a very 
short course, falls over a high rock into the sea. The cascade 
thus formed is at all times highly picturesque, and, seen through 
the luxuriant foliage which environs it. in summer, is an object of 
uncommon beauty. The water is of a petrifying quality. It holds 
m solution the super-carbonate of lime, which, on coming into con- 
tact with the atmosphere, gives off its excess of carbonic acid, and 
is precipitated as the carbonate of lime. Many interesting spe- 
cimens of petrified moss and wood have been here procured. 

The water with which the town is supplied, is conveyed by 
leaden pipes from the high ground to the eastward. As it flows 
off lime, it is in some degree impregnated with that substance, and 
leaves a slight deposit on being boiled. It is hard, but clear and 
wholesome ; and there is, in general, an abundant supply. 

Tides, Src — Under this head it may be stated, that two hours 
before high-water the ebb-tide commences to run down inshore ; 
and that, vice versa, two hours before low-water, the flood-tide 
commences to run up in-shore. Sometimes before low- water, the 
tide is observed to flow for a short time, and then to ebb to a 
greater distance than the line at which the irregular flow com- 
menced. The reverse of this phenomenon is also observed to 
take place— the tide sometimes beginning to ebb before high- 
water, and, after receding a short space, to return to high-water 
mark. These irregularities are denominated leahies, and are al- 
ways connected with stormy weather. A minute account of them, 
as they occur in the Frith, between Queensferry and, Alloa, may 
be found in Sibbald's History of Fife, in a communication from the 
Rev. Mr Wright, formerly minister at Alloa.

Geology and Mineralogy. — This parish, in a geological point of 
view, is very interesting, not only as illustrating general geological 
principles, but also from the varied and beautiful displays it affords of 
the numerous Neptunian and Plutonian rocks of the coal formation, 
and of the fossil organic remains which it contains. Since the atten- 
tion of naturalists was first directed to the natural history of this dis- 
trict, by the observations of Professor Jameson, read to the Wernerian 
Society, few parts of Scotland have been more visited by native and 
foreign geologists, and'the Professor himself still pays us an annual 
visit with his class of Natural History. We regret that the limited 
nature of this work prevents us from communicating more than the 
following observations. 

The southern part of this parish may be regarded as a centre 
from which the strata radiate in opposite directions, thus af- 
fording an example of the qua-qua versal dip. Supposing the 
spectator to look southward, he will have on his left Kinghorn 
and Inchkeith, consisting of strata of the coal formation, dipping 
to the east. In front, he will have the country between Newhaven 
and the Pentland range, where the strata dip south ; while on the 
right, the strata cross the Frith in the direction of Inchcolm, the 
dip being westerly. Behind the dip is to the north. Hence it 
would seem as if this part of the country had originally been flat, 
and been upheaved by some great subterranean force, whose cen- 
tre of action has been somewhere near Burntisland. 

The rocks belong to the coal formation, and are principally lime-- 
stone, sandstone, ironstone, slate-clay, bituminous shale, green- 
stone, basalt, trap tuffa, &amp;c. At the boundary between Kinghorn 
and Burntisland, there are beds of sandstone and limestone, which 
are cut across by greenstone and trap tuffa. Here also occur 
masses of sandstone, limestone, and slate-clay, imbedded in tufa- 
ceous rock. Coal has also been ascertained to exist. 

At Whinnyhall quarries in the south-east part of the parish, 
the strata have been laid open to a considerable extent. In the 
lowest quarry, or that nearest the sea, they occur in the following 
order: — the lowest is limestone, then slate-clay, felspar, slate-clay, 
and bituminous shale of a dark shade of colour, ironstone, sand- 
stone, alluvium. The dip is eastward. In the next quarry to the 
north, the same strata occur, exhibiting a beautiful bend or wave-. 
The felspar is here seen bursting through the coal formation, af- 
fording a very good specimen of a slip or fault. Another example 



BUUNTI3LAND. 



407 



occurs at the third quarry to the north, on the side of the road 
leading to Kirkcaldy. Between these quarries and the Lochies, is 
a mass of greenstone with slate-clay, very much hardened, and re- 
sembling porcelain jasper. 

The strata of sandstone, shale, and limestone, contain fossil 
remains of ferns, also specimens of the fossil genera Stigmaria, 
Sigillaria, Lepidodendron, Lepidophyllum, Lepidostrobus and Ly- 
copodites. In the bituminous shale and limestone, teeth, bones, 
scales, and coprolite, of fishes, also entire fossilized fishes occur. 
Professor Jameson pointed out these remains to his pupils many 
years ago during his geological excursions. Lately, on opening 
up a new bed of coal limestone, in the limestone quarries of Burdie 
House, on the south side of the Forth, so long celebrated for their 
fossil plants, remains of fishes were discovered. In our Burntisland 
quarries several of the Burdie House fossil fishes have been met 
with, besides others unknown there, such as the Pygopteris Jame- 
soni, and the P. elegans of Agassiz. 

The first ridge, mentioned in the account of the topographical 
appearances as rising from the sea, consists of greenstone dipping 
to the north. Sandstone occupies the hollow in which the town 
stands. The second ridge is also of greenstone, and the hollow 
beyond is filled with sandstone. The third ridge consists of the 
same material with the two already mentioned ; and in the flat 
track to the northward, are found sandstone, slate-clay, bituminous 
shale, and limestone. The Bin, which is the highest part of the 
succeeding ridge, consists of trap tuffa, and appears to have risen 
through limestone, sandstone, clay-ironstone, slate-clay, and bitu- 
minous shale. The minerals found here are natrolite, zeolite, 
amethyst, chalcedony, agates, &amp;c. The eminences to the north- 
ward consist of greenstone, basalt, trap tuffa, &amp;c. Basalt oc- 
curs in abundance at Dunearn Hill, along the north side of which 
it assumes very distinctly the columnar form. On the summit is 
a small loch which never dries. This has been supposed to be the 
crater of an extinct volcano ; and, indeed, throughout the district 
traces of igneous action are of frequent occurrence. On Orrock 
hdl, there is a beautiful display of basaltic columns. The west 
side of this hill is bare and steep, and is covered at the bottom 

'•/r "I''ge Museum of Edinburgh, there is a collection of the Burntisland 
fossil fashes. We are particular in mentioning this circumstance, because the lime- 
stone quarries that alTorclecl the fossil fishes are now no longer worked, and it is only 
rarely that specimens are to be picked amongst the rubbish in the old quarries.

with debris. The north side of Dunearn Hill presents the same 
appearances on a grander scale. 

We may now briefly trace the line of coast. The eastern part 
presents a succession of small sandhills, onwards to the Links. 
The chief part of these is a fine smooth plain, which is said to have 
extended at one time to a small rock, now about half a mile from the 
shore. In this quarter, the sea has obviously made great encroach- 
ments. The current sweeping round the rock already mentioned, 
has gradually gained on the land, and worn away the softer por- 
tions of the opposite rocks at Lamberlaws. From the Links to 
the harbour, is the ridge of greenstone formerly noticed. Along 
half of this space, the rocks are very rugged and precipitous, and 
at high water are covered in some places to the depth of 12 or 14 
feet. From the harbour westward, along the rest of the peninsula, 
the coast presents limestone alternating with sandstone, and is very 
rugged from the large quantities of debris. The same rocks pre- 
dominate along the remainder of the coast. At Starly-burn, the 
rocks are incrusted with deposits of calc tuflf and calc sinter, from 
springs which come through the large beds of limestone, in the 
south-west part of the parish. The veins of calcareous spar, so 
abundant in amygdaloidal and trap rocks, have been filled up 
with similar deposits, crystallization taking place after the deposi- 
tion. 

Fossils of the vegetable kind are found, but not in great abun- 
dance, at the quarries at Newbigging, and at the old sandstone 
quarries near the coast, at the eastern boundary of the parish. 
Charred wood occurs in the masses of trap tulFa, scattered along 
the eastern shore. 

The chief alluvial deposits are, loam, gravel, sand, clay, and 
moss. The soil between the town and the Bin is mostly a rich 
deep loam of great fertility, and is probably as good land as can 
be found in the county. To the northward, the soil is lighter; but, 
being for the most part well cultivated, yields good crops. A 
strip of mossy ground runs along the northern boundary .of the 
parish. 

Quarries. — Besides the quarries already noticed, there is one of 
excellent sandstone or freestone at Grange. At Newbigging, the 
limestone rock has been extensively excavated. The western quarry 
extends from the front of the rock backwards above a hundred yards. 
The roof is sandstone, — to support which, masses of limestone four 
feet square are left standing. The rooms between these supports are 



BURNTISLAND. 



400 



36 feet square. In July 1831, ti great part of this quarry was 
flooded, and eight rooms are still under water. A large proportion 
of the limestone is now got from a mine to the eastward, which com- 
municates with the surface by a tunnel, 500 yards in length, 3 in 
width, and 21 in height. In cutting this tunnel, great obstructions 
were met with, the ground being much troubled With dikes and off- 
cuts. Masses of greenstone, limestone, freestone, clay, and blaes, 
black and gray were found intermingled in a state of great con- 
fusion. The whole bed of limestone is very much intersected with 
dikes. 

Zoology. — In addition to hares, rabbits, and other common ani- 
mals, deer, badgers, and otters, are occasionally seen. About 
eighty species of birds, including land and sea-birds, are natives 
or visitors of the parish, but none is peculiar to it, nor are there 
any very rare. The golden-crested wren, the bullfinch, the gold- 
finch, the jay, the fieldfare, the pheasant, with most of the com- 
mon small birds, are found in the district. It has been remarked, 
that, since the great snow-storm of 1822, goldfinches have been 
much less numerous than they previously were. In June 1834, a 
brown-coloured crow was seen in the parish, and attempts were 
made, but without success, to obtain possession of it. 

The more common species of fish are found off the coast. For 
several seasons, the herring, which formerly was very abundant, has 
almost totally deserted the Frith. Oysters and lobsters are found, 
with abundance of cockles, spout-fish, and sand-eels, which form 
part of the food of the poorer classes during summer. Great num- 
bers, especially of the young, may then be seen digging at low 
water for these kinds of fish, in the extensive sand-beds to the east 
of Burntisland.

In the parish, generally, there is a great deficiency of wood. 
Within the last two or three years, some attention has been paid 
to the remedying of this defect ; but there is still ample scope for 
improvement. The soil appears most congenial to hard -wood, oak, 
ash, elm, &amp;c. 

It may be mentioned that there grew last summer in the manse 
garden, a Scots thistle, which produced 713 heads, exclusive of 
about thirty which were scarcely developed.  

 With regard to the department of Natural History, it may not be out of place 
to record here the suggestion so often urged by Professor Jameson, and also by an 
intelligent friend, that, in connection with every parochial school, it would be very 
desirable to have a parochial museum. A certain knowledge of natural history, would 
of course, be requisite in the parish teacher; the scholars and others might be en- 
couraged to collect specimens; and in almost every parisli, there would surely be 
found some individuals who would take an interest in the matter, and bear part of 
the expenses, which would be very trifling. The scheme, if carried into cflect, would 
lead to a very complete knowledge of the Natural History of the country. To those 
who have not reflected on the subject, it is almost incredible wliat an interesting col- 
lection might be formed out of the productions of a single parish.

BURNTISLAND. 411 

II. — Civil History. 

The Town-council records are the chief source of information 
regarding the history and antiquities of the parish. The Session 
records are also of some use in this respect. Some of the follow- 
ing details are derived from the Report on the Municipal Corpo- 
rations of Scotland. 

Historical Notices. — It has been conjectured that Agricola's 
army encamped on Dunearn Hill, on the summit of which is a flat 
piece of ground, surrounded with an immense number of loose 
stones, called, according to the former account, Agricola's camp 
or garrison. It is certain that that General explored the north 
coast of tjie Frith of Forth, directing his attention particularly to 
the harbours. " Portus classe exploravit trans Bodotriam," says 
Tacitus, in the 22d chapter of his Life of Agricola. He could 
scarcely fail to be struck with the natural superiority of the har- 
bour at this point, and may be reasonably conjectured to have 
landed here. 

Prior to 1541, the town of Burntisland belonged to the Abbey of 
Dunfermline. It was then exchanged by James V, for some lands 
in the neighbourhood, and was proclaimed a royal burgh in 1568. 
Before the Union, it seems to have been a place of considerable 
importance. About 1656, Kingliorn, Kirkcaldy, Dysart, Wemyss, 
Leven, Ely, St Monance, Pittenweem, Anstruther, Crail, St An- 
drews, and South Queensferry were all counted as members of the 
head port of Burntisland ; and the tonnage of the whole was esti- 
mated at 1291 tons, divided over 46 vessels. About that period, 
and previously, there seems to have been considerable intercourse 
between this port and Holland. 

In May 1601, the General Assembly met at Burntisland. On 
this occasion, James VI. renewed his vows as a Covenanter. Hav- 
ing confessed the errors that had hitherto characterized his go- 
vernment, he vowed, with uplifted hand, that he would adhere to 
the religion presently professed in the realm of Scotland, that he 
would oppose the efforts of its adversaries, and be more faithful 
than he had hitherto been, in performing all the duties of a good 
and Christian King. The members of Assembly also vowed, at 
his request, that they would be more faithful in the discharge of 
their respective duties ; and, that the people might be aware of the 
good understanding between him and the church, the mutual vow 
was ordered to be intimated from the pulpits on the following Sab- 
bath. At this Assembly, the King also suggested the propriety 



412 



FIFESHIRE 



of revising the common translation of the Scriptures, and the me- 
trical version of the Psalms. According to Spotswood, the speech 
which he made on the occasion " bred not little admiration in the 
whole assembly." " But ravished as they were," says Dr M'Crie, 
" and proud as they might be of having for a King so great a di- 
vine and linguist and poet, the Assembly did not think fit to gra- 
tify his Majesty by naming him on the committee; but recom- 
mended the translation of the Bible to such of their own number 
as were best acquainted with the original languages, and the cor- 
rection of the psalmody to Pont." 

The inhabitants of Burntisland were zealous Covenanters. In 
1638, many of them signified their adherence to the National Co- 
venant, as the kirk-session records testify, " with tearis of great 
joy." The minister, " Mr Johne Mitchelsone," being of a dif- 
ferent mind, was left for a time to preach to empty walls — " 13 
May — 20 May — 27 May — 3 Junii — 10 Junii — no actionis, be- 
cause the people goes from the kirke and will not heir the minis- 
ter, seing he will not covenant with the people of God." In 
February 1 639, he was deposed for contumacy with regard to the 
Covenant, and for disowning the proceedings of the celebrated 
Assembly that was held at Glasgow. 

It is sai'd that the town capitulated to Cromwell on condition of 
his repairing the streets and the harbour. The quays, as they at 
present stand, were accordingly built by him ; and up to the date 
of last Account, no repairs had been added to those which he ef-

broken up, and the main street macadamized 

In 171.5, the town was occupied by the Earl of Mar's troops, 
who found the harbour very advantageous for the reception of 
foreign stores. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, Mrs Aytoun of Inch- 
dairnie ; the Carron Company ; the Heirs of the late Alexander 
Greenhill, Esq.; J. G. Drinkwater Bethune, Esq.of Orrock; James 
Bogie, Esq. ; The Earl of Morton ; Messrs Young ; the Heirs of 
Captain Beatson ; and Mrs Pillans of Rossend. 

JEminent Characters. — Mrs Somerville, whose works have raised 
her to a very high place among modern writers in Natural Philo- 
sophy, spent part of her youth in this parish. Craigholm, towards 
the east end of the links, is the summer residence of the Rev. Dr 
Chalmers.

Parochial Bee/ i. 'tiers. — The session records commence at March 
1502. They consist of eight volumes, and have for the most part 
been regidarly kept. Blanks occur from 1670 to 1672; from 
1686 to 1693; from 1711 to 1719; and from 1748 to 1769. 
From 1786 there is a series of fragments on to 1821 ; after which 
period, the record has been regularly kept.  The register of 
births, baptisms, and marriages commences at 1672, and is con- 
tinued more or less perfectly to the present time. As in the 
session records, there are some considerable blanks. At va- 
rious periods, a record of deaths has been kept, but it is very 
scanty.-f- 

Antiquities. — The town was at one time fortified. On the south- 
east side of the harbour, part of the walls of a fort is still standing; 
and till within a few years back, traces of the ancient fortification 
were discernible on the small eminence in the north side of the 
town. At Lamberlaws, on a knoll projecting into the sea, are the 
traces of an encampment ascribed to Cromwell ; in consequence 
of which, the name of Oliver's knoll has sometimes been given to 
the locality. Tn the same situation, there appears to have stood 
at one time a gallows for the execution of criminals under the feu- 
dal system. In allusion to this circumstance, the locality is some- 
times called Gallows Knoll. 

On an eminence overhanging the harbour stands Rossend Cas- 
tle, erected, it would seem, at some period in the fifteenth century, 
by Dury of that Ilk. Sibbald, in his History of Fife, states, that 
" in the chartulary of Dunfermling, to Avhich abbacy this town, 
castle, and harbour belonged, there is a grant by George Durie, 

• Since 1616, there appear to have been sixteen ministers of the parish, the aver- 
age duration of their ministry being nearly fourteen years. One of them, " Mr 
Harie Malcome," officiated only one Sabbath as minister. The record, after' giving 
an account of his admission on June 17th 1663, has the following entry : " Sunday 
the 21 of June, our minister, Mr Harie Malcome, preached before and after noone, 
&amp;c. He went awaye on Monday in the morning yrafter to his father's, and came' 
never back againc to us, for his father presentlie dieing where he was there he stayed 
and suesidet to his father's church." 

t Some of the entries are of a striking character: " Janr. 1737, perished in a 
storm near  Andrew Watt, late Provest of this burgh, and with him in the 

ship also perished his eldest son Andrew, his second son, William, his fourth son, 
David. Also perished with them Andrew Boog, son to George Boog, late Bailie 
in this burgh. Also perished with them James Sinclair, mariner in this town, also 
other four youths."—-' 1739, May 10th, being Thursday about three o'clock in the 
morning, perished in the water within the harbour, the sea being in Within twenty 
or thirty yards of the Iron-crag towards the south-west of it, John'Aitken, David 
Laverock, and Gouvlie, all belonging to Kinghorn, their fathers still living 

there, and Andrew Thomson, carpenter, at present living here  All four young 
men, below thirty years of age the eldest. An awful Providence "

comnicndater of Dunfermling, and Archdeacon of St Andrews, to 
Robert Durie of that Ilk, of our lands of Nether Grange of King- 
horn Wester, called Le Mains ; together with the keeping of the 
place or fort of the same ; ' and for the preserving and custody 
thereof, we dispone heritably our lands of Grefland and Cuninger- 
land, now called Brunt- Island, within our shire of Kinghorn, rega- 
lity of Dunfermhng, and sheriffdom of Fife dated anno 1538." 
After the Reformation, according to the same authority, the cas- 
tle was given first to Kirkcaldy of Grange, then to Sir Robert 
Melville of Carnie. Since that period, it is understood to have 
passed through the hands of many different proprietors. It served 
as head quarters to the detachment of the Covenanters' troops 
that was raised in this part of the country. In modern times, con- 
siderable additions have been made to it. It is surrounded by 
plantations and garden ground ; and forms a fine object in the 
foreground of the rich and extensive view commanded by the en- 
virons of the town. 

At the village of Kirktoun, are the ruins of the original parish 
church, surrounded by a small burying-ground. The date of its 
erection is unknown ; but it bears the marks of great antiquity. 
On a small eminence at Stenhouse, in the north -west part of the 
parish, stand the ruins of a small fort or castle, called Knockda- 
vie. It belonged anciently to an individual of the name of Dou- 
glas, of whom some notice is taken in " The Judgments of God 
on Persecutors," appended to some of the old editions of the 
Scots Worthies. At Balbee, a mile and a half eastward, there 
existed a structure somewhat similar. It was taken down about 
sixty or seventy years ago, and portions of the fine hewn freestone 
of which it was built may still be seen in some of the walls in the 
neighbourhood. Near the same place, a barrow or tumulus was 
opened fifty years ago, when some square stones were found, ar- 
ranged in the form of a coffin, but containing no particular relics. 
There appears to have been a number of tumuli in the same neigh- 
bourhood.

From temporary causes, the population seems to have been 
somewhat greater when the census was taken, than it would other- 
wise have been. There has since been a considerable decrease. 
According to a census taken four years after by the writer, the 
number of families was found to be 500, giving a population of 
about 2100. This decrease must chiefly be attributed to the o-reat 
failure in the herring fishery during the last five years. Emplo}- 
ment having thus become scarcer, many have been compelled to 
seek for it elsewhere. It has also happened, that several families, 
not dependent on trade, have removed from the .parish since the 
Government census was taken, while others in similar circumstan- 
ces have not come in to occupy their place.

There are four fatuous persons in the parish, one insane, and 
one or two bhnd. 

The chief game is golf, — the hnks, though not very extensive, 
being well adapted for it. A golf club has been in existence up- 
wards of forty years. 

IV. — Industry. 
There are about 12900 imperial acres in the parish,of which 
from 400 to 500 are in pasture, and nearly 90 are covered with 
wood. From the extent of rocky surface, there is a considerable 
proportion of waste land, but none that could profitably be added 
to what is already in cultivation. Some of it, however, might be 
advantageously planted. There is no land in the parish in undi- 
vided common. 

Rent of Land. — The value of arable land varies from L. 1, 10s. 
up to L. 7 per acre ; the average rent may be nearly L. 3. The 
rent of grazing is estimated at L. 3 for an ox or cow, and at 15s. 
for a sheep. 

Rate of Wages. — Farm-servants receive from 9s. k 12s. per 
week ; and the different kinds of country artisans from 15s. to L. 1. 

Husbandry.— The following is the rotation of crops adopted in 
the southern and more fertile part of the parish :— green crop, 
succeeded by wheat, barley, or oats ; and then green crop of a 
different kind from what has been two years before. The rota- 
tion in the more northern parts is as follows :— green crop, bar- 
ley or oats, and sometimes wheat ; sown grass, one, two, or three 
years ; then oats. The system of husbandry may be regarded as 
carried in some parts of the parish to great perfection. Within a 
few years, some waste land has been reclaimed, and great improve- 
ments have been effected by liming and draining. The farm- 
steadings are, for the most part, in excellent order ; but there is 
in some quarters, a great want of fences, and on this account there 
is little or no pasture in the most fertile district of the parish. 
The usual period of a lease is nineteen years. The cattle are ge- 
nerally of the Fife breed, and the sheep of the Cheviot breed. 

Produce.— \t is difficult to ascertain the gross produce of the 
parish ; but the real rental being about L. 4800, should give an 
average of about L. 14,000. 

Corn-Mills.— these there are two, both in the neighbour- 
hood of the town. One of them is driven by the sea, and can 
work on an average about fourteen hours per day. 

Distillery.— Theve, is an extensive distillery at Grange, about 
half a-mile"to the northward of the town ; 11,000 quarters of malt. 



BURNTISLAND.

the quantity which it annually consumes, yield 185,000 gallons of 
proof spirits, the duty on which amounts of itself to about L. 36,000 ; 
or nearly L. 100 per day. About 700 head of cattle are annually 
fed in connection with this distillery, which at L, 15, 10s. per head, 
will produce L. 10,830. The proprietors of this work employ re- 
gularly about 100 men and 50 horses. Notwithstanding the na- 
ture of their employment, the men, in general, are sober and steady. 

Herring fishery and curing. — The herring fishery commenced 
about 1793, and from that period till about 1805, was carried on 
only in the Frith during the winter season. The curers then be- 
gan to send boats during summer to the northern fishing stations, 
and for many years the trade was very prosperous. At its most 
flourishing period, as many as 500 vessels might be seen at once in 
the harbour, all either connected directly with the fishery, or em- 
ployed in the exportation of herrings. The trade has now greatly 
declined, there having been no winter fishing for the last five years. 
At present, there are eight curing establishments which send out to 
the northern fishery between 70 and 80 boats, most of which 
belong to other ports in the Frith. The greater part of them go 
to Wick, the rest to Fraserburgh and Rosehearty. The middle of 
July is the time at which they usually set out, and they return in 
about two months. Each boat carries five men, so that during 
two months in the year, Burntisland employs in this way about 400 
men. A number more are employed in the sloops which, to the 
number of 8 or 10, ply during the same period between this port 
and the fishing stations, carrying out barrels and salt, and bringing 
home the herrings that have been taken. From 200 to 250 cranes, 
a crane being equal to a barrel, are considered to be the com- 
plement of each boat. For some years, there have been annually 
cured from 16,000 to 18,000 barrels, which, at L. 1, the average 
price per barrel, will give the same number of pounds. About 36 
hands, including apprentices, are constantly employed as coopers; 
and about 60 females are occasionally employed in the curing of 
the herrings. The occupation is cold and disagreeable ; but even 
this cannot warrant a pernicious practice that has long prevailed, of 
giving daily to those engaged in it, and some of these are young 
females, a considerable quantity of undiluted spirits. 

Whale fishing Company. — This company commenced operations 
in 1830, and from that period have annually sent out two vessels, 
one of 377 tons, and the other of 311, — each of which carries 50 
men. Last season, both returned clean ; but from 1830 to 1835,

t\icif cargoes produced 1112 tons of oil, and 56 tons of bones. 
During that period, the wages and oil money paid to the crews of 
both vessels amounted to upwards of L. 14,400 Sterling; and up- 
wards of L. 1300 was paid for labourage, landing cargoes, prepar- 
ino- the oil, and cleaning the bone. Twelve oilmen and coopers are 
employed in the work, and from twelve to fifteen women in cleaning 
the bone. The late Sir John Leslie, in a report on the subject, 
gives the following account of the method devised and carried into 
efiect bv Mr Farnie, for destroying the fetid vapours emitted dur- 
ino- the manufacture of the oil. " The boiler is very large, and 
completely covered by a circle of thick plank, except a small open- 
ing on the more accessible side, to receive the contents of the 
casks, and a narrow vent in another part, which allows a current of 
air to mingle with the vapour, and sweep over the surface of the 
heated oil. All the steaming products are made to enter into a re- 
verberatory furnace, and pass upwards through two successive 
branders, charged with coke or coal, that burn with an intense 
white heat. On the same level with the branders, are three small 
air-holes, having each a separate flue for inciting occasionally the 
ardour of inflammation, and while the ebullition advances, the 
blubber lying at the bottom of the pan is constantly turned round 
by an agitator, like the stirrer of a large still, only driven by the 
action of a crank fixed near the side of the boiler. After the boil- 
ing is finished, and the oil has been moderately cooled, it is drawn 
by means of a syphon into a tank, and the refuse thrown into a 
covered vault ; every operation being performed under the same 
close roof." Sir John states that he regards the operations intro- 
duced by this company " as an invaluable practical invention," and 
expresses his belief that it will " be speedily adopted in the ma- 
itime parts of the empire, and thus become a real national bles-

Ship-Building. — In the building and repairing of vessels, 30 
men are at present employed ; at former periods, there have been 
as many as 100. The largest vessel ever built here was one of

gesses are qualified to be elected ; but this is one of the burghs the 
number of whose councillors it is proposed to reduce. It unites 



BURNTISLAND.

with Kirkcaldy, Dysart, and Kinghorn, in returning a Member to 
Parliament. The number of voters is 48. Within the parliamentary 
boundaries, there are 66 persons whose rents in property or tenantry 
amount to L. 10 per annum and upwards, and of these 35 are bur- 
gesses. Within the same boundaries, there are 53 persons Avhose 
rents amount to L. 5, and are under L. 10; and of these 9 are 
burgesses. Besides the guildry, amounting to 82, inclusive of 7 
non-resident, there are 6 incorporated trades, viz. hammermen, 
tailors, weavers, fleshers, shoemakers, bakers. All these corpora- 
tions, together with a rather wealthy institution called the Prime- 
Guild Society, which consists of ship-owners and others connect- 
ed with the sea-faring line, are possessed of seats in the parish 
church ; and it must be added, that some of these bodies wring out 
as high seat rents as possible from the pockets of the parishioners. 
A number of seats are also possessed by the town. 

3Ieatis of Communication. — There is a regular post -office, the 
revenue of which amounted, some years ago, to about L. 300; but, 
from the decay of trade, is now understood to fall short of that 
sum. The communication with Edinburgh, by means of the post, 
is twice- a-day. There are about five miles of turnpike road, but 
no public carriages travel regularly through any part of the parish. 
The Dundee and Perth coaches come occasionally this way, when 
the weather is too severe to admit of the passengers embarking at 
Pettycur. This being one of the stations of the Fife and Mid- 
Lothian ferries, there is regular communication by steam with 
Newhaven ; but great complaints are made of the extravagance of the 
fares, which are 2s. in the cabin, and Is. 6d. steerage, — very high 
rates, it must be allowed, for a distance short of six miles. In 
addition to the steam-vessels, there are large sailing-boats which 
ply at tide time every lawful day, and are principally employed in 
carrying goods, &amp;c. 

Harbour, SC. — The opinion anciently entertained of the excel- 
lence of the harbour may be learned from the name " Portasgra- 
tice" or " Partus salutis" by which it is designated in some of the 
chartersof the burgh. It is still reckoned the best in the frith, being 
easily entered, as well as very capacious and secure ; and at full 
tide of great depth. Its latitude is 56° 3' 20", its longitude 3° 15'. 
The distance between the lighthouse on tlie pier and that on the 
pier at Newhaven is five miles and a third nearly, as found by ac- 
curate observations. In 1833, the vessels belonging to this port 
were eight, and their tonnage 900.

The extension of the piprs would be a vast improvement, and 
could be effected at a moderate expense, as the necessary mate- 
rials are abundant in the neighbourhood, and the other natural fa- 
cilities are great. Were this effected, the harbour could easily 
be entered at any state of the tide. With reference to the im- 
provement of the ferry, Sir Thomas Telford has suggested the 
construction of a landing-pier a little to the eastward. In his re- 
port on the subject, he gives a decided preference to Burntisland 
as a landing- place on the north shore of the frith, — stating, that 
" whether the expense of construction, or the distance, facility, 
and regularity of passage, is considered, it appears quite clear that 
Burntisland should be adopted."—" It is, indeed," he says, " most 
fortunate that a place so well calculated should afford the shortest 
passage, and be otherwise so favourably situated." 

Dock. — Connected with the harbour is a dry dock belonging 
to Mr Farnie. It is 200 feet in length, the width of the gates is 
44 feet, and the depth of water at high spring tides 16| feet. 
The gates are of a peculiar construction, being circular in the 
bottom. A Russian frigate of 1000 tons, and the steam-ship, the 
United Kingdom, are the largest vessels that have ever been in 
this dock. 

Boadstead.—T\\e roadstead of Burntisland possesses great ad- 
vantages, and is accordingly much resorted to in stormy weather. 
The anchorage is good ; there is great depth of water very near 
the shore ; and ample shelter is afforded by the high ground to 
the north, and by the sand-bank to the east, which projects a con- 
siderable way into the sea. 

At Starly-burn there is a small harbour where the limestone be- 
long ing to the Carron Company is shipped, and where vessels occa- 
sionally take in water, of which there is a copious supply. For this 
latter purpose, it was frequently resorted to by the King's ships 
during the last war. About half a mile to the eastward of the 
town, there is also a pier for the shipping of lime. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church stands on the ridge 
which rises from the sea. It was built in 1592, on the model, it 
is' understood, of the North Church of Amsterdam, and is thus an 
iijdication of the ancient intercourse which subsisted between this 
port and Holland. It was erected, not by the heritors, but by 
the inhabitants of the town, who began to find it inconvenient to 
go over to the old church at Kirktoun. They asked nothing of 
the heritors but their consent ; and, as an inducement, offered them 



BURNTISLAND. 



421 



their due proportion of seats, taking the whole burden, not only of 
building, but also of repairing on themselves. They reared, ac- 
cordingly, a substantial square edifice, surmounted by a tower, the 
height of which is not proportioned to its thickness ; but want of 
funds is understood to have prevented it from lifting its head so 
high as was contemplated. Though situated on the boundary of 
the parish, and distant about three miles from its northern ex- 
tremities, the church is perfectly convenient for the great mass of 
the population. It is at present in a good state of repair, and af- 
fords accommodation for 900 or upwards, but might easily be 
made to accommodate a hundred or two more, as the area is very 
uneconomically seated. In the former Account, it is stated as a 
fact well known in this place, that it once held within its walls 
bet ween 3000 and 4000 Hessians, who were lying encamped near 
the town in 1746. 

The manse was built in 1824, and is considered one of the best 
in Scotland. The glebe consists of 5 Scots acres, and is let at a 
yearly rent of L. 35. There is no grass glebe, but the sum of 
L. 15 Sterling is allowed in lieu of it. The stipend is mostly 
payable in money, and amounts to about L. 190. 

There is a chapel in the parish in connection with the United 
Secession Synod. The minister is paid out of the seat rents, and 
his stipend is understood to be L. 100. An assistant and succes- 
sor is about to be appointed, when it is proposed that the former 
shall receive L. 60, and the latter L. 80. A house belonging to 
the congregation forms part of the living of the minister. 

Taking 500 as the number of families, about 330 of these be- 
long to the Established Church, and the rest, with very few ex- 
ceptions, to the United Secession. A very small number are 
connected with no religious denomination, and there are three or 
four Roman Catholics. Divine service is respectably attended both 
at the parish church, and at the dissenting meeting-house ; at both 
it might be better. The average number of communicants at the 
Established Church is about 400. In connection with the congre- 
gation of the parish church, there is a society in support of the 
missions, &amp;c. of the Church of Scotland. As it is but of recent 
origin, it would be premature to conjecture the amount of its an- 
nual contributions. The collections at the parish church for re- 
ligious and charitable purposes may be stated as averaging for some 
years between L. 20 and L. 30 per annum. This is exclusive of 
the ordinary collections for the poor, which amount in the year to

between L. 60 and L. 70. The sum realized during the last two 
years. and a-half for religious purposes, including collections, a 
subscription for church extension, and the contributions already 
obtained by the society in connection with the parish church, falls 
very little short of L. 130. 

Education. — There are in all seven schools in the parish ; but 
five of these are small, and four of them are taught by females. 
There is no parochial school. The burgh school has always been 
under the direction of the magistrates and council, and the teacher 
is appointed by them. His salary is L. 37 a-year, and is paid out 
of the burgh revenue. The regulated fees are, for English read- 
ing, 2s. per quarter; do. with writing, 2s. 6d. ; with arithmetic, 
4s. 6d. ; Latin, with Greek, French, arithmetic, mathematics, Eng- 
lish grammar, geography, 6s. per quarter ; navigation and book- 
keeping, L. 1, Is. per course. These fees have been the same for the 
last twenty years. All regulations for the school are made under 
the sanction and control of the magistrates. There are certain 
lands in the parish mortified by a Mr Watson, and a house and 
garden in the burgh, for behoof of the schoolmaster and three poor 
widows. Each of the widows has an allotment in the house, and 
each a third of the garden. The land is let to a tenant at the 
money rent of L. 18, 10s., and 34 bolls of barley and 6 bolls of 
oatmeal yearly, the growth of the lands ; and if he has no barley 
on the lands, he is bound to pay the highest Mid- Lothian fiar prices 
for the barley and oatmeal. Ten bolls of the barley, and one- 
fourth of the money rent are paid to the schoolmaster, for which 
he is obliged to teach as many poor children belonging to the town 
and parish as the magistrates recommend, at the rate of Is. 6d. per 
quarter, the number of scholars not to exceed, at this rate, the 
sum he may draw yearly. The rest of the barley, oatmeal, and 
money rent, is divided equally among the three widows.f 

The average number attending all the schools is not much short 
of 300, which, taking the population at 2100, gives about one- 
seventh attending school. The people in general seem alive to

cimen of the kiiul of collections that were frequently made in Scotland a century or 
two a"-o. " December 1 1th 1659.— The minister does by ordour of the synode

the benefits of education. Very few above six or seven are unable 
to read, and most can both read and write. There are two Sun- 
day schools, besides a class connected with the congregation of the 
parish church'. 

Literature. — There is a subscription library of between fjOO and 
600 volumes. Along with the proportion of trash which is usual- 
ly found in such libraries, it contains a good deal of the standard 
literature of the country. It has not, of late, been in a very nour- 
ishing condition. There is also a parish library, chiefly for the be- 
nefit of the poorer classes and of the young. It consists of about 
300 volumes, chiefly of a religious nature. The books are given 
out gratis, and the number of readers, both old and young, is very 
considerable. 

Charitable Institutions. — Watson's mortification, already men- 
tioned, is the only thing in the shape of an endowment for the 
poor. In January 1829, a society was formed called " The Burnt- 
island Funeral Insurance Society." It is divided into three classes ; 
the first, including those who insure a sum of money to be paid at 
their death ; the second, those who insure a sum to be paid at the 
death of their wives or husbands ; and the third, those who insure 
a sum to be paid at the death of any of their children under eight- 
een years of age. Any person qualified may enter any one or 
more of these classes. By the original regulations, it is provided 
that persons under forty years of age shall pay 2s. and those above 
that age 4s. on their admission as members ; and that at each quar- 
terly meeting, each member of one class shall pay 3d. ; each mem- 
ber of two classes, 6d. ; and each member of three classes, 9d. On 
the death of a member of the first or second class, L. 5 may be 
drawn from the funds of the society by the party having a right ; 
and on the death of a child of a member of class third, if under 
three months, L. 1, 10s. maybe drawn; if above that age and 
under three years, L. 2; if between three and eighteen years, L. 3. 
On these regulations some slight changes have been made, the 
sums payable on the death of members being now somewhat smaller. 
This sociefy has proved of considerable benefit to the working 
classes, and now numbers upwards of 300 members. 

There is no savings bank in the parish. An attempt was made 
to establish one, some years ago, but it unfortunately failed. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number at pre.sent on the 
poor's roll is 35. Individuals receive 6d. Is. or Is. 6d. per week, 
according to their circumstances, — some, who have children to sup-

port, receive larger sums. The highest allowance at present is 3s. 
The funds arise from the collections at the church door, which 
may be stated at L. 65 ; from proclamations which, at 2s. 6d. each, 
yield from L. 2 to L. 2, 5s. per annum ; and from a voluntary as- 
sessment on the part of the landward heritors to the extent of L. 50, 
the whole of which, however, has not for some time been realized. 
For a year or two, these funds haA'e proved insufficient to meet the 
demands made upon them, and the kirk-session have been under 
the necessity of calling upon the heritors to renew their contribu- 
tion before the expiry of the annual term. On account of the de- 
cay of trade, and the consequent lack of employment, pauperism 
has been, for some time, decidedly on the increase. Among many 
of the poor, there is very little reluctance to apply for parochial aid. 
There are some honourable exceptions ; but the old Scottish spi- 
rit of independence is gradually disappearing. Instances also oc- 
cur of extreme unwillingness to contribute towards the maintenance 
of infirm or aged relatives. As yet, the spirit of beneficence is far 
from being dormant in the breasts of the wealthier classes. The 
amount of private charity is considerable ; and subscriptions are oc- 
casionally made to meet cases of peculiar destitution. Coals, pro- 
cured in this way, are generally distributed in the winter season ; 
and to the liberality of James Strange, Esq. and his household, by 
whom Rossend Castle has for some years been occupied during the 
summer months, have the poor been indebted for a seasonable sup- 
ply of this necessary article, in the course of the present and two 
preceding winters. 

Jail — The jail of Burntisland is neither large nor commodious ; 
but there are seldom any prisoners.

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the date of last Account, both the town and the landward 
district have undergone great improvements. For a number of 
years, the town has been a favourite watering-place. The pure 
air, the good bathing-ground, the agreeable and extensive walks, 
the rich and varied scenery, together with the facility of commu- 
nication with Edinburgh, attract annually a great number of visi- 
tors ; so that, between June and October, the town assumes a much 
more animated appearance than during the remainder of the year. 
There is good accommodation for visitors, at rates varying from a 
small sum up to fifteen or twenty guineas per month. The vitriol 
work, which was in operation when the last Statistical Account was 
written, has been long suspended, and the premises have been con- 
verted into cottages for the summer visitors. 

The country part of the parish is in a much higher state of cul- 
tivation than it was forty years ago. The farms are large, and the 
country population is consequently smaller. In this, as in many 
parishes, a want of hands is sometimes experienced in harvest, — 
many who formerly inhabited rural districts having been attracted 
to towns by the thriving state of manufactures. Would it not be 
for the advantage of all parties, if proprietors were to erect cot- 
tages, or give greater facilities for feuing, or otherwise encourage 
labourers and their families to settle in the country  This would 
be preferable in many ways to the system of bothies ; and we should 
look for a much healthier state of the communitv, both in a moral 
and an economical point of view, were the proportion of the rural 
to the town population much higher than it is.

IMIKSBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF JTIFE. 

THE REV. ANDREW MELVILLE, MINISTEJf. 



I. TOPOGKAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Name. — The name of this parish is supposed to be Gaelic, siy- 
uityiug a hollow arnonghills. This is descriptive of the place in which 
the church is situated. The name Logie is frequently conjoined 
with some other name or epithet, referring probably either to 
something peculiar in the situation of the place, or to some per- 
son particularly connected with it; — as Logie Almond, Blair Lo- 
gie, Logierait. This parish was anciently called Logie Mur- 
doch. 

Extent, Bo7.mdaries, Sj-c. — Its length is nearly 4 miles, its breadth 
from 1 to and consequently it contains from 4 to 5 square 
miles. Its figure is an irregular oblong, bounded on the east by 
the parishes of Forgan and Leuchars ; on the south, by Leuchars 
and Dairsie ; on the west and north, by Kilmany. It occupies the 
south-eastern extremity of that range of high land which, rising 
to the northward of Stirling under the name of the Ochil hills, 
stretches eastward, gradually sinking in elevation, till it terminates 
in the plain, which bounds the bay of St Andrews between the 
Frith of Tay and the estuary of the river Eden, Its surface is 
irregular and hilly. But none of the hills rise to more than 500 
or 600 feet above the level of the sea. The highest, which is in 
the east end of the parish, is called Inchlawhill, about 5 miles from 
the shore of the German ocean. 

Meteorology. — No accurate meteorological accounts have been 
kept here. The air is colder, the snow falls deeper and lies long- 
er than in the adjacent low country, but not so much as materi- 
ally to retard the operations of agriculture in spring, or the ripen- 
ing of the crops in autumn. The prevailing wind in spring, and in 
the beginning of summer, is east and north-east, frequently dry but 
cold, and hurtful to vegetation ; blowing probably from the snow- 
clad mountains of Norway, and not much softened by its short pas-

sage across the German ocean. As in most parts of the eastern 
coast of the lowlands of Scotland, less rain falls here than on'the 
western coast. This seems to arise from the rainy clouds which 
the south-west wind brings from the Atlantic ocean, being emptied 
before they reach this side of the Island, and there being no land 
sufficiently high to attract the clouds. The rainy point is the 
south-east. 

Geology. — The rock of which the hills are composed, is chiefly 
what in common language is termed whinstone. The highest hill, 
however, is an insulated mass of porphyry of a reddish yellow co- 
lour, apparently resting upon a bed of whinstone. There are se- 
veral other similar masses of the same species of rock, in the same 
range of hills to the westward. In the low ground to the north 
of this hill, there is a singular bank or table-land of sand, which 
was formerly surrounded by a marsh or lake ; but this is now con- 
verted into arable land by draining. The top of this bank of sand 
is a dead level of at least 60 acres. It is of a circular form ; and 
the sides, except on the east, are steep, and rise to a height of 70 
or 80 feet. There are similar banks in the neighbourhood, but 
none of them are so well defined as this. They have very much 
the appearance of having been formed by water, and speculators 
in geology suppose that the low ground here has been covered by 
a lake of fresh water, in which these banks of sand were formed.' 
They conjecture that the shore of the sea was much farther easf 
than it is now, and as St Abbs Head, the Bell Rock, and the 
Redhead near Arbroath, are composed of the same species of red 
sandstone, they are probably points in what was formerly the shore 
of the German Ocean. Certain it is, that at St Andrews great 
encroachments have been made by the sea upon the land in no 
long period of time. 

Soil — The soil of a considerable portion of the parish is moor- 
ish and thin, of a cold tilly quality. Upon the sides of the hills, 
however, it is generally of a good fertile loam. 

Botany. — Some rare plants are found here, — such as the Orni- 
tliogalum luteum or yellow star of Bethlehem ; Empetrum nigrum, 
Sedum rejlexwn, Hypnum dendroides, Menyanthes trifoliata, Par- 
nassia palustris, Gymnadenia conopseu. A good deal of wood, 
chiefly larch and Scotch fir, has of late years been planted on one 
of the hills. But either the soil, or the climate, or both are not 
favourable fo the growth of these trees, for they soon become 
much covered with lichen or moss. 



428 



FII-'ESHIUE. 



Zuolof/i/. — No rare species of animal or insect has been found 
here. In a pretty extensive marsh near the churcli, there used 
to be a great many wild ducks, snipes, green plovers, redshanks, 
and in winter, wild geese. These have in a great measure disap- 
peared, in consequence of its having been drained. The open 
fields, however, are still much frequented by wild geese in 
winter, which sometimes do considerable damage to the young 
wheat. Partridges, hares, and rabbits abound, and there are a 
few pheasants, and even a strayed deer is sometimes to be seen. 
Yet poaching is seldom heard of, except when a poor hare makes 
a false step into a snare set for rabbits. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — The only person of eminence in literature or 
science known to have belonged to this parish, is John West, au- 
thor of a System of Mathematics, much esteemed by the scientific 
world. He was son of a minister who lived about the middle of 
the last century. Mr West became an Episcopal clergyman in 
the Island of Jamaica, and died a few years ago. He is said to 
have left some valuable mathematical papers, some of which, it is 
understood, the late Professor Leslie of Edinburgh intended to 
publish, along with a memoir of the author. 

Antiquities. — There are no buildings, ancient or modern, of any 
importance, except the ruins of one of those square towers which 
the feudal possessors of the land seem to have erected, for the' de- 
fence as well as residence of their families. 

Land-owners. — The land is at present much subdivided, — no 
heritor possessing more than two farms, or from 500 to 600 acres. 
All the heritors are non-resident except two, who occupy their 
own farms. The following is a list of the heritors according to 
their valued rent: — William Mackenzie of Forret; Robert Lindsay 
of Straiton ; David Gillespie of Cruvie ; Trustees of the late Sir 
William Fettes of Denbrae; George Johnston Lindsay of Ked- 
loch ; John Millar Bowman of Logie; Walter Millar of Tor-Ked- 
loch ; Robert Russel of Tor- Forret ; and Robert Murdoch of Tor- 
Forret. 

Rental. — The rental of the two last is under L. 50. The whole 
valued rent of the parish is L. 2916, 6s. 8d. There is a consi- 
derable number of feuars, possessing from 1 to 8 acres. There 
are eight farms above 200 acres each, and four under 100. 

III. — Population. 
This parish, like many others, was formerly divided into smaller 



LOGIE. 



429 



farms, than it is now. This change tends, of course, to diminish 
the population ; and, what has contributed to the same effect, fewer 
cottages are required upon farms, in consequence of unmarried 
being generally preferred to married servants. These causes of 
a decrease of population, however, have been in some measure 
counterbalanced by the encouragement given to feuing by some 
of the proprietors. Three small villages have arisen in this way. 
The advantages of feuing either to proprietor or tenant are very 
questionable. A higher rent may be obtained, but an unsound po- 
pulation is produced, and paupers, which the landholder must 
maintain, are increased in number. Man naturally wishes to be in- 
dependent, — to have a house and a home which he can call his 
own. But the expense of building a house to a poor man, and a 
high feu-rent, often leave him nothing of independence but the 
name. This, however, many are compelled to do, or remove to 
towns, as neither proprietors nor tenants give much encourage- 
ment to the building and letting of cottages. This sy&amp;tem weak- 
ens or dissolves that moral tie which should unite rich and poor, 
and widens that breach between them, which is ruiiious to the 



peace and prosperity of both.

Habits and Character of the People. — A great proportion of 
the inhabitants, both male and female, are employed in agricul- 
ture, and they are In general very sober and industrious, and are 
tolerably comfortable in their circumstances. Few of the farm- 
servants, indeed, have now the luxury of a cow ; but they have 
each a Scotch pint of milk daily from their master's dalrj, with a 
sufficient quantity of oat-meal and potatoes, and in general they fat- 
ten a pig or two annually for family use. It is, indeed, truly won- 
derful how well clothed, neat, and clean, large families are kept, 
and at the same time tolerably well educated, with the few pounds 
of wages received by farm-servants and other labourers. Much 



-130 



Fjri:siiiRR, 



depends upon the sobriety of the husband, and the good econo- 
my of the wife, and the good health which a kind Providence is 
pleased to bestow. The young unmarried servants are not in so 
comfortable a state. Their only food is oatmeal, milk, and some po- 
tatoes. They are lodged in an apartment called a hothy, by them- 
selves, quite detached from their master's house, and in general 
entirely neglected by him as to moral inspection or religions in- 
struction. The fatal consequence is, that too many of our youth 
in that rank of life have, for many years past, grown up in igno- 
rance and vice : and the instruction which they may receive from 
clergymen is very inefficient, as a great proportion of them change 
masters every year. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish contains about 3343 acres imperial measure. Of 
these 2770 are arable, 307 unarable, 266 in wood. At an ave- 
rage 302 acres are annually in wheat, 465 in barley, 785 in oats, 
128 in pease and beans, 149 in potatoes, 239 in turnips, 249 
in grass, cut green and for hay, 660 in pasture, 42 in fallow. 
The average annual produce per acre is, of wheat, 3 quarters 4 
bushels; of barley, 4 quarters 4 bushels; of oats, 4 quarters 6 
bushels ; of pease, 3 quarters 2 bushels ; of potatoes, 25 bolls, 
vahie about L. 10; of turnips, value about L. 7 ; of hay, 150 
stones. Since the cultivation of potatoes became so extensive, a 
small proportion of land is in fallow. 

JRent of Land. — The average rent per acre is about L. 1, 18s., 
paid, in general, partly in money, and partly in grain, by the fiars 
of the county. 

Hushandry. — The system of husbandry, as in the adjoining 
parishes, or rather throughout the county, is upon the most im- 
proved plan, and conducted with great skill and industry. The 
mode of cropping is generally what is called a six years' rotation, 
alternating as regularly as possible green and corn crops. There 
is, however, an occasional deviation from this course, barley being 
sometimes sown after wheat in good soils. The practice of sowing 
turnip with bone manure has become very general ; and on some 
farms, where the soil is light and dry, they are eaten down with 
sheep, which is a great improvement. It would also prove very 
beneficial to such soils, to allow them to lie in grass for pasture for 
several years. This would recruit them when exhausted by long- 
continued corn cropping. The want of inclosures, however, is 
unfavourable to this improvement. 



LOGIE.

'J'lie shortness of leases, too, is a great discourngcnient to en- 
terprising farmers. For if a farm be in bad order when entered 
to, or need much draining, or require to be inclosed, a period of 
nineteen years, the almost universal term of leases, does not admit 
of a sulRcient return for much capital expended in such improve- 
ments ; and without these, the farm cannot be so productive as it 
would otherwise be, so that short leases, and even those of nine- 
teen years, must be unfavourable both to proprietors and tenants. 
A lease of twenty-five or thirty years would certainly give greater 
encouragement to enterprise and improvement. 

Live-Siock. — There are, on the different farms, 121 horses, 90 
milk cows, 257 cattle from one to three years old, 114 pigs, 630 
sheep. Many of the horses used in husbandry are reared upon 
the farms. They are not remarkably large, but well-shaped, stout, 
and active. A pair of work horses is required for every fifty acres. 
Iron ploughs are almost universally used. But as our roads are ra- 
ther hilly, there are few single horse carts. Cattle also are, in general, 
reared upon the farms, at the rate of about fifteen per 200 acres. 
A regular proportion of these is fattened in winter by turnip, 
and then sold to the butcher at three years old. It may be more 
profitable to feed and sell them so young, but their flesh cannot 
be so good or nutritive as at a more mature age. Some farmers 
however, instead of rearing, buy in stock, and so either buy and 
sell at all ages, or buy so as to feed at four or five years old. The 
cattle reared are what is called the Fife breed, generally of a black 
colour, well-shaped, sometimes of great size and weight. A cross 
with the Teeswater breed has been tried, but it does not seem to 
be much approved of The cows are not first-rate milkers, but the 
dairy is not much counted upon. The few sheep kept only on 
three farms are of various breeds,— black- faced, Highland, Che- 
viot, and Leicester, and crosses. 

Farm-houses and steadings are tolerably good, though not, in 
general, equal to the extent of the farms, and to the capital, indus- 
try, and enterprise of the occupiers. The cottages are very poor 
uncomfortable habitations, but what have been lately built are con- 
siderably improved. 

Wages.— The rate of wages is for men about 9s. a week in sum- 
mer, and 8s. a week in winter ; for women, by whom much field 
work is done, 4s. a week ; for wrights, smiths, and masons from 
i2s to 15s. a week.

V. — Pauochial Economy. 
No turnpike road passes through any part of this parish, and 
there is no inn or alehouse in it. The nearest post-town is Cu- 
par, distant about four miles and a half. 

Ecclesiastical Stoic— There is no dissenting place of worship 
in the parish, and the Dissenters, who chiefly belong to what are 
called the Relief and Associate Synod, are not numerous,— seldom 
exceeding thirty individuals. 

The parish church, which was built in 1826, is a very plain 
but commodious house, placed in a centrical situation. It is 
seated for 280, and none of the seats are let. Each heritor 
accommodates the people upon his own ground with seats. But 
though the church is sufficiently large for the .population, there 
is stitl a want of seats in those divisions of the church which be- 
long to heritors, who, by feuing their ground, have raised a 
greater number of people upon it than their proportion of the 
church can supply with seats. This is a hardship for which no 
legal remedy is yet provided. About one-half of the population 
regularly attend public worship on the Sabbath, and about one- 
third of them are communicants. No society for religious pur- 
poses is, at present, established in the parish. But there is, in ge- 
neral, an annual collection so appropriated, amounting to L. 6 or 
L. 7. The minister's stipend consists of 1 boll 2 pecks of wheat ; 
45 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks of barley ; 39 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 1 
lippie of meal; 29 bolls, 3 pecks, 3lippie» of oats ; and L. 82, 12s. 
2d. The teinds are valued and exhausted. The glebe is about 6 
Scotch, or 7 acres 2 roods imperial measure, which may be 
valued at a rent of L. 12. A new manse was built in 1815, and 
offices in 1828; and both are in good condition. 

Education.— T\ievQ is only one school in the parish. The 
schoolmaster has the maximum salary,— with an addition of 50 
merks Scots per annum,— a mortification of an old date by an 
heritor in the parish to the person then called the reader. 
The common branches of education, English reading, writing, 
and arithmetic, are taught. But the schoolmaster is qualified 
to teach English grammar, Latin, practical mathematics, and 
geography, and sometimes has a few scholars attending these 
higher branches. The fees per quarter are 2s., 2s. 6d., and 
3s. The fees received by the teacher may amount to L. 15 or 
L. 20 per annum. There are none in the parish who cannot read, 
p.tid few who cannot write, and are not also somewhat acquainted 



LOQIE. 433 

with arithmetic. The children of the labouring classes are in ge- 
neral sent to school at an earlier period of life, and leave it sooner 
than formerly, so that, unless they are attended to by parents or 
masters, or have the benefit of a Sabbath school, they too soon 
forget what they have learned. A Sabbath school has been long 
taught in this parish, but is now attended chiefly by girls. 

Library. — There is no public library for the use of the parish, 
but Sabbath scholars and others are supplied with a few appro- 
priate books from the manse. There is, indeed, a library of some 
value belonging to a heritor, to which a certain class of the parish- 
ioners have access, if they choose to avail themselves of the privi- 
lege. But the very terms upon which it is granted, operate as an 
exclusion from the carefully secured treasure. The books, as well 
as the acres, are strictly entailed. The heir of entail is prohibited 
from lending a book to his neighbours ; but he is bound to keep a 
suitable room for the library in his house, and to allow free access 
to It to the minister and other gentlemen, there to read and study, 
but all women and children are expressly excluded. 

Poo-.— The poor in this parish, whose average number is about 
7, and who get from 4s. to 10s. per month, according to their cir- 
cumstances, are supplied by collections at the church door, by the 
interest of a small sum of money, and voluntary contributions by 
the heritors. The collections and interest amount to L. 18 or L.20, 
and nearly as much is contributed annually by the heritors. In- 
stances of praiseworthy delicacy respecting dependence upon the 
poor's fund sometimes occur, but a very different feelino- is evi- 
dently increasing. The session records and parish register are re- 
gularly kept. The date of the earliest is 1660.

PUKSBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

REV. ROBERT BROWN, MINISTER. 



I.„T0P0GRAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Boundaries, Extent— Tnia parish is bounded on the east by the 
parish of Newburn ; on the west, by Scoonie ; on the north, by 
Ceres; and on the south by Largo Bay, in the Frith of Forth. It 
extends from north to south nearly 6, from east to west an average 
of 3 miles, and contains 6820 imperial acres. 

Topographical Appearances, and Geology.— It presents, through- 
out, an unusual variety of ground, being finely diversified by ac- 
clivities and plains. But the only hill deserving of that nanie is 
Larao Law, of a conical form, and rising 910 feet above the level 
of the sea, at a distance from it of two miles. At the summit, 
which is cleft in two, regular columns of basalt present themselves. 
The south side, which is very precipitous, is composed of basalt, 
the west and north-west of sandstone. The east slopes very gra- 
dually, and consists of soft tuffa and debris of water-worn rocks and 
gravel. To the west of Largo Law is a deep valley, named Keils 
Glen, extending two miles, composed of sandstone, with beds ot 
shale, greenstone, with veins of felspar, calcareous spar, and wacke. 
The sea coast, which is the southern boundary of the parish, forms 
part of Largo Bay, which reaches from Kincraig point on the east, 
to Methill point on the west, making a straight line between them 
of 7 miles, and a semicircle of 10. In this bay, and especially in 
the eastern curve, are found very satisfactory evidences ot a sub- 
marine forest. The neighbouring rocks are of the coal formation. 
The bed on which the forest rests consists of firmly laminated brown 
clay, coveredwith gravel and sand, above which is a bed of peat, com- 
posed of land andfresh waterplants. In this bed have been discovered 
the remains of the birch, and hazel, and alder,-a trunk o the lat- 
ter measuring six feet. Do not such appearances confirm the tradi- 
tionary record which places the " Wood of Forth" in this locality . 

. A chemical analysis of the basaltic rocks of Largo Law has been published in the 
Edinburgh New Philosophic Journal. 



LARGO. 435 

The shore is flat and sandy, with the exception of red sandstone 
and minute portions of coal near the surface. Lime and sandstone, 
with numerous boulders of trap, are found throughout the parish, 
the limestone lying below slate-clay, and ironstone being frequent 
in the sandstone bed. The limestone, in some, places is 1 5 feet 
thick, of a gray colour, and the superincumbent strata are general- 
ly argillo-calcareous rock, ;i bed of shale and sandstone. Organic 
remains are rare, although corallines and occasionally shells do oc- 
cur. There is only one good freestone quarry, which is wrought 
at considerable expense, from the great thickness of earth above 
the rock. Many years ago, coal was wrought in large quantities, 
especially near the coast. At present, there are three seams 
wrought, but none of them are of the first quality. To the north 
of New Gilston a singular mass of rum" coal is found, under the 
mass of overlying trap on the south. It is an inflammable bitu- 
minous shale, and is extensively used for lime-burning. It is known 
to be 80 feet thick, and is wrought in an open quarry. On the estate 
of Teuchats, in the north centre of the parish, is a limestone rock 
of excellent quality, and much esteemed for building. The work- 
ing of it here had nearly ceased; but, a new level has been lately 
brought up, and a deeper cut in the lime commenced. It is car- 
ried on in the parish of Ceres, where the same bed runs to a great 
extent. The soil on the north is generally of a thick black mould, 
on a wet bottom ; in the south, of a black loam, partly on a wet, 
and partly on a dry bottom— interspersed with fields of light land ; 
rich breaking clay is peculiar to the south-east ; and there are some 
tracks to the west of Largo Law, of a more obdurate nature, and 
on a wet bottom. 

Plantations, §-c.— In the north-east quarter, are extensive plan- 
tations of Scotch fir and larch. Interspersed among these, and 
particularly in all recent plantings, are varieties of hard-wood, as 
oak, ash, elm, beech, and plane. There is- a grove of very an- 
cient limes at Lundin House. The planes about Largo House are 
remarkable for their size; and several elms deserve notice for their 
smgular and fantastic beauty. There do not appear to be any in- 
digenous plants of a rare species. The subsoil in the more souther- 
ly gardens is rotten rock, and they are found very productive in 
fruit, especially pears, and favourable to the growth of plants, both 
of a hardy and tender kind. Shrubs from New Holland, as the 
Leptospermwm baccatum, stand the winter well. The Acacia, and

the Azalea, both In several varieties, lourish. The Arbutus Andrach- 
ne ripens its fruit, and myrtles, in sheltered situations, are well 
carried through even severe seasons. A very marked difference 
prevails in the temperature of the atmosphere, between north and 
south, the latter being always several degrees warmer. 

II. — Civil History. 
The most ancient and remarkable account of this parish is con- 
tained in Lament's Diary, extending from 1649 to 1671, and em- 
bracing various genealogical and historical notices, with no small 
proportion of gossip. The writer was factor on the Lundin estate, 
and his work was first printed from his MS. in 1810, by Mr Con- 
stable, and again in 1830. 

Parochial Rec/isters.The parochial registers consist of four- 
teen volumes. They commence in 1636, have been regularly kept, 
and are often very curious and full in their details of such parish 
transactions as the session took under their cognizance. 

Eminent Men.— Among the most eminent characters connected 
with the parish is Sir Andrew Wood, a naval officer, to whom, by a 
charter under the Great Seal, of date 1482, James III. granted the 
barony of Largo, in acknowledgement of his brilliant achievements 
against the greatly superior force of the piratical vessels of England ; 
and his son James IV. continued to hold him in deservedly high 
esteem, and employed him, both in war and diplomatic nego- 
tiations. Little is known of John Wood, founder of the hospital 
afterwards noticed, and to whom there is a monument in the church- 
yard wall, except that he was a cadet of the family of Largo, died 
in London in great difficulties, though leaving a large property, and 
was buried in Largo aisle, 22d July 1661. 

In 1670, this barony, which, subsequently to Sir A. Wood, had 
been possessed by Mr Peter Black, and the Gibsons of Dune, 
was purchased from the latter in 1663, by Sir Alexander Durham, 
Lord Lyon King at Arms, for 85,000 merks. His brother was Mr 
James Durham, minister of the High Church, Glasgow, and dis- 
tinguished both as an officer and a divine. 

In the village of Low Largo, was born Alexander Selkirk in 
1676. Being disgusted with the notice taken by the session, of a 
squabble which he had with his brother, he went to sea, and in 
1703, being sailing master of the ship Cinque Ports, bound for the 
south sea, he was put or left on shore on the island of Juan Fernan- 
dez He remained here, in entire solitude, four years and four 
months, when he was brought to England by Captain Woods Rogers.

De Foe found him about Wapping, and out of his story constructed 
Robinson Crusoe, the most entertaining and popuhir of all adven- 
tures. Alexander brought home the gun, sea-chest, and cap which 
he had with him on the desolate island, returned to sea after nine 
months, and was never heard of again. 

The late Sir John Leslie was born in this parish in 1766, of respec- 
table parents. He discovered an early predilection for mathematical 
and physical science, having with little aid qualified himself, in his 
thirteenth year, for the senior mathematic class in the University 
of St Andrews. In 1784, he entered as a student of Divinity at 
Edinburgh, but soon gave up all thoughts of the church as a pro- 
fession, and devoted an interval of several years to private teach- 
ing, travelling and writing for periodical publications of the day. 
Becoming well known by his differential thermometer, completed in 
1794, by his essay on Heat, published in 1804, and by other works 
pubhshed in Nicolson's Journal, and the Transactions of the Royal 
Society of London, he was elected Professor of Mathematics in the 
University of Edinburgh, in 1805; in 1809, Trofessor of Natural 
Philosophy ; and in 1820, Corresponding Member of the Institute 
of France. He contributed largely to the new edition of the Encyclo- 
paedia Britannica ; and in that, was published his last and best pro- 
duction, " The Progress of Mathematical Science in the eighteenth 
century." In 1832, he was created a Knight of the Guelphic Order, 
and in the November of that year he died, leaving the impress of 
his vigorous and original genius, whatever may be thought of his 
theories and reasonings, on his admirable instruments and experi- 
mental labours.

Antiqidics. — A circular tower of the old house, inhabited by Sir 
Andrew Wood, and said lo have been, previously to his time, a 
jointure house of the Scottish queens, still remains. General Dur- 
ham has lately put on it a monumental stone, with an inscription 
from Sir Andrew's charter. On the banks of the Kiel, a small 
stream, are the ruins of the Castle of Balcruvie, once possessed by 
the noble fimily of Crawfurd. In the centre of Lundin House, 
which is a modern erection, rises a square tower of great antiquity. 
The property of Lundin, which once embraced nearly the whole 
parish, was held by individuals of the name of Lundin, so early as 
the reign of David L One of King William the Lion's sons, Ro- 
bert, married the heiress, and in 1670, John Drummond, second 
son of the Earl of Perth, married the then heiress Sophia, after 
which the property remained in the united families of Perth and 
Lundin, now represented by Lady Willoughby D'Eresby, for a 
number of years subsequent to the attainder of the Earl of Perth m 
1745, when it was disposed of; and it is now in possession of Cap- 
tain Erskine Wemyss of Wemyss Castle, in right of his mother, 
daughter of the late Sir William Erskine, Bartf 

To the south and east of Lundin House are erected three un- 
wrought stones of a triangular form, measuring six yards above, 
and, as it is thought, as much below gromid, the solid contents of 
each being 270 feet. They bear no traces of any figure or in- 
scription. By some, they are conjectured to be of Roman origm ; 
by others, to be the gravestones of Danish chiefs, who fought 
here and were conquered by Banquo and Macbeth ; and by others, 
perhaps, with most probability, to be Druidical remains. Ancient 
sepulchres are found near them. They are of red sandstone. Two 
pieces of the same species of stone, evidently belonging to each 
other, were found some years ago, a mile apart, on the south of 
Largo estate. They are now joined, and present the appearance 
of a carved cross, of which the transverse pieces are equal, sur- 
rounded by a carved circle, touching the extremities of each. 
Such stones are said to be extremely rare, one only being known 

 He hrs also erected this summer, on a handsome stage, an iron 32 pounder, belong- 
ing to the Royal George, which was wrecked in 1782. This gun, which was recover- 
ed in 1836, and presented to the General by the Board of Ordnance, is peculiarly m- 
terosting, as Admiral Sir Philip Durham, his brother, a native of the parish, and ft 
distinguished officer, Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth, now, and at the time when 
the eun was recovered, was a lieutenant, and on board of the Royal George, at tlie 
time of the wreck, and one of 70 who, out of 1200 persons, were rescued from that 

fatal caJ™'f J descendants of the family of Lundin, hearing the name, are the I.un- 
dins of Auchtermairnie, in the parish of Kennoway.

ill Britain, and a few in Denmark. On a rising ground to the 
north, called Norrie's Law, several antiquities in • silver were dis- 
covered, together with a number of small silver Roman coins, 
bearing the stamp of the earlier emperors. They are now in the 
possession of General Durham. On the property of Balhousie, 
about forty years ago, were found, deposited eighteen inches be- 
neath the surface, three earthen vases containing ashes, and near 
them some rude stone coffins, and the bones of a child.

The population formerly employed in sea pursuits, salt-works, 
and collieries, in the south, has no doubt been diminished ; but the 
deficiency is far more than counterbalanced by the greater number 
of hands employed in the cultivation of the land, in manufactures, 
and in collieries in the north. 

Of the whole, there may be considered as residing in villages, . 1761

The proprietors of land of L. 50 and upwards are the heritors 
formerly mentioned, three of whom are resident. 

There is nothing peculiar in the language or manners of the in- 
habitants. It argues well for their prudence and management, 
that with wages, as frequently happens, not exceeding 6s. or 7s. 
a-week, they are able to clothe, educate, and feed their families, 
pay tlveir house rent, and defray other necessary expenses. Their 
general character, with exceptions which are found almost solely 
in the villages, may be considered as moral and becoming. Their 
kindness to each other in distress, it is always gratifying to witness ;

and their attendance at religious meetings, besides the ordinary 
Sabbath services, is a favourable evidence of their religious cha- 
racter. 

IV. — iNDUgTRY. 

The number of acres in the parish in cultivation is, • 5935 

of pasturage lands, . 290 
of planting, . . 595 

In general, the plantations consist of Scotch fir, larch, oak, elm, 
plane, ash, and beech. They thrive well, particularly the oak, if 
allowed sufficient room. On the north side of the parish, which 
is higher and of less value, the plantations, though mixed with va- 
rious sorts of hard-wood, are chiefly Scotch fir and larch ; the 
latter is rapid in its growth, and found to be very useful for many 
coimtry purposes. The plantations are under good management, 
and regularly thinned, but the produce is small. 

Rent. — The average rent of land may be reckoned at L. 2 per 
acre ; the rate of grazing an ox depends on his weight and size, — 
at three years old, and weighing 40 superficial stones, he may be 
grazed for L. 2, 15s. ; a milk cow, L. 3; and a full-grown Leices- 
ter sheep, 14s. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle generally bred are what is termed the 
Fife breed, but it is not considered pure. Of late, some farmers 
have bred from short-horned or Teeswater bulls, which is reckon- 
ed a great improvement, as the stock both milk well and feed well. 
No sheep are bred except for private use, and these are of the 
Leicester kind. Horses are reared chiefly for draught. Some of 
a superior kind have been bred lately from Yorkshire coaching 
horses, and have brought high prices for gentlemen's carriages. 
A considerable number of hogs are bred and fattened. They are 
of a smaller kind than formerly, being a cross of the Chinese, which 
are easily fattened, and meet with a ready market. 

Husbandry. — There is little waste land in the parish, all having 
undergone some degree of improvement, although in some places 
much remains to be done. Increased attention is now given to drain- 
ing; and considerable sums have been laid out on it, to great advan- 
tage. Furrow or surface drains are becoming frequent, and are high- 
ly approved. It is usual for the landlord to be at the expense of 
opening and filling them, whilst the tenant defrays the remainder. 
The general duration of leases is nineteen years. For the first 
fifteen, the tenant, though taken bound not to deteriorate the land 
bv over-cropping, is otherwise unrestricted ; for the last four, he 
is tied down to a certain management and rotation, according to

the nature of the ground, and particularly, to leave a proportion 
of it in grass, green crop, and fallow. 1'he term of lease may be 
long enough in ordinary cases, but not sufficient to reimburse the 
tenant when great improvements have been accomplished at his 
expense. The farm-buildings are now generally commodious and 
suitable. Much has been done for their improvement, within twenty 
years. The farm-house ordinarily consists of two storeys, covered 
with tile or slate, and has the office-houses behind it, for the most 
part in the form of a square. There is only a small proportion of 
unenclosed ground in the parish, although some of the fences are 
very insufficient, and not well taken care of. More attention is 
now paid to them, and the ditches are occasionally scoured, and 
the hedges dressed and cleaned annually. No obstacles of mate- 
rial consequence oppose the agricultural improvement of the pa- 
rish, except the low prices of produce for some years, which have 
barely enabled the tenant to pay his rent and his current expenses 
of cultivation. 

Fishery. — Some years ago, a salmon stake-net fishery was com- 
menced in Largo Bay. The rent paid to the proprietors of the diffe- 
rent stations was one-fourteenth of the gross produce. The annual 
amount of the fish sold, on an average of five years, was only 
L. 130, and from the expense of erecting and keeping the nets, 
nearly half of the capital employed was lost. The undertaking 
has been resumed, and is now more prosperously carried on. 

Manufactures.—There are two manufactures in the parish ; one 
water-mill for cleaning, and the other water and steam-mill for spin- 
nmg flax ; the first employing 4, the second employing 85 hands. 
They work six days in the week, twelve hours per diem, and nine 
on Saturday. They afford a fair remuneration, and are not con- 
sidered as particularly prejudicial either to health or morals. 

Shippinff.— -Three small vessels only belong to the port of the 
parish. The trade carried on in old times, in coal, salt, iron, 
sandstone, &amp;c. with Campvere and Rotterdam, and more recent- 
ly in wood with Norway, being altogether at an end. 

V, — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns, Sfc.—Leven and Colinsburgh, each three mile.s 
distant from the Kirkton of Largo, may be considered as the 
market-towns of the parish, for although it has several bakers 
and brewers, it has never regularly supplied itself with butcher- 
meat. The several villages contain a population as follows,— Kirk-

ton, 413; Lower Largo, including Temple and Drummochy, 567 ; 
Lundin Mill, 453; Backmuir of Gilston and Woodside, 316. 

Means of Communication.— Tlumerous means of communica- 
tion are enjoyed by the parish. A daily post arrives and 
departs. The turnpike road passing through it exceeds eight 
miles. There is a daily coach from Cupar to Largo, except 
in the depth of winter ; and at all seasons, one by Largo from 
Anstruther to Edinburgh, three times a week ; and one also as 
frequently from St Andrews to Largo. A steam-boat plies 
twice a day in summer and once in winter between Largo and 
Newhaven. The harbour, formed by the influx of the Kiel 
into the Frith of Forth, is not in good order. Were it repaired, 
which might be done without much outlay, it would be one of the 
best on this side of the Forth, and were alow water or chain pier to 
be constructed, and a more level road made between this port and 
Cupar, not only would the neighbourhood be benefited, and the 
county town obtain a shipping port within ten miles, but the near- 
est and most direct communication would be opened between the 
capital and the north-east of Scotland, and a place of shelter af- 
forded to vessels in storms, by which much property and life might 
be saved. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated most conve- 
niently for the majority of the population, but at a distance of four or 
five milesfrom one-fifth of it. It was built in 1817; and in 1826, there 
was taken into the new building, an aisle belonging to the old, by 
which the spire is supported, bearing date 1623. It affords accom- 
modation for upwards of 800, and there are no free sittings except 
50, eight for the hospitalers, and the remainder for official persons. 

There are considerable benefactions in the management of the 
session. The interest of L. 100, left by Mrs Wood, for the bene- 
fit of orphans; the interest of L. 600, left by the late Mr Kettle, 
writer in Edinburgh, one-half for the education of four poor child- 
ren, to the parochial teacher, and one-half to as many persons as 
it will reach, none receiving less than L. 2, who have fallen from 
their former means, but are not on the poor's roll ; and the inte- 
rest of L. 500, to respectable widows, named Jameson, who have, 
and only as long as they have, children under sixteen years of age. 
This fund, from the want of applicants corresponding to the de- 
scription, now exceeds L. 1100. No individual can receive more 

than L. 5 per annum. 

The manse was built in 1770. A large addition, with a com-

plete set of new offices, was made to it in \8'23, and another ad- 
dition this summer, so that now there is none better in the county. 
The glebe and garden make up 5 acres, worth L. 20. For many 
years, L. 1 1 per annum has been paid to the minister in lieu of 
foggage. The stipend, exclusive of L. 10 for communion ele- 
ments, has been, since the augmentation for crop 1830, 136 bolls 
of meal, and 136 barley, commuted at the fiar prices, and amount- 
ing, for the last six years respectively, to L.281, L. 228, L.215, 
L. 212, L. 219, and for crop 1836, to L. 292. 

There are two dissenting chapels, one belonging to the Relief, 
and the other to the Baptist persuasion, both situated at Lower 
Largo. Their ministers are paid by voluntary contribution. The 
number of families connected with the Establishment is 350 — with 
Dissenters of all classes, 200 ; and there are not a few individuals 
unconnected with any religious persuasion. Divine service at the 
Establishment is generally well attended, and, there is reason to 
think, would be much better attended, were it not that more seats 
are given to tenants, or let out to others, than they or their fami- 
lies can occupy, and thus such as would fill vacant seats cannot 
obtain them, — an evil which here, and in many other places, calls 
loudly for redress. The number of communicants on the roll is 
760. The number present in summer is about 600 ; and in win- 
ter, 500. 

There were Societies for religious and charitable purposes, but 
it is found more expedient to have regular collections, several times 
a-year. The average amount collected for the last three years has 
been L. 30 per annum. 

Education. — There is one parochial school, the teacher of which 
has the maximum salary, L. 34, 2s. 4d., more than the legal ac- 
commodations, and fees amounting to L. 20. Of three other 
schools, two have gratuitous salaries of L. 5 each from the heri- 
tors ; and the fees of each will amount to nearly L. 40 per annum. 
The branches generally taught are, reading, writing, arithmetic, 
mensuration, and occasionally Latin, book-keeping, and naviga- 
tion. The expensei.of course, varies, according to the branches 
taught; the lowest being 4d., the medium Is., and the highest 
7s. a month. The people are alive to the benefits of educa- 
tion ; and there are few children of six years who have not been 
sent to school; and few above fifteen who cannot read. And 
though the distances from school are two and even three miles, 
this does not pi'event attendance. Additional schools are not re-

quired except for this distance, which makes one in the north-west 
district very desirable' ; but a more liberal remuneration would be 
a great boon to the unendowed teachers, who often suffer from non- 
payment of fees. 

Library. — A subscription library has been established for a num- 
ber of years, containing about 500 volumes. It has been less pa- 
tronized of late than formerly, probably because there is a much 
greater number of periodical publications circulating at a small ex- 
pense. 

WoocCs Hospital — There is only one charitable institution, 
— Wood's Hospital. John Wood, a cadet of Sir Andrew's family, 
by deed ofmortification, dated 7th July 1659, bequeathed L. 68,418 
Scotch, to build and endow an hospital within the parish, for the 
maintenance of thirteen indigent and enfeebled persons of the 
name of Wood, besides a gardener, a porter, and a chaplain, with 
L. 17 a year. He appointed the Earl of Wemyss, the lairds of 
Largo, Lundin, and Balfour, together with the minister, and rema- 
nent members of the kirk-session, as patrons. The hospital was 
built in 1667, at an expense. Lament says, of 9000 merks. This 
hospital was found in a state of great decay in 1830, and the pa- 
trons erected a new one, which is not only a commodious, but a 
very handsome and ornamental building, after a design by Mr 
James Leslie, civil-engineer. It cost in all L. 2000. It is fitted 
up for sixteen inmates, each having a sitting and a sleeping apart- 
ment. In the centre is a large hall, where they are convened to 
prayers, morning and evening ; above which, is a room for the meet- 
ings of the patrons. The annual allowance to each hospitaler is 
L. 15 paid monthly, and vegetables. The funds arise from the 
interest of L. 2000, and a farm, the rent of which averages L. 280. 

Socu'izes.— There were two Friendly Societies, but they were 
lately dissolved, having been found, like many in the neighbour- 
hood, to be calculated on too low a principle. 

Savings Bank.— A savings bank, gratuitously managed by the 
parochial teacher, has been in active operation since 1815. The 
average of the whole deposits is about L. 1200, and about L.250 
is annually invested and withdrawn. The investments are made 
by servants, labourers, weavers, and mechanics. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid, and regularly on the poor list, is 40, and 
their average allowance Is. a week. The annual amount of col- 
lections at the church door for five years has been L. 37, L. 46, 
L 35, L. 36, and L. 31, and of mortcloths L. 3 per annum. The 



LARGO. 



445 



latter fund has been falling off, in consequence of a subscription 
mortcloth being most frequently employed. It used to be L. 8. 
Voluntary contributions are the only other source of income for 
the poor, and these, from the unwonted number of insane and fa- 
tuous persons of late, have been very high, amounting for three 
years, in 1835 to L. 100; in 1836, to L. 250; in 1837, to L. 100. 
Nevertheless, the heritors most wisely refrain from resorting to pa- 
rochial assessment. It is desirable that this forbearance were met 
by a more general disposition, on the part of the people, to contri- 
bute to the funds of the poor, and also by a greater reluctance to 
resort to the aid of these funds. There are many in need, by whom 
relief will not be sought as a favour ; by the majority, it is consi- 
dered and claimed as a right. 

Inns and Ale-houses. — There are 4 innsand 16licensed ale-houses 
in the parish. The latter are much more numerous than necessary, 
and unquestionably have a pernicious influence on the morals of many 
of the people. At the same time, it may be doubted if their being 
compelled to observe the regulations imposed on them by ]a,w 
more strictly, would prove beneficial, unless it were possible to pre- 
vent a most detrimental practice beginning here, and prevalent 
elsewhere, viz. their selling spirits, which are used not on the pre- 
mises, but in private houses. 

Fuel. — Scarcely any fuel except coal is consumed. It is obtaih- 
ed, in the parish, of an inferior sort at 6s. ; and from Wemyss and 
Largo ward, at 10s. per ton, inclusive of driving. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

There can be no doubt that the general condition of the parish has 
been improved since the date of the last Statistical Account. Much 
has been done for it in every department of agriculture, and the 
common comforts of life are more extensively diff"used. The ga- 
therings at tent-preachings, which used to amount to 3000 and 
4000 at every Sacrament, are now entirely unknown. Beggars, 
with whom the parish was wont to be infested, are now, by the ex- 
ertions of a new system of police, scarcely ever seen. Religious 
animosities, which were carried to a disgraceful height, have great- 
ly subsided. And withal, whilst it must be wished that family wor- 
ship were more cultivated, the " honouring of all men" more practis- 
ed, and their mental resources more employed by the body of the 
population, still they may be viewed as distinguished by shrewd- 
ness, and industry, and intelligence, and will no doubt participate 
in the progressive changes and improvements of the age.

<p>



PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JAMES GREIG, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Origin of the Name. — Ballingry is said to signify the village of 
the cross, and to be compounded of the Gaelic word Bal, a village, 
and the initials inscribed on crosses in the fields, J. N. R. J. Jesus 
Nazarenus Rex Judceorum, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is irregular. It is about 
4. miles in length, and 2 in breadth. It is bounded on the 
east by the parishes of Kinglassie and Auchterderran ; on the 
south by Auchterderran and Beath ; on the west by Cleish ; on 
the north by Portmoak. 

Soil. — The soil on the northern division of this parish is good; 
some of it dry and fit for any crop ; on the south part it is of a 
cold bottom, but well adapted for pasturage, in which a great part 
of the land has been lying for many years. 

Wood. — About 57 acres were planted, more than twenty years 
ago, with a variety of forest trees, on the south front of Binarty, 
the only hill in the parish, which is now a very thriving plantation, 
and a great ornament of the country. The larch soon rises above 
the other trees. Including the above, there are about 127 acres 
in planting on the estate of Lochore. A large ash tree on it was 
struck by the lightning, in August 1831, which shattered a thick 
branch, and rent the bark down to the earth. There are plan- 
tations on other properties in this parish. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — No vestige remains of the Roman Camp said to 
have been in this parish. Near its site is now the steading of the 
Chapel Farm. 

Parochial Registers. — These commence in 1669, and contain 
registers of marriages, births, and deaths. 

Land-oxoners.—The chief land- owners in the parish are, The 
Earl of Minto, Lord Dundas, Sir Walter and Lady Scott, Sir 



HALLINGRY. 



John Malcolm, Messrs William Briggs, William Gilmour, George 
Greig, Andrew Rutherford, and Robert Henderson. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755 the numbers were rated at, . . 464 

When the last Account of the parish was drawn up, 220 
By the census of 1831, the males were . 209 

females . 183 



Total, . . 392 

Perhaps 20 workmen engaged at two buildings in this parish 

in 1831, should be deducted, 20 

The number at present, . ... 372 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — There is little more than a fourth in tillage. 

Number of acres, standard imperial measure, in tlie parish, which are either culti- 
vated or occasionally in tillage, . . - 2837f 

Number of acres which never have been cultivated, and which remain con- 
stantly waste, or in pasture, _ - . - 1927 

Number of acres that might, with a profitable application of capital, be culti- 
■ vated, - - - - - - 197 

Number of acres under wood, _ . . _ 234 

All the acres, except 300 imperial, are Scotch measure. 

Rental. — The rental of the parish is L. 4160, 18s. 6d. 

The leases are generally for nineteen years. 

Wages. — An able young man, as a farm-servant, will get from 
L. 11 to L. 12 a-year, and his victuals. Day-labourers earn 
Is. 8d. a day in summer, and Is. 6d. in winter. 

Produce. — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for food of man or the domestic 
animals, L. 2903 5 0 

Of potatoes and turnips, . . - - . 220 16 0 

Of hay, whether meadow or cultivated, ... 770 1 5 0 

Of flax, - - - - 1 15 0 

Annual thinnings of wood, - - - - - - 30 00 



Total yearly value of raw produce raised, - L. 3926 1 1 0 

Value of coal raised, - - - L. 9183 6 8 

Draining. — The bottom of Lochore Loch, after it was drained, 
yielded very abundant crops for some time, but the drain is not suf- 
ficiently wide to carry off the water in heavy rains, which overflow 
the lands, and damage the grain occasionally. The cut for the w ater 
of Leven is very sufficient, and passes through a part of this pa- 
rish. The trustees of a minor are improving his estate by clear- 
ing some parts of it of stones, by draining, by planting barren spots, 
and building good steadings. A proprietor has been, and is still 
carrying on great improvements in draining his lands. It is hoped 
that some will follow his example. 

Crops raised and time of Sowing. — Oats is the grain most ge- 
nerally sown here ; barley is also sown, and it is accounted the 
most profitable crop. There is also some wheat, and pease and 



448 



FIPKSIIIRE. 



beans sown. Oats are sown in March or beginning of April, and 
early oats in the first of May ; barley is sown in April. The most 
approved rotation is one crop of oats, then a green crop, and the 
third a crop of oats or barley, with grass seeds. The next crop is 
hay, and then pasture for some time. The different estates in the 
parish are bound thirle to Inchgaw mill. 

Coal and Limestone. — In this parish two good coals are now 
working, which have an extensive sale. The limestone here is not 
good, and none of it is wrought at present. Lime is brought here 
from a distance of some miles. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — In 1831, a commodious church was built, 
sufficient for the inhabitants. The number of families attending 
the Established Church is 53, and that of Dissenters 16. The 
stipend was decerned by the Court in 1810, to be nine chalders 
of victual, half meal and half barley, and such a further quantity 
of victual as shall be equal to L. 45, lis. 4/gd. Sterling; but the 
full amount has not been drawn, as a process is still pending about 
the valuation of an estate in the parish. The amount of stipend 
converted into money is L. 209, 14s. lOd. The glebe extends to 
8 J acres. 

Education. — A school and a house for the teacher, who has the 
maximum salary, was built in 1825. His school fees may amount 
to L. 7 Sterling yearly ; and he has besides L. 2, 2s., and two bolls 
of oatmeal in lieu of garden ground. 

Poor Funds. — The poor sustained a loss by exchanging their 
land for what was not so good as what they had. Their' land is 
feued at L. 21 Sterhng yearly. The collections at the church 
doors may average about L. 7 Sterling a-year. The number on 
the roll has been nine for some years, who receive from 3s. to 7s. 
a-month. A late proprietor left a legacy of L. 1 00 Sterling to 
the poor's fund. There is an infirm woman, who is very reluctant 
to be put on the roll, although she needs assistance. This is a 
singular case. 

Jnns. — There are two houses in which malt and spirituous 
liquors are sold by legal license, but in one of them none is given 
to such as are intoxicated. This laudable example is worthy of 
the imitation of all engaged in the sale of ardent spirits. Were 
it universally followed, society would derive the greatest benefit 
from it. The inhabitants are generally sober and industrious.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. R. HALDANE, D. D. 1 tv/ttxttctpr c 
THE REV. GEORGE BUIST, D. D. /MINISTERS. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Prior to the period of the introduction of Christ- 
ianity into Scotland, the district of the country by which St An- 
drews is surrounded wore the aspect of a forest, in which a few 
patches of cultivated ground seem to have been interspersed. In 
this forest, the hog or swine in its wild state abounded ; and from 
this circumstance, it was denominated by the Picts, who at that 
period occupied the east coast of Scotland, Miicros, muc in their 
language, which was the Celtic or Gaelic, signifying a sow or boar, 
and ros, a peninsula or promontory. The correctness of this deri- 
vation is confirmed by the fact, that near the eastern extremity of 
the parish, the village of Boarhills still retains, the original name 
of the district, but translated into the modern language. The Picts 
at this period were a rude people, and their religious opinions and 
observances were regulated by the Druids. The early Scottish 
'historians inform us, that, towards the close of the fourth cen- 
tury of the Christian era, a Greek monk named Regulus, from 
the province of Achaia, was directed in a vision to leave his native 
country in a ship, attended by a number of religious devotees, and 
carrying along with him certain of the bones or relics of the apostle 
Andrew. With this mandate he complied ; and, after a long and 
dangerous navigation, he and his associates were shipwrecked near 
the spot where the city of St Andrews now stands, with the loss 
of every thing but their lives and the sacred relics. The appear- 
ance of men so different in their aspect from what they had been 
accustomed to witness, arrested the attention of the native inha- 
bitants of the district, and information of the event was communi- 
cated to the sovereign of the country, then resident at Abernethy, 
his capital, in the vicinity of the junction of the Earne and Tay. 

The curiosity of the monarch was aroused at the intelligence, and

he resolved to visit the strangers in person. He was fascinated 
with their appearance, and conversation, and doctrine. He was 
induced by them to abandon his idolatrous notions, and to become 
a convert to the Christian faith ; and many of his subjects, impres- 
sed with the same sentiments, followed his example. To manifest 
his gratitude to his new spiritual guides, he put them in possession 
of a proper place of residence, with an extensive territorial domain ; 
and he erected for them a chapel and tower, which some writers 
imagine are the same which still subsist in a good state of preser- 
vation in the immediate vicinity of the ruins of the cathedral, and 
which still bear the name of the Grecian saint. To commemorate 
the happy change which their arrival and preaching had been the 
means of introducing, the King changed the name of their place 
of residence from Mucros to Kilremonth, which means the cell 
or chapel of the King on the mount, according to some of the 
ancient authorities ; and afterwards to Kilrule, the cell or chapel 
of Regulus or Rule. This last name was retained so long as the 
government of the Picts was recognized ; but when their territo- 
ries were subjugated by the Scots under Kenneth 11. that prince, 
who recognized the apostle Andrew as his patron saint, altered the 
name of the place where his relics were deposited to St Andrews, 
the name which it still retains. The Pictish designation, however, 
is still adhered to by the Highlanders of Scotland, who employ the 
Gaelic language. 

Extent. — The parish of St Andrews is about 10 miles in length, 
but the medium breadth is not quite 2 miles, the area compre- 
hending a space of between 17 and 18 square miles. 

Boundaries. — It is bounded on the north by the Eden, which 
separates it from the parish of Leuchars, till it reach the German 
Ocean ; and by the ocean, from that point to its eastern extremity ; 
on the east, by the stream denominated Kenloway or Kenly, which 
separates it from the parishes of Kingsbarns and St Leonards ; and 
by the parishes of Dunino, Cameron, Ceres, and Kemback, on the 
south and west. 

Topograpliical J]}peai'ances. — No part of the parish rises to a 
great elevation, the hills of East and West Balrymonth, which 
are the highest in the eastern division, being, the former, 360, and 
the latter, 375 feet above the level of the sea, as ascertained by 
accurate barometrical measurements ; and the hill of Clatto, in the 
western division, rises to the elevation of 548 feet. The low and 
flat lands in the parish extend to from 600 to 800 acres, more than 



ST ANDREWS. 



451 



the half of which are in a regular course of tillage, and the remain- 
der form the links or downs, which extend from the estuary of the 
Eden to the vicinity of the city, and which, while they are highly 
useful as a place of recreation for the citizens, afford also pasture 
for sheep. 

A few years ago, there were several caves among the rocks over- 
hanging the sea in the vicinity of the castle. Their dimensions 
were but small, and they bore strong marks of being, partly at least, 
artificial. But in consequence of the encroachments of the watery 
element on this part of the coast, they have now almost entirely 
disappeared. About a mile to the east of the city, in the cliffs 
which bound the ocean, there is a natural cave of considerable di- 
mensions, which is usually denominated Kinkell cave. It penetrates 
from seventy to eighty feet inwards, with a breadth in the centre of 
about twenty-five feet, and a height on the west side of ten or eleven 
feet; but the roof, which seems to consist of a single stone form- 
ing throughout a perfect plane, dips so much towards the east as 
to terminate in the floor, forming with it an acute angle. Part of 
the floor and the west side, where there is a constant dropping of 
water from the roof, are covered with plants, which continue to 
grow to nearly forty feet from the entrance, which is much more 
contracted than the cave itself. This cave is easily accessible, and 
it is frequently visited, especially during the summer months, by 
the citizens and their visitants. 

The sea-coast of this parish is about six miles in extent, of which 
two to the north and east of the city are low, consisting of sand- 
hills of little elevation, which form the eastern boundaries of the 
links; and the remaining four are elevated from 50 to 100 feet, in 
some places perpendicular, and presenting only the sandstone rock ; 
but in others, where layers of clay and other loose materials alter- 
nate with the rock, the declivity is less abrupt, and the surface pre- 
sents a covering of grass, with a variety of other native plants and 
stunted shrubs interspersed. In this line of coast, there are several in- 
sulated rocks of considerable dimensions, as the Maiden Rock, which 
is skirted by the sea, and which rises, like an irregular piece of 
masonry, to a height of about forty feet, from a base of about the 
same extent, and from six to twelve feet in thickness. The rock and 
spindle at Kinkell are striking objects, and will be afterwards al- 
luded to ; and the Buddo Rock, in the vicinity of Boarhills, is also 
calculated to arrest the attention.

above the mean level of the sea, and with a northern exposure, will 
afford a correct view of the mean temperature of the several months 
of the year at St Andrews, in Latitude 56° 20' 30" north, and Lon- 
gitude 2° 47' 30" west.

The last number in the table, viz. 48°.374, is the mean annual 
temperature taken as the mean of the mean monthly temperature 
for the above eight years. 

The climate of the parish is dry and healthy. The swamps and 
morasses which existed at a former period, in the low grounds, have 
been thoroughly drained. The situation of the city is particular- 
ly salubrious, the soil being dry, and elevated from 60 to 70 feet 
above the level of the sea. The south-west is the prevailing wmd 
for the year; but in April and May the east wind generally pre- 
dominates. It is then, as over the greater part of the east coast 
of the kingdom, peculiarly piercing and chilly, and is regarded as 
injurious to persons of a delicate constitution. 

From a report in manuscript drawn up in 1827 by one of the 
physicians established in the city, the following excerpts will aflford 
an idea of the state of the city, so far as the health of its citizens 
is concerned : " The great width of the streets, and the extensive 
gardens interspersed, afford the fullest ventilation ; and, except in 
some of the narrow closes, there is no obstacle to the admission 
of pure air into the houses of the inhabitants. There are no com- 
mon sewers for the reception of rain water in the streets, the whole

being conducted in open gutters. I notice this, as several authors 
of topographical sketches reckon the stagnation of the putrid water in 
tliese sewers as the cause of unhealthiness in many large cities. We 
have no table of the ages to which the inhabitants live, but I am 
persuaded that the average of years is greater than in most other 
towns. In 1814, there were alive, within twenty doors of each 
other, not fewer than six persons, the youngest of whom was above 
ninety. Epidemic diseases are scarcely known in the city. Dur- 
ing a residence of nearly twenty years, I have not known typhus 
fever epidemic within it, though it has prevailed in the neighbour- 
ing districts. In 1810, it was very prevalent in the parish, parti- 
cularly in the western division, where, in one small village, I had 
at one time nearly 70 patients, while in the city there were few or 
none. The same took place in 1818, when St Andrews seemed 
to be the only place in the united kingdom which was not visited 
by that epidemic. Intermittents are rare, but I have seen several 
cases ; all, however, from a distance. The exanthemata have been 
occasionally prevalent, but seldom have proved very fatal. In 1816, 
there were about 120 cases of well-marked scarlet fever, of which 
only 8 or 9 died ; and, though measles and hooping-cough prevail- 
ed the same year, the number of deaths that year was not beyond 
the average. In 1826, measles were very prevalent, and the mor- 
taUty was much greater, the number of deaths being nearly 40 
above the usual average. Measles had not appeared in St An- 
drews during the preceding nine years, and a great number of chil- 
dren were affected, many of whom fell victims to the secondary 
symptoms. Inflammatory complaints, especially of the chest, are 
of frequent occurrence, but do not appear to be more severe than 
in other parts of Scotland. Rheumatism, in the acute form, is a 
frequent complaint. I think that thp number of cases of haemop- 
tysis and of phthisis is smaller than in the neighbouring districts, 
owing, perhaps, to the want of manufactures. Catarrh is a fre- 
quent complaint, and I have often seen it contagious. .The amuse- 
ment of golf, which is general with all ranks, is the best prophy- 
lactic in preventing dyspepsia and hypochondriasis, which occa- 
sionally occur." 

The following table contains a statement of the amount of the 
rain which fell at St Andrews in 1835 and 1836, as ascertained 
by Dr Jackson's rain-gage, elevated 6f feet above the level of the 
ground :

Hydrography. — Springs are to be found in the various districts 
of the parish ; but with the exception of one nearly a mile to the 
east of the city, at the foot of the rocky eminence which skirts 
the ocean, and another on the lands of Bonytoun, both of which 
are impregnated with iron, they have nothing remarkable in their 
appearance or properties. The temperature of a well, at the 
depth of 21 feet below the surface of the ground, in the immediate 
vicinity of St Salvator's College, was carefully examined by Dr 
Jackson, during the years 1821, 1822, and 1823, when its medium 
was found to be 46°.95l, Fahrenheit, while the medium tempera- 
ture of the air for the same years was 47°.265. 

Two small streams have their origin in the parish, and fall into 
the sea, the one on the south-east, and the other on the north-west 
of the city. The course of the larger does not exceed five miles ; 
it passes through the harbour, after having previously communi- 
cated motion to the machinery of several corn-mills. The other 
stream is much smaller, and is not applied to any useful purpose. 
The Eden, which forms the northern boundary of the parish for 
about four miles, and which enters the German Ocean a mile and 
a-half to the north of the city, has altogether a course of about 
twenty-five miles. And the course of the Kenly, which forms 
another of the parish boundaries, is from six to eight miles. The 
tide flows up the Eden about four miles, when its farther progress, 
except at high spring tides, is prevented by Nydie mill-dam, which 
forms the boundary of the parish in that direction. For nearly 
the half of this distance, it has a considerable estuary, which is co- 
vered by the sea at high water, and is then navigable for vessels 
of an hundred or an hundred and twenty tons. But when the 
tide retires, the greater part of it presents a surface of soft mud 
and sand. As the course of the river through it is winding, and 
as there is also a bar at the entrance from the sea, the assistance

of a pilot becomes necessary for its safe navigation. Towards its 
centre it contains extensive beds of cockles and mussels. The 
former are collected and disposed of as a wholesome article of 
diet, and the latter are sometimes applied to this use, but they 
are chiefly employed as bait by the fishermen, not only of St An- 
drews, but of most of the fishing stations within the range of 
twenty or thirty miles. There are no lakes nor cascades within 
the limits of the parish. 

Geology.  — The geology and , mineralogy of the parish are 
possessed of considerable interest, in consequence of the ex- 
tent of rocky coast by which it is bounded on the north. The 
prevailing strata are sandstone, containing thin seams of coal, 
and strata of slate clay, with courses of clay ironstone; thus in- 
dicating that the whole group belongs to the carboniferous se- 
ries. That they form the lowest members of that series, is, how- 
ever, no less certain, both from the character of the strata on which 
they rest, which do not belong to the coal formation at all, and 
from their deficiency in carboniferous matter. 

The sandstone is of a grayish-yellow colour. The general dip 
of its strata, where their bearings are most uniform, is towards the 
south. But in these places, especially those that lie to the east- 
ward of the town, from the agency of causes concerning which 
there are differences of opinion, all uniformity of dip and direction 
has either been originally prevented, or subsequently destroyed. 
The most curious convolutions and tortu'ous windings among the 
strata are everywhere to be observed ; while in some places, on 
the other hand, all traces of stratification vanish. So variable al- 
so is the state of adhesion among the particles of the rock, that in 
one place a mass will be found quite friable, and in another, not 
an hundred yards distant, another mass almost as hard as flint. 
In this sandstone, globular and botryoidal masses of iron pyrites are 
of frequent occurrence, and those vegetable organic remains which 
are usually met with in analogous strata are in some places abun- 
dant. 

The sandstone strata are very frequently separated by strata of 
slate clay, in which the vegetable impressions proper to that rock, 
when associated as here, are of occasional occurrence. And what 
gives the slate clay a certain degree of economic interest, are the 
courses and thin beds of clay ironstone which it usually con-

tains, and which, at a time when the iron trade was more profit- 
able than it is now, were sometimes collected and sent off to the 
Carron Ironworks. 

At the place to the north-west of the town named the Witch- 
lake, the phenomena now described may be observed. But it is 
chiefly on the coast to the eastward that geological phenomena 
of interest are displayed. Of these, the constantarying direc- 
tion of the strata and character of the rock are very remarkable. 
But what seems most worthy of notice in this place is a curious 
mass of trap tuff, about a mile and a half from St Andrews, of 
which the remains constitute the rock well known by the name of 
the Rock and Spindle. Besides this mass, other portions of trap, 
as might be expected, occur in various quarters of the parish, 
but as they present nothing peculiar in their character, it were 
needless to describe them minutely. That the Rock and Spindle, 
however, is possessed of no small interest, will be perceived from 
the following account of it extracted from a paper on the mine- 
ralogy of the neighbourhood of St Andrews, by the Rev. Dr Flem- 
ing, and found in the second volume of the memoirs of the Wer- 
nerian Society. " The most curious circumstance which attract- 
ed my notice in examining this bed of tuff, was the rock which is 
well known in the neighbourhood of St Andrews, by the name 
of the Rock and Spindle. This rock is about 40 feet in height. 
Towards the base there is a spherical concretion of basalt ui the 
form of five or six-sided pyramids meeting at the apex, giving to 
the mass a stellate appearance. The mass is likewise divided not 
in concentric layers. The basalt contains crystals of augite with 
olivine and glassy felspar. This concretion of basalt is surround- 
ed with the tuff, into which it gradually passes, and must have been 
completely enveloped in it previous to its partial wasting away by 
the action of the sea, and of the atmosphere. It may be mention- 
ed in this place, that the regular basaltic columns at Ely, are a 
portion of a spherical concretion contained ui trap tuff. Here 
the concretion is only about ten feet in diameter ; at Ely it is seve- 
ral hundred feet." P. 153. This statement and explanation of 
Dr Fleming, it is proper to add, is by a later observer, Mr R. H. 
Cunningham, held to be incorrect : that geologist maintaining that 
the basalt of the Rock and Spindle is not a contemporaneous con- 
cretion of basalt, but part of a vein, and of after formation to the 

tuffa. ' . 1 • -1

most remarkable. These were so abundant, at a remote period, 
in the district, that their name, as has been already remarked, 
was incorporated with its designation. At present there appears 
to be nothing connected with the zoology of the parish of a pe- 
culiar character, the animals, both wild and domestic, resembling 
those which are to be found in the other districts of the country. 
Within these few years, the small insect denominated the Ameri- 
can bug has been very injurious to the apple trees in the city and 
its vicinity, and no remedy that has hitherto been employed has 
proved effectual for securing its destruction. 

The Eden, between the Guard Bridge and the sea, is during 
the winter season the resort of a great variety of water-birds ; and 
during the recess of the tide, a great many species of marine ani- 
mals are to be found among the rocks on the shore. After cer- 
tain storms also, not a few species of shells are cast on the west 
sands. But the bottom of the bay is generally sandy, and rather 
unproductive of organic forms. On comparing the number of spe- 
cies which it yields with those of the Frith of Forth, it may be said 
that it affords an illustration of the remark, that organized beings 
are much more abundant in estuaries than in bays. 

The species of shell-fish which are of importance here, in an 
economical point of view, are the cockle and mussel, which abound 
in the estuary of the Eden, and the lobster and crab, which are 
found on the rocky shore between the city and the eastern extre- 
mity of the parish. 

Botany. — But few rare plants flourish in this district, and none 
of them seem to be deserving of particular notice. The close 
plantations which exist in the parish are in general of the Scotch 
fir, and are on the poorest of the soils, but they are of no great ex- 
tent. In the vicinity of some of the landed proprietor's houses, the 
oak, the elm, the beech, the plane, the larch, and some other spe- 
cies of trees have been introduced. The ash is more generally 
diffused over the district than any other species of tree, its timber 
being very useful for the construction of agricultural implements. 

The landward part of the parish is not remark9.ble for its bota- 
nical riches ; but on the cliffs and banks which stretch towards the 
east on the sea shore, several of the rarer flowering plants and many 
interesting species of mosses and lichens occur. The rocks be- 
tween high and low water-mark are also covered with sea-weeds, 
and furnish many species. But here again it may be remarked, that 
from the very friable nature of the sandstone, of which many of 
these rocks are composed, the marine botany of the parish is pre-

vented from rivalling either that on the southern side of Fifeness, 
or on the northern shore at Aberbrothwick. 

II. — Civil History. 
Of the parish at large no ancient nor modern history has been 
traced. The city being the seat of the Archbishop and metropo- 
litan of the kingdom, and of the earliest of its universities, is fre- 
quently referred to in the annals of Scottish history. No detail- 
ed account, however, of any of its institutions appears to have been 
drawn up prior to the days of Martine, who was secretary to two 
of the archbishops previous to the Revolution, and who has exhi- 
bited in his work entitled Reliquice Divi Andrece a mass of valu- 
able information, relative to the religious establishments of the 
city. This production remained in manuscript for more than a 
century, and it was at last printed in a handsome manner at St 
Andrew's in 1797, by the University printer. About ten years af- 
terwards, the Rev. Mr Grierson, minister of the parish of Cock- 
pen, published his Delineations of St Andrews, in which he exhi- 
bited a particular account of every thing remarkable in the history 
and present state of the city and ruins, the University, and other 
interesting objects of this ancient ecclesiastical capital of Scotland. 
And in 1822, he published a second edition of his work with consi- 
derable corrections and additions. This production furnishes a com- 
prehensive view of the ancient and modern state of the city, and of 
its institutions, and is a useful manual both to the citizens, and to 
occasional visitants. A short account of the city and its institu- 
tions has also appeared in Chambers's Gazetteer of Scotland. 

Historical Events.— The principal historical events in which the 
city and parish of St Andrews are concerned, will be found in the ac- 
counts of the institutions to which they refer. In addition to these, it 
may here be stated, that after Edward.Lhad subjugated Scotland, he 
summoned the members ofthe Scottish Parliamentto meet him at St 
Andrews, where he compelled them to swear allegiance to him. And 
that a few years afterwards, they again assembled at this city, and 
recognized the claims of Robert Bruce to the Scottish throne. 
When Edward III., with his victorious forces, overrun and sub- 
dued the greater part of Scotland, he placed a garrison in St An- 
drews ; but after his return to England, many of his new conquests 
were wrested from him. Among others, the city and Castle of St 
Andrews were besieged and taken after a short resistance, and the 
fortifications of the latter were in a great measure destroyed.— In 
1401, the unfortunate Duke of Rothsay was imprisoned in he 



ST ANDREWS. 



459 



Castle of St Andrews, by his uncle, the Duke of Albany, the Re- 
gent of the kingdom, previous to his removal to Falkland, where 
he was starved to death. — A few years afterwards John Resby and 
Paul Craw, were committed to the flames at St Andrews, for pro- 
pagating what was then held to be heretical doctrine. — In 1471, 
the Bishop of St Andrews was invested by the Pope with archie- 
piscopal dignity, and this his successors in office, whether of the 
Romish or of the Protestant faith, afterwards retained. — After the 
tenets of the Reformation had begun to be disseminated in Scot- 
land, several individuals were tried at St Andrews, as supporters of 
the new opinions, and condemned to the flames. Among these 
were Patrick Hamilton, Abbot of Fearn, and nephew to the Earl 
of Arran ,• and George Wishart, son of the proprietor of Pittarrow, 
in the Mearns, whose cruel and untimely deaths were greatly la- 
mented by the community at large. The celebrated George Bu- 
chanan avoided a similar fate, by escaping from imprisonment in 
the Castle of St Andrews. — These events were followed by the 
murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546, and the subsequent siege, sur- 
render, and partial demolition of the castle, which had been garri- 
soned by the conspirators. Two of what, it is supposed, were cannon 
balls, employed at that siege, were some years ago found by some 
young men among the rocks in the immediate vicinity of the castle. 
They are now in the custody of the Professor of Chemistry, and 
were covered when found, with a calcareous incrustation. The 
one of them had undergone a considerable alteration, being soft on 
the surface, and resembling a carburet of iron, while the other re- 
tained its original hardness. — In June 1583, James VI. escaped 
from the influence of the noblemen who had placed him under per- 
sonal restraint at Ruthven, by entering the Castle of St Andrews, 
where he was soon joined by a number of his well-aff'ected subjects. 
This prince frequently visited St Andrews while he remained in 
Scotland ; and when, after his accession to the English throne, he 
returned to it in 1617, St Andrews was by no means overlooked. 
Here he had directed the prelates, and a number of the influential 
clergy, to meet him, that he might unfold to them his views, rela- 
tive to subsequent ecclesiastical arrangements. — In 1645, the Scot- 
tish Parliament held its meetings in St Andrews, and among other 
proceedings condemned to death Sir Robert Spottiswood, son of the 
archbishop of that name, and three other gentlemen who had sup- 
ported the royal cause, and had been taken prisoners at the battle 
of Philiphaugh, and who were afterwards executed in the princi- 
pal street of the city. — In May 1679, James Sharp, Archbishop of

St Andrews, who had been a zealous supporter of the measures of 
the Court, against the opponents of Episcopacy, was murdered at 
Magus Muir, near the western extremity of the parish, by a party 
of the Covenanters, who had assembled not for this purpose, but 
for the avowed object of waylaying and destroying the Sheriff-sub- 
stitute of the county of Fife, who, instigated by the Archbishop, 
had been a violent persecutor of the Presbyterians, who resided 
within the limits of his jurisdiction. The murderers escaped, but 
in the month of November following, five of the insurgents, who 
had been taken prisoners at the battle of Bothwell Bridge, were 
executed, and their bodies were hung in chains, at the spot where 
the murder had taken place. A stone was afterwards erected in 
the immediate vicinity, with an inscription commemorative of their 
fate, which is still visited by many who feel an interest in the events. 

Maps, Sj'c. — No map or survey of the parish has been discovered 
by the writer of this article, nor any letters, papers, or documents 
tendingto illustrate the history, biography, or antiquities of the parish, 
with the exception of the productions already alluded to, and the 
documents in the possession of the city functionaries, the colleges, 
and the church and commissary courts. Many of these are highly 
interesting to the antiquarian ; but any detail of their contents, 
that might be satisfactory or useful, would swell out this article 
far beyond all reasonable limits. 

Eminent Men. — Many eminent characters have been connected 
with this parish by birth, residence, or burial. Previous to the 
estabhshment of the Reformation in Scotland, many of the bishops, 
archbishops, and priors of St Andrews were distinguished by their 
abilities, and by their influence in the counsels of the nation. 
And many of the individuals connected with the university were 
possessed of great learning and of high talents. Towards the 
middle of the tenth century, Constantino III. King of Scotland, 
after a long reign, in which he had ultimately experienced many 
reverses in his wars with the English, wearied of his high rank 
and eminence, retired from the world, and took up his residence 
among the Culdees of St Andrews, A. D. 950, becoming the 
prior or abbot of the order ; an office which he exercised during 
the remainder of his life. 

The prelates who occupied the important see of St Andrews 
were in general connected with the first families of the kingdom. 
They were distinguished by their talents, as well as by their edu- 
cation. To them the city was indebted for its most remarkable 
edifices and institutions, such as the erection of its cathedral, its

priory, and its castle, and the establishment of the university and 
its colleges. A considerable number of them left behind them 
specimens of their literary talents. Thus Turgot, who is styled 
by Martine, the tutelary saint of Archangel, and who was Bishop 
of St Andrews about the commencement of the twelfth century, 
composed in Latin a variety of historical works, chiefly referring 
to the affairs of Scotland. Of one of these, viz. his Chronicle of 
Scottish Affairs, Fordun's Scoto-Chronicon formsthe continuation; 
and whoever is anxious to ascertain the titles of the literary pro- 
ductions of the other prelates, may have his curiosity gratified by 
consulting Dempster's Ecclesiastical History of the Scottish na- 
tion, where he will find them detailed under their respective names. 
« In the same production, he will find an enumeration of the writings 
of such of the priors of St Andrews, professors of the university, 
and other individuals connected with the ecclesiastical establish- 
ments, as turned their attention to literary pursuits. Of these the 
most celebrated as literary characters were Andrew Wyntown, 
one of the canons of the Augustinian Monastery toward the close 
of the fourteenth century, and the author of a poetical chronicle 
of Scotland, composed not in the Latin language, which was the 
usual vehicle of the period, but in the vernacular language of 
the country ; and which existed in manuscript only until 1795, 
when it was printed ; and John Major, Principal of St Salvator's 
College towards the middle of the sixteenth century, whose 
history of his country, in six books, though written in a rude 
style, and though it embraces many erroneous and fabulous state- 
ments, displays at the same time much boldness of spirit. This 
writer freely censures the usurpations of the Roman hierarchy, 
together with the indolence and sensuality that were, at that pe- 
riod, so generally prevalent among the members of the ecclesiasti- 
cal orders. His theological works, which were voluminous, parti- 
cularly his Decisiones Sententiaruvi, were held in high estimation 
by the theologians of the age. 

After the Reformation, the splendour of the religious establish- 
ments at St Andrews was greatly curtailed, — a large portion of 
their revenues having been alienated to different purposes. The 
succeeding prelates were in consequence of a less influential cha- 
racter, and less distinguished by their family connections. But 
in general, they were men of respectable talents. The most dis- 
tinguished among them as a writer was Spottiswood, the historian 
of the Church of Scotland. Of the members of the university 
who distinguished themselves between the Reformation and the

Revolution, were the celebrated George Buchanan, who was for 
several years Principal of St Leonard's College ; Andrew Melville, 
Principal of St Mary's College, the zealous and steady champion 
of Presbyterianism, whose life, opinions, and exertions in the cause 
of religion, have been so ably detailed by Dr M'Crie ; Samuel 
Rutherford, Professor of Divinity and Principal of St Mary's Col- 
lege, who was one of the members of the Assembly of Divines at 
Westminster, during the civil waVs, and whose religious publica- 
lions are still popular in Scotland. — James Wood, Professor of 
Divinity, the author of several controversial works, which display 
much acuteness ; Robert Blair, one of the ministers of the city, 
and one of the leading members of the church during the troubles 
of the times ; and James Gregory, Professor of Mathematics, the . 
celebrated inventor of the Gregorian telescope. 

Since the era of the Revolution, among the learned men who 
have contributed to support the lustre of the university, we meet 
with the names of Thomas Halyburton, Professor of Divinity, 
and author of several popular and controversial works ; Prin- 
cipal Hadow, who distinguished himself in the controversy rela- 
tive to the work entitled " The Marrow of Modern Divinity ;" 
Principal TulUdeph, who left behind him a valuable paraphrase 
and notes on the New Testament, which remain still in ma- 
nuscript ; Professor Wilkie, the author of the Epigoniad ; 
Principal Watson, the historian of Philip 11. ; Professor Ba- 
ron, the author of Lectures on Belles Lettres and Logic, and 
some other productions; Dr Wilson, the author of a valuable 
Hebrew Grammar ; Dr James Playfair, the author of the ela- 
borate systems of chronology and geography which bear his 
name ; Dr George Hill, who for many years was the leading 
member of the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland, and 
whose valuable Lectures on Divinity were published after his death; 
Dr Adam Ferguson, the historian of the Roman republic, who 
spent the close of his life in the city that was endeared to him by 
his early associations ; and Dr Andrew Bell, the founder of 
the Madras or national system of education, who was a native of 
the city, and who has left behind him most substantial proofs of 
the regard which he felt for its welfare and prosperity. 

Had the limits allotted to this article permitted, this section of 
it might have been materially enlarged, by additional names, and 
by a train of illustrative remarks. 

Heritors. The Heritors of the parish form a numerous body. 

Those of the Priory alone are nearly 100 in number ; and in the re-

maining part of the parish they amount to nearly 60. Three of 
them, viz. John Whyte Melville, Esq. ; James Home Rigg, Esq. ; 
and the United College, have each a valued 'rent exceeding 
L. 1200 Scots. Mrs Cheape of Strathtyrum ; Alexander Meldrum, 
Esq. of Kincaple; General Ramsay of Kinkell ; and John A. Thom- 
son of Charleton, have each a valued rent between L. 600 and 
L. 1200. The valuation of nine other heritors exceeds L. 300 
each, and of twenty-four the valuation is from L. 100 to L. 300. 

Parochial Eeffisters.—Theo\destYo\nmeoithe kirk-sessionrecords 
commences with the year 1559, and comprehends the transactions of 
that body down to the year 1600. It presents many curious and in- 
teresting details relative to the administration of church discipline, 
and other parochial arrangements, at that early period of the history 
of the Reformed Church. The volume containing the proceedings 
from 1600 to 1638 has been lost, but from the latter of these 
dates, down to the present time, the minutes have been preserved. 
The existing register of births and baptisms begins with the year 
1626, and has been continued to the present time, with the excep- 
tion of the entries from 1738 to 1742, which have been lost. The 
register of contracts, proclamations, and marriages, begins with 
the year 1770, and that of deaths with 1740, and both have been 
continued to the present day. The keeper of these records, how- 
ever, states, that they are defective to a very considerable extent, 
as, notwithstanding all the means that are employed by him to en- 
sure the registration of the births, many of the parents neglect 
this part of their duty. And when the dead are buried in other 
cemeteries, there is no return of the interment m.ade to him, and 
no entry in his books. 

It is much to be regretted that the keepers of the ecclesiastical 
records in Scotland have been so negligent, that in many of the 
parishes they are not to be found of an older date than a century, 
or a century and a-half. It is probable that many of the volumes 
of these records, which are supposed to be lost or destroyed, might 
still be recovered, were the ministers of the parishes to institute a 
diligent inquiry respecting them. A number of years ago, the 
writer of this article discovered, in the course of an investigation, 
the minutes of the Diocaesan Synod of St Andrews, commen- 
cing with the year 1611, and containing the proceedings of that 
court for above twenty years, which he was enabled to place in 
the custody of the clerk of the synod of Fife. And within these 
lew years, he accidentally discovered the volume containing the 
proceedmgs of the presbytery of St Andrews from October 1586 



•104

to December 1605. This is a highly interesting record, as it fur- 
nishes many details relative to the proceedings of Andrew Melville 
and his associates, that are not to be found in any printed work. 
This volume does not appear to have been in the hands of the 
presbytery clerks for more than a century. During the first six 
years of the period which it embraces, the presbytery of St An- 
drews comprehended also the parishes which now form the pres- 
bytery of Cupar, the first erection of the latter presbytery not tak- 
ing place until October 1592. This volume has not yet been put 
into the hands of the presbytery clerk, but it is hoped that this 
will ere long be effected ; and if this expectation should not be re- 
alized, a transcript of it which has been made will be lodged with 

the other records. 

Antiquities.— The Chapel and Tower of St Regulus are understood 
to be the most ancient relics of ecclesiastical architecture that ex- 
ist at St Andrews. The date of their erection cannot be correct- 
ly ascertained ; but the most ancient of our Scottish historians speak 
of them as existing in their times, and, indeed, as having already ex- 
isted for several centuries at the period when they wrote. Some 
contend that they were erected as early as the close of the fourth 
century of the Christian era, by the Pictish king in whose terri- 
tories they were situated, at the suggestion of St Regulus, by 
whom he had been converted to the belief of Christianity. And 
their appearance seems fully to warrant the conclusion, that they 
must have been erected prior to the introduction of the Saxon or 
Gothic architecture. The tower, whose sides form a square of 
about 20 feet each, and which is 108 in elevation, appears to have 
formed the centre of the erection. Its appendages were two 
wings, one to the east and the other to the west, the correspond- 
ing sides of the tower having at the bottom large doors or open- 
ings, by which the three divisions might, according to choice, form 
but one apartment. But even in this extended state, the dunen- 
sions of the church or chapel must have been but small, as its 
whole length would not much exceed 70 feet, while its breadth 
would vary from 14 to 20 feet. The walls of the apartment or 
chapel on the east of the tower have been put in a good state of 
repair; but the west wing has long been entirely destroyed. Yet 
from the traces of the roof on the side of the tower, and from what 
is understood to have been a representation of the fabric on the 
seals of the ancient charters connected with the priory, many of 
which still exist, the existence of the west wing at some former pe- 
riod seems to be incontrovertibly established. The chapel and

tower, which remain, are in good preservation, and, with a little at- 
tention, may be kept in that state for many centuries to come. 
The tower was covered, about fifty years ago, with a flat leaden 
roof, and a small staircase of stone was then also constructed with- 
in it, so that there is now access to the summit, from which there 
is an extensive and beautiful prospect when the weather is favour- 
able. 

The Cathedral, which was by far the most extensive of the reli- 
gious erections at St Andrews, is situated in the vicinity of St Re- 
gulus' tower. It was constructed in the form of a Latin cross, — 
the extreme length of the nave or principal part of the building 
being about 370 feet, and the breadth 72 feet, the thickness of 
the walls included, and the transept being in length 180 feet. The 
foundation of the building was laid in the year 1159, during the 
reign of Malcolm IV. who was present at the ceremony, but it was 
not finished until the reign of Robert Bruce, who was present at 
its consecration in 1318. About 160 years, consequently, elapsed 
between the dates of the two events. Fifty years after its conse- 
cration, a considerable part of the edifice was accidentally burnt, 
and after its reparation, the succeeding priors kept it in a proper 
state of repair, and some of them contributed materially both to its 
internal and its external decoration. At the period of the Refor- 
mation, the animosity subsisting between the Roman Catholics and 
the Protestants in Scotland was strong, and had led to an open 
warfare. The celebrated John Knox, the zealous supporter and 
champion of Protestantism, had for some time been resident at. St 
Andrews, and his public ministrations in this city and in the neigh- 
bouring towns had been attended by vast multitudes, who adhered 
to his views; and having expressed in his discourses the notion, that 
the destruction of the religious edifices might be one of the most 
effectual means of eradicating Popery, the heated multitude eager- 
ly imbibed the idea, and proceeded without delay to put it into 
execution. The religious edifices in St Andrews were accordingly 
assailed, and in a very few hours, what had been the labour of ages, 
was involved in ruin. When the. cathedral was entire, it had°six 
spires or turrets,— two at each of the extremities of the nave, one 
at the southern extremity of the transept, and one in the centre at 
the intersection of the nave and transept. The two turrets at the 
eastern extremity and one of the two at the western extremity still 
subsist, and rise to an elevation of about 100 feet; the other three 
have long been destroyed,— a small part of the pillars, on which the

central turret was erected, now alone remaining. But a small por- 
tion of the exterior wall of this once magnificent fabric is now in 
existence. The area within continued to be covered with a mass 
of rubbish until within these few years, when the Honourable the 
Barons of his Majesty's Exchequer directed it to be removed, and 
certain repairs to be executed, to promote the preservation of the 
ruins. The plan of the interior may now in consequence be tra- 
ced with considerable accuracy. Several flat tombstones with de- 
vices and inscriptions have been exposed, and what apparently 
must have been a well, about forty feet deep, though now without 
water. Nothing, however, of any material value was disclosed by 
the operation. 

In the vicinity of the cathedral, were the various buildings con- 
nected with the Priory or Augustine Monastery, which was found- 
ed during the reign of Alexander I., near the commencement of 
the twelfth century, by Robert, Bishop of St Andrews, and which 
ultimately accommodated no less than thirty-four conventual bre- 
thren, besides the necessary domestics. Martine states, that, at 
the period when his Reliquiae were composed, or about 150 years 
ago, some of these buildings were still entire ; and that of others 
considerable remains still existed. In the interval, however, which 
has elapsed since that period, a great change has taken place. 
Most of them have now entirely disappeared, the materials of which 
they were composed having been removed, and applied to various 
purposes. And as nearly the whole of the areas has been convert- 
ed into garden ground, even the site of several of them can now 
scarcely be ascertained. The original erections connected with 
this establishment appear to have been comparatively of a very 
limited description ; and as its wealth and its resources increased, 
the extent of its buildings was enlarged. At the commencement 
of the fifteenth century, they were so arranged as to form two 
courts, and James Bisset, the prior at that period, is represented 
as having paved both. In the days of Martine, so far as a judg- 
ment may be formed from his description, the plan of the buildings 
must have been very irregular. According to Boethius, this mo- 
nastery was excelled by none in Europe, either in respect to the 
extent of its accommodations, or to the beauty of its architecture. 
A considerable portion of what is denominated the abbey wall, 
which surrounded and enclosed the whole, is still in existence ; it 
appears to have been nearly half a mile in extent, about 4 feet m 
thickness, and '20 feet in height. It had originally sixteen towers 



ST ANDREWS. 



467 



or turrets, interspersed at irregular distances, projecting outward 
several feet, and rising a few feet higher than the general level of 
the wall. It was erected by John Hepburn, the prior, soon after 
the commencement of the sixteenth century. There were three 
gates by which the enclosure might be entered, which, from their 
remains, appear to have been handsome ; that, in particular, which 
is at the eastern extremity of the South Street of the city. 

The burying -ground for the city and parish was originally in 
the immediate vicinity of the parish church, but as the space al- 
lotted for the purpose wa§ confined, and in the heart of the city, it 
was with great propriety, soon after the Reformation, transferred 
to the vicinity of the cathedral, where it still continues. Many of 
the monuments which are to be found in this cemetery possess con- 
siderable interest ; but none of them are of a date so old as the 
era of the Reformation. 

The Castle of St Andrews is situated about 250 yards to the 
north-west of the cathedral, on an eminence immediately overhang- 
ing the sea. It was first erected about the beginning of the thir- 
teenth century, by the bishop of that period, as a place of residence 
for himself and his successors in office. After standing nearly a 
century and a half, it fell into the hands of the English, and was 
subsequently besieged, taken, and demolished by the Scottish 
forces. It lay in ruins for half a century, during which period the 
bishop resided within the monastery, and it was rebuilt by Bishop 
Trail near the close of the fourteenth century It is affirmed that 
James III., King of Scotland, was born in it in 1460. After the 
murder of Cardinal Beaton, and the subsequent siege, it was dis- 
mantled to a considerable extent ; but the injury was in a great 
measure repaired, a few years afterwards, by Archbishop Hamil- 
ton, and it was occasionally occupied by succeeding archbishops 
until the period of the civil wars, when it became uninhabitable ; 
and the priory having been annexed to the archbishoprick in 1633, 
the prelates who held the see after the Restoration, resided within 
the monastery in the building denominated the New Inns. The 
castle, when entire, formed a quadrangle, with a court in the inte- 
rior of considerable dimensions. But, with the exception of a part 
of the south wall, including a handsome square tower, and a few 
other fragments, it is entirely in ruins. The sea, within these few 
years, has made considerable encroachments on the east wing ; and 
the northern division will probably ere long share the same fate. 

In addition to the monastery of the Augustines, which was rich- 



468 



FIFESIIIIIE. 



ly endowed, there were at St Andrews two convents for friars of 
the mendicant orders. The one of these belonged to the Gray 
Friars, denominated also Franciscans or Minorites, and was situat- 
ed immediately without the west port of the North Street of the city. 
It was founded by Bishop Kennedy about the middle of the fifteenth 
century, and it became the noviciate of the order in Scotland : it was 
demolished at the Reformation ; and the ruins and grounds connect- 
ed with them were conveyed by a charter from Queen Mary to the 
provost and magistrates of the city for the benefit of the commu- 
nity, and are still in their possession. A handsome street or row, 
consisting of houses of considerable magnitude, and erected accord- 
ing to a regular plan, has been projected by the magistrates and 
council, to occupy the grounds of this monastery. Several of the 
houses have already been erected, and several more are to be erect- 
ed next season. This street, when finished, will tend materially 
to the embelHshment of the city, and it will form a very convenient 
line of communication between the North and Market Streets. It 
has been proposed that this street should be continued in a south- 
erly direction, so as to meet the south or principal street of the 
city; and although the arrangements for this purpose have not yet 
been effected, it is highly probable that, in a few years, this part 
of the plan will also be put into execution. It has been named 
Bell Street, in memory of the founder of the Madras College; and 
if it be continued southward, that beautiful erection will form its 
southern termination. The other convent, which was situated on 
the south side of the South Street, belonged to the Black or Pre- 
dicant Friars, denominated also Dominicans. It was founded by 
Bishop Wishart in 1274. It was demolished at the Reformation, 
with the exception of the chapel, the dimensions of which are very 
limited, but the architecture is in a rich Gothic style. A part of the 
arched stone roof has given way ; but Dr Bell, in his trust-deed re- 
lative to the Madras College, within whose grounds it is now situat- 
ed, has made provision for its being kept in a proper state of repair. 

The Kirkheuch or Kirkhill, was a collegiate church, having at- 
tached to it a provost and ten prebendaries. It appears to have 
belonged originally to the Culdees, who at an early period were 
held in so high estimation, that Constantino III., after resigning 
his crown, became abbot of the order. Its first site appears to 
have been a rock, a little beyond the entrance of the present har- 
bour; but the encroachments of the sea having rendered it neces- 



ST ANDUKWS. 469 

sary to abandon this position, it was removed to the elevated ground 
west from the harbour, where a small fragment of its ruins may still 
be traced. Fordun states, that it was erected by Constantine II, 
soon after the middle of the ninth century ; but others contend that 
it was founded by the Macduffs, Earls of Fife. It was suppressed 
at the Reformation, and its revenues were appropriated to various 
purposes. 

At the general assumption of the rents of the church benefices 
in Scotland in 1561, for the purpose of establishing a fund for the 
support of the ministry and of the Queen's household, the following 
statement of the benefices of St Andrews was drawn up and pre- 
sented to the proper functionaries; the modern value is annexed:

4. The Archdeanery of St Andrews, let in tack for L. 600. 

5. Of the vicarage of St Andrews no rental of that date has 
been discovered; but in the year 1656, the minister of the recent- 
ly erected parish of Cameron, to whom the vicarage of St Andrews 
had been assigned by act of Parliament as a stipend, raised an ac- 
tion in the Commissary Court against the whole of the landed pro- 
prietors of the original parish of St Andrews, for the purpose of 
ascertaining the amount of the vicarage teind. He obtained in 
consequence a sentence in his favour, and the followinff statement 
exhibits the amount of the several articles comprehended in the 
decree, with the value affixed to each in Scottish money, viz.

The vicarage teind was afterwards subjected to a process of va- 
luation, and instead of the large sum above-specified, amounting 
to L.337, 12s. 2d. Sterhng, it was fixed at L. 20, 14s. 5d. Ster- 
ling, only, which the minister of Cameron continues to receive. 

The Trinitij or Parochial Church of the city was originally erect- 
ted by Bishop Turgot, about the beginning of the twelfth century. 
Prior to the Reformation, it had a large establishment of chaplains 
and chorists, who officiated in the several chapels which were within 
its precincts. From a charter dated 1475, it appears that they 
then amounted to thirty of the former denomination and fifteen of 
the latter. They were supported, partly at least, by small annual 
payments due to them from the different tenements within the city. 
At the Reformation they were suppressed, and their revenues were 
transferred by a gift from Queen Mary to the common funds of 
the city. This church became the Archbishop's cathedral after 
the Reformation, the large cathedral being then demolished. It 
was thoroughly repaired in 1798, the expense being defrayed by 
the city, the heritors of the parish, and the Crown, in place of the 
Archbishop. It now consists of a nave 136 feet long by 57 broad, 
and an aisle 441 feet by 28 within the walls. It is seated so as 
to accommodate 2200 hearers. In the aisle, is a fine monument, 
erected to the memory of Archbishop Sharp, a few years after his 
murder. The ancient tower and spire of the church still remain, 
but a fine old bell, which had hung in it for centuries, and whose 
inscription bore that it had been cast by order of David Lear- 
mounth, Provost of the city, in honour of the Holy Trinity, in the 
year 1108, was inconsiderately removed, to make way for others of 
a more modern date. 

Some centuries ago, the city was fortified; and more than once 
the citizens were subjected to the hardships and privations of a 
siege. Scarcely a vestige, however, of the city walls now remain, 
the port or gate excepted at the western extremity of the South 
Street, which has a handsome appearance, and is kept in a good 
state of repair. The city arms, indeed, above the centre of the 
arch, are nearly effaced, in consequence of the wasting of the stone 
by the weather, and would require to be renewed. 

The Toxon-House is very inconveniently situated in the centre 



ST ANDREWS. 



471 



of the Market Street, in the vicinity of the spot where the cross for- 
merly stood. A few years ago, having fallen into disrepair, a con- 
venient piece of ground was purchased for the purpose of a new 
erection ; but as the city funds were deemed to be inadequate for 
the undertaking, the eld fabric was repaired and enlarged, and it 
is now sufficiently commodious for the purposes for which it is re- 
quired. 

Modern Buildings. — Handsome Chapels, for the use of the Epis- 
copalians, and for those who are connected with the United Asso- 
ciate Synod, have been erected within these few years. The flour 
mills belonging to the Incorporation of Bakers have been lately re- 
built at considerable expense. A sjinning-mill has been in opera- 
tion since 1823, its machinery being moved by steam. Thirty years 
ago, there was a manufactory of sail-cloth of a superior quality, 
but it was afterwards abandoned, and has not been revived. 

III. — Population. 

No enumeration of the population of the parish has been discovered of an older date 
than that of Dr Webster in 1755, when the amount was 4690 
in 1793, it amounted to 3950 
1801, . . 4203 

1811, . . 4311 

1821, . • 4899 

1831, . 3621 

Of the last of these dates, 2520 were males, and 3101 females. 
The feuing of a considerable portion of ground at the village of 
Strathkinness, for the purposes of erecting houses, has contributed 
materially to the increase of population in the country district of 
the parish. The city has also considerably enlarged its bounda- 
ries, by modern erections at its south-east and north-west extremi- 
ties, and by the filling up of a number of blanks in the streets and 
lanes. The number of families who resort to St Andrews for the 
purpose of education, or as a place where they may enjoy agree- 
able society and the necessaries of life at a moderate expense, has 
also materially increased.

There seems to be no peculiarity in the strength, size, complex- 
ion, or other personal qualities of the inhabitants, to distinguish 
them from their neighbours. The number of insane and fatuous 
persons is 13, of bUnd 5, of deaf and dumb 4, 

The language which is generally employed by the labouring 
classes, is the Fifan dialect. Among the higher classes, the English 
language is spoken. There is no popular custom that can be said 
to be peculiar to the district; but there is a gaihe of skill, which 
has for centuries formed a favourite amusement at St Andrews, 
viz. the game of golf. For the prosecution of this amusement, a 
considerable range of ground is requisite, with a short herbage. 
Both these requisites, the links or downs to the north-west of the 
city supplv. And the inequalities of surface which the course 
presents, instead of being regarded as disadvantageous, tends mate- 
rially to increase the interest of the game, and to promote the de- 
velopement of the skill of the several competitors. The course 
for this game is divided into a number of stages from 200 to 500 
yards distant from each other. At the termination of each, a hole, 
about five inches in diameter and several inches deep, is formed, 
and the object of the competitors is to drive the ball they employ 
from station to station, landirig it ultimately in the holes, with the 
fewest number of strokes. For this purpose, clubs of a variety ot 
shapes are employed, according to the nature of the position m 
which the ball may be found after the several strokes. Nearly 
eighty years ago, a number of gentlemen in St Andrews and its 
vicinity formed themselves into an association for the purpose of 
promoting the cultivation of this very interesting and healthy 
amusement. This club has now a muster roll of from 300 to 400 
members. King William IV., who, before his accession to the 
Crown, was Duke of St Andrews, has signified his acceptance of 
the office of patron of the club, and has lately sent a spletidid gold 
medal, to be competed for annually, and to be held for the year 
by the winner. 

The majority of the people appear, on the whole, to enjoy in a 
reasonable degree the comforts and advantages of society. But 
there are many individuals and families who have both the ability 
and the inclination to exert themselves, but who, in consequence

of existing circumstances, cannot obtain an adequate remuneration 
for their labour. Many females who formerly had their depend- 
ence on the produce of the spinning-wheel, have, in consequence 
of the very extensive introduction of spinning machinery, and the 
low rate of wages for spinning, been thrown in a great measure 
idle. The very reduced remuneration, also, which, for a number 
of years, the manufacturers received for the produce of their la- 
bours, has reduced many of them who have families to a state 
bordering upon destitution. In such circumstances, it can scarce- 
ly be regarded as matter of surprise, that many are far from be- 
ing content with their situation, and that they are anxious for 
changes by which their condition may be improved. 

The bulk of the parishioners are characterized by their regard 
for the interests of morality, and by their attachment to the cause 
of religion. And if there are individuals of an opposite character, 
their numbei" does not seem to exceed the average of individuals 
of a corresponding description in other districts of the country. 

Poaching in game is practised to a limited extent. Smuggling 
was formerly carried on on an extensive scale ; but for manj years 
past, the severity of the laws against this species of traffic, and the 
strictness of the precautions which are employed to guard against 
its prevalence, have almost completely put an end to the demora- 
lizing practice. Pawnbroking is unknown in this district of the 
country. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of standard imperial acres in the 
parish, which are either cultivated or are occasionally in tillage, is 
about 9844. The number of acres which have never been cultivated, 
and which are waste, or in pasture, is about 544, The number 
of acres, that, with a profitable application of capital, might be 
added to the cultivated land, is very considerable, — the high prices 
which were obtained for grain from 1804 to 1814, having induced 
the cultivator to bring into tillage almost every acre that was fit 
for the plough. The lands that were at one period in a state of 
commonty, were all divided, many years ago, among the conter- 
minous proprietors, according to the extent of their several claims. 
The number of acres under wood, all of which have been planted, 
is 345. The plantations seem in general to be under judicious 
management. 

Rent.—T\ie average rent of arable land in the parish is L. 1, 
17s. 6d. per imperial acre. No grazing of sheep or cattle per 
capita prevails in this district.

Rate of Wages. — Farm-labourers when hired by the year re- 
ceive from L. 10 to L. 12 Sterling, with 6 bolls of oatmeal, each 
140 imperial pounds in weight, and Is. weekly for milk. The 
foreman, as he is denominated, who has a species of authority over 
the other farm-servants, and who is in some measure responsible 
for the proper execution of the farming operations, receives from 
L. 2 to L. 10 more than the others. Female servants hired by 
the year receive from L. 5 to L. 7. Labourers engaged by the 
day, receive in summer from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d., and in winter, from 
Is. 2d. to Is. 4d. daily, the labourers furnishing their own victuals. 
Married farm-servants are, in many instances, allowed the use of a 
cow, and when this is the case, they receive only about L. 7 of 
wages. They have in addition to their meal, however, an allow- 
ance of ground on the farm, sufficient for sowing a peck of lintseed, 
and for planting from 1 cwt. to 2 cwt. of potatoes. The black- 
smith in general charges the farmer for each article furnished 
by him, but a practice has been lately introduced, of allowing 
him at the rate of L. 2 Sterling annually, for each pair of horses 
employed on the farm. For this allowance, he furnishes shoes 
for the horses, and keeps the various agricultural implements in 
a proper state of repair. 

Live-Stoch. — In former times, a breed of cattle was very gene- 
rally reared in the county, denominated the Fife breed. This is 
still to be found in the district, and some of the agriculturists are 
of opinion, that it is better adapted to the soil and cHmate than 
any other variety of the species. A number of other varieties, 
however, have been introduced, so that the breed of cattle now 
to be found in the district is of a mongrel description. But few 
sheep were for many years reared or pastured in the parish ; of 
late, they have become more abundant, and are either of the High- 
land or Cheviot breeds. The character of the husbandry of the 
district is good, and does not appear to be susceptible of many al- 
terations, that would prove useful and profitable. 

About 55 acres of ground contiguous to the estuary of the 
Eden, which formed a part of that estuary, or were apt to be over- 
flowed at stream tides, have at two different periods been secured 
by expensive embankments, and the acquisitions are now in a 
state of productive tillage. Apian was, at one period, under con- 
sideration, of securing a much larger extent of the estuary, but 
the proprietors interested in the undertaking were doubtful whether 
the new acquisition would have remunerated them for the expense 

4 



ST ANDREWS. 



475 



that would have been incurred, and the scheme was in consequence 
abandoned. The agriculturists in the district seem to be fully 
aware of the advantages attendant on draining, and considerable 
sums have been expended by them for securing its object, wherever 
it was required. Irrigation has never been practised in the dis- 
trict. 

Leases, Sfc. — Nineteen years is the usual term of endurance of 
leases. This is regarded as a proper period both for the landlord 
and tenant. The lands, however, which are in the vicinity of the 
city, and which are let in small allotments chiefly to the citizens, 
have generally a shorter term of lease, varying from nine to thirteen 
years. The farm-buildings in general correspond with the size 
of the farms, and are kept in a proper state of repair. Almost 
the whole of the parish is better adapted for tillage than for pas- 
ture, and a large proportion of it is in consequence unenclosed. 
And even where fences have been erected, they are in many 
cases of a slight and a defective quality. No remarkable improve- 
ments in agriculture have lately been introduced into the district, 
either by the agriculturists at large, or by any particular individu- 
al, and no obstacles to improvement seem at present to exist. 

Quarries mid Mines. — Quarries of excellent free or sandstone, 
well adapted for building operations, are wrought at Nydie Hill, 
and at Strathkinness, near the western extremity of the parish. 
The stones of most of the buildings in St Andrews and its vici- 
nity have been supplied from this source ; and the materials 
which they furnish are held in so high estimation, that they are 
conveyed to considerable distances, sometimes even beyond the 
limits of the county. From Nydie Hill quarry, blocks of a very 
large size may be readily obtained. Quarries of whinstone have 
also been opened in different places, chiefly for the purpose of 
procuring materials for the public roads, and the streets of the 
city. No mines are at present wrought, but it is understood that 
coal, though of an inferior quality, might be procured at Denhead, 
near the south-west extremity of the parish. 

Fisheries. — A salmon-fishery has long been established in the 
Eden, as far as the tide extends, but the produce is inconsiderable 
both in extent and value. The town-council of the city have, for 
a number of years, disposed of their right to take salmon on the 
east and west sands, and stake-nets have in consequence been 
erected ; but their success has failed to realize the expectations of 
the tacksmen, and their erections are liable to be demolished by 



476

the heavy seas, brought into the bay, by an easterly or north-east- 
erly gale. The rent yielded is about L. 7 Sterling. A number 
of families in the city gain their livelihood from the open sea fish- 
ery. They have several fishing boats, by which they provide for 
the home market during ten months of the year ; and during the 
other two months, the bulk of them are usually employed at the 
herring fishery on the coast of Caithness. The produce of their 
labour while they are at home, is not entirely consumed within 
the city, but a part of it is regularly transmitted to Cupar, the 
county town, and a part of it is appropriated to the supply of the 
vicinity. The principal varieties of fish which they produce in 
the market, are the haddock, cod, ling, skate, halibut, and flound- 
er. When the wind blows fresh from the east or north -east, there 
is in general so heavy a surf along the coast, that the boats cannot 
venture beyond the limits of the harbour. Hence the citizens are 
frequently, for many days together, without any supplies from 
their own fishermen, and have then to rely on supplies from the 
fishing stations on the south coast of the county. Durmg the 
stormy season, the fishing apparatus which is left m the sea, is ex- 
posed to injury, nay even, in many cases, to utter destruction, and 
the vicissitudes of the weather are then so sudden that the fisher- 
men themselves are often unexpectedly exposed to the greatest 

danger. j • j 

Produce.— average amount and value of raw produce raised

Manvfactnres.-o\vge manufacturing establishment exists in 
the parish. The labour of the tradesmen is chiefly required for 
articles of home consumption. The weaving of linen is carried on 
to a considerable extent, indeed, in detached premises ; but his is 
dependent not on the resources of manufacturers resident in the lo- 
calitY, but on the capital of the Kirkland establishment near Le- 
ven or on the commercial enterprise of Dundee. The manufac- 
ture' of golf balls has long been carried on here, to a considerable 
extent Above 10,000 are made annually. A good workman can

477 



make from 50 to 60 a-week. Nearly one-half of the product is re- 
quired for the use of the cultivators of the amusement in St An- 
drews. A market for the remainder is found in other places. 
Some have been sent as far as Calcutta and Madras. When trade 
is flourishing, the several branches afford a fair remuneration to 
such as are employed in them ; but there have been times of de- 
pression, when even with the strictest economy, the craftsmen 
could scarcely secure, from the fruits of their industry, the neces- 
saries of life for themselves and their families ; and when it was 
necessary for the more favoured classes to come forward to their 
assistance. 

Navigation. — There is but one sea port in the parish, viz. that 
of St Andrews. The number of vessels at present connected with 
the port is fourteen. They are all of a small size, as the harbour 
does not admit vessels of a large burden. Their whole amount of 
tonnage does not exceed 680 tons register of old measure. The 
only foreign vessels which visit the harbour are from Norway or 
the Baltic, freighted with timber. But these, when they exceed 
100 tons in burden, or draw more than 14 feet of water, are 
under the necessity of discharging a part of their cargo before they 
can attempt to enter the harbour; and even this can be done with 
safety, only at stream-tides. The estuary of the Eden, when the 
tide is nearly full, is navigable to about two miles from its entrance. 
And an extensive distillery being situated on its margin at this dis- 
tance from the sea, vessels may frequently be seen navigating the 
estuary, loaded with coals and grain for its use, and conveving its 
produce to a distant market. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

City. — According to Martine, Robert, Bishop of St Andrews, ob- 
tained for the city the liberties of a burgh royal,Ty consent of David 
I. about the year 1140. Malcolm IV., the grandson and successor 
of David, confirmed this erection, and the original charter granted 
by this monarch is still preserved in the city charter chest. It is 
in Latin, written in a neat small hand, on a slip of parchment, some- 
what smaller in dimensions than a common playing card. It is ex- 
pressed so briefly, that it consists only of fifty-two words, exclusive 
of the names and designations of five witnesses. A fac-simile of 
this charter is here presented. 

Prior to the Reformation, the city must have been much more 
important and populous, than it afterwards became. But no docu- 
ment has been discovered, by which the amount of its inhabitants 
at that period can be ascertained.

The city functionaries consist of a provost, four bailies, a dean 
of guild, and a treasurer ; and the town-council consists of these 
office-bearers, and twenty-two councillors. Before the passing of the 
late Burgh Reform Bill, the dean of guild ranked next to the pro- 
vost, and presided at the meetings of the council in his absence ; 
but since that period, the bailies have acquired the precedency. 
The latter hold courts from time to time, in which matters of liti- 
gation with citizens are determined, and in which also delinquen- 
cies are investigated, and a judgment on them pronounced. The 
council have under their management the revenues of the city, 
which amount to above L. 1300 Sterling a-year, but there is a debt 
affecting them, which amounts to nearly L. 5000. In addition to 
this they have since 1831, in consequence of a clause of Dr Bell's 
trust-deed, been invested with the disbursement of the interest of 
L. 9798, 13s. 4d. of 3 per cent, government annuities, destined 
for the purpose of promoting the moral and religious improvement 
of the community, and for such other useful and permanent works 
connected with the city, as might be judged most eligible ; under 
the superintendence, however, and with the approbation of the 
Lord Lieutenant of the county of Fife, and the Trustees of the Ma- 
dras College. 

Markets, c— St Andrews is the only market-town in the parish. 
It has three fairs annually, besides a weekly market for the sale of 
grain, which is held on Monday, and a market twice a-week, viz. 
Wednesday and Saturday, for butter, poultry, eggs, vegetables, 
&amp;c. There is a post-office in the city, which has a daily commu- 
nication with Dundee and Edinburgh. The length of the turn- 
pike roads in the parish is about twenty miles, and of the roads sup- 
ported by the statute labour, six to eight miles. The bridges are 
kept in a good state of repair. The only one deserving of particu- 
lar notice is the Guard or Gair Bridge, which affords a passage 
across the Eden, at the point where the roads from Dundee and 
Cupar to St Andrews meet. It was constructed four centuries ago, 
by Bishop Wardlaw, the founder of the University. It consists of 
six arches, and the only inconvenience attending it is its narrow- 
ness, which is such as not to admit of two carriages passing each 
other. There are no canals nor railroads in the parish. 

Harbour. — The harbour is merely what is denominated a tide- 
harbour ; it is dry at low water, with the exception of a small stream, 
which runs through it. There is in general a sand bar at its 
mouth, which prevents large vessels from finding admittance. To 
remedy as far as possible this inconvenience, a flood-gate has been 



ST ANDREWS. 



479 



constructed near the centre of the harbour, for the purpose of re- 
tainino- the water in the upper division, till the tide has retired, 
when it is opened, and the water escapes in a torrent, carrying 
along with it a portion of the sand which may have accumulated at 
the bar. But even with this auxiliary the harbour is still defective, 
and it does not appear to be susceptible of any material additional 
improvement, unless at an expense far beyond what the funds of the 
city can afford. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is in a central situation, 
being nearly at an equal distance between the two extremities of 
the parish. But there is a population of nearly 1000 individuals 
in the western division, who are situated between two and a-half and 
five miles from the parish church, and for whose accommodation, 
it would be highly desirable to have a church and a minister. 
And in the eastern division, there is a population of nearly 200, 
most of whom are four miles from the parish church, while they 
are not more than the half of that distance from the church of 
Kingsbarns. 

The pai'ish church, which was originally erected about the com- 
mencement of the twelfth century, obtained a thorough repair in 
1798, and is at present in a good condition. It is seated for about 
2200. There are, however, no free sittings, the whole having 
been divided by the Sheriff of the county, under the sanction of 
the Court of Session, between the city and the landed proprietors. 
A considerable proportion of the city's allotment was disposed of 
to the several corporate bodies within its limits, for the accom- 
modation of the members of these corporations and their families. 
And the remainder was let every third year, by the city function- 
aries, to such of the inhabitants as required church accommoda- 
tion, and the revenue thus obtained was added to. the city funds. 
Several of the corporate trades have lately sold their allotments 
of the seating, which now belong to private individuals. The size 
and form of the church render it very unfavourable both for the 
speaker and for many of the hearers. It has been ascertained 
that there are nearly 500 sittings so situate, that the occupants 
cannot distinctly hear what is uttered in the pulpit by any ordinary 
speaker, and that in many of them they cannot even see the offi- 
ciatmg mmister. Hence, these pews are in general but thinly oc- 
cupied, and many of them stand almost perpetually empty. A 

A handsome preaching station, which serves also for a school-house, has lately- 
been erected in the village of Strathkinness, which is central for this district of the 
parish.

plan has been suggested of secluding a number of them from the 
church by partitions, which would greatly improve it, with but lit- 
tle detriment to any individual. And it has been also suggested, 
that further curtailments should bcv made upon the church, and 
that, to meet the wants of the population, an additional church 
should be erected within the city, which might either be supplied 
by the ministers alternately, or by one of them officiating regularly 
to the new congregation. It seems to be not improbable, that 
this suggestion may ere long be realized, as urgent applications are 
frequently made for church accommodation, by persons who are 
anxious to obtain it, but who are in general under the necessity 
of waiting for a considerable period, before they can secure it in 
an eligible situation. And numbers, who have been unable to 
obtain such accommodation, have been induced to apply pr it, 
either in the church of St Leonards or in the dissenting chapels, 
where it could be obtained. 

No manse has been erected for the use of either of the minis- 
ters. It seems to be understood, however, that the first minister 
would be found entitled to a manse and offices, were he to apply 
for them in a regular form. He already possesses a glebe, con- 
sisting of four acres, in the immediate vicinity of the city, which is 
let to a tenant for a rent of L. 23 a year ; and connected with it he 
has a small garden. The stipend of the first minister amounts to 
22 chalders from the teinds of the parish, and he enjoys, besides, 
the half of the emoluments of the archdeaconry, which add to it 
about 6 chalders. He has also an allowance of L. 20 Sterling 
for communion elements. The second charge was established in 
1589. The incumbent has no manse nor glebe. His stipend 
consisted, until within these few years, of L. 72, 4s. 5d. from the 
city funds, and the half of the archdeaconry, which amounts to 
about 107 bolls of grain, and L. 3 Sterling. He is also entitled 
to the teind of the fish caught by the fishermen within the city. 
But those who follow this profession are in general so much op- 
pressed with poverty, that for the last twenty-years he has not 
exacted from them one farthing. It was decided by the commis- 
sioners of teinds, after an expensive litigation, that he has no claim 
on the teinds of the parish, so that when the late parliamentary 
grant 5th Geo. IV. ch. 72. was made in favours of the small 
livings in Scotland, he found it advisable to make the necessary 
application for the benefit of that endowment, and the income of 
the office had an addition made to it of L. 33, 10s. 5d., to raise it 
to the minimum rate, including an allowance for a manse and 



ST ANDREWS. 



481 



glebe ; and L. 8, 6s. 8d. were assigned to him annually for com- 
munion elements. 

No chapel of ease nor Government church exists at present in 
the parish, and no missionary nor catechist was employed within its 
precincts until 1834, when an experienced licentiate of the Church 
of Scotland was engaged to act as a preacher, to conduct public 
worship at one or other of the villages of Strathkinness, Boarhills, 
or Kincaple, on the Sundays, and also to act as a catechist, in the 
city and villages, both on Sundays and ordinary week days. His 
salary of L- 52, 12s. a-year, was afforded him the first year by the 
first minister ; and since that period, the latter has contributed the 
half only of the salary, and certain of the heritors and parishioners 
the remainder. 

There are four Dissenting chapels in the parish, three of which 
are in the city, and one at the village of Strathkinness, one of the 
former being Episcopalian. The ministers of these chapels de- 
rive their incomes from the seat rents, and from the collections 
which are made at their doors, when the several congregations as- 
semble for public worship. It is understood that they vary in 
amount from L. 70 to L. 100 Sterling a year. Between an eighth 
and a ninth part of the population of the parish are dissenters from 
the Established Church of Scotland, and have connected them- 
selves with these chapels. The remaining part of the population, 
the few excepted who have no religious profession, adhere to the 
Established Church. One family of Roman Cathohcs only re- 
sides in the parish ; the father is in the preventive service, and was 
stationed here only about a year and a half ago. There are two 
other individuals of that persuasion in the parish, and the whole 
are natives of Ireland. Divine service, both in the parish church 
and in the chapels, is generally well attended. The average num- 
ber of communicants at the dispensation of the sacrament of the 
Lord's Supper in the parish church for the last ten or twelve years 
IS about 2030. But from an investigation which took place in 
1836, it appeared that there were 2490 individuals in the parish 
who were in communion with the establishment, although, in con- 
sequence of age and infirmities, the great distance of many of them 
from the church, and the necessity of having a proper person to 
watch over many of the families on the communion Sabbath, near- 
ly a fifth of the whole were absent when that service was perform- 
ed. It was at the same time ascertained, that the number of the 
parishioners who were in communion with the various denomina- 

FIFE.

tions of Dissenters amounted to 344, while the whole number of 
Dissenters was 697. Of this number 328 were in connection with 
the United Associate Synod, 150 with the Original Burghers, 
108 with the Episcopalians, and 111 with the Independents. 

A Bible Society and a Missionanj Society have been established 
in the city for many years. The annual amount of their contri- 
butions is about L. 30, and the annual average of church collec- 
tions for religious purposes is nearly to the same amount. 

Education.— Vnov to the year 1834, there were in the parish 
seventeen schools, but strictly speaking no parochial school exist- 
ed among the number, its place being supplied by the burgh 
school, so that the heritors of the parish were not burdened with 
the payment of a schoolmaster's salary. Two of the schools in 
the city, viz. the English and grammar schools, had hitherto been 
supported in part by endowment from the common funds of the 
city. And two of the schools in the country districts have each a 
small house, garden, and salary attached to them, and one of them 
viz. that of Strathkinness, has, in addition to these, six acres of 
arable ground, which were allotted to it many years ago, on the 
division of a commonty among the conterminous heritors. The 
others were dependent entirely on the school-fees. In some of 
them, the reading of English was the only branch taught, in others 
there were combined with it writing and arithmetic. In the gram- 
mar-school, the master confined himself to the teaching of Latm 
and Greek. The school fees varied considerably in the different 
schools. In some, they were as low as 2s. a quarter. In the burgh 
English school, the highest charge did not exceed L. 1 a year ; 
and in the grammar-school it was fixed at L. 2, 2s. 

The Madras College.— \n May 1831, the Rev. Dr Andrew 
Bell, one of the prebendaries of Westminster, the deviser of the 
Madras or national system of education, and a native of St An- 
drews, transferred into the joint names of the provost of the city 
of St Andrews, the two ministers of the parish, and the Professor 
of Greek in the University, two several sums of L. 60,000, three 
per cent, reduced annuities, and L. 60,000 three per cent, consols, 
for purposes connected with education, to be afterwards more ful- 
ly detailed. And about two months afterwards, he and the said 
parties as trustees, executed a declaration of trusts, relative to the 
appropriation of the said sums, in which it is narrated, that as the 
procrress of the Madras System of Education had been but slow 
andimperfect in his native country of Scotland, he, the munifi-

cent donor, entertained the idea that the greatest boon he could 
confer upon it was to adopt measures for the more effectual diffu- 
sion of the said system within its limits ; and that, for promoting 
this object, one-twelfth share of the sums so transferred, after set- 
ting apart a specified sum to defray all expenses, should be trans- 
ferred by the trustees to the provost, magistrates, and town-coun- 
cil of each of the five cities or towns, viz. Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
Leith, Aberdeen, and Inverness, on the condition that it should 
be held by them and their successors in office for ever, and that 
the annual produce thereof should be employed in founding and 
maintaining schools in each of the said towns, for the instruction 
of child ren in the ordinary branches of education, upon the sys- 
tem of mutual instruction and moral discipline exemplified in the 
Madras school. That a twelfth share should be transferred to the 
trustees of the Royal Naval School, established for the education 
of children of officers in the navy, on the same condition and for 
the same purpose. That another twelfth share should be trans- 
ferred to the provost, magistrates, and town-council of St An- 
drews, so as to become a permanent fund for the moral and reli- 
gious improvement of the city; and for such other useful and per- 
manent works within the city as might be judged most eligible. 
And that the remaining five shares should continue to be vested 
in the four said trustees and their successors in office, substituting, 
however, the Sheriff-Depute of Fife for the Professor of Greek after 
the death of the present incumbent, for the purpose of erecting a 
college on a small field previously purchased by Dr Bell within 
the city, with appropriate houses for masters, monitors, and ser- 
vants, and with gardens, shrubbery, and play-ground, to be desig- 
nated the Madras College of St Andrews. It was further provid- 
ed, that the trustees should not expend more than the half of the 
sum which remained in their hands in the erection of the neces- 
sary buildings, and that the annual income of the remainder should 
be applied to the maintenance of the said college, and to the es- 
tablishment of eight bursaries in the United College, to be held 
by such only as had previously been educated at the Madras Col- 
lege for the space of three years. The Lord Lieutenant of the 
county of Fife, the Lord Justice- Clerk of Scotland, and the Reve- 
rend the Episcopal Bishop of Edinburgh are nominated patrons 
and visitors of the College, and have intimated their acceptance of 
the nomination ; and the trustees for their own exoneration have ob- 
tained the consent of three gentlemen residing in the neighbourhood,

viz. Sir Ralph Anstruther, of Balcaskie, Baronet; David Mony- 
penny, Esq. of PitmiUie ; and David Wemyss, Esq. of Denbrae, 
to undertake the task of auditing their accounts. 
- With this new seminary, the Enghsh and grammar schools of 
the city are now incorjoorated, with the salaries attached to them; 
and the nomination of the masters is vested in the trustees, after 
a proper trial and examination of the candidates, the patrons hav- 
ing a veto in the nomination. The trustees are directed also to 
exact from the children educated in the said college, such fees 
only, as it shall appear to them that the parents of such children 
are able to pay without nauch inconvenience ; and that those chil- 
dren whose parents are imable to pay any such fees shall be edu- 
cated gratis. They are directed also to inspect and to examine 
the said college every three months, that they may ascertain the 
progress of the scholars ; and to have a public examination of them 
annually. 

The buildings devoted to the purposes of tuition in the Madras 
College are now completed. They form a quadrangle, with a 
court within, which is surrounded by a handsome corridor, from 
which the class-rooms enter. The style of the building is that 
which prevailed in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. 
The plan, devised by William Burn, Esq. architect, Edinburgh, 
is such as might have been expected from his taste and talents ; 
and the execution of the work is highly creditable to the skill of 
our native artisans who were employed in the erection. Between 
this quadrangle and the street, there is an extensive area covered 
with gravel, where the pupils of the institution enjoy air and exer- 
cise ; and close to the street, and as remote from each other as 
the extent of the ground would admit, two commodious dwelling- 
houses, harmonizing in their architecture with the prmcipal budd- 
ing, have been erected for the use of the English and classical 
masters, who are thus furnished with the means of receiving each 
a considerable number of boarders. 

When the buildings were in a sufficient state of forwardness, 
the trustees proceeded, with the sanction of the patrons, to model 
the institution, so as most effectually, in their apprehension, to 
meet the object of the founder and the benefit of the community, 
and to put the whole into operation. It now January 1838 
comprehends teachers of the following branches: — 1. Of English 
and of English grammar, who is furnished with an assistant ; 2. of 
Greek and Latin, who has also an assistant ; 3. of arithmetic ; 



ST ANDREWS. 



485 



4. of mathematics and geography ; 5. of writing ; 6. of drawing ; 
7. of the French, German, and ItaUan languages; and, 8. of church 
music. 

The pupils connected with the English department are accom- 
modated in two large apartments, in the south division of the 
quadrangle. The classical teacher, with his pupils, occupies an 
elegant and spacious apartment in the northern division, while the 
teachers of arithmetic and writing occupy, respectively, the east and 
west divisions. In the trustees' room, there is a handsome marble 
bust of the founder, executed by Mr Joseph, London, which is re- 
garded as exhibiting a very accurate likeness of the original at the 
period when it passed through the hands of the artist. About 
150 children of the most indigent of the citizens are selected by 
the trustees to receive a gratuitous education. Those who can 
afford to pay for the education of their families have, for the or- 
dinary branches, a selection of two rates of fees, the one being 
double the amount of the other, — the same masters, however, su- 
perintending the whole. The higher rate is 2s. a quarter for 
English reading ; 2s. 6d. for reading and writing ; and 3s. for read- 
ing, Avriting, arithmetic, and English grammar. The fees in the 
other departments, viz. to the classical teacher, to the teacher of 
modern languages, drawing, and mathematics, are each 7s. 6d. a 
quarter, while the music master has only Is. a quarter from each 
of his pupils. In addition to their respective fees, the teachers 
of arithmetic, writing, and the modern languages have each an 
allowance of L. 50 a year from the funds of the college, and 
the music master L. 25. The English master has a salary of 
L. 25 annually from the funds of the city, and the classical mas- 
ter has L. 50 annually from the same source. 

The trustees have been most fortunate in the selection of teach- 
ers for this new institution ; and the beneficial consequences that 
were anticipated from it have been amply realized. St Andrews 
has long been regarded as a most eligible place for education in 
all its departments ; and the erection of the Madras College has 
contributed materially to increase its attractiveness. The follow- 
ing detail exhibits a statement of the number of pupils attending 
the several classes in May 1836, viz.— The English classes, 629; 
writing do. 447 ; drawing do. 30 ; arithmetic do. 360 ; mathema- 
tical do. 40 ; geography do. 43 ; Latin do. 95 ; Greek do. 50 ; 
church music do. 80. The total number of pupils attending the 
institution at this date was, on a careful scrutiny, found to be 798.

Dr Bell, the munificent benefactor of his country, and of his 
native city in particular, did not live to see his benevolent purposes 
carried into full operation. He died at Cheltenham in January 
1832, in the seventy-ninth year of his age, leaving the bulk of the 
residue of his fortune for the same valuable object, namely, the 
education of the young in Scotland, on the principles laid down in 
the printed manual, which details the particulars of his excellent 
system. 

Two Boarding Schools for young ladies, where day-scholars are 
also admitted from the families resident in the city, have long 
been established at St Andrews. In these, all the usual branches 
of education that are required for females in the higher ranks of 
life may be attained. Two other schools conducted by females 
at present exist ; and the number of pupils attending the whole of 
these seminaries is about 65. In addition to the Madras College, 
there are two schools in the city conducted by males, the number 
of whose scholars is 52 ; and in the schools established in the 
country districts of the parish, 220 young persons receive their 
education. The Sunday schools in the parish are attended by seve- 
ral hundreds. The people seem to be, in general, fully alive to the 
benefits resulting from a good education ; and as schools have been 
long established in the different districts of the parish, all have 
had the means within their reach of securing it for their children. 
There is, in consequence, scarcely an individual in the parish above 
the age of ten years, who cannot read, and but few who cannot also 
write. 

These details relative to the institutions connected with the 
elementary branches of education, naturally lead to a survey of 
the establishments with which St Andrews has been furnished for 
the acquisition of higher attainments in literature and science. 

The University of St Andrews. — This university was establish- 
ed in 1411, by Henry Wardlaw, Bishop of St Andrews. Prior to 
this period, the young men in Scotland, who aimed at the attain- 
ment of a more liberal education than the seminaries of the coun- 
try afforded, were under the necessity of repairing to foreign uni- 
versities and colleges. And as their removal thither was frequent- 
ly attended with much risk and inconvenience, the discerning part 
of the community were sensible of the advantages which the coun- 
try would derive from the establishment of an institution within its 
limits, where the higher branches of education, in science, phi- 
losophy, and theology, might be attained. Wardlaw, the eccle- 
siastical metropolitan of the kingdom, was one of the individuals 



ST ANDREWS. 



487 



who entertained these sentiments; and having ascertained that his 
Sovereign James I., at that period a prisoner in England, heartily 
approved of such an estabhshment, he determined, with the co- 
operation of some of the most enlightened of the ecclesiastics of 
his diocese, to erect an university at St Andrews. And the sanc- 
tion of the Pope being at that period regarded as necessary to le- 
galize such an establishment, he applied to Benedict XIII., who 
was recognized by the Scottish nation as the duly constituted head 
of the Church, who readily approved of the measure, and who 
sent him a bull, sanctioning and-confirming the new erection. By 
this charter, the bishop of the diocese was recognized as the chan- 
cellor of the university, authority being conveyed to him to confer 
degrees in theology, laws, medicine, and the arts. The funds at- 
tached to the institution were at first extremely limited ; but the 
individuals who were appointed to superintend the different de- 
partments of study, and who in general enjoyed endowments from 
other sources, were enthusiastic in the cause ; and although they 
received but httle remuneration for their labours, they persevered 
in their efforts, and attracted to their prelections multitudes of 
voung men from the several districts of the kingdom. At the head 
of the institution a rector was placed, of whom, by the charter of 
erection, it was required, as a necessary qualification, that he should 
be a graduate in one of the faculties, and that he should be in- 
vested with holy orders. 

St Salvator's College. — James Kennedy, the successor of Ward-, 
law in the discharge of the Episcopal functions at St Andrews, 
judging the scale of the original institution of the university to be 
too limited for the great concourse of students, prepared the way 
for its farther extension and improvement, by the erection of the 
College of St Salvator in 1455, with which he incorporated for 
an endowment the rectorial tithes of the parishes of Cults, Kem- 
back, Denino, and Kilmany, the three principal masters of the 
college, being constituted rectors of the three first enumerated 
parishes ; and the fruits of the last being reserved as a common 
fund, for the use and maintenance of all the founded persons, who 
were thirteen in number, together with their attendants and ser- 
vants. This erection was also sanctioned with the Pope's autho- 
rity, who bestowed on it the privilege of conferring degrees in the- 
ology and the arts. 

St Leonard's College. — In the year 1512, John Hepburn, Prior 
of the Augustinian Monastery at St Andrews, made an additional 



488 



FIl'ESHIRE. 



increase to tlie extent of the university, by the erection of St 
Leonard's College, which he endowed with the revenues of the 
hospital at St Andrews, which had formerly been appropriated to 
the reception of pilgrims, who repaired to this city for the pious 
purpose of viewing the relics of its tutelary saint. Twenty-five 
persons were to be supported by this new foundation, viz. a prin- 
cipal, four chaplains, two of them being regents, and twenty scho- 
lars. This erection was soon afterwards confirmed by the arch- 
bishop, and by the monarch of the country, James IV. 

St Marys College.— Ki the period of the erection of St Leon- 
ard's College, the buildings which had been appropriated to the 
use of the university after its first establishment, and which were 
denominated the Pedagogy, having fallen into great disrepair, and 
the slenderness of the funds connected with this part of the insti- 
tution having rendered it a matter of difficulty to procure the ser- 
vices of men properly qualified for conducting the education of the 
students, the archbishop, with the consent and concurrence of the 
prior and convent, formed the design of repairing or of rebuilding 
them, and of erecting them into a college with a suitable endow- 
ment ; but for reasons which have not been ascertained, the inten- 
tion was not then carried into execution. In 15.37, however, 
James Beaton, the archbishop, resolved to prosecute the plan which 
had been devised by his predecessor in office, and obtained the 
sanction of the Pope for the erection of a college on the site of 
the pedagogy, to be denominated St Mary's College. He was 
proceeding in the execution of the work, when its farther progress ' 
was arrested by his death. Cardinal Beaton, his successor in of- 
fice, continued the work, which, however, was far from being com- 
plete at the period of his murder. Archbishop Hamilton, who 
succeeded him, greatly enlarged the plan of the new erection, and 
completed the work. He assumed to himself also the title of 
founder of the college, to which, however, he continued the desig- 
nation which had been assigned to it by his predecessors. He in- 
tended it to be on a much larger scale than either of the other 
two colleges connected with the University, and that there should 
be maintained within its precincts a principal, eight professors, and 
twenty-four bursars in theology and philosophy, besides menial at- 
tendants. And for the maintenance of the establishment, he ap- 
propriated the tithes of the parishes of 1 annadice, Tynningham, 
Laurencekirk, Pert, Tarvet, and Craig. This erection was also 



ST ANDREWS 



489 



sanctioned by the Pope, who conferred on it the privilege of con- 
ferringf des'rees in the several faculties. 

From the monarchs of the country, the University and its col- 
leges experienced all due encouragement. They confirmed their 
several charters of erection, and they exempted the individuals 
connected with them, whether masters or students, together with 
their revenues, from all services and taxations, which might af- 
fect the other subjects who were resident within the kingdom. 

Soon after the Reformation, it was deemed to be expedient, that 
the University and its colleges should be modelled anew, so as 
that they might be accommodated to the change which had taken 
place in the religious establishment of the country ; and by an 
enactment of the Legislature in 1579, what is usually known by 
the name of Buchanans Reformation because the celebrated 
George Buchanan was one of the commissioners employed in 
drawing up the plan of the new arrangements, was carried into 
effect. By the provisions of this act, the colleges of St Salvator 
and St Leonard were to be restricted to the teaching of philoso- 
phy, and St Mary's was to be a seminary for theology only. In 
process of time, however, it was found, that the alterations which 
had thus been effected, had given rise to uncertainty on the part 
of the professors, relative to the sciences which they were required 
to teach, and to a consequent negligence in the discharge of their 
professional duties. To i-emedy this evil, a fresh enactment of the 
Legislature in 1621, ratified the first foundations of the three col- 
leges in all their heads, articles, and clauses, so far as was consist- 
ent with the state of the reformed religious establishment, and 
ordained the different members of the colleges to conform them- 
selves to the regulations therein specified, with the exception only, 
that the masters of St Mary's College should confine themselves 
to the teaching of divinity, as directed by the former Act of Par- 
liament. 

The three colleges, thus restored to their original foundations, 
continued to subsist until the year 1747, when, in consequence of 
the inadequacy of the provision for the principals and professors 
of the two philosophy colleges, an union of them, which had for 
some time been contemplated, was carried into eflect by an act of 
the British Parliament ratifying the measure, and embracing a de- 
tail of the regulations by which the future arrangements of the 
United College of St Salvator and St Leonard's were to be con- 
ducted. By this statute, the number of the endowments was con- 



490 



FIFESIIIRE. 



siderably curtailed. Instead of two principals and ten professors 
which formed the previous establishment of the two colleges, the 
United College was to have but one principal and eight profes- 
sors. 

No change in the constitution of the colleges has taken place 
since that period, and the United College has now a principal, 
who superintends the whole establishment, but who has hitherto 
been required to take no active share in conducting any of the 
particular departments of literature or science ; and Professors of 
Greek, Humanity or Latin, of Logic and Rhetoric, of Moral Philo- 
sophy, of Natural Philosophy, of Civil History, and of Medicine; the 
Professor of Moral Philosophy having also a class for political eco- 
nomy, and the Professor of Medicine a class for chemistry and 
chemical pharmacy. A few years ago, the college resolved to al- 
low a salary of L. 26, 5s. annually from their revenue to a lectur- 
er on natural history. A gentleman well qualified for the under- 
taking was selected for the office, and for several seasons fulfilled 
its duties with much credit to himself, and advantage to his pupils. 
But it was found, in the issue, that the number of students who 
were disposed to avail themselves of this new institution, was too 
limited to afford an adequate remuneration, and the labours of the 
lecturer were in consequence discontinued. In St Mary's Col- 
lege, there is a principal, who is also Primarius Professor of Theo- 
logy, and who is actively employed in conducting the department 
of systematic theology, a Professor of Divinity, who confines him- 
self chiefly to biblical criticism, and Professors of Ecclesiastical 
History, and the Oriental Languages. 

The Senatus Academicus of the University is composed of the 
principals and professors of the colleges, and the rector of the 
University presides at its meetings. By it alone, degrees are con- 
ferred, the other faculties only exercising the privilege of recom- 
mending to its notice such individuals as they may deem qualified 
for receiving the distinction. This aggregate body superintends 
the arrangements connected with the University library ; it nomi- 
nates the Chancellor of the University when a vacancy occurs, and 
it possesses and exercises the right of electing the Professor of 
Medicine, the librarian and the archbeadle. An appeal to it is com- 
petent in certain cases, it is understood, from a judgment pro- 
nounced by either of the colleges. 

The Rector of the university is elected annually on the first 
Monday of March, at a meeting of the comitia of the whole uni- 



ST ANDREWS. 



491 



versity, comprehending the principals, professors, and students, by 
four delegates of their number denominated intrants, who repre- 
sent the four nations or bodies, viz. the Fifani, Albani, Lothiani, 
and Angusiani, into which the members of the comitia are arrang- 
ed, and who are supposed to form their decision in conformity to 
the general sentiment entertained by their constituents. By the 
existing regulations, the only individuals who are eligible to the of- 
fice of rector are the principals of the two colleges, and the pro- 
fessors of divinity and ecclesiastical history. 

From time to time, royal visitations of the university and its col- 
leges, were found requisite to correct abuses, where they had been 
introduced, to see that the rules of the several institutions were 
properly observed, and to establish such alterations in the regula- 
tions as might be deemed necessary for the advancement of lite- 
rature, and for the welfare of the several corporations. This prac- 
tice having been discontinued for more than a century, his Ma- 
jesty George IV. in 1826, issued a commission to certain noble- 
men and gentlemen to visit the several universities in Scotland, 
to take a particular account of the existing state of these institu- 
tions, to report their proceedings to his Majesty, and to suggest 
such rules, ordinances, and improvements, as they might judge to 
be expedient for their future regulation and prosperity. This ar- 
duous task, the commissioners ably and faithfully performed ; and 
their report, which is voluminous and interesting, was presented to 
his Majesty several years ago. But although several attempts have 
been made to found upon it a legislative enactment, such a mea- 
sure has hitherto been found to be attended with difficulties of no 
ordinary magnitude, and none of the suggestions of the commis- 
sioners have yet received the necessary sanction for establishing 
their introduction and enforcement. 

The endowments of the colleges having been greatly curtailed 
within the last half century, by the augmentations of the stipends 
of those parishes, of the tithes of which they were titulars, their 
revenues, after affording an inadequate salary to the several incum- 
bents, and other necessary disbursements, were found to be total- 
ly inadequate for the purpose of preserving the college buildings 
in a proper state of repair. They were in consequence, a few 
years ago, in a very dilapidated state, and a considerable part of 
them must have been allowed to fall into ruin. In consequence, 
however, of the intervention of Lord Melville, the Chancellor of 
the University, strengthened by the concurrence of the royal com- 



492 



FIFESHIHE. 



missioners, the Lords of the Treasury were directed by his late 
Majesty, George IV., to issue an order for the appropriation of 
the sum that might be deemed requisite, for re-establishing such 
of the buildings as were capable of being repaired, and of rebuild- 
ing such as were hastening towards irremediable decay. St Mary's 
College has in consequence been repaired agreeably to a design 
by Mr Reid, the King's Architect in Edinburgh, and has now an 
appropriate academical appearance. An elegant plan was also 
formed by the same gentleman, for the erection of a new set of 
buildings for the United College. A considerable part of the 
work, was in consequence executed, and its continuance and com- 
pletion, it was expected, would ere long have been carried into exe- 
cution ; but the farther progress of the undertaking has been delay- 
ed, and farther advances from the Treasury have, it is understood, 
been refused, on the ground, that the sum set apart for the re-esta- 
blishmentof the University buildings, has already been expended. It 
may be properto add, that the University Libra7y,\\hose apartments 
were completely filled with a store of books, amounting to upwards 
of 30,000 volumes, was at the same time greatly enlarged. The 
front of the old part of this building toward the street, was then 
renewed, or retouched, so as to harmonize with the new part of 
the erection, and it exhibits a line of handsome shields, extending 
from the one extremity to the other, on which are emblazoned the 
arms of the several Chancellors of the University, from its first 
erection down to the present times. 

The elegant Gothic Chapel and Tower of St Salvator's College, 
erected by Bishop Kennedy, still remain, though somewhat muti- 
lated and altered, both internally and externally. The fine arched 
roof of the former was removed, considerably more than half a cen- 
tury ago, on an apprehension of insecurity, for which there appears 
to have been but little foundation. Its rich antique windows have 
been supplanted by others of a far less appropriate aspect, and the 
beautiful monument of its founder, with which the chapel was 
adorned, was seriously injured by the carelessness and unskilfulness 
of the workmen, who were employed in carrying these alterations 
into execution. About the same period, the parish church of St 
Leonard's having fallen into disrepair, the congregation removed to 
this chapel, which was properly fitted up for their accommodation, 
and it still continues to be employed for this purpose. 

There are many other interesting particulars relative to the 
University and its colleges, which might have been detailed, but

which the limits prescribed to this article render it necessary for 
the writer to omit. 

Literature. — A parochial library was established in St Andrews 
a few years ago. The publications which have been introduced 
into it, are almost exclusively of a rehgious character. The num- 
ber of the volumes now amounts to 260 ; and one shilling a-year 
only is exacted from those who avail themselves of the advantages 
which it affords. About fifteen years ago, a number of the gentle- 
men residing in the city and neighbourhood entered into an asso- 
ciation for the purpose of establishing a library which might em- 
brace the most popular productions connected with general litera- 
ture. They have now a library of considerable value, compre- 
hending nearly 1200 volumes, and which is annually on the in- 
crease. The books are given out to subscribers only, who pay an 
annual subscription of 8s., and who are at present about 100 in 
number. A Mechanics Library was established some years 
ago, and it seemed at first to meet with considerable encourage- 
ment, but of late it has not prospered. No school of arts, nor any 
scientific, literary, or antiquarian society, has been established 
within the parish, the society being too limited for affording the 
necessary support, for any considerable length of time, to such in- 
stitutions. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — A few years ago, several 
friendly societies existed in the city, but they have one by one been 
abandoned. They appeared, while they were in operation, to be 
highly beneficial in their tendency, and to be conducive to the 
formation of industrious habits. They were evidently founded, 
however, on erroneous calculations, and held out much more 
flattering promises of advantage to the contributors than they 
were able to realize. It is to be apprehended also, that where 
they engaged to afford a weekly allowance to a contributor when 
he was in distress, and when he was unable to attend to his ordi- 
nary duties, there were individuals who occasionally counterfeited 
sickness, or who continued much longer on the sick list than was 
just and equitable, that they might receive the stipulated allow- 
ance. The detection of a few cases of this description, combined 
with the necessity which existed of remodelling the whole plan 
of their arrangements, so as to enable the managers to fulfil their 
engagements, has had the tendency to render them unpopular, 
and to lead to their dissolution. This is much to be lamented,

as while they are calculated to cherish industrious hahits, ihey 
foster also the natural desire of independence. 

A Savmgs Bank was established in the city in 1816. During 
the first nine years, the amount of the deposits, after deducting the 
sums withdrawn, was annually on the increase. During the fol- 
lowing three years, there was a considerable decrease, but since 
that period, the increase has again been steady, and the amount in 
March 1837 is about L. 1100 Sterling. The number of the de- 
positors is at present nearly 200, and the average amount of the 
deposits is about L. 6. The deposits are almost exclusively 
made by persons belonging to the labouring classes. They 
are lodged in the Bank of Scotland's branch at St Andrews ; 
and that establishment has from the commencement, with the view 
of encouraging the savings bank, allowed one per cent, more of 
interest to its deposits than to ordinary depositors, so that the 
rate of intei-est to savings bank deposits has never been below 3 
per cent. ' The writer of this article has had the sole charge of 
the savitigs bank, for eighteen years past. He sets apart for it an 
hour every Monday, though in general the half of that time would 
be quite sufficient. 

Poor and Funds for their support under the management of the 
Kirk-session. — The average number of persons receiving parochial 
aid, during the last seven years, was 103 per annum,'and their al- 
lowances varied from 6d. to 2s. 6d. weekly, according to their exi- 
gencies. The funds for their support were, average collections at 
the church doors, L. 218, 4s. 2d. ; rent and feu-duties of lands, 
L. 73, 16s. 7d. ; interest of a debt due by the city, L. 40; col- 
lected by Saturday's box, L. 44, 4s. ; rent of a legacy, L. 5 ; 
total annual average, L. 381, 4s. 9d.; total average expenditure, 
L.417, Os. 4id. 

The poor's funds have for many years been burdened with a 
heavy expense in supporting and confining indigent lunatics. The 
kirk-session has, in consequence, found it requisite to apply, though 
at distant periods, to the heritors, citizens, tenantry, &amp;c. for volun- 
tary contributions to enable them to meet this expenditure, and 
hitherto they have contributed liberally for this object. There is 
now unquestionably less delicacy among the poor relative to appli- 
cation for parochial relief than in former times, and there are many 
who account it no degradation to receive an allowance from this 
source. But there are also individuals who can only be compelled 
by the most urgent necessity to have recourse to parochial relief.

Prisons. — There is a prison in the city, in which the average 
number confined during the year is about 20, for theft, drunk- 
enness, and riotous behaviour. It is strong and well secured. 
Particular attention is paid in it to the health, diet, and lodging 
of the prisoners. Its superintendence is vested in the magistrates, 
who have a jailor acting under their direction. 

Fairs. — Three fairs are held in the city annually, on days which 
are still regulated by the old style of computation, viz. the second 
Thm-sday of April, the 1st day of August, and the 30th Novem- 
ber. The first of the three was what Martine denominates, 
" the renouned faire of St Andrews, called the Senzie Mercat, 
held and kept for fifteen dayes, and beginning the second week 
after Easter, whereunto resorted merchants from most of the then 
trading kingdomes in Europe ; trade in this kingdome being then 
in its infancie." At that period, according to tradition, from 200 
to 300 vessels might have been seen in the bay and harbour of 
St Andrews, conveying to it the produce of foreign countries. The 
fair is now confined to a single day, and the business transacted 
in it is to a very limited amount. The fair in August has of late 
been much frequented by the farm-servants of the eastern districts 
of the county, many of them in the market-place forming engage- 
ments with new masters. The third fair is held on St Andrew's 
day old style, and is usually but thinly attended. 

Inns, Sj'c. — The number of inns, alehouses, &amp;c. within the parish 
is 48, viz. 39 in the city, and 9 in the country districts. This is 
unquestionably a much greater number than the exigencies of the 
population require; and it were much to be wished that some ef- 
fectual expedient were adopted, not here only, but throughout the 
country at large, for checking an evil which has so demoralizing 
an influence. 

Fuel — The fuel which is employed in the city is coal, chiefly 
conveyed by sea from Newcastle, or the ports in the Forth where 
that commodity is shipped. A part of the supply is also brought 
by land carriage from Largoward, which is seven miles distant, 
and from Drumcarro, which is still nearer. In the country dis- 
tricts there is a greater dependence on the home supply, though 
it is not confined to this alone. The present expense of sea coal 
is much greater than usual, being for Newcastle coal from 18s. to 
L. 1, Is. a ton, according to quality, at the harbour, while the coal 
from the Forth varies from 15s. to 18s. Those who are in the 
possession of horses and carriages, find it advantageous to procure

coals directly from the pit ; but where it is requisite to pay hire 
and tolls, a family can be nearly as cheaply supplied by sea-borne 
coal. 

Miscellaneous Obseiiva.tions. 
Since the publication of the Statistical Account of the parish, 
by the late Dr Adamson, in 1794, considerable alterations and im- 
provements have taken place. Portions of the waste and unculti- 
vated lands have been brought into a state of tillage. The mode 
of farming has been also materially altered for the better ; a much 
greater quantity of grain being now raised, than under the former 
system of agriculture. But the expense attendant on farming ope- 
rations, and the rent of land, have also materially increased, though 
for a number of years the latter has been on the decline ; so that 
the farmer of the present day does not derive from his skill and 
capital so high a remuneration as he then enjoyed. Tracts of 
soil, too, whose culture would not have afforded a remuneration for 
the expense attendant upon it, have been planted by the proprie- 
tors ; and the young plantations, while, in process of time, they 
will prove a source of revenue, will tend also materially to the em- 
bellishment of the country. Strathkinness, which then consisted 
of but a few straggling houses, now forms a village with a popu- 
lation little short of 500 inhabitants. Within the city, great im- 
provements are also visible. The pavement of the streets and lanes, 
which was then in a very bad condition, has been everywhere 
amended, though there is still a great deficiency of smooth pave- 
ment at the sides. Until within these twenty years, the streets 
were not lighted during the winter, but this defect has since been 
supplied ; first, by oil, and ultimately, by gas : a joint stock com- 
pany having, during the course of the season, 1835, established 
the manufacture of that commodity for the supply of the city. 
Many of the houses which were old and ruinous have been pulled 
down, and have been replaced by others of a more commodious 
and ornamental description ; and a number of the blank spaces 
which presented themselves in the streets and lanes have been 
filled up with appropriate buildings. Regarded as a bathing- 
station, the city has been furnished with a handsome erection in 
the immediate vicinity of the castle, and overhanging the sea, con- 
taining suitable accommodation for hot and cold baths, which may 
be obtained at a moderate expense. The sea-beach, in the vicini- 
ty of the city, is well-adapted for bathing, but it is still destitute 
of what many would regard as a very appropriate convenience, 



ST LEONARDS. 497 

for such a locality, viz., one or two batliing-machines, which it is 
supposed would amply remunerate the proprietor for the expense 
incurred by their introduction. 

The Typographical art was cultivated at St Andrews previous 
to the era of the Reformation ; but the works which, about that pe- 
riod, were printed in the city are now very rare, and are only to 
be found in some of the most valuable libraries. Among these, the 
Complaynt of Scotland, printed in 1548, and Archbishop Hamil- 
ton's Catechism, printed in 1552, have attracted considerable at- 
tention. When the city fell into a state of decay, after the de- 
struction of the principal ecclesiastical edifices, and the alienation 
of the revenues, by which they were supported, the art of printing 
appearsto have been discontinued. An attempt to revive it within 
the precincts of the University was made in 1796 by Mr Morison 
of Perth, who Wcxs appointed to the office of university printer, 
when, with several other productions, accurate editions of certain 
of the Latin classics were printed, under the superintendence of 
Dr John Hunter, then Professor of Humanity. But although the 
editor was a gentleman of distinguished talents and celebrity, it 
was found that the expense of the establishment more than 
counterbalanced the profit, and Mr Morison was induced to resign 
the appomtment, and to withdraw his press. 

A branch of the Bank of Scotland was established in the city 
nearly half a century ago, and has been continued to the present 
day without any rival ; the limited extent of the commercial ar- 
rangements of the city and its vicinity requiring no additional 
supply.

of the Franks, who afterwards retired from that court to a forest 
in the Limousin, where he constructed an oratory, and acquired 
high celebrity as a preacher. His fame is said to have been 
greatly increased by the miraculous endowments he exhiljited, and 
by the sanctity of his life. After his death he was canonized, and 
many religious edifices were dedicated to him, not in France only 
but also in Britain. He died soon after the middle of the sixth 
century of the Christian era. 

It is uncertain at what period the territory which at present 
constitutes the parish of St Leonards was originally erected into 
a parish. From the erection of St Leonard's College in 1512, 
its parochial status can be distinctly traced, but prior to that pe- 
riod, it is not so decidedly fixed. There are circumstances which 
seem to render it probable that it is not of a more ancient date. 
When, according to tradition, the Greek monk Regulus and his as- 
sociates who had sailed from Greece, carrying along with them 
certain of the bones or relics of the apostle Andrew, were wreck- 
ed at the spot where the city of St Andrews now stands, they were 
successful in prevailing upon the monarch of the country and the 
bulk of his subjects, to abandon their idolatrous notions and prac- 
tices, and to embrace Christianity. The precious relics, which 
had been preserved at the period of the shipwreck, were carefully 
kept, and in the superstitious times which followed, multitudes 
flocked, not only from the various districts of the kingdom, but 
also from foreign lands, to inspect and admire them, and to expe- 
rience the influence of their supposed miraculous powers. The 
multitude of these devotees was, at certain periods, so great, that 
they could not be conveniently accommodated, in the bmldmgs 
which had been erected for the use of the existing religious insti- 
tutions of the place, and they were often in consequence subject- 
ed to very considerable inconvenience. To remedy this evil, it 
was judged to be expedient, that a house should be erected of suf- 
ficient dimensions for their accommodation, in the vicmity of the 
apartment where the relics were deposited. And as many of the 
devotees were in indigent circumstances, and the idea, in these 
ages, was very generally prevalent, that such pilgrimages were 
highly meritorious, and ought to meet with all due encouragement 
from the ecclesiastical bodies, ample funds were set apart for their 
maintenance, for such a period as might be deemed proper for 
them to remain in the place. This house of entertainment for 
poor pilgrims was denominated an hospital, and it was dedicated 



ST LEONARDS. 



499 



to St Leonard. Like most of the religious institutions of the 
times, it had a church or chapel attached to it, which is fre- 
quently alluded to in the records of the University prior to the 
erection of St Leonard's College, as one of the places where 
that body held its meetings, at a period when the apartments 
appropriated for its accommodation were very circumscribed. 
In process of time, the desire for pilgrimages cooled, and the 
veneration for ancient relics decayed. The hospital of St Leo- 
nard's became, in consequence, less and less frequented, and this 
desertion increased at last to such an extent, that it was obvious 
that its revenues ought to be appropriated to some more beneficial 
purpose. An experiment was accordingly made, to convert it 
into an hospital or nunnery for the reception of females consider- 
ably advanced in years, who might there devote themselves to the 
performance of religious duties ; but it failed to realize the expec- 
tations which had been formed of its utility, its inmates having 
exhibited but few indications of a regard either for morality or 
piety. The prior and convent of the Augustine monastery, with- 
in whose precincts the hospital was situated, and from whose re- 
venues it had derived its endowments, came at last in 1512 to the 
resolution of -converting it into a college connected with the Uni- 
versity, to consist, according to the charter of erection, of a princi- 
pal, four chaplains, twenty scholars, who were to be instructed in 
grammar, music, and the other liberal arts, and six other scholars 
who had previously acquired a knowledge of the arts, and who, 
under the superintendency of the principal, were to devote their 
attention to the study of theology. Two of the chaplains were to 
be regents or professors in the college, and one of them was to be 
invested with the cure of souls, and was to act as a sacrist, or a 
parish minister. For the maintenance of this institution, the whole 
of the endowments of the ancient hospital were appropriated. 
These consisted of three farms, upper and lower Kenloway and 
Favvside, and 63 acres of the lands of Rathelpy, in the immedi- 
ate vicmity of the city of St Andrews ; together with the feu-du- 
ties of that part of the suburbs denominated Argvle, which had 
been erected on part of these lands, and of the tenements situated 
between the Priors or Eastburn Wynd, and the Augustine monas- 
tery Of the three farms, one, viz. Fawside, was situated in the 
parish of Crail, now of Kingsbarns, and the other two, together 
with the lands and tenements alluded to, with the farm of Pikie, 
which has been since mortified to the city of Glasgow, form the 



500 



FIFKSIII Rli 



parish of St Leonards. The teinds parsonage and vicarage of 
these lands had not been conveyed to llie ancient hospital, but 
they were now incorporated with the revenues of the college ; and 
this circumstance, when combined with the fact, that one of the 
four chaplains of the college was to be invested with the cure of 
souls, would seem to imply, that St Leonards now for the first 
time acquired the name and character of a parish. The parish 
thus constituted had its sacrist or curate, who was one of the chap- 
lains of St Leonards College, till the period of the Reformation. 
When that event took place, many of the parish ministers in Scot- 
land continued to adhere to the Popish tenets, and being in con- 
sequence' ejected, their parishes became destitute of pastors. The 
expedient to which the church and the constituted authorities had 
recourse, to supply thisdeficiency, was to place two or three con- 
tiguous parishes under the charge of one minister, till a more 
ample supply should be obtained. The parishioners of St Leo- 
nards being thus situated, were placed under the charge of the 
minister of St Andrews; and this arrangement continued to sub- 
sist for about thirty years, when Mr Robert Wilkie, minister of 
St Andrews, having, by advice of the General Assembly, been 
appointed Principal of St Leonards College, and minister of the 
parish of St Leonards, he was inducted into these offices, and his 
successors in the office of principal have, with little variation, been 
ever since ministers also of St Leonards'. 

A part of the parish of St Leonards hes in the immediate vi- 
cinity of the city, and consists of several detached allotments, sur- 
rounded by the town parish ; and the remainder, consisting of the 
two Kenloways or Kenlies, and Pikie, are most inconveniently si- 
tuated, being from four to five miles distant from the parish church. 
This latter division of the parish, which is by far the most exten- 
sive, though least populous, is bounded by the parishes of St An- 
drews on the north, and Kingsbarns, Crail, and Denino on the 
east, south, and west respectively. 

To the natural history of the parish it were unnecessary to ad- 
vert, as the remarks which might be made would be merely a re- 
petition of the statements exhibited relative to the Natural History | 
of the parish of St Andrews, with which it is so closely connected. 
The same remark is applicable to the great bulk of the other - 
particulars which the " heads of inquiry" embrace.

leges of St Salvator and St Leonards are the chief land-owners in 
this parish. The only other heritor is the city of Glasgow, which 
receives the rents of the lands of Pikie, in consequence of a deed 
of mortification by Scot of Scotstarvet. There are, besides, a con- 
siderable number of feuars ; but these hold of the college as su- 
perior, and pay to it feu-duties corresponding to the extent and 
the value of their allotments. 

Parochial Begisters.—The earliest entry in the parochial re- 
gisters of the parish, is of date June 28, 1696. The register of 
births and marriages is extant from that period ; but with regard 
to the former, the same remark is applicable which has been made 
in reference to the register of births for the parish of St Andrews, 
namely, that it "is highly defective, many of the parents neglecting 
to apply to the session-clerk to have the names of their children 
enrolled. 

When the union took place between the Colleges of St Salva- 
tor and St Leonards, the grounds and buildings connected with 
one of them were no longer requisite for the accommodation of 
the members of the United College. Those belonging to St Leon- 
ards College were in consequence sold ; and the apartments in 
which the masters and students originally resided are now divided 
between two proprietors, who, with former occupants, have made 
very considerable alterations and additions to the buildings, so as 
to form commodious dwelling-houses.

There are no blind nor deaf and dumb persons in the parish ; 
but there are two persons in a fatuous state. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agricultui-e. — The number of acres standard imperial measure 
in the parish, which are in a state of cultivation, is 654 ; and the 
waste or pasture grounds amount to 327 acres. No part of the 
latter, it is understood, could be profitably kept in tillage. There 
are no plantations in the parish. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent per imperial acre of the ar- 
able land in that district of the parish, which is most remote from 
the church, is about L. 1, IDs. ; but the district in the vicinity of 
the city yields an average rent of L. 4 Sterling per acre. The 
former is partly enclosed, and the farm- buildings and enclosures 
are in a good state of repair ; but the latter is not enclosed, being 
rented by the citizens and others in small allotments. 

Quarries. — The distant district abounds in free or sandstone, 
of which several quarries have been opened, and the stone, though 
soft, has been found to be durable, and adapted to the various pur- 
poses of the builder. 

Produce. — -The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 



Grain of all kinds, . L. 1450

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The original church of the parish of St 
Leonards was situated in the immediate vicinity of the college of 
the same name, and for more than two centuries it was occupied 
by the parishioners. About seventy years ago it required exten- 
sive repairs, the expense of which would have fallen chiefly on the 
funds of the United College. A few years prior to this period, 
however, the Colleges of St Salvator and St Leonards had been 
incorporated by Act of Parliament ; and to St Salvator's there 
had been attached by the founder a large chapel, which was still 
in a good state of repair, and was now the property of the United 

College ; and it became a subject of discussion among the masters, 

4 



ST LEONAHDS. 



503 



whether it would be more eligible to repair the old parish church, 
or to fit up the Chapel of St Salvator's for the use of the parish- 
ioners  The latter was situated, indeed, beyond the limits of the 
parish, and within the town parish ; but the distance between the 
two was so small, that it was a matter of but little importance to the 
parishioners whether they were accommodated in the one or in the 
other. The majority of the masters favoured the idea of the pro- 
posed transference, as the other buildings of St Salvator's College 
were already appropriated for the use of the United College ; and 
the sanction of the presbytery of St Andrews to the measure hav- 
ing been obtained, the chapel was fitted up so as to accommodate 
the parishioners of St Leonards, and the students attending the 
United College ; and for their use it continues to be appropriated. 
The walls of the old parish church still remain in a tolerable state 
of preservation ; but the tower and spire connected with it were 
pulled down soon after the transference. The area of the church 
formed a parallelogram of about 70 feet long by 18 wide within 
the walls ; and the style of its architecture was neat and appro- 
priate. The interior still contains several monuments, inserted 
into the wall, to the memory of individuals connected with St 
Leonard's College, in the earlier periods of its existence ; but the 
most elegant of them has been constructed of a species of stone 
but ill fitted for encountering the vicissitudes of the weather, and 
is fast hastening to a state of utter decay. 

The greater part of the population of St Leonards being re- 
sident in the immediate vicinity of the city, the present substitute 
for the parish church cannot be regarded as inconveniently situat- 
ed. But as a distance of between four and five miles intervenes 
between this portion of the parish and the distant district, it is evi- 
dent that this latter division of the parishioners must feel, that 
they reside at a very inconvenient distance from the Church. 
This, however, is an evil to which a remedy cannot well be applied, 
so long as they are connected with the parish of St Leonards, as 
no site for a parish church could be devised that would be suit- 
ed to them,, in common with the other parishioners. 

The chapel of St Salvator's, in which the parishioners of St 
Leonards now assemble for public worship, was erected by Bishop 
Kennedy about the middle of the fifteenth century. The style of its 
architecture is the Gothic, and it must have originally been a very 
elegant edifice. It appears to have been stripped of many of its 
ornaments of a superstitious aspect, at the period of the Reforma- 



504 



FIFESHIRE. 



tion, and to have suffered still more, so far as its architectural 
beauty and character are concerned, about seventy years ago, 
when it received extensive alterations and repairs. In its original 
state, it was an edifice of 107 feet in length by 29 in breadth 
within the walls. But as this formed an area, of larger dimen- 
sions than the congregation of St Leonards required, a partition 
wall was erected, by which a considerable space at the western ex- 
tremity was cut off ; so that the length of the Chapel, as it is now 
employed for public worship, is reduced to 78 feet. It is at 
present in a good state of repair. The area affords accommodation 
for 360 persons, and a gallery, which was erected for the use of the 
professors and students, accommodates 120 more. The seating of 
the area, after furnishing the requisite accommodation for the pro- 
fessors' families, is appropriated to the use of the parishioners, with 
the exception of a few pews, which are rented. 

The ministers of St Leonards had no manse nor glebe, nor 
any allowance for either, until within these few years, when a 
glebe, and ground for the' site of a manse, offices, and garden, were 
designed for them by the presbytery of St Andrews, from church 
lands in the vicinity of the city, and belonging to the United Col- 
lege. But the present incumbent, at whose request the designation 
took place, instead of taking possession of the ground, which was 
under lease, has agreed during his incumbency to accept of a 
compensation. The glebe is, of course, of the legal extent of four 
acres, and half an acre added for the site of the manse, offices, and 
garden; the whole yields a rent of L. 18 to the College. 

The stipend attached to the charge of St Leonards, until with- 
in these twenty-five years, consisted only of 5 chalders of victual, 
not, however, derived from the teinds of the lands in the parish con- 
nected with the college, these having been originally conveyed to 
it cum decimis inclusis, but from the revenues of the priory of St 
Andrews, in terms of an old allocation by the Commissioners of 
Plat, at the period when the Duke of Lennox was commendator 
of the priory. The incumbent receives, in addition, the rent of 
half an acre of land, in the immediate vicinity of the city, mor- 
tified, nearly two centuries ago, for the use of the ministers of St 
Leonards. When the act of Parliament assigning a grant for the 
agumentation of the small livings in Scotland passed in 1810, a 
sum was appropriated to the minister of St Leonards from that 
fund to raise the stipend to L. 150 Sterling : but the grain was 
then rated at a much higher conversion than the prices of late 



FORGAN. 



505 



years, so that now there is a corresponding defalcation in the 
amount of the stipend. 

Education. — No parochial school has at any period existed in 
this parish. The young persons residing in those districts which 
are in the vicinity of the city receive their education at the city 
schools ; and those residing in the distant district, at the school of 
Boarhills, from which they are distant about one mile only. 

Poor and Poor's Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid is 15, and the weekly allowance made to 
them is L. 1, 2s., being at an average nearly Is. 6d. each. In ad- 
dition to this regular payment, amounting to L. 57, 4s. annually, 
occasional demands, to the amount of about L. 20 annually, have 
been suppHed, so that the average amount of expenditure during 
the last five years is L. 78. To meet this the receipts have been ; 
average annual collection at church door, L. 47, 15s. 8d. ; ave- 
rage annual rent of three acres of land, L. 8, 7s. ; interest of a 
sum in the Bank of Scotland, 17s. 5d. ; part of said sum drawn 
from bank annually, L. 21 ; total L. 78, Os. Id. 

In 1831, the money in the bank amounted to L. 105, but it is 
now totally expended ; and unless means can be devised, either 
for diminishing the rate of expenditure, or for increasing the an- 
nual amount of the funds, it will be necessary to have recourse 
to an assessment, either voluntary or legal, to enable the kirk-ses- 
sion to meet the demands against them.

former of these, which in earlier periods was written Forgun, For-

the south. When or for what reason the alternative name St 
Phillan was added, is not known. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish, which is of an ohlong- 
figure, is nearly 6 miles long and a little more than 2 broad. 
It is bounded on the north by the river Tay ; on the west, by the 
parishes of Balmerino and Kilmany; on the south, by Leuchars 
and Logie ; and on the east, by Ferry-Port-on- Craig. 

Topograjjliical Appearances. — The general asjiect is highly pleas- 
ing, from the irregular and undulating appearance of the ground. 
The only eminences that have received the name of hills are those of 
St Fort and Newton, the greatest altitude of which above the Tay 
is about 300 feet. There are several valleys or straths, the largest 
of which commences at a tract of flat land in the eastern extremity 
of the parish, and forms, with a slight interruption, the southern 
boundary, until it reaches the most westerly district, where it bends 
northward, and forms the west boundary at the Tay. Along this 
strath, there were several pieces of marshy ground or mires, all of 
which have been drained and brought under cultivation since the 
last Statistical Account. 

The shore of the Tay, which extends nearly four miles on the 
north side of the parish, is covered with gravel or large stones, 
above sleech or clay near high water-mark, and at low water-mark 
it is entirely sleech or clay. The coast is uniformly of a bold or 
rocky nature, averaging from thirty to fifty feet above the adjacent 
shores. Wormit Bay, where the coast is more flat, forms the 
western extremity of the parish ; besides which, there are creeks at 
Woodhaven and Newport, where there are small harbours. About 
half a mile east of Newport, there is a headland, which in a very 
ancient Atlas is marked under the name Skarness. It is now- 
named Craighead. 

Climate. — The climate of the parish is dry and highly salu- 
brious, which, in connection with its favourable situation for bath- 
ing, induces many families to resort to it in the summer season. 
There are numerous instances of longevity. Few epidemical dis- 
eases prevail ; and it is remarkable, that during the time of Asiatic 
cholera not a single ease occurred in the parish, although there 
was an hourly communication with Dundee, where the disease was 
general and fatal. 

Hydrography. — The width of the Frith between Newport and 
Dundee is one statute mile and a little more than a half, or about 
2760 yards. During the ebb-tide, the water is brackish, but dur- 



FORGAN.

ing the flood it is completely salt. The current is strong, arti- 
cularly during ebb-tide, when it runs about four miles an hour. 
Springs of excellent quality are found in abundance throughout 
the parish. 

Geology and Mineralogy— As forming part of the extensive 
tract of country that ranges from Alloa to the sea at St Andrews 
and Ferry-port-on- Craig, the district in which this parish is situ- 
ated is intersected by a series of trap hills of various elevations. 
Sandstone and sandstone conglomerate form the basis ; and the 
strata being elevated by the intrusion of the. trap, rest upon it with 
a general inclination to the south-east. The greater part of the 
parish consists of a number of hills of greenstone, which is of a 
compact fine-grained quality, and of a dark colour, from a pre- 
ponderance of augite. Along the banks of the Tay, rocks of 
amygdaloidal greenstone prevail. The base is an irregular, rather 
friable and porous greenstone, with numerous nodules, some com- 
posed of a greenish earth, others of calcareous crystals, and a great 
proportion of quartz, assuming the forms of agates, with beauti- 
fiil concentric lamellar structure. 

Soil. — The soil, being formed in a great measure from the de- 
bris of the trap rocks, is generally of an excellent and fertile na- 
ture. The greater part is good black loam and clayey earth. 
Some portions of it being light and gravelly, are better suited for 
sheep pasture than for grain crops. In the diluvial soil, particu- 
larly in the western districts of the parish, there are numerous 
transported masses of rock or boulders, consisting partly of frag- 
ments of the surrounding trap hills, and partly of primitive rocks, 
which must have been conveyed by a powerful current from the 
north-west or GramjDian range. 

II. — Civil History. 

No history of the parish is known to exist ; and the notices of 
it in Sibbald's History of Fife, and in Martin's Reliquiae Divi An- 
dreae, are extremely meagre. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, — 

Henry Stewart, Esq. of St Fort, resident, valued rent, L 2349 6 8 Scotch. 

William Berry, Esq. of Tayfield, do. 1082 3 4 

David Gillespie, Esq. of Kirkton, non-resident, 711 0 0 

The Right Hon. Lord Dundas, Newton, do. 640 10 0 

Henry Scrymgeour Wedderburn, Esq of Wormit, do. 201 0 0 

John Hay, Esq of Morton, do. 164 6 8 

The estate of St Fort belonged for several hundred years, till 
the beginning of the last century, to a family of the name of 
Nairne, who, as appears from Douglas' Peerage and Sibbald's 



508 



FIFESniRK. 



History of Fife, held various high offices in the State. A younger 
branch of this family was ennobled, in the reign of Charles II., by 
the title of Lord Nairne, which was forfeited at the Rebellion in 
1745, and restored during the reign of George the Fourth. The 
estate of St Fort, along with several other lands belonging to the 
family of Nairne, was sold at the beginning of the last century ; 
and since that time all the lands in the parish have frequently 
changed owners, with the exception of the small property of Mor- 
ton, which has continued in the same family for a long period. 

Antiquities. — There are several cairns or tumuli, composed of 
small stones, in conspicuous situations of the parish, but they have 
not been thoroughly explored. A few urns of rude workmanship 
were found, a few years ago, in cutting the public road at Newport. 
They were injured by the workmen, and their contents, if they 
had any, were not ascertained. It is not improbable that a proper 
examination of these cairns miffht bring to liofht some interesting 
relics, in reference to the contests between the Danes and Picts 
near the entrance of the Tay. 

Parochial Registersi — The parochial registers do not extend far- 
ther back than 1701. 

Modem Buildings. — On the estate of St Fort, there has been 
recently erected a very spacious and handsome house in the Eliza- 
bethan form of architecture. The mansion house of Tayfield, 
several years ago, received large additions, in a similar character 
of building, so as to present the appearance of an entirely new 
structure, and from its delightful situation on the banks of the Tay, 
it commands a very extensive and beautiful view of the river and 
country to the west. 

III. — Population. 

The population amounted in 1755 to 751 

1793 . 875 
By the Parlimentary census for 1801 it was 916 

1811 898 
1821 . 937 
1831 . 1090 

This increase of population in the parish is obviously caused 
by its contiguity to, and ready communication with, the town of 
Dundee, and it is highly probable that the thriving village of 
Newport will ere long become a large and populous town. 

The village population is somewhat more than - 600 

Total numher of families, - - 205 

Of which employed in agriculture nearly, - 90 

From 40 to 50 are artisans or connected with trade, and not 
more than 10 are engaged in seaftiring occupations.

The yearly average of births for the last seven years was, . 23

Character of the People. — The parishioners are in general quiet 
and orderly in their deportment. Their houses are for the most 
part clean and well kept — while some of the cottages are distin- 
guished for their neat and tasteful appearance. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish contains about 5000 acres, nearly 4000 of which are under cultivation. 
Of unarable land there are about - 250 
plantations, - . 360 

grass parks, - . 370 

Plantations. — Since the last Statistical Account, there has been 
a great increase to the plantations on the estates of St Fort and 
Ttiyfield. There is still, however, a considerable extent of rocky and 
hillygroimd that might be planted with great advantage. The trees 
are chiefly of the fir tribe— but the soil is well adapted for the 
growth of such hard wood as the oak, ash, chestnut and beech. 
There are several old trees at St Fort and Newton. In regard to size, 
there are none deserving of notice, with the exception of three yews 
in the garden at Kirkton, which probably are not to be equalled 
by any in Scotland. The management in regard to thinning and 
pruning is excellent. 

Rent of Land. — The annual rent of land in the parish is from 
L. 1 to L. 3 per acre. Some near the Tay, from its local ad- 
vantages, is let at L. 4 per Scotch acre. The general average is 
about L. 1, 15s. The rent of grazing is L. 2, 10s. per ox or 
cow, and 10s. per ewe. 

Rate of rFaes.— Labourers earn from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. per 
day, and have almost constant employment. Masons, carpenters, 
and other handicraft receive from 14s. to 18s. per week. The 
wages of ploughmen, paid partly in money and grain, vary from 
L. 20 to L. 28 per annum,— a number of the farm-servants being 
allowed to keep cows. 

The prices of all produce are regulated by the Dundee, Cupar, 
and St Andrews markets, where it is sold. In general, they are 
not so high as those obtained at Kirkcaldy, where there is a 
stock market, although the grain grown in the north of Fife is of 
excellent quality. 

Husbandry.— 'The tenants in this parish are distinguished by 
their mtelhgence, enterprise, and skill. They readily and spirited- 
ly avail themselves of any improvements that may be introduced 
into the methods of cultivating the land, or of improving the breed 



510 



FIFESHIRE. 



of cattle. The system of husbandry pursued is the rotation of 
five and six years. 

The breeds of cattle most encouraged are the Fife, Angus, 
Ayrshire, and Teeswater. For the last of these the pasture is not 
considered to be very suitable. The sheep are of the Leicester 
and Cheviot breeds. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years, and from the 
respectability of the farmers, it may be inferred that these are fa- 
vourable to the occupier. 

The state of the farm-buildings is in general excellent. Some 
of the steadings have been rebuilt, improved, and enlarged within 
these few years. A number of inclosures, chiefly of stone and 
lime walls, have been made of late years by Mr Berry of Tay- 
field, upon whose property, there are also several fields enclosed 
by hedge and ditch. On the estate of St Fort, there are also a 
number of enclosures. But there is still a considerable deficiency 
in this respect throughout the parish. 

Quarries. — The quarries in the parish are all whinstone. They 
are wrought for building houses and enclosures. The freestone 
is brought either from Angus, or from the quarries on the south 
of the river Eden, a distance of about nine miles. The lime is also 
brought by sea, or carted from the lime hills at a still greater dis- 
tance than the freestone. 

Fisheries. — There are several salmon fisheries in the parish. 
They are carried on by net and coble, — a mode of fishing which is 
found to be very ineffectual in estuaries, so that the rents are of 
small amount, probably not exceeding L. 150 yearly. About the 
year 1797, stake-nets were introduced into the Frith, when in one 
season 7000 salmon were caught with a single net, a quantity 
nearly equal to a fourth part of the previous produce of the whole 
Frith and river. This immediately alarmed the proprietors of 
fisheries in the upper parts of the Tay, who had previously enjoyed 
a monopoly of the trade, and they accordingly brought an action 
before the Supreme Court, to have the new mode of fishing put 
down. This they accomplished after a litigation which lasted 
till the year 1812, when it was decided that the use of stake-nets 
in friths and estuaries fell under the prohibition of certain Scotch 
statutes. It is much to be regretted that a question involving so 

• The sheep husbandry has been carried on to considerable advantage by some of 
the farmers for improving their light lands, particularly oh the farms of Kirkton aud 
Newton. 



FORGAN. 511 

deeply the interests of those concerned should have been determin- 
ed not according to the merits of the particular mode of fishing, 
as was distinctly admitted both in the Court of Session and in 
the House of Lords, but according to the construction put upon 
certain statutory words in the interpretation of the ancient laws 
regarding fisheries. In these circumstances, it is remarkable, that 
hitherto no united efforts have been made by the proprietors along 
the estuary of the Tay, in conjunction with others similarly situ- 
ated, to bring their case in reference to their fisheries before the 
Legislature, and so to have it ascertained — not what was the law 
at a remote period, when the subject was little attended to, and 
but imperfectly understood, but what ought to be the law for carry- 
ing on these fisheries in a way that would at once secure the rights 
of private parlies, and confer the largest amount of benefit on the 
public. From the evidence that was given before a Committee of 
the House of Commons, in the years 1824 and 1825, it appears 
that chiefly in the months of August, September, and October, 
the salmon ascend the frith for the purpose of spawning in the 
river, and that they keep the deep water of the mid channel as 
they pass through the estuary. They descend in the months of 
February, March, and April, when the helts or spent fish with 
the fry keep in deep water ; the clean fish roaming at large through- 
out the shallow and deep water. 

The salmon that are caught are either sent to Dundee, or pack- 
ed in ice, and exported by the Dundee steam ships to the London 
market. 

It may be remarked, that, about thirty years ago, a large shoal 
of herrings made its appearance, in the winter season, opposite to 
Newport, which employed a number of boats and other vessels 
during its continuance ; but there has not been any shoal known 
in the Tay since that time. 

Produce. — The average yearly value of raw produce raised in 
the parish after deduction for seed, &amp;c. is nearly as follows : 



Produce of grain, . L. 10,360 

Potatoes and turnips, . . 3,900 

Hay, . . . 630 

Pasture, . .. . ],250 

Thinning and felling of woods, . 200 

Fisheries, . ' , . 150 



L. 16,490 

Manufactures. — There is some weaving in the parish, chiefly 
of the fabric suited to the Dundee manufacture of coarse linen, 
&amp;c. The number of individuals thus employed does not exceed 20.

V. — Parochiai, Economy. 

The nearest makct-town is Dundee, which is only separated 
from the parish by the Tay. Cupar, which is also a market-town, 
is distant about eleven miles. Both of them are frequented by 
the farmers, weekly, for the sale of produce. 

The parish enjoys the benefit of a ready communication with 
other parts of the country both by land and water carriage. There 
is a post-office at Newport, and there are two daily coaches com- 
municating with Edinburgh, besides a daily mail-coach lately es- 
tablished. 

Roads. — The principal turnpike road betwixt Edinburgh and 
the north-east of Scotland, by the ferry at Newport, runs through 
the parish for about two miles and a half. The other roads are, 
1. the old turnpike to Woodhaven, the length of which within the 
parish is about three miles ; 2. another turnpike road, which joins 
it about one mile and a half from Woodhaven, leading by Kil- 
many to New Inn, length within the parish two miles and a half. 
3. the turnpike road from Cupar to Ferry-port-on- Craig, length 
about a mile ; 4. a turnpike road made a few years ago betwixt 
Ferry-port-on- Craig and Newport, length in parish one mile and a 
half ; and, 5. a road of communication betwixt Newport and 
Woodhaven, length one mile. There are also two parish or sta- 
tute labour roads connecting the principal or turnpike roads. These 
are maintained in good order, particularly the great road which in- 
tersects the parish into nearly equal parts, and which is always in 
the best condition. 

Ferries. — Till the year 1822, there had been, from time imme- 
morial, two public ferries in the parish communicating with Dundee 
across the Tay, viz. one at Woodhaven, and another at New- 
port, about a mile farther east. These ferries were supplied by 
sail boats of a small and inconvenient description. 

About the year 1790, a new turnpike road was made to the 
ferry of Woodhaven, which, therefore, became for some time the 
principal ferry, and commanded the greatest resort of passengers, 
&amp;c. But about the year 1806, by the exertions of the late Mr 
Berry and his son, the present proprietor of Tayfield, another 
turnpike road was made communicating with that betwixt Wood- 
haven and Cupar, at a point distant about four miles from New- 
port. In consequence of this and of the communication with 
Dundee by Newport being shorter and more convenient, the 
thoroughfare began gradually to change, so as at length to make 



FORGAN. 



513 



Newport the principal place of resort for those travelling to the 
north-east. 

In the year 1807, the attention of the counties of Fife and 
Forfar was directed to the risk and inconvenience connected with 
the Ferry across the Tay. At that period, there were 25 boats 
on the passage, manned by upwards of 100 men and boys. But 
these boats and crews were found to be alike unsuitable for the 
safety and accommodation of the public ; and as upon investigation 
it was found that the ferry produced a revenue adequate, not only 
for the maintenance of a better system, but for providing funds for 
the erection of suitable piers and landing-places adapted to all 
states of the tide, an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1819, 
constituting the Justices of the Peace and Commi sioners of Sup- 
ply in the two counties of Fife and Forfar, with some official per- 
sons, trustees for erection of piers, and otherwise improving and 
regulating the ferry. Soon after this act had been obtained, the 
trustees were induced to direct their attention to the advantage of 
substituting a steam-boat in place of the numerous sail-boats by 
which the ferry had been previously maintained, and, after care- 
ful inquiries, they decided upon making the experiment with a 
double or twin steam-boat, such as had been in use on the 
American rivers, and also at Hamburgh, and on the Mersey, near 
Liverpool. A vessel of this description was accordingly built un- 
der their direction, at an expense of betwixt L. 4000 and L. 5000, 
and placed on the ferry about the end of the year 182]. This 
vessel was made to ply alternately from Dundee to Woodhaven 
and Newport, but, as this place was found to be very inconvenient 
for passengers, it was resolved, in July 1822, that the boat should 
call at Newport only. In consequence of this arrangement, a great 
advantage immediately arose to the public, and the intercourse 
rapidly increased; but as the trustees were bound to maintain a 
separate ferry at Woodhaven, a 'new Act of Parliament was ap- 
plied for and obtained in 1822, by which the trustees were autho- 
rized to substitute one landing-place, and to erect piers at New- 
port and Dundee, for the purposes of the ferry. Very complete 
ferry harbours were accordingly erected at these places, and an 
additional double or twin steam-boat was procured. So that from 
havmg been, as it was at the date of the last Statistical Account 
of the parish, one of the worst and most dangerous, it now ranks 
among the safest, most expeditious, and convenient ferries in the 
kingdom. Besides the steam-boat, which during the day affords 

FIFE.

FIFESHIRE. 



a passage hourly from each side, there are kept a large sail-boat 
and a pinnace and yawl, with crews at each station ready for the 
acconfimodation of the public, when required. About two years 
ago, the trustees found it expedient to let the ferry for five years, 
and it is now maintained by the lessees, who have since placed upon 
it a single steam-boat of sixty horse power, which is a greater 
steam force than those formerly in use. The lessees, besides main- 
taining the ferry in terms of the regulations of the trustees, are 
bound to pay a rent of L. 2200 a year, out of which, interest at 
3 per cent, is paid on the large debt of L. 40,000 incurred in the 
ferry improvements. The remainder of the rent goes towards the 
extinction of the debt. 

For the year ending 31st December 1834, being the year pre- 
vious to that on which the ferry was let, the following is an ab- 
stract of the number of passengers, cattle, horses, &amp;c., which were 
conveyed across the ferry : — 

Passengers, . . 86,607 Cattle, , . . 4,598 

Four-wheeled carriages, . 268 Sheep and lambs, . 11,911 

Gigs, . . , 578 Carts of goods, . . 2,798 

Horses, . . 3,794 Barrels bulk of goods, . 3,375 

Carts, . . . 3,727 

The following is the state of the revenue for each month of the 
same year : — 

January, . L. 324 12 4 July, . . L.481 15 9 

February, . 315 8 0 August, . . 520 9 2

April, . . 383 8 9 October, . . 442 9 0 

May, . . 418 16 11 November, . 364 6 4 

June, . . 470 0 0 December, . . 324 1 3 
Making a total amount of L. 4844, 5s. 5d. 

It may be important to observe, in regard to the above state- 
ment, as illustrating the beneficial results of affording good accom- 
modation to the public, that since the improvements of a steam- 
boat and low-water piers were introduced, the number of passen- 
gers has been increased by about 20,000, and the amount of re- 
venue has been very nearly doubled. 

Harbours. — The harbours of Woodhaven and Newport are 
the private properties of Mr Stewart of St Fort, and Mr Berry of 
Tayfield. They can accommodate vessels of from 100 to 150 
tons burden, and are kept in good order. They answer the pur- 
poses of exporting the produce of the neighbouring country, and 
of importing lime, coal, and other necessaries. The ferry harbour 
at Newport, which is the property of the ferry trustees, is a splen- 
did erection. It is 350 feet long, and 60 wide, with a carriage- 
way on each side, and with a depth of five feet water at low water

of spring tides. This work was designed by the late Sir Thomas 
Telford. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated in a most beautiful 
and sequestered spot — but being at the south-east extremity of the 
parish, it is very inconvenient for the population in general, and 
■ particularly for those resident in the villages along the banks of 
the Tay, from whom it is distant from three to four miles. The 
date of its erection is not known. It formed one of the priory 
kirks belonging to St Andrews, and was built, according to tra- 
dition, in its present site, for the special accommodation of a 
wealthy lady resident in the adjoining mansion-house of Kirkton, 
who contributed largely of her substance for that purpose. It receiv- 
ed a thorough repair in the year 1770, and was reseated at the com- 
mencement of the present century. It is seated for about 350, so 
that the extent of church accommodation is greatly under what is 
required for the population. During the last year, the heritors 
have contemplated the erection of a new church in a more central 
situation. And although some difficulty has been experienced in 
determining the site that would prove most advantageous for the 
parishioners, it is to be hoped, that this inestimable boon will not 
be long withheld, as it is at present impossible for the aged, the 
infirm, and the young to enjoy the benefits of religious instruction 
in the parish church. 

There is a meeting house near Newport in connection with the 
Independents. The number of families belonging to it is about 
10, and the clergyman is an individual who is highly respected for 
his personal piety, and his anxious endeavours to benefit the neigh- 
bourhood in which he resides. 

The manse, which is in good condition, was built in 1803. The 
stipend is 15 chalders and 6 bolls of meal and barley in equal 
proportions. The glebe contains upwards of 9 acres. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish. The paro- 
chial teacher's salary is the maximum, and the branches taught 
are, English, writing, arithmetic, geography, practical mathema- 
tics, Latin, and French. The number of scholars is about 120, 
and the fees, varying from 2s. 6d. to 5s. per quarter, amount to 
L. 24 per annum. 

A new school-house was erected by the heritors, about ten years 
ago, in a central part of the parish, in consequence of which 
the attendance has greatly increased. And an excellent dwelling-

FIFESHIRE. 



house for the schoolmaster, with a suitable garden attached to it, 
has this year been built adjoining the school-house. 

The other school is kept by two females, and is attended by 
about 30 very young children, who are instructed in some of the 
elementary branches of education. 

Poor. — The average number of regular paupers is from 4 to 
6, who receive a Aveekly allowance of Is., Is. 6d., or 2s. There 
are from 12 to 15 more, who obtain occasional relief in money, 
and regular supplies oC meal and coals. The church-door col- 
lections have hitherto been sufficient for defraying these expenses. 
But, for several years, a heavy charge has been incurred for the 
support of two lunatics, who are boarded in the Dundee asylum. 
There is also a fatuous young man, for whose maintenance a year- 
ly allowance is given from the session funds. 

Inns. — There are two inns and four ale-houses in the parish. 

Fuel. — The only fuel used is coal, which is brought chiefly by 
sea, although tenants and cottars cart it occasionally from the Fife 
coal hills, about ten miles distant. The prices of that which is 
sea-borne is from 4s. to 5s. per bushel. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The more striking differences betwixt the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time when the last Statisti- 
cal Account was published, consist in the improvements that have 
been made in agriculture, which have been such as greatly to in- 
crease the produce, and to improve the appearance of the lands ; in 
the improved state of the roads, some of which, particularly the 
present great road to Newport, were at that time nearly impas- 
sable ; in the important changes that have taken place in regard 
to the Dundee Ferry ; in the large increase that has been made 
to the village of Newport ; in the reclaiming and cultivation of 
much waste land ; and in the plantations that have been made on 
the estates of St Fort and Tayfield. 

By the number and excellent condition of the roads, and the 
ready means of communicating with other parts of the county, 
every obstacle to the farther improvement of the district has been 
removed ; and from the character of the present proprietors and 
tenants, there can be no doubt that these advantages will be made 
available for advancing the prosperity of the parish, and promot- 
ing the welfare of its inhabitants.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, AND SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JOSEPH CRICHTON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

The parish of Ceres contains five separate villages, two of vi'hich 
are of considerable extent. The most extensive of these is Ceres, 
from which the parish takes its name. The second largest village 
is named Craigrothie ; and the third. Chance Inn. Coaltown was 
once a thriving village, inhabited by colliers. 

Name. — The name is to be found in ancient records written

Extent and Boundaries. — The greatest length of this parish is 
about 8 statute miles. The breadth varies from half a mile to 4 
miles. The river Eden runs along the north-west part of the pa- 
rish for a short way. The parishes of Kemback, St Andrews, and 
Cameron, bound Ceres towards the east; Kilconquhar and Largo 
towards the south; Scoonie, Kettle, and Cults towards the west; 
and Cupar towards the north. The boundaries between Cupar 
and Ceres are of a most irregular kind, and the very natives are, 
at some places, puzzled to tell whether they are standing in their 
own parish. 

Climate, Diseases, -c— The climate  mild, and exceedino-jy 
healthful. The fogs that blow from the German Ocean are here 
removed or modified, and the sickly of St Andrews often make a 
salutary sojourn m some part of Ceres, where the east wind is felt 
as a pleasant breeze. The people are, on the whole, a healthy race. 
1 here are one or two persons at present in the parish, above nine- 
ty years of age ; and in Craigrothie, where there are not many more 
than 200 mhabitants, there died lately three women, all of whom 
were above nmety.

It once abounded with excellent trout, but their numbers are 
now greatly diminished ; and, whether from the manufactures 
established on different parts of the river, or from the num- 
bers who go forth to fish with the natural flies, you nmst either 
adopt their cruel mode of fishing, or content yourself with an 
empty basket. There are several streams within the parish. Three 
of them are from the east ; one from the south, and one from the 
west, unite near the village of Ceres, and form what is called 
Ceres burn. It passes through the village, and runs a mile and 
a half, north-east through the parish, and then enters the beautiful 
den of Dara, and shortly afterwards joins the Eden. Ceres burn, 
though at times an apparently harmless and insignificant rivulet, 
occasionally becomes a great and dangerous water. The sudden- 
ness of its swelling adds much to the danger. It has already wash- 
ed away one good stone bridge,  and has threatened its successor. 
There were once a good many trout in Ceres burn, but there are 
now very few. Every part of the parish is well supplied with springs 
or rivulets of excellent water. Several springs are impregnated 
with the quality of the soil out of which they arise. There is a 
mineral spring on the mains of Kirklands, the property of INIr 
Crichton. It possesses valuable medicinal qualities; and, being 
highly impregnated with carbonic acid gas, acts as a grateful sti- 
mulant. 

Geology, Soil, iSfc. — The soil is of great variety. Along the 
banks of the Eden, in the north-west part of the parish, it is light 
and sandy, and chiefly lies upon a freestone rock. The greater 
part of the parish is a deep cold earth, lying upon whinstone rock, 
limestone rock, or tilly clay. In the neighbourhood of the village 
of Ceres, the soil is a free earth, lying upon gravel. The mosses 
and moors, which are mentioned in the former Statistical Account, 
are in great part rendered arable. Along the north side of the 
parish, there is abundance of freestone rock. Whinstone rock 
abounds on the south side. There are several quarries, which are 
very valuable either for the purposes of building or supplying the 
roads with metal. There is a quarry at Pitscottie, to which many 
of the feuars in Ceres have free access in building their houses. 
There are quarries also at Kinninmonth and Craigrothie, which 
are very valuable for the purposes of building. On the farm of 
Newbigging of Craighall, there is a range of basaltic rock or pil- 

 There is a very old and iiii n ow bridge over this water. It stands adjacent jto 
the present, and may likely outlive it, as it outlived its predecessor. Archbisliop 
Sharpc crossed this old bridge in his last and fatal journey from Edinburgh to St 
Andrews, or rather to Magabk moor.

lars, extending for half a mile from north to south. In many places 
columns of immense size have been precipitated from the top of 
the cliff to a great distance. 

Mineralogy. — This parish abounds in minerals. Both coal and 
limestone are found, and regularly worked in several of the adjoining 
parishes, i. e. Cults, Largo, and St Andrews ; and along the whole 
southmost part of this parish, there are appearances both of coal and 
limestone. There is no coal worked now ; but this has arisen from 
the expense of the working, and not from the want of coals. The 
Teasses coals can be traced over a considerable distance of coun- 
try. A line might be traced from Teasses, by Hall Teasses, 
Newbigging, Craighall, and Craighall to Coaltown. About Hall- 
Teasses, the coal is described as very fine, and as gradually becom- 
ing blind and deprived of its bitumen. There are numerous old 
pits between Hall-Teasses and New Guilston. At Craighall 
Castle, the coal is separated from the limestone by a mass of trap, 
which has the effect of tilting the coals and adjoining strata upon 
edge. This tilting up of the strata into an almost vertical position, 
has brought into notice no less than seventeen seams of coal within 
a space of 500 yards. There are, in like manner, seventeen seams 
of coal as near the limestone at Pittenweem. They resemble the 
above, and are named the Ceres coals ; and their individual names 
and thickness, along with the interposing strata, may give an in- 
teresting view of the curious alternations that take place in the 
formation of coal.

The line of coals above-mentioned bears in a direction pa- 
rallel to the limestone. There are nineteen seams of these coals. 
Towards Coaltown they gradually flatten and occupy a greater 
surface of country. Beyond Kinninmont the coals are broken up, 
and some of them driven aside by the eruption of the trap hill of 
Ladedda. The thick coal and other five of the seams are tossed 
up to the top of the hill of Drumcarro, where they are regularly 
wrought. The south slope of Ladedda-hill has many marks of 
old pits upon it, proving that the coals pass along there. The 
limestone which runs parallel with the line of coal is wrought re- 
gularly at present, in four different quarries. There is the Tequ- 
liats quarry ; there are two on Teasses property, and one at La- 
dedda. 

1. The Tequliats lime is wrought by tirring. It is of a spark- 
ling gray colour, and crystalline. It is II feet 6 inches thick, 
and in three beds. Organic remains are exceedingly rare' in this 
quarry. The strata above the limestone are 2 feet 6 inches of 
sklut, then 18 feet of shale — containing a good deal of pyrites, 
which sometimes also occurs in the limestone. Above the shale 
are 6 feet of sandstone, and 4 feet of alluvium. This limestone fol- 
lows the coal, all the way to Craighall, where it has been wrought. 
About six men are generally employed in'this quarry. They reckon 
the dip to be 1 fathom in 4 to S. E. 

2. There is the Woodtop quarry or Teasses middle limestone. 
It is compact, and of a bluish gray colour, contains corallines and 
encrinites, and is less dark than the former limestone. The strata 
above it are 4 feet 6 inches of inferior limestone or sklut, in which 
are numerous fissures filled with beautiful incrustations of calcareous 
spar ; and where the fissures are large, stalactites, and stalagmites 
of a dazzling whiteness are formed. Above the sklut, there are 20 
feet of shale, and 1 foot of alluvium. This limestone is also wrought 
by tirring. It is 10 feet thick, and in four beds. It dips about 1 
fathom in 4. It has been worked for about thirty years, and from 
ten to fifteen men are employed in it. It is used for laying on 



0-ERES- 



521 



land, or for building, and is shipped in considerable quantities from 
the adjoining ports. 

3. There is the Teasses white limestone quarry. The hme- 
stone is 10 feet 6 inches thick, and divided into five beds. Its 
colour is whitish gray, and there would thus seem to be a regu- 
lar progress in changing the colour from Tequliats quarry. This 
white limestone is very compact and difficult to work, — organic re- 
mains very scarce. The dip is 1 fathom in 5 to S. E. The strata 
above it are 5 feet of inferior limestone, containing a large portion 
of argillaceous matter, 14 feet of shale, 7 feet of sandstone, and 
20 feet of ferruginous basalt, disposed in irregular columns or 
blocks. This limestone is wrought under ground. The pillars 
are about 6 feet, and 10 feet between them. It was previously 
wrought by tirring, but has been worked under ground for thirty- 
two years. Eight men are generally employed. They enjoy excel- 
lent health. Indeed, there is something wholesome in the air un- 
der ground ; and more than one martyr to hooping cough have been 
sent by their physician, to keep company with the workmen, 
for greater part of a day, in the hope of curing them. The result 
was generally favourable. About 4000 bolls of this limestone 
are turned out in the year, — it is used for purifying gas, for bleach- 
ing and plastering, as well as for land. 

There is a great similarity between the three limestones already 
mentioned. They are all about one thickness ; their structure 
and fracture resemble each other ; the strata above ihem are si- 
milar, and the organic remains are the same; and in all proba- 
bility, they are the same bed of limestone, thrown up successively 
by faults, passing parallel to their line of bearing. The Teuchats 
limestone appears at Craighall, and has been worked there ; and 
bearing west a little, it trends round in a semicircular form to Ceres 
toll-bar, where it is lost sight of. There is a thin coal found 
under it. The limestone here dips north. It was attempted to be 
wrought, by mining it under the trap hill. They had not, how 
ever, proceeded many yards, when the limestone was found to be 
broken in masses, and full of fissures filled with ferruginous de- 
composed trap, and so much altered as to be unfit for use. The 
roof, though composed of firm shale, could not be supported, from 
the shattered state of the limestone left as pillars. - The mining 
became dangerous, and was consequently abandoned. 

4. The limestone is also wrought at Ladedda ; it gets flat here, or 
assumes the basin form. It is seen on the north side of Ladedda Hill, 



522 



FIFESHIRE. 



dippincr towards it. This limestone is 11 feet thick, of a whitish 
gray colour, and compact structure. It is supposed to extend to the 
trap at the foot of Duncarro Hill. The strata above consist of two 
feet of inferior limestone termed sklut. It is unlike the other 
skluts, and is entirely composed of organic remains, united by a 
calcareous cement, the prevailing fossil being the encrinite, found 
in all positions, dislocated and studded all over, giving it the ap- 
pearance of a conglomerate. There are also found in this sklut 
the shells of the Producta in great abundance, a few Terebratula, 
some fish teeth and scales. Above this sklut are 14 feet of shale, 
4 feet of schistose sandstone ; 2 feet 6 inches of shale ; 15 inches 
of coal ; 2 feet of brown inferior limestone ; 8 yards of various 
strata, hitherto unascertained ; then coal 2 feet 4 inches thick ; 
4 yards of various strata, then another coal 2 feet 6 inches thick, 
then a different kind, i. e. the 6 foot coal inclined at a high angle, 
and then the 10 foot coal, almost all vertical. The limestone is 
wrought by tirring in Ladedda quarry, and from eight to ten men 
are employed in the work. It is impossible, in a work of the pre- 
sent nature, to give a full account of the lime and coal which 
abound in the parish of Ceres ; but it will be apparent, from what 
has been already written, that there is here a very extensive field 
either for theorists or practical speculators; and if the demand 
for coal continues to increase, it will likely be found to be neither 
a bold nor a very profitless speculation to re-open some of the 
coal- works that have been allowed here to get into disuse. Those 
who wish to study the subject fully are referred to a valuable 
article in the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture for June 1836, 
written by Mr David Landale. I have borrowed liberally from 
his article. 

No coal or limestone has hitherto been discovered on the north 
side of Ceres water. There is at Baltullo mill, near Ceres, a seam 
of the " Wright's black coal," which is used for marking. The 
seam is from 18 inches to 2 feet thick. The dip is nearly the 
same as that of the limestone on the south side. Some of this 
black coal was sent to America, and L. 7 was received for one 
ton of it. The proprietor of the ground does not wish it to be 
wrought, and has closed up the quarry. 

II. — Civil History. 
Ceres appears to have been made up, in past generations, of a 
number of distinct baronies. In the parochial registers, of date 
1631, there is particular mention of the various deacons who be-

longed to the several baronies of the parish. These baronies 
were five or six in number. Ceres is a burgh of barony, holding 
of the Hopes of Craighall, and the feuars are bound to attend the 
head courts ; but it has no charter. Hopes are now entertained 
of its receiving the privileges of a burgh. Craigrothie, which is 
adjacent to Struthers, seems to have long enjoyed these privileges. 
Its inhabitants still elect their baihe and councillors ; and two cases 
are on record, where individuals were sent to them for judgment, 
and disposed of according to their pleasure. The Earl of Crawford 
patronized this council, and left an important case to its decision. 

Land-oioners. — The present land-owners are, The Earl of 
Glasgow ; Mr Wilson, Craigrothie ; Captain Wemyss, Wemyss 
Hall ; Sir George Campbell, Edenwood ; Major Christie, Findas ; 
Captain Ker, Greenside ; Captain Stark, Teasses ; Sir Alexander 
Hope, Craighall; Messrs Thoms, Rumgay; Mr Thomson, Newbig- 
ging; Mr Lumsden, Callange ; Mr Speirs, Kinninmont ; Mr Ped- 
dle, Bankhead ; Lady Baird, East Pitscottie ; Baldinnie is divided 
into seven shares ; General Bethune of Blebo ; Mr Barclay of 
Magus ; and Mr Normand of BaltuUo. 

The original proprietors of Craighall and Struthers seem to 
have possessed great part of the parish ; and many valuable pro- 
perties are still held in feu from the Hopes of Craighall. These 
feus, in former times, were equal to the full value of the rent of the 
property ; but at present, from the rise in the value of land, they 
are equal to about one-sixth of the rent which is paid by the far- 
mer to the feuar. 

Parochial Registers. — The records of the kirk-session are in pre- 
servation, from the year 1620; and from that date to the present, 
they have been kept regularly. Under date 1638, we find an account 
of the Confession of Faith, which was agreed to in 1 560, and imme- 
diately after it, a solemn declaration or covenant, in which the no- 
bility and gentry bind themselves to stand by the confession, and 
to withstand the many attempts which were then made against 
their religion. This declaration is signed at the kirk of Ceres, 
" the last day of Apryll 1638," by " Lindesay," " Hy. Ja. Hope," 
and Jo. Scott," the minister, elders, and heads of families. In 
1667, William Rowe, minister of Ceres, had been deposed, be- 
cause he would not conform to Episcopacy ; and we find, in the re- 
cords of that date, an edict by " Lord St Andrews," appointing 
Alexander Leslie to be minister in the room of Mr Rowe.- 

In a case ol horse-stealing, sentence of banishment was passed and executed.

Antiquities.— There is a great variety of antiquities in this pa- 
rish. There are three very fine ruins. The ruins of Craichall 
stand about half a mile south-east of Ceres, upon the north bank 
of a lovely den. The den is sequestered and deep, and of consi- 
derable extent, and well wooded. The ruins still have an ap- 
pearance of grandeur, and serve to indicate what had been the 
magnificence of the mansion. Craighall was formerly the seat of 
Sir Thomas Hope, King's Advocate, from whom the principal fa- 
milies in Scotland of the name of Hope are descended, and it con- 
tinued to be the residence of Sir Thomas's heirs till the beginning 
of the last century, when it was sold to another branch of the fa- 
mily, who succeeded to be Earls of Hopetoun. It is now the pro- 
perty of Sir Alexander Hope, brother to the late John, Earl of 
Hopetoun. 

There are also the ruins of Struthers, or, as it is called in some 
old papers, Auchter-uther-Struther. This was formerly the seat 
of the Earls of Crawford, and it stands about two miles south-west 
from the village of Ceres. Man has been less merciful to this 
place than " time ;" and there now exist very scanty remains of the 
once splendid house, and warlike towers and battlements. The 
park around the house, which is enclosed with a stone wall, contains 
about 200 acres of ground. The venerable beeches of a very large 
size, which are mentioned in the last Statistical Account, have died 
or been cut down. 

There is a fine tower of freestone, well hewn and nicely jointed. 
The tower is about 24 feet square, and about 50 or 60 feet high. 
It stands upon an eminence, commands a fine prospect, and is seen 
at a great distance in different directions. It is formed by one lofty 
vault on the top of another. Upon the top of the uppermost, which 
is surrounded with a battlement, there is an apartment covered with 
slate. It stands about a mile and a half west from the village of 
Ceres. It was the dwelling-place of the family in 1662, for in 
April 29 we find this notice, " The Lady Scotstaret, younger, 
married to the Laird of Erdlee, surnamed Preston. The marrkge 
feast stood at Tarvet." 

Remarkable Events.~On Wednesday, the 5th day of October 
1785, Sig. Vincentius Lunardi, a Florentine, having ascended at 
Edinburgh, in an air balloon, at three o'clock afternoon, descended 
a mile to the eastward of Ceres, at twenty minutes past four p. m. 
This was the first aerial voyage made in Scotland, and the daring 
adventurer, in performing it, passed over about twenty miles of sea, 



CERES.

and about twelve of land. The house is still standing in which 
he was received on his descent. , 

Eminent Persons. — Lindsay of Pitscottie, author of an enter- 
taining history of Scotland, was a native of the parish of Ceres, 
and proprietor of a small estate in it. 

Thomas Buchanan, rector of Ceres, who lived immediately after 
the Reformation, was a man of considerable abilities, and of great 
influence in the church. 

Mr Thomas Haliburton, minister of Ceres, and afterwards Pro- 
fessor of Divinity at St Andrews, was esteemed both as a divine 
and as a scholar, and wrote several pious and learned treatises. 

Modei-n Buildings. — Since the date of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, there have been built two uncommonly good mansion-houses 
on the properties of Teasses and Edenwood. The one on the for- 
mer property is built so as to command a splendid view of the Frith 
of Forth.

In 1755, the population was 2540

Since 1831, there has been a great increase in the number of 
the people ; and, from the accounts of their establishments, which 
were lately given in by the several manufacturers in the parish, we 
are authorized to say, that the population must now be about 3000 
at least. In 1793, 138 looms are said to have been employed in 
the parish. From 700 to 900 of the inhabitants are now employed 
in weaving and winding. From 170 to 200 are employed regularly 
in the mills ; and, with the exception of about 30, who are employ- 
ed in the lime-works, the greater part which remains of the work- 
ing population is agricultural. The town of Cupar is so near to 
Ceres, that there are few shopkeepers or venders of any commodi- 
ties in the latter place. 

Character and Habits of the People.— T\ie people are univer- 
sally uidustrious, and in general they cultivate the sister virtues 
of temperance and frugality. Considerable attention to neat- 
ness and cleanhness also may be discovered among them. Dr Ar- 
not, author of the former account, mentions, that among the wo- 
men, the cloak and bonnet had become substitutes for the plaid ; 
and among the men, that the bonnet was supplanted by the hat. 



526 



PIFESHIRE. 



It is singular enough, that the plaid and bonnet should now be both 
regaining their former estimation. There exists also among the 
people a considerable deal of information, and a general desire for 
knowledge. A subscription and circulating library was commenced 
by them in 1828. It consists now of 500 volumes, in which there 
is varied as well as much useful reading. There are 100 subscrib- 
ers to this library. 

During the last three years, there were 3 illegitimate births in 
the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The valued rent of the parish is L. 8248, Is. Id. 
Scotch. There are 8000 acres of land in the parish. Of these, about 
four-tenths are in tillage, five-tenths in grass, and one-tenth in plant- 
ing and moor. There is little of moor land. The average rent per 
acre is L. 1, 10s. The farm-houses, and the enclosures on the 
farms, are, in general, good. The produce does not exceed greatly 
the double of the rent, which is paid from the land. The gross pro- 
duce cannot be much under 30,000 bolls of corn, and 15,000 do. 
potatoes. Dr Arnot, in his time, makes 12,000 of corn and 2000 
of potatoes  But in a parish where so many have their patch of 
corn, and their planting of potatoes, in addition to their live-stock, 
it is impossible to form a correct estimate of the real produce. 
About ninety years ago, there were 20 flocks of sheep kept in the 
parish. Now there is not one ; but there is a great number of 
cattle fed for the market. The last Statistical Account states 90 
to be the number of ploughs. They are now 130 at least. A 
quantity of pork also is sent from this to London. 

The rent of a cottage is L. 2. It is to be regretted, however, 
that the cottar system does not prevail to any extent here. The 
farms vary in extent from 40 to 365 Scotch acres. The farmers 
have adopted, with great success, the various improvements that have 
been lately suggested in the system of agriculture, and the land is 
everywhere in a high state of cultivation. Draining has been car- 
ried on to a very great extent ; and as there are either quarries or 
plenty of stones in the neighbourhood, the drains are almost all 
regularly built. The fields are well enclosed, and in general with 
stone fences. There is one thrashing-mill, which is driven by steam, 
three thrashing-mills, and one mill for making butter, driven 
by water. There is also one windmill, which thrashes corn, and 
makes meal, and saws wood. It was erected on the property of 
Greenside, by the present proprietor, and serves admirably for the

three purposes above-mentioned. It is the only one, I believe, in 
the county of Fife. A great quantity of lime has been laid out 
on the several farms in the parish. The farmers, as a body of 
men, are of an enterprising and industrious spirit ; and, as they 
have lime and stones near at hand, and other necessaries for im- 
proving land, they have not been slow to avail themselves of these 
means. The quantity of water which abounds in the parish, and 
often overflows the land, is the great obstacle to improvement in 
agriculture. On one farm, during the late wet season, about 1000 
cart-loads of surface were carried off half an acre of land. 

The leases are, in general, of nineteen years' duration. 

Manufactures. — Since the date of the last Statistical Account 
three spinning-mills have been built in the parish, and a bleach- 
field establishment has been erected at Duraden. In 1827, two 
mills were built on the grounds of Easter Pitscottie. The ma- 
chinei'y is propelled partly by water, and partly by steam. The 
steam, in general, is only required in summer, occasionally when 
the water is light. The mills belong to Messrs William and James 
Yool, manufacturers, Ceres. There is accommodation for the fa- 
milies of the workers in the buildings at these mills ; and they con- 
tain altogether upwards of 150 individuals. There is a teacher and 
a small library attached to the mills. The other spinning-mill, 
which belongs to Mr David Yool, was erected at Tarvit in 1799. 
The machinery at this mill goes partly by water, and partly by 
steam ; and the power is applied also to the turning of a saw-mill. 
The three spinning-mills are occupied in preparing and spinning 
flax, tow, and yarns. The raw material is obtained from Dundee : 
and the yarns are sent partly to the Dundee market, and partly to 
manufacturers in Fife. 150 men, women, and young people are em- 
ployed. The bleachfield establishment was erected in 1825 by some 
manufacturers in Ceres. It has received the name of St Ann's 
Bleaching Company, from a well of that name in the vicinity. 
The number of hands employed varies from 35 to 40. The sup- 
ply of brown raw material for it, is chiefly obtained from the mills 
already mentioned. Previous to the erection of this bleachfield, 
little was manufactured by the weavers in Ceres except « Brown 
Silesias ;" now the yarns are all cleaned and bleached, and the 
people are employed in weaving dowlas and sheeting. From 700 
to 900 are engaged in this employment ; and from L. 50,000 to 
L. 60,000 Sterling worth of dowlas and sheeting are annually ma- 
nufactured in the parish. To any one who reads this statement

of the manufacture, it will be evident that the various works are 
most profitably arranged. The mills supply the bleachfield, and 
the bleachfield supplies the weavers : and while there is a saving, 
in this manner, as to the carriage of the various articles, there is 
also an encouragement to the manufacture of the place. There 
is every likelihood that the manufacture of this flourishing place 
will, in a few years, become more extended ; and there are, at pre- 
sent, some proposals of erecting another mill on a very extensive 
plan. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — There is a weekly market in Cupar, the county own, 
distant only two miles and a-half. But this widely extended parish 
has an easy access to markets in several places : and some of the 
farmers find it convenient to send their produce to Largo, some to 
St Andrews, and a very few to Dundee. There are two annual 
markets or fairs held in the village of Ceres, — one on the 24th 
June, and the other on the 20th day of October ; and both of them 
are most numerously resorted to, as excellent wool, and corn, and 
horse, and cattle-markets. 

Means of Communication. — A turnpike road runs from east to 
west through the whole length of the parish. There is also a road 
which runs from north to south, through the breadth of the parish. 
In summer, a daily-coach runs though Ceres, and joins the steam- 
boat which leaves Largo for Edinburgh. A messenger, paid by 
the inhabitants of Ceres, carries letters or papers daily to Cupar, 
the post-town. There are regular carriers from Ceres to all the 
neighbouring towns. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Ceres parish is a rectory, which, before 
the Reformation, belonged to the Provostry of Kirkheugh, a re- 
ligious house at St Andrews. A considerable part of the east end 
of the parish formerly belonged to the parish of St Andrews, and 
about the year 1620, was annexed to Cere, quoad sacra tantiim, 
as it was long thought; but the present incumbent discovered 
that there was no such reservation, and it is now annexed, quoad 
sacra et civilia. Ceres originally belonged to St Andrews pres- 
bytery. In the old church of Ceres, tliere was an aisle on the 
south, which belonged to the family of Craighall, and which, be- 
fore the Reformation, was a chapel dedicated to St Ninian. The 
schoolmaster of Ceres uniformly receives a presentation to the 
chaplainry. There used to be a salary of L. 3 Scots paid to him ; 
but the houses in Cupar from which this salary was paid cannot

now be discovered. The present church was built in 1806. It 
stands on a height, where formerly stood the old church and cha- 
pel : it was situated on the outskirts of the old town, but since the 
new town or Bridge-end was built, it may be said to be in the cen- 
tre of the village. It is seated for 1100, but actually holds 
1300, and the seats are very advantageously disposed both for 
hearers and speaker. These seats aU belong to the heritors of 
the parish, and there is no rent charged for the use of them. 
Seats are appropriated for the proprietors and farmers, and the 
remainder are free and open to the people, and, except on very 
bad days, they are well filled. There are two meetings in the 
church, winter and summer. The average number of com- 
municants is 1000. The right of patronage, by a grant from the 
Crown, was vested in . the Crawford family. The stipend, by a 
decreet of the Court of Teinds, was fixed at 16 chalders victual, 
half meal, half barley. The manse was built in 1 788, and has had 
little alteration or repair since that time. The glebe consists of 7 
acres of excellent land. 

There are also two meeting-houses in the village of Ceres, one 
for the Associate Congregation of Antiburgher Seceders, which 
was built in 1744, the other for the Presbytery of Relief. To 
each of these are attached a settled clergyman and regular con- 
gregation. A brotherly feeling and Christian spirit pervades the 
greater number of the members of these three congregations ; 
and you will occasionally find them in each others place of wor- 
ship. 

There are about 86 families in this parish attached to the Re- 
lief Church, and about the same number to the Secession. 

Education. — There are one parochial, one Secession school, and 
three contribution schools, besides the schools at Pitscottieand Tar- 
vit Mills. There are also two female schools, besides one or two small 
private schools. By a contract entered into, anno 1631, between Sir 
Thomas Hope, advocate to Charles I., on the one part, and Lord 
Lindsay, patron of the parish, the heritors thereof, the minister, and 
kirk-session on the other part ; Sir Thomas Hope,in consequence of 
mortifying 100 merks Scotch yearly, for the benefit of the school- 
master, was to have the right of presenting the schoolmaster. 
The right of trial and admission was to be vested in the minister 
and session. In this state the matter still continues. The 
schoolmaster receives the value of this mortification in addition to 
his salary, which is the maximum. The average number of scho-

lars who attend at this parish school is 150, The fees may amount 
to L. 65 per annum. 

In October 1836, the scholars entered the new school-house, 
which had been built by the heritors for their additional accommo- 
dation, and which would easily contain 200 scholars and upwards. 
It is a very handsome building, and far surpasses the common 
structure of school-houses. The exterior is elegantly finished, 
and the interior is in harmony with the outward appearance. This 
attention to the comfort and health of the young is an act of true 
mercy, for which the parents cannot be too thankful. The heri- 
tors propose to build a dwelling-house for the teacher. 

One of the other schools is held in the village of Craigrothie. 
A school and school-house were built by subscription in 1806; 
and ground was given by the proprietor of Craigrothie, who still 
contributes to the support of the teacher. Excepting this contri- 
bution, the fees are the only support of this teacher. From 60 to 
70 scholars attend him. There is a Sunday evening school, which 
is attached to this school, as well as to the parochial one, and each 
of them have got libraries for the use of those who attend. Their 
is also another Sunday school in Ceres, which possesses a library 
for the use of the young. About 50 or 60 girls attend one of the 
female schools, which is kept in the village of Ceres. 

Societies. — In 1795, a Friendly Society was established in the 
village of Ceres. It now consists of 200 members, and it possesses 
a capital of L. 600, which is laid out on heritable security at 5 
per cent. The sum of 4s. 6d. is annually contributed by each of 
the members, — and this small contribution entitles them to receive 
4s. a week, if for a time they should be conjined to bed ; or 2s. if 
they are merely unable to work. To those who are superannuated, 
and have no hope of returning to work, Is. 6d. a week is given. 
This society has been the means of enabHng many to enjoy vari- 
ous comforts during sickness. In 1765, a branch of the Grand 
Mason Lodge of Scotland was established in Ceres. Its members 
are numerous, and 60 of them have joined themselves into a 
Friendly Society. They contribute 6s. annually, and during the 
time of sickness they receive 3s. 6d. a week. There is also in 
Craigrothie a Friendly Society, which was formed in 1825. The 
number of its members at present is 60. The object of this So- 
ciety is to give aid to members when in sickness, and to widows, 
when the funds can afford. The funds are .at present in so flour- 
ishing a state, that the society gives 15s. a year to widows.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Besides the usual funds for the poor 
which arise from collections at the church, and from dues on mar- 
riages, &amp;c. there is the rent of three acres which were left to the ses- 
sion, and also the interest of L. 460, which was left by the late 
Miss Halkerston of Carskardo. Originally, this sum was L. 500, 
but the necessary expenses on legacies have reduced it to L. 460. 
It is lent out at 4 per cent. There is no regular assessment. 
But the heritors, every year, make a voluntary assessment, so as to 
meet all deficiencies in the other sources. The church collection 
may amount to L. 60 per annum. There is a great deal of 
money expended for the good of the poor in a private way, 
by benevolent individuals who reside in the parish. This private 
charity falls, of course, very heavily on the few heritors who reside 
in the parish, and to whom frequent applications are made. A 
certain quantity of coals and meal is annually distributed among 
the poor, at the private expense of some of the heritors. The 
average number of poor on the roll is 50, and the yearly expen- 
diture is about L. 120. 

Fuel. — There is an abundant supply of good Scotch coal in the 
neighbourhood ; and in common seasons coal is the cheapest fuel. 

Inns. — The number of inns may be about 25. Their corrupt- 
ing influence has not hitherto been very general.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. HENRY D. COOK, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography AND Natural History. 

Situation and Boundaries. — The parish of Kilmany is situate 
in the north-east district of the presbytery of Cupar, in the county 
of Fife. It is bounded on the east by Forgan ; on the south by 
Logie; on the west by Dairsie, Cupar, and Moonzie ; and on the 
north by Creech and Balmerino. The small village in which the 
church is placed lies at nearly equal distance from Cupar, the 
county town, and Newport, which is now the principal ferry to Dun- 
dee, and the north, from Edinburgh and the south of Scotland. 
The distance from each of these places is nearly five miles. 
The parish constitutes a part of that rich and fertile valley which 
commences at the low grounds of Forgan and Leuchars, on the 
.east, and runs through the north of Fife to the west, by Rathil- 
let, Letham, and the new inn on the left hand ; and to Newburgh 
by Denbog, on the right. 

Name. — The origin of the name is Celtic; some supposing that 
it means the Church of the Monks, although there are no remains 
of such a building. Others think, that it signifies the church in 
the valley, — which is characteristic of its situation. 

Extent. — The length of Kilmany, from east to west, is 6 miles ; and 
through the whole of it runs the high road from Newport to Edin- 
burgh by Luthrie and Melville Gates, &amp;c. It is narrow towards the 
east, but it gradually widens to the west. The greatest breadth be- 
twixt Hazleton walls, and the south boundary of Myre-Cairnie, is 
four miles. The shape of the parish resembles that of a bottle, the 
manse and church being placed at the neck of it. The hills 
by which the valley is formed are branches of the Ochils. Their 
shape is peculiar, and almost uniform. From the east, they gra- 
dually ascend to a considerable height, and suddenly fall towards 
the west. This is not only the case with the large range which se- 
parates Kilmany from the Tay ; but also with the smaller ridges 
which at different places divide the parish. The principal range 



KILMANY. 



533 



is extensive, and at some places rises more than 400 feet above 
the level of the sea. It terminates at Newton, three miles to the 
east of Kilmany ; the southern branch of the Ochils, which forms 
this valley, lies in Logie parish, and extends towards Leuchars. 
Goales den is the only fissure of any importance in the parish. It 
is a beautiful and romantic spot, and I daresay would afford ample 
materials for the speculations of the geologist. It is a deep cut 
in Kilmany hill, looking towards the south, through which a small 
rivulet flows from the higher grounds, and by which, during the 
course of ages, it was probably formed. It is almost dry in sum- 
mer ; but in winter after storms, it sends down a considerable 
quantity of water to the Motray. It was planted with great taste 
by the late proprietor, Mr Thomson, and beautiful walks were 
made through it; but these, since his lamented death, have been 
permitted in a great degree, to go out of order. 

Hydrography. — The valley itself presents some striking features. 
The lower part of it has been under water to a considerable length 
and depth. This is evident from the height of the sandy hillocks 
scattered through the lands of East Kinnear, and from the nature 
and formation of the mound, upon which the village and church of 
Kilmany are built. From the elevation of these, above the bot- 
tom of the valley, the water must have stood 20 feet above the 
channel of the Motray. From the nature of the sand deposited, 
it is probable that the east part of the valley formed an extensive 
lake. The grains of it are soft and small, and do not resemble the 
hard sharp sand which is found upon the sea shore. The upper 
part of the valley has also been under water, but rather as a marsh 
than deep standing water. The shape of the different hillocks 
and mounds shows that the lake has been gradually formed ; the 
sides of them rise with a gentle slop, and, generally speaking, the 
tops of them are smooth. There must have been some barrier to 
the east of Kinnear, which prevented the Motray having free ac- 
cess to the ocean ; but the precise place where it was cannot now 
be ascertained. How it was removed, is equally uncertain ; the 
height of the water, accumulated for ages, probably forced a pas-- 
sage for itself to the sea, and left the valley a morass, which it 
contmued to be for ages. It is not above fifty years since a great 
part of it was drained, and converted into excellent arable land. 
There is a vague tradition that there was once a passage boat upon 
this lake to Cruvie and Straiten, and in confirmation of this, it 
IS stated that a small alichor was found when the meadows were 
first ploughed.

FIFESHIRE. 



The Motray takes its rise from the different sides of Norman's 
Law ; from east of these, a small stream proceeds, and they unite 
before they enter the parish at Starr. Its course is through the 
lowlands of Starr, Murdo-Cairnie, and Mountquhanie ; it bounds 
the back fields of Rathillet and Newbigging, where it is not seen 
from the public road ; it again appears flowing through Kilmany- 
den, crosses the high road at the mill, and continues its course to 
the Eden by Kilmany church and the two Kinnears. In summer, 
it is a small stream not ten feet broad, and one deep ; but in win- 
ter, it often assumes a threatening appearance. It then not only 
fills but overflows its banks, and affords to the Eden a great mass 
of water. It turns in this parish three corn mills, one thrashing 
mill and one saw mill. 

There is another small stream, which has its source to the east 
of Rathillet school. Its name is Cluthie or Colluthie. It joins 
the Motray below the church. Its whole course is little more 
than a mile. The water of it is pure and excellent, and it does 
not become dry during the hottest summers. It is the boundary 
betwixt Kilmany and the estate of Forret, in Logic parish There 
are two other small burns, one of which passes through Lochnia- 
lonie and Rathillet, and the other, which is the south boundary of 
the parish below Myre-Cairnie, does not fall into the Motray. 
The parish, from these streams, is admirably adapted for grazing. 

Climate. — The climate of Kilmany, from its situation, is mild 
and pleasant. The heat in summer, in the morning, and fore- 
noon, is sometimes oppressive ; but not often so ; and by the af- 
ternoon, the wind goes round to the east, and gives us a cooling 
breeze fromthe German Ocean. The coldin winter isseldom intense ; 
but the one, from the commencement of January 1838, is an excep- 
tion from this remark. The thermometer on the evening of the 
14th of February stood at 6 of Fahrenheit. It must have been 
lower than this, during the night ; and at nine next morning, it was at 
9. I have kept the thermometer regularly for the last seven years : 
— but during that period there has been no cold so intense as that 
which I have now mentioned. To give a fair idea of the pres- 
sure, and the temperature of the atmosphere, I send an average ot 
the one, and the other, for the months of 1835 and 1836. It is 
accurately drawn up by my friend, Mr M'Gillivray, parochial teach- 
er, from a record of the weather, daily and regularly kept by my- 
self. The barometer is marked at nine morning and eleven at night, 
the thermometer at nine morning, twelve at noon, and eleven at night.

In 1835, the greatest cold was during the night of January 18th. 
The thermometer stood at 18. The greatest heat was, on August 
18th, 76. Greatest cold, 1836, November the 9th, 22i. The 
greatest heat, August 11th, 74. The greatest height of barome- 
ter 1835, was 20, January 3d being 30.8tV the lowest October 
26, 28.7. In 1836 barometer highest, May 14th, 30.6|, lowest, 
October 13th '28.7. The weather is often cold and ungenial 
in March, April, and the beginning of May, the wind being in an 
ea.st or south-east direction. Our highest winds in spring and 
autumn are from the south-west. The willow trees all lie from 
that direction — but our greatest falls of rain and snow are invari- 
ably from the east or south-east. Since 1827 until March last, 
the roads in winter have not been completely blocked up ; and when 
they were difficult to pass, this arose more from the snow being 
drifted than from any serious fall. The harvest has commenced, 
in this valley, since 1821, as follows.

The earliest harvest for the last seventeen years being 221 of 
July 1826, and the latest September 16th 1823. This statement 
IS the best practical account of the climate of Kilmany and its 
neighbourhood. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— On these subjects, it is enough here 
to state, that the principal range of hills to the north of Kilmany is 
composed of trap or whinstone. There are various kinds of this rock. 
There is a dark blue species on Kinnear and East Kilmany, which 
is hard, and brittle, and with difficulty stands the operations of the 
hammer. It is in a solid body, and must be separated from the pa- 
rent mass by gunpowder. There is another species of this rock on 
West Kilmany. It is equally hard, its colour is lighter blue, and 
its grain considerably coarser and more tenacious. It is difficult to 
work ; but, by hard labour, it can be cut into any size and form, for 
building. It appears in the quarry in great blocks,— separated 
from one another, by a thin coating of a substance like yellow ochre. 
Judging from an imperfect examination, the quarry behind Mount- 
quhanie, is of the same description. On the top and face of the hills, 
when it has been long exposed to the weather, it assumes the aspect 
of rotten rock. On the lower range of hills, such as are behind West 
Kilmany farm house, it is not in solid masses, which need to be blown ; 
but can be separated into comparatively small pieces, by the com- 
mon pick or lever. From this species of trap, some of the roads in 
the neighbourhood are repaired. At Hill-Cairnie and Myre-Cair- 
nie, at the south-west of the parish, the hills assume a different 
appearance, although they are of the trap species. The rocks, of 
which they are composed, are equally hard with the trap, on the 
north range; but the colour, instead of a dark blue, consists of a 
dirty white, mixed with red ; they are well adapted for coarse build- 
ing, for dikes, and drains, and for metal to the roads. When 
properly chosen and shaped, they look tolerably well for buildings 
of higher pretensions. The whole of Mr Russell xf Hill-Cairnie''s 
steading, which is the most substantial in the parish, with the ex- 
ception of the cornerstones, hntels, and skews, is built of this stone. 
There are various other kinds of the trap family scattered amongst

Zoology, Sfc. — In addition to those birds which are common 
throughout the country, the pheasant has been partially introdu- 
ced amongst us ; but, from the want of cover, they are by no means 
numerous, and, fiom the same cause, will not become so. The 
parish is visited by the common and larger snipe ; and occa-

sionally during winter, by the woodcock. Immense flocks of 
wild geese traverse the air and the fields in spring and autumn ; 
and in winter, wheq the weather is mild ; but from the open nature 
of the country, few of them fall by the gun of the sportsman. 
Wild ducks were at one time common ; but they have, in a great 
degree, retired before the agricultural improvements which have 
taken place. A few of them are still occasionally seen about 
Kilmany mill-dam, and upon the Motray. The same may be 
said of the water hen, or common gallinule. The heron is seen ; 
but does not build in the parish. The yellow wagtail is also rare. 
The ringdove produces in abundance, and for some years past 
has become a nuisance to the farmer. In winter, they fly in flocks, 
and during a storm, attack every thing green which appears above 
the snow. They are particularly severe upon the turnip crops. 
Many acres of this valuable root are annually severely damaged 
by this destructive bird. Means should be employed by proprie- 
tors and tenants to diminish their numbers. The lapwing ap- 
pears in March and April, and the corncrake's voice is heard dur- 
ing the summer, from May to October. Both these birds disap- 
pear before the winter. During a storm, or rather at the approach 
of it, various species of gulls are seen in flocks on the fields, mixing 
with the common crow. They appear upon these occasions to 
feed on the worms turned up by the plough, and to devour what- 
ever grain or seeds come in their way. 

The Motray was once famous as a fishing stream. Its course 
was not direct, nor its waters equally shallow, as they now are ; 
but at every turn, there were excellent pools or crannies, where 
the finny race could harbour, feed, and grow to maturity. By 
the improvements in agriculture, its character, in this respect, is 
in a great degree lost. It now assumes the aspect of a large even 
drain. As such, it has answered the excellent purposes for which 
it was cast. It has converted a large tract of marshy ground into 
rich and productive fields ; but it has removed those corners and 
holes, where trout, pike, and minnows delight to dwell The 
angler is now seldom seen on its banks ; and when he does appear, 
his labour and patience receive a very poor reward. 

There are no very rare species of animals found in this neigh- 
bourhood. The roe-deer was for a long time banished fi ■om this 
part o the country, but of late has again made its appearance. A 
much larger spec.es of deer, at one period, must have existed in 
this parish, and neighbom-hood. This is evident from some fossil 



538 



FIFESniRE. 



remains which were some years ago ploughed up in Hill-Cairnie 
Myre. One skeleton of the deer species was found with immense 
horns, both in point of height and breadth. It is now in the pos- 
session of Professor Fleminfj of Aberdeen. This must either have 
been a distinct species from any which we now meet with ; or the 
roe-deer, enjoying perfect liberty, abundance of meat, and extent 
of country, and, freed from the presence and persecution of man, 
must then have reached a size of which, in the present day, we 
have no conception. The badger is seldom seen ; and I was not 
aware that the otter was ever seen here, until last year. 

Woods. — Along with the writer of the last Statistical Account, 
we have to lament the want of woods and plantations. With these 
judiciously scattered through the parish, and on the hill-tops, KiU 
many would present a scene which the man of taste would delight 
to contemplate. But, by most of the heritors, liltle has been done 
to make it one of the most beautiful parishes in Scotland. From 
this censure, David Gillespie, Esq., and John A. Thomson, Esq. 
and Captain Pearson, are excepted. Mountquhanie, under the 
fostering hands of Mr Gillespie, has become a splendid residence. 
The woods planted by him, on the neighbouring hills, to the north- 
west and south, are yearly adding to the charms of his estate. The 
state of Kilmany, in this respect, was equally improved by the cor- 
rect taste of the late Mr Thomson. The hills which separate 
Kilmany from the Tay were planted by him, and are now clothed 
with trees. Walks were cut through them, from which the Tay, 
the Carse of Gowrie, and the Angus hills are seen. Myre-Cair- 
nie-hill, and the top of the ridge, which runs from it towards the 
east, are completely covered with wood, affording a striking object 
to the eye, and shelter, and climate to the soil. Whilst on these 
properties, the plantations have been increased, — on other estates, 
they have been considerably diminished. The beautiful hdl of 
Rathillet, which was covered with fine dark fir trees, is now bare 
almost to its summit. A part of it has been again planted with 
larch, but many years must elapse before it regains its late splen- 
did and romantic appearance. The plantations on the top of East 
Kinnear are now being cut. However much their removal will 
add to the arable acres of the farm, it does not improve its external 
appearance. It has given to this estate, when viewed from the 
south, a cold and bleak aspect, which it did not formerly possess. 
The old wood of the parish is about the mansion houses of Mount- 
quhanie, Lochmalonie, and Rathillet, &amp;c. ; and some fine trees 



KILMANY. 



539 



are about the village and cliurch of Kilmany. The wood prin- 
cipally planted is the larch, the Scotch fir, the plane, the beech, 
and the ash, with a few oaks interspersed. They all, from 
their rapid growth, appear to be congenial to the soil and climate. 
The oldest tree is supposed to be a plane, which is still vigorous, 
at Hill-Cairnie. 

IL — Civil History. 

Eminent Men-. — Halkerstones of Rathillet. — The individual con- 
nected with the parish who holds the greatest place in the history of 
his country, is the famous but unfortunate David Hackston, or Hal- 
kerstone of Rathillet. It is not known whether he was born at his fa- 
mily seat; the records of the kirk-session do not go back so far. He 
appears to have been a man of talent, energy, and courage, and a 
friend of civil and religious liberty. He had great influence over the 
party with whom he acted. He was connected with the men who 
killed Archbishop Sharp on Magus Muir, although he was not actu- 
ally concerned in the murder ; for which crime he was condemned, 
and executed at Edinburgh in the cruellest and most barbarous 
manner. His descendants possessed a considerable share of his 
talents and courage. One of them was engaged on the Whig side 
in the Rebellion of 1715; and long after this affair was ended, 
rode a fine horse, which he himself took from the enemy. An- 
other of them, was sheriff of the county. The last male branch 
of the family was Mr Helenus Halkerston, a man well known in 
his day, for his talents and eccentricity. He sold the estate of 
Rathillet to a Mr Sweet, upon particular conditions, about the 
year 1772 or 1773. Since the death of Miss Halkerston of Car- 
phin, which took place thirty years ago, this respectable family is 
extinct, at least in this part of the country. 

Clergymen. — Since the Revolution, this parish has been blessed 
with several eminent clergymen. Mr Alexander Pitcairn, Mr 
Brown, and Mr Smibert, who held the benefice in succession, from 
February 23d 1697, to April 4th 1739, appear from the minutes 
which were kept by them to have been able and intelligent men, 
and they died ministers of Kilmany. Mr Joseph M'Cormick 
succeeded Mr Smibert in April 17th 1760, and continued 
in the parish only for a. few months; he left it in the follow- 
ing November. He afterwards published the Life of Principal 
Carstairs of Edinburgh, and died Principal of the United College 
of St Andrews. Mr William Gibb was then ordained minister in 
September 24th 1761. This gentleman, for some cause not stated 



540 



FIFESHIRE. 



in the minutes of session, was not popular as a minister, principally, 
I believe, from non-residence in the parish. A number of parish- 
ioners seceded from the church, and built the meeting-house at 
Rathillet, which continues to this day. He was soon presented to 
the church of Uphall, by the Earl of Buchan, and was succeeded 
in May the 10th 1764, by Mr John Adamson. He wasmost popu- 
lar, not more from the eloquence of his preaching than the excel- 
lence of his private character, and the kindness of his heart. Mr 
Adamson was called to a much wider field of usefulness, to the 
second charge of St Andrews, in October 1772. He died in 
1808, first minister of that city, and Professor of Civil History in 
the United College. He was succeeded by Mr Andrew Hutton, 
from Cults, an amiable man, a conscientious minister, and a con- 
siderable antiquary, who died at Kilmany 1792. He was succeed- 
ed by my late brother, Mr John Cook, of whose talents and ac- 
quirements, and virtues, it would be indelicate for me, who loved 
and revered him from my infancy, to speak. He left the parish 
in 1802, for the Hebrew Chair at St Andrews, and died in 1824, 
after having filled the divinity chair of St Mary's from 1808. He 
published in 1821 his " Inquiry into the Books of the New Tes- 
tament," which contains the substance of a very small part of his 
course of lectures on theology. He was succeeded in May 13th 
1803, by even then the brilliant and accomplished Mr Thomas 
Chalmers, and now the well-known and justly celebrated Professor 
of Divinity in Edinburgh. This distinguished clergyman, who was 
beloved and admired by all classes of the community, and whose name 
is still dear to every one who sat under his ministry, discharged the 
duties of this sequestered parish until July 1815. His first works 
were written and published while he was minister of Kilmany. The 
present incumbent has enjoyed this benefice, since September 28th 
1815. It would be unfair, in this place, to pass in silence the late 
Rev. John Tindal, Minister at Rathillet. By nature, he was a 
man of a sound and vigorous mind, and of the most amiable and 
generous dispositions. He assiduously cultivated the talents with 
which he was gifted, and had acquired a great store of varied and 
extensive information. He died in September 15th 1836. 

Land-owners. — The landed proprietors, according to their va- 
lued rent, are the following gentlemen : — David Gillespie, Esq. 
of Kirkton and Mountquhanie, the principal heritor ; John A. 
Thomson, Esq. of Charleton and Kilmany, &amp;c. ; Charles Kinnear,

Inglis' property are in Kilmany parish. 

Parochial Begisters. — The parochial registers T examined with 
great care in November 1828, and I then made the following mi- 
nute with regard to them : Kilmany, November 16th 1828, " I 
have examined with considerable care the records of the session of 
Kilmany, and I have found them wonderfully complete, notwith- 
standing their present miserable condition. They have been ori- 
ginally bound up as a volume ; but at this date they consist of se- 
parate sheets and leaves. When they were put into my posses- 
sion, they were in great disorder, and it required nearly a week's 
labour to put them into their present condition. A considerable 
part of them are consumed with damp and bad care. The mark- 
ing of the pages is gone ; and I am afraid, that, in their present 
wasted state, they will not keep together for many years. The 
paper is so much consumed, that they cannot be bound into a vo- 
lume. All that I can do to preserve them after being arranged 
is to enclose them in a portfolio. They commence 1st of Novem- 
ber 1696, and they go down to 1729 ; the month at which they 
close, is worn off. In the records there is a blank from October 
31st 1697 to June 1st 1701 ; also a leaf of distribution of kirk- 
session 1728. I have observed in these early records of the kirk- 
session no other blank. I have put the registers of births toge- 
ther at the end. They consist of three fragments. The first of 
the register of births begins May 5th 1706, and is very accurate, 
although a good deal decayed, until August 18th 1710. The se- 
cond portion of the register of births commences November 18th 
1711, leaving a blank from August 1710, and continues regular 
although much wasted at the bottoms of the pages, until October 
12th 1718. Third portion of the registers of births commences No- 
vember 18th 1721, leaving a blank from October 1718, and it 
goes down to 1727. This is in far worse condition than the other 
two. It is so much wasted that I could not ascertain the particular 
month in 1717, when it closes. The records which I have exa- 
mined and described begin, as before stated, November 1696, 
and come down to 1729." This volume of minutes of session has 
been long in bad condition. So far back as when Mr Adamson 



542 



FIFESHIRE. 



was elected minister in 1 764, it is stated, that the session-clerk 
produced " an old illegible book of minutes, about the year 1669 
-70, &amp;c. a book in which were contained a register of baptisms, &amp;c. 
from November 1696 to December 1729, inclusive, and minute of 
discipline, collections, distributions of the same dates ;" another 
book, containing a register of baptisms, &amp;c. from January 1730, 
to the present time, and minutes of collections and distributions 
from January 1730 to December 1728, inclusive, and discipline 
by itself, from January 1749 to the present time ; another book 
containing only minutes of collections and distributions from Ja- 
nuary 1749 to the present time." These are all in existence. 
They were most accurately kept by Mr Adamson. They have 
been continued to the present day, except minutes of discipline. 
Since Mr Adamson's time, until very lately, this part of the pa- 
rish registers has been completely neglected. No entry has been 
made with regard to any meetings which have taken place betwixt 
the heritors and kirk-session. 

Little is known of the ecclesiastical state of the parish before 
1697. From a monument lately turned up in the church-yard, it 
appears that a Master James Thomson was minister of Kilmany for 
forty-two years previous to 1646. He died in that year aged seventy- 
eight ; and it adds, and " that of his beloved wife, Besse Smith, 
with whom he lived forty-one years, Deo Lavs, amen." No tradi- 
tion remains in the parish with regard to this reverend gentleman. 
In Limond's Diary, a Mr George Thomson is mentionedasminister 
of Kilmany, and dying there about 1655. But whoever were 
the ministers of Kilmany previous to 1697, it is evident from a 
minute of session, May 7th 1707, that the sacrament of the Lord's 
supper for a long time had not been regularly dispensed. These 
are the words of it : " Being Wednesday the session met, and 
considering that this congregation has long wanted the benefit of 
the sacrament of the Lord's supper, the minister Mr Brown 
did intimate to them his design of celebrating that solemn ordi- 
nance ; and the session considering what may be the most proper 
season for it, did condescend upon the last Sabbath of June next ; and 
farther considering that the communion tables were all broken and 
gone to ruin, the session recommends it to the minister and elders 
in the town of Kilmany to agree with James Miles, wright, to buy 
timber, and make up the said tables, and to mend some parts of 

• I never saw the old illegible book of minutes about the year 1699-70. The 
earliest which was put in my possession was 1st of November 1696. 



KILMANY,

the pulpit that is decayed, and to do other things needful about 
the church. And the session farther recommends to the minis- 
ter, to write to the provost of the Old College, either to furnish the 
communion elements, or allow a fund to buy them, being, it is 
said, that the Old College was in use and wont so to do, and being 
proprietors of the tithes of the parish, are obliged to allow a fund 
for, or else provide elements for, the use of the parish." Upon 
this solemn occasion, " Elizabeth Forrester, Lady Mountwhanie, 
spouse to James Crawford of Mountwhanie, did provide the pul- 
pit with a covering, together with a good silk fringe, and other 
things belonging thereto ; as also she did give as much fine linen 
as served for the use of the table cloaths at the Sacrament. The 
session, out of gratitude to the said lady, did order the recording 
of this in the minutes." It is stated in the minutes of June, the 
Sth, " the provost of the Old College declines to allow a fund, or 
afford communion elements. The session recommends to the mi- 
nister to take advice what means must be used to obtain a fund 
for this purpose in time coming." June 22d, the session met, in- 
timation was made this day, that the fast day before the sacra- 
ment was to be on Wednesday next. The sacrament was dis- 
pensed on the 29th of June. The session met on the 2d of July ; 
" the minister reported that he had taken advice what method 
must be used for obtaining a fund for providing the communion 
elements, and that the advice was, that there was no other way but 
to raise a process before the Session Lords, now Commissioners for 
Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, and that he was resolved, 
when a fair opportunity offered, to take that method, both with 
respect to his stipend and the communion elements. The session, 
considering that the minister's stipend, being but a scrimp enough 
maintenance, could not allow of paying the elements out of it, they 
unanimously agreed to pay them out of the collections, gathered at 
the sacrament, until a fund shall be otherwise provided." In July 
6th 1714, the session met, and the minister represented to them that 
he had at last, after a long depending process, obtained a decreet of 
modification and locality of his stipend ; wherein a fund is provided 
for communion elements, which he pays out of the same, and so the 
poor's box will be no longer burdened with the payment of communion 
elements. 

In the minutes, there is nothing particularly interesting to 
the general reader. In November Sth 1704, the session gave to 
Daniel Guines, as encouragement for setting up a printing-house 



544 



FIFESHIRE. 



in Dundee, 14s. In May 5th 1709, a collection was ordered for 
those whose houses were burnt in Edinburgh. " In October 23d 
1747, the session met, and the minister represented that the rebels 
having been in his house several times during the late rebeilion, 
and carried off some of his effects, he had put in places he thought 
they would not suspect, some papers of value in his custody, particu- 
larly a bill of seventeen pounds sterling, belonging to the kirk-ses- 
sion, and that he could not recover the said bill." As this bill was 
afterwards renewed by the person who owed it, the kirk-session lost 
nothing by this depredation of the rebels. . 

The Lawries of Hill Cairnie are the oldest residenters in the pa- 
rish. They have lived upon the same farm for 118 years, and, 
from 1720 to 1834, they were members of the kirk-session. The 
first, Mr David Lawrie, was admitted into the session of Kilmany 
in 1720. His son, Mr David Lawrie, was elected an elder in 1766; 
and his son, Mr David Lawrie, who died 1834, in May the 5th 
1814. 

Antiquities. — Kilmany is not remarkable for the number of its 
antiquities ; and there are no traditions with regard to those which 
exist. A considerable number of stone coffins have been dug up 
behind the farm-house of Starr. A few earthen vessels with bones 
were found on the farm of Drumnod, and one of the same descrip- 
tion at Kilmany. Some of these were of the rudest construction, 
and others of them displayed more refinement of taste, and more 
elegance of workmanship. Those found at Drumnod were in the 
possession of Dr Fleming of Aberdeen, when he was minister of 
Flisk ; and Mr Edie, Kilmany, had a part of the urn found on 
his farm, for many years. Coins have been occasionally picked up 
at Myre-Cairnie and Hill-Cairnie, of different sizes and value. 
These I never saw, and there are none of them, as far as I know, 
in the possession of any individual in the parish. 

Modern Buildings. — The house of Mountquhanie, built by the 
late Mr Gillespie, is an elegant modern structure, on a fine com- 
manding situation looking to the south. The policy around it is kept 
in excellent order, and the whole appearance of the grounds about 
it is improving in beauty every year. The other houses of resident 
heritors are neat and commodious, and suited to their circumstan- 
ces, to the extent of their families, or to their individual tastes. 

III. — Population. 
The population of Kilmany has been decreasing for many years. 
This arises from the enlargement of the farms, from the want of 

4 



KILMANY. 



545 



ground for telling, and from the introduction of machinery for bodi- 
ly and manual labour. In the last Statistical Account it is stated, 
there are now living in the parish 396 males and 473 females. 
When the census was taken in 1821, the population was 751,345 
males and 406 females. In 1831 it had fallen to 707, 334 males 
and 373 females, and since that date it is as low as 685 or ,690. 
From the time when the last Statistical Account was written, thrash- 
ing-mills have been universally introduced, and have led to a consi- 
derable diminution of the population ; and individuals with large fa- 
milies naturally retire from a parish, where there are no manufacto- . 
ries, to towns and places where they can obtain employment for their 
children. The average of births for the last seven years has been 15, 
of marriages 3 ; of deaths it is not so easy to speak accurately, 
as some die in the parish who are buried elsewhere, and many of 
the dead from other parishes are buried in Kilmany churchyard. 
This will appear evident from the following statement : There 
have been buried at Kilmany, for the last seven years, 106; of 
this number only 45 have died in the parish. Those who died 
here, and were buried elsewhere, are not recorded in our register. 
I should think that twelve is a fair average of those who have died 
in the parish for the last seven years.

The inhabitants, from the profession which they follow, and from 
their temperate habits, are healthy and strong, and many of them 
reach to very advanced age. Since 1830, there have died eleven 
individuals, whose united ages amounted to 924 years ; the average 
age of each, 84. 

From an early period, Kilmany has been an agricultural parish, 
and Its population possessed of much natural talent, great industry, 
and pious and amiable dispositions. Every clergyman who has la-, 
boured amongst them, has had good reason to bear testimony to 
their piety and correct conduct, and has received from them, many 

ivx m 



54G 



FIFESIIIRE. 



marks of affection and esteem. This amiable feature in their 
character, has hitherto been general. 

IV. — Industry. 
The number of males employed in agriculture is 120. They 
may be thus divided : proprietors farming their estates or part of 
them, 5; tenants, 12; cottars or agricultural married servants, 37; 
unmarried do., 66; total, 120. The industry of the parish in 
other respects may be estimated from the following statement : 
day labourers, ] 8 ; weavers, 10; wrights, 2 masters, workmen and 
apprentices, 11 ; sawyers, 5; smiths, 6 masters, workmen and ap- 
prentices, 4 ; publican, 1 ; toll-keeper, 1 ; tailors, 2 masters, ap- 
prentice 1 ; masons, 3 ; gardeners, 2 masters, workmen and ap- 
prentices, 4 ; grocers in a small way, 2 ; millers, 3, assistants, &amp;c. 
3 ; beadle, 1 ; shoemakers, 3 masters, workmen and apprentices, 
6; ministers, 1 Established, 1 Secession; parochial schoolmas- 
ter 1, schoolmistresses, 2; butler, gamekeeper, &amp;c. 5; retired, 3; 
total, 101. 

There is no large manufactory in the parish. The weavers are 
employed at home work, and when this cannot be obtained, they 
are supplied with Osnaburgh, or other cloth, by the merchants of 
Dundee and Cupar ; or by their agents in the country. In ad- 
dition to the number who weave, mentioned above, there are seve- 
ral females who occupy themselves in this manner, during the win- 
ter. In summer, they generally give up this work when the farm- 
ers need their assistance. 

The only branch of industry, except agriculture, which is carried 
on to any extent, is a saw-mill, which was some years ago erected 
by Mr Thomson of Charleton. It has been occupied, ever since it 
was built, by Mr William Malcolm, wright. During the course of 
the year, it is by him actively employed, and cuts down a consi- 
derable quantity of wood. Its power is not sufficiently strong for 
large trees, but it is admirably adapted for cutting paling, for pre- 
paring wood for sheep flakes, and for converting inferior timber 
into staves for herring barrels. Many thousands of these are an- 
nually sent from this mill to Leith, and other places on the Forth 
where herrings are cured. 

Agriculture. — The whole of this parish is arable, with the ex- 
ception of the hill tops, which are planted. The number of cul- 
tivated acres is about 3550 Scotch, or by imperial measure, 4477. 
There is no land which continues waste, or in a state of natural 
pasture. There is no undivided common. The number of acres 



KILMANV. 



547 



planted is not above 150 acres Scotch, or 190 imperial measure. 
The trees which are planted are the Scotch fir, the larch, the 
beech, with an intermixture of a few ash, plane, and oak. 

Bent— The average rent of the arable land is about L.2, 5s. to 
L. 2, ] Os. per acre ; that of grazing is at the rate of L. 3 per ox, 
or cow, and of 12s. per ewe, or full-grown sheep for the season. 

Waffes,— The wages of married farm-servants are from L. 9 to 
L. 12, with house and garden, 6 bolls of oatmeal, 9 bolls of po- 
tatoes per annum, and 1 pint of sweet milk daily; of unmarried 
servants living in bothies, L. 10 to L. 11, with the same allowance 
of oatmeal and milk ; and potatoes for supper. Fuel and bed- 
clothes are afforded by their masters. In winter the rate of com- 
irjon labourers is from 8s. to 9s. per week; in summer from 9s. 
to lis. Artisans vary from 10s. to 16s. per week. Women for 
agricultural work 8d. without meat; do. for washing, Is. with meat, 
but the hours are long. 

Gram.— Varieties of seed used, and the quantity sown per 
Scotch acre : meat— White do. now principally Hunter's; little 
red do.; quantity sown per Scotch acre, 4 bushels. Barley Enff- 
Chevalier do. much used, and approved of; the only objec- 
tion against it, is its being ten days later of ripening than other 
varieties; quantity sown per acre from 5 to 6 bushels. Oas.— Po- 
tatoe do. early Angus, common, and lately introduced, and much 
esteemed Hopetoun do. Quantity of seed per acre from 6 to 8 
bushels. Potatoes.— The Devonshire red, and the Perthshire red, 
the most popular in the London market. There were fewer failures 
in the crop of Devonshire red, in this neighbourhood, than of 
any other variety. A few blue Dons are planted, more of Glasgow 
buffs, and almost no white species. When raised, they are for home 
consumption. Quantity used for seed per acre, from 3 to 4 bolls. 
Turnips.~Yov early use, white globe and red, for standing dur- 
ing the winter and spring, green top yellow, Aberdeenshire yellow, 
hybrid, and a few Swedes. Quantity used for seed per acre, 2 
to 2| lbs. Grass.— Annual and perennial rye-grass, 1 to 2 bushels 
per acre; red clover from 10 to 12 lbs. per do. Some farmers 
sow along with it 2 lbs. of white. When laid down for pasture 4 
lbs. of red, with 5 to 6 lbs. of white clover. 
_ Live-stock.— The breeds of sheep which are raised, or bought 
in to feed, are the Leicester, Cheviot, and Highland kinds. There 
are about 1000 of the above varieties annually fed for the butcher 
upon turnips. The breed of cattle is the original Fife one, or as

near it, as can now be obtained. Some years ago, the Teeswater, 
or short-horned breed, was introduced, and some very fine cattle 
were raised from it. They were profitable to the breeder, from his 
being able to sell them fat, a year sooner, than the Fife and Angus 
kinds. But they are too fine, and delicate for our climate, and 
pasture. They have a tendency to degenerate, unless they are 
kept up at a great expense, or the breed renewed from warmer 
and richer soils. The original breed of the county, if equally at- 
tended to, although kept to a greater age, affords a richer article 
to the butcher, and is nearly, if not altogether, as profitable to the 
farmer. A cross betwixt the Teeswater and the Fife breed is 
generally considered an advantageous one. The stock thus rais- 
ed, if placed in favourable circumstances, acquire a greater weight 
than the pure Fife breed, and, although more delicate, are sooner 
ready for the market. There are about 200 cattle of various kinds 
raised in the parish annually, and the most of them are sold fat, 
about three years of age. There are few horses raised for the 
market. Those bred for agricultural purposes are strong and hand- 
some. 

Rotation of Crops.— On the best soils the following five shift is 
common : 1. Fallow or green crop ; 2. wheat ; 3. barley sown down 
with grass seeds ; 4. grass cut, or pastured ; 5. oats. This is a 
severe rotation, and has a tendency in the course of years to wear 
out the best of land. It can be justified only from the want of en- 
closures, which prevents the farmer from adopting, as he would 
wish to do, the stock husbandry. This is gradually giving way to 
the six shift, which, in every agricultural point of view, is supe- 
rior to it, although at first less profitable. 1. Fallow, or green 
crop 2. wheat ; 3. pease or beans, or turnips manured with bones, 
and eaten off with sheep ; 4. barley with grass seeds ; 5. grass 
cut, or pastured ; 6. oats. This rotation would be much improv- 
ed, by allowing the land to lie in pasture for two or three years 
after barley, and would be unquestionably so, if the farms were 
properly enclosed. There is little land in the parish which can- 
not bear this last course. Where it does exist, barley is substituted 
for wheat ; then, white' and green crops alternately, and pasture 
for several years. 

Great improvements have been made within the last forty years, 
in ploughing and draining; and they are still proceeding. Furrow 
draining, which promises such happy results, has been introduced, 
and will in a short time be carried to a great extent. The subsoil 



KILMANY. 



549 



plough has also been set to work. These united will improve the 
wet and retentive lands. They will free them from extra moisture, 
give them depth of soil, and prepare them for the reception of 
lime and manure. Another great improvement which has been 
introduced within the last few years is the application of bones 
for fertihzing the soil. This manure is admirably adapted for 
high dry fields. 

The leases extend to the period of nineteen years, and the nature 
and conditions of them are generally considered fair for proprie- 
tor and tenant, — perhaps an extension of them to twenty-four years 
would be still more advantageous to both parties. The farm 
houses and steadings are, in a majority of cases, good, and, by the 
liberality of the [roprietors, are improving every year. 

Rathillet mill presents an obstacle for improving one part of the 
parish. Its dam-dike prevents a proper level from being carried 
through the low lands of West Rathillet, and Mountquhanie, and 
Stair. The fields lying along this part of the Motray, which from 
. their situation, should be the most productive in the parish, are almost 
always damp, and do not bear the crops of which they are capable. 
They are also exposed to be occasionally flooded. Were this ob- 
stacle removed, and the lands properly drained, the difference be- 
twixt the crops, which are now, and which would be raised upon 
these fields, would amply remunerate the heritors interested, in a 
very few years. All such obstacles are removed in the eastern part 
of the parish, and the consequence is, that the banks of the Motray, 
which were once marshy and of little value, are now dry, and pro- 
duce excellent crops of grain and the best of pasture. What are 
called the Greens and the Haughs of Kilmany, were also occasion- 
ally overflowed with water. This was corrected some years ago, by 
giving the Motray a new and a wider course, betwixt the mill and 
the church of Kilmany. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, in as far as it can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of all kinds of grain cultivated for food of man or the domestic 

animals, - . . . ] 3,800 

of potatoes turnips, &amp;c. cultivated in the fields for food, - 3,800 
of hay almost all cultivated. - ... 140O 

of land in pasture rating it at L. 3 per cow or full-grown ox, 
grazed, or that may he grazed for the;season, at 12s. perewe, 
or full grown sheep pastured or may be pastured for the year, 1200 
of annual thinning and periodical felling of woods, plantations, &amp;c. 40

near has various soils. In the lower parts, it is sandy, with some 
moss along the banks of Motray. The higher fields are not 
composed of a deep but of a sharp light soil. The best lands 
of ][Cinnear are not so strong as to resist extreme drought. It 
suffered much from this cause in 1826. It is naturally adapted 
for sheep, and cattle, more than a continued rotation of culmi- 
ferous and leguminous crops. It has been most judiciously and 
completely divided into parks, and enclosed with substantial whin- 
stone dikes. This improvement has added greatly to the produce 
of the farm. By the assistance of these parks, and by grazing, 
excellent crops have been lately raised upon inferior land ; and 
first-rate cattle and sheep have been brought to the market. 

The next farm to the west is Little Kinnear, the property of 
Henry Wedderburn, Esq. of Birkhill. It is a small one, but 
valuable from its soil, its climate, and situation. It requires only 
to be enclosed, to become a first-rate farm for its size. The up- 
per land, although thin, lies upon a whinstone bottom. To the 
west of Little Kinnear,lies the estate of Kilmany, belonging to 
John A. Thomson, Esq. of Charleton. It is divided into three 
farms ; — East and West Kilmany ; — and Muir Craig, on the top 
of the hill, which separates Kilmany from Balmerino and the Tay. 
The two first farms have always been considered excellent ones, 
and capable of raising all kinds of crops. They are more adapt- 
ed for wheat, than either of the Kinnears. Their soil is various. 
Upon the Motray it is a deep rich loam. In wet seasons, this 
part of it raises great quantities of straw; but the quantity and 
the quality of the grain do not correspond with the bulk of fod- 
der. This was particularly the case in 1817 ; but in drier seasons 
it produces heavy crops of straw and corn. Another part of it is 
a fine sharp soil lying on trap, which yields an excellent boll, for 
the quantity of fodder, which is in some seasons deficient. There 
is another part of it, moorish, and of little value to the farmer. This 
is the tract of land lying betwixt the manse and glebe, and the 
east march of Rathillet. This part of the property, by the subsoil 
plough, furrow draining, and, above all things, by enclosures, may 
be much improved, and, in the course of time, may become, if not 
fertile, at least a convenient piece of ground to the tenant. The 
Muir Craigs is a hill farm, and, as its name denotes, there is in it 
a considerable quantity of indifferent land ; but of late years, it 
has been much improved, and is in the way of being still better 



KILMANY. 



551 



cultivated. The value of the whole of this estate would be much 
enhanced, if it was as completely inclosed as East Kinnear. 

To the west of Kilmany is the estate of Rathillet, which was 
long in the possession of the Halkerstones ; but, for the last sixty 
years, has been the propefVty of the grandfather, and father of the 
present laird, David Carswell, Esq. It is one of the largest, and, 
upon the whole, one of the best farms in the parish. It was well 
enclosed by a Mr Sweet, who purchased it from Mr Halkerston, 
with hedge-rows interspersed with ash trees, and in this respect 
it took the lead, in substantial improvements, of the rest of the pa- 
rish, by nearly half a century. The soil, generally speaking, is 
not so well adapted for wheat as Kilmany, and of the other farms 
which are still to be mentioned ; but for barley, and for raising cat- 
tle, it has few equals in this or in the neighbouring districts. To the 
north of Rathillet, is Newbigging, part of the property of Mrs Robert- 
son of Ballendean; it contains some good and some indifferent land. 

The estate of Mountquhanie, belonging to David Gillespie, 
Esq. of Kirkton, originally containing the farms of Stirton, Mount- 
quhanie, and Drumnod, lies to the north-west of Rathillet. Of 
these, the soil of Stirton is the poorest. It is thin cold land, with 
a retentive subsoil. It is not enclosed. Little, for many years, was 
done upon this farm. The proprietor took it into his own hands 
some years ago. He drove lime to it, and in some degree drained 
it. With these improvements, it was lately let to an active tenant, 
who will employ skill and capital to increase its productive powers. 
Mountquhanie and Drumnod contain excellent sharp land, a part 
of it upon whinstone bottom, and are highly cultivated. 

To the south of Mountquhanie, are the farms of Starr and of the 
Cairnies, Murdoch and New Cairnie. These by purchase were add- 
ed to the Mountquhanie estate by the late Mr Gillespie. They con- 
tain some of the best land in the parish. They are fit to raise every 
species of crop, and equally adapted for the feeding of cattle. To 
the west of Murdoch Cairnie is the estate of Newington, belong- 
ing to Henry Inglis, Esq. Only part of Mr Inglis' property is in 
Kilmany ; the rest of it, is in the adjoining parish of Moonzie. It 
originally formed part of the Cairnie estate, and is distinguished 
for a rich deep soil. Lochmalonie, the estate of James Horsburgh, 
Esq. lies to the south of Rathillet, and is bounded by it on the 
north and west. The soil of Lochmalonie is various. About the 
mansion-house, and farm-steading, it is excellent. The higher 
grounds to the south, are of inferior quality. It is cold with a re- 



552 



FIFESHIRE. 



tentive subsoil. This part of the property was much improved, 
by its late amiable, judicious, and justly esteemed proprietor, Major 
Horsburgh. He trenched a considerable part of it; and one field, 
where he was disappointed of the beneficial effects which he ex- 
pected, he covered with clay, which he found under the surface, 
which succeeded far beyond his most sanguine hopes. 

The only other estates within the parish, and which form its south- 
west boundary, are Hill Cairnie, the property of Robert Russell, 
Esq. and Myre Cairnie, belonging to Captain Pearson, R. N. Both 
of these farms are cultivated by Mr Russell. They contain some 
very strong land. Hill Cairnie is known in the neighbourhood for 
its deep red clay. It has also a considerable extent of meadow 
ground, which is composed of sand, moss, and marl. This is all 
drained, and contributes liberally to the barn-yard, or to the 
feeding byres. Both these farms lie near the town of Cupar, and 
from it receive a great quantity of dung, in addition to what is pro- 
duced upon themselves. They are thus highly cultivated and 
fertile. 

From these observations, it is evident that Kilmany is a most 
productive parish. From the well known excellence of its soil, 
from the greater part of it being completely watered by the Mo- 
tray, and its other small streams, from the excellence of the roads 
which run through it, and from its nearness to good markets, — the 
farms which compose it, have been long in great request by the 
agriculturist. There are many offerers of skill, and of capital, for 
every farm which comes into the market. On this account all the 
farms are rented at their full value, and some of them above it. 
If times were becoming worse than they now are, the rent promis- 
ed for them could not be paid, without entrenching upon the ca- 
pital of the tenants. Such a state of things would be deeply to 
be deplored, not more for the sake of this industrious, and in every 
way respectable class of men, than for the agricultural prosperity 
and the general good of the country. 

The valued rent of Kilmany is L. 5327, 9s. 9d. Scots money ; 
real rent from L. 8000 to L. 9000 Sterling. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion — Means of Communication. — What is called the 
village of Kilmany consists of the cottars' houses of the two farms of 
the same name, with those of the wright, smith, shoemaker, weaver, 
and beadle ; and of a few more fjimilies. The market-town is 
•Cupar, which is distant from the centre of the parish betwixt four 



KILMANY. 



553 



and five miles. Although the roads are excellent, it enjoys few 
means of communication with the neighbouring towns and vil- 
lages. There is no post nearer than Cupar or Newport, which 
is found in many cases to be very inconvenient, and no carrier 
passes this way to Dundee and Cupar. A great part of the ne- 
cessaries of life must be sent for, to one or other of these places, 
which entails upon the inhabitants additional labour and expense. 
The parish is abundantly supplied with excellent bread, three or 
four times a-week, by carts from Cupar, Newport, and Leuchars. 
The length of the turnpike-road running through the valley is six 
miles. Originally there was a considerable deal of posting upon 
it, from Newport to Edinburgh, as this is the best and nearest 
line of road betwixt these places. But all the public coaches go 
round by Cupar, and since the starting of these conveyances, few 
post-chaises are seen in this district. There are eleven small 
bridges in the parish, eight of them are over the Motray, and all 
of them in good order. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated upon the beautiful 
rising ground, upon which the small village is placed. It com- 
mands a fine view of the surrounding country. The Motray runs 
below it, and washes the bank upon which it is built. It is not 
particularly well situated for the accommodation of the parish ; as 
the most extensive and populous parts of it lie at a considerable 
distance from the church. This cannot now be avoided. As the 
parish is not extensive, the people in good weather can easily attend 
divine worship, from its most distant points. If they are unwilling 
to come so far, there are other churches connected with the 
Establishment nearer them, to which they can easily go. The great- 
est distance from the parish church, is about four and a-half miles. 
It was built in 1768. It is of the plainest construction. The 
original expense of it, was under L. 150. From some repairs 
which it lately received, it is far from being uncomfortable. It 
can accommodate from 300 to 340 individuals. As the parish 
has diminished in population since it was erected, it is more than 
sufficiently large for the congregation. The greatest part of the 
area is divided amongst the different heritors, and is occupied by 
them, or by their tenants and servants ; but the communion tables 
and the east gallery are free sittings, as nothing has been charged 
for them for many years. These were erected originally at the 
expense of the kirk-session, and were let out for the benefit of 
the poor.

The manse was built for Dr Chalmers in 1810. By his advice, 
the site of it was removed from the village to its jjresent situa- 
tion on the glebe. It is now about 400 paces to the west of the 
church. This change for many reasons was a desirable one. The 
old site with the garden, and small park below the church, do not 
now belong to the minister. They were exchanged in 1820, for 
land lying contiguous to the principal part of the glebe. The 
manse now stands by itself, in a fine park of ten acres, with an 
excellent approach to it, which the late site completely wanted. 
The manse and offices are in good repair, and are in every way 
suitable to the accommodation of the minister. The garden is sur- 
rounded with an excellent wall, five and a half feet high to the 
south, nine and a half to the east, north, and west ; it was built in 
1820. The heritors allowed for this purpose L. 45; the present 
incumbent, for his own conveniency, gave an additional L. 10. It 
is now well stocked with fruit trees, although the soil is not very 
favourable for their growth ; and with an abundance of gooseberry, 
and currant bushes. The ground about the manse was laid out 
with great taste by Dr Chalmers. It remains very much in the 
state in which he left it. The glebe consists of nearly 10 acres 
Scotch measure, and is enclosed with a beech and thorn hedge. 
The soil is unequal; but a great part of it is good and sharp ; and, 
under proper management, is productive. It would let over head 
at L. 3 to L. 3, 10s. per acre. The stipend during the greatest 
part of Dr Chalmers' incumbency, and of mine, was, wheat, 8 
bolls; barley, 92 bolls, 1 firlotl peck. Of lippies; oatmeal, 48 bolls, 
1 firlot, 1 peck, Of lippies ; oats, 40 bolls, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. of 
communion elements. In 1832 the stipend was augmented by 
the Court of Teinds, as follows: wheat, 8 bolls; barley, 116 bolls; 
oatmeal 116, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. as communion elements. The 
whole teinds of the parish, except what the minister receives as 
stipend, belong to the United College of St Andrews, and every 
augmentation which i granted is taken from the revenues of that 
most respectable body. This is a state of things which is in 
every way to be regretted, and the college has unquestionably 
a just claim upon Government, for the loss which by various aug- 
mentations, they have sustained. The Principal and Professors 
of the said college are patrons of the parish. 

There has been a dissenting chapel in the parish since 1762. 
The clergyman, I believe, is paid by the collections, and the seat- 
rents ; his salary is about L. 100. He has, in addition, a good 



KILMANY. 



555 



house, and an excellent garden. As the congregation is compos- 
ed of the Dissenters of various parishes in the neighbourhood, I do 
not know the number which attends this chapel. The number of 
heads of families attending the Established Church is about 80 ; 
of communicants, 266 to 275. 

t Education There are three schools in the parish ; the paro- 
chial one, at Rathillet, the centre of the parish ; and two private 
ones, taught by females, at Hazleton of Mountquhanie, and at 
Kilmany. The two last are supported by the liberality of Mrs 
Gillespie of Kirkton, and Mrs Thomson of Charleton. Each 
teacher has a house, school-room, and garden, and L. 10 of sa- 
lary ; the rest of their living is composed of school -fees, which may 
amount to betwixt L. 5 and L. 10 per annum. These schools 
have been of great use in teaching the younger children, who are 
not able to go so far as the parish school; and still more so, for 
giving to the girls in the parish and neighbourhood a knowledge 
of knitting, needle-work, and other branches of female education. 
In the parochial school, the ordinary branches of education are 
at present most ably taught by Mr William M'Gillivray. In 
addition to these, if required, he is prepared to teach practical 
mathematics, geography, and Latin. The fees are fixed by 
the heritors and minister, as follows : for English reading, 2s. 
per quarter ; do. with writing per quarter, 2s. 6d ; these, with 
arithmetic, 3s. 6d. per quarter ; these, with English gram- 
mar and geography, 5s. per quarter ; without geography, 4s. : 
and for the whole, with Latin, 10s. per quarter. The school- 
master, like most of his brethren in country parishes, receives only 
three quarters per annum. He is at present ill accommodated, 
having only the legal allowance of two rooms ; and these are small 
and low in the ceiling ; but I have no doubt that this will be cor- 
rected by the liberality of the heritors, when a new school-room is 
built. He has an excellent garden ; and as session and heritor's 
clerk, he has a salary of L.3, 10s., the emoluments of which office, 
from marriages, births, and funerals may be, on an average, L. 2 
more per annum. His school-fees may amount to L. 18 or L.20 
per annum. All the children are sent to school, and there is al- 
most no person who cannot read; and a great part of the lower 
classes, can also write and keep accounts. From the central situa- 
tion of the school, all the children in the parish can attend it, 
who have reached the age of seven years. There is no need of 
additional schools.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor of this parish are few in 
number, and are supported at a very trifling expense. There still 
exists amongst them that noble spirit, which spurns at public as- 
sistance, when, by their own exertions and economy, they can pro- 
vide for themselves. We have, at present, cases anongst us where 
individuals have reached the utmost verge of human life ; with, 
means bordering upon poverty, and by many, would be considered 
actually so, resolutely refusing the scanty supply which is given to 
those who are upon the kirk -session roll. The number who were 
assisted by the kirk-session last year were 14, of whom five only 
were regularly on the roll ; the rest got occasional assistance. The 
whole sum given to the above poor, from January 1837 to January 
1838, was L. 23, lis. 5d. In addition to this, 15s. 6d. was given 
to a medical gentleman for advice ; and perhaps L. 3 are still due 
to the schoolmaster, for poor scholars. In addition to this sum, 
David Gillespie, Esq. of Kirkton, gave me liberty last year, to give 
coals to every person in the parish, who I thought stood in need of 
them ; and I was particularly requested by him, not to diminish 
the ordinary supply afforded to the poor, in consequence of his do- 
nation. Several families, who were in distress from accidental cir- 
cumstances, were thus supplied with coals, who never received a 
farthing from the kirk-session. Call the average, L. 30; and this 
sum cannot be said to be extravagant, upon a rental of L. 8000 to 
L. 9000 per annum, although the heritors paid every farthing of it. 
But this they do not. \st. The kirk-session has an heritable bond 
belonging to it of L. 200 ; the interest of which, although now re- 
duced, goes for the support of the poor, and the other expenses of 
the kirk-session, which amount annually to L. 8, 7s. : Id, collec- 
tions at the church doors, which amount to about L. 14; 3f, 
dues upon mortcloths, which may average from L. 2 to L. 2, 5s. : 
and dues upon marriages, which come to very little money; Ath, 
interest of a legacy of L. 45 left by the late David Gillespie, Esq. 
of Kirkton, for the benefit of the poor; and 5th, interest of the re- 
mains of a legacy of L. 34, 2s. lOd. left by the late John A. Thom- 
son. Esq. of Charleton, to be expended upon clothing to needy 
and respectable individuals. Although the kirk-session had no 
other expenses, the funds are not sufficient of themselves to supply 
the poor, few as they are, and to pay the salaries above stated. In 
addition to these, there are school-fees for the children of people 
in distress, and there are accidental expenses, which, taken to- 
gether, may amount annually from L. 3, lOs. to L. 4, lOs. To

make up any such deficiency, the heritors were accustomed to as- 
sess themselves voluntarily, according to their valued rents. All 
that was required of them was a sum of L. 30 to L. 35 every al- 
ternate year. They thus kept the capital of the kirk-session en- 
tire, and ready to be advanced upon any emergency. But on a late 
occasion, a majority of heritors agreed not to contribute as they 
had hitherto done, until the legacy left to the kirk-session by Mr 
Gillespie was expended. The tendency of such proceeding, if 
carried farther, is to bring on a legal assessment, which will de- 
stroy here, as elsewhere, that independent and noble spirit, which 
spurns at parochial relief. The present incumbent, at least, has 
done all in his power to prevent this state of things. 

Inns. — There is now only one public-house in the parish. 

Fuel. — The principal article used for fuel is coal. There is 
no pit of this valuable mineral nearer than twelve miles. By land 
carriage, it is brought from Teasses in Ceres parish, from Drum- 
carro in Cameron, from Kilmux, and from Orr's Bridge. It is 
imported in considerable quantities into Balmerino, from various 
places on the Forth, and from Newcastle. On the hill, a double 
cart containing six loads, costs from 7s. 6d. to 9s. 6d. ; carriage of 
ditto, with tolls 8s. lOd. At Balmerino, English coal costs about 
15s. to 17s., Scotch coal from 12s. 6d. to 17s., carriage 4s. for 
a double cart. In winter the price is even higher at Balmerino 
than what is stated.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. THOMAS J. CRAWFORD, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. — This parish is situated in 
the heart of the county of Fife. In form, it is nearly oblong, and 
in superficial extent about 3 square miles, being 2 miles long 
from north to south, and 1 broad from east to west. It is bounded 
on the west, by the parishes of Kettle and Collessie ; on the north, 
by Collessie, Monimail, and Cupar ; on the east, by Ceres; and 
on the south by Ceres and Kettle. 

Name. — The ancient name of this parish was Qxiilts or Quilques. 
This word is alleged, in the former Statistical Account, to be of 
Celtic origin, signifying a " 7iook" or " corner," and is suppos- 
ed to be descriptive of the situation of the parish, which recedes 
towards the south-east from the large strath or valley of the 
Eden. 

Topographical Appearances. — There is nothing very remarkable 
to be noted under this head. The surface is flat or slightly de- 
clining towards the north, but hilly towards the south and east. 
The eastern district is richly wooded, — the western somewhat bare 
and uninteresting. Of the hills may be mentioned the Walton 
hill, which rises at the south-east extremity of the parish, — and 
the Pitlessie or Cults' lime hills, which adjoin it on the south. 
On these, there are many points from which the fine scenery of 
the neighbourhood, the beautiful valley of Stratheden, and " mine 
own blue Lomonds," as Sir D. Wilkie, in a letter to a former 
clergymen of Cults, enthusiastically calls them, may be seen to 
the greatest advantage. 

Soil. — There is great variety in the quality of the soil. From 
the northern boundary to the high road, the soil is a light brown- 
ish sand, arid and unproductive, apt to be overrun, if left long

under grass, with bent, broom and furze. Farther southwards 
to the ascent of the hme hills, a soft black loam prevails, varying 
from 10 to 20 inches in depth. On the sides and tops of the hills, 
there is a strong clay, of excellent quality, capable of producing 
the finest crops. 

Climate. — The climate is dry, mild, and salubrious. There 
are no peculiar diseases incident to the locality. Agues, which 
were prevalent sixty years ago, have now, owing to the improved 
cultivation of the country, entirely disappeared, and fevers have 
of late years been neither so frequent nor so severe as in some of 
the surrounding parishes. The highest winds are from the south- 
west ; the greatest storms of rain and snow from the east. 

Hydrography. — The river Eden divides part of this parish from 
that of Collessie on the north, and traverses the other part. The 
breadth of the river is about thirty-four feet. Its bed is level, its 
course winding, and its current consequently slow and noiseless. 
From the western to the eastern extremity of the parish, it has a 
fall of about thirteen feet. It drives six mills, and in these is 
made available in the summer season to the extent of not less than 
twenty horse power. The Eden is joined by the Ballomill burn, 
which, flowing southwards, divides Cults from Collessie on the 
west. This stream, though only about fifteen feet in width, is, 
during the summer months, of nearly equal power with the Eden 
itself. Besides these, there are various streamlets of inconsiderable 
size. One of them drives two thrashing-mills. 

Geology.— The parish of Cults presents a very interesting field 
of observation to the geologist. Its geognostic appearances are, 
for the most part, connected with the carboniferous or great in- 
dependent coal formation. The rocks consist of sandstone, lime- 
stone, shale, coal, and trap, and constitute the northern outcrop 
of the coal metals. We shall begin our brief description with the 
lowest of the sedimentary deposits, and consider the others in 
their relative order of superposition, — a method which will conduct 
us gradually from the northern to the southern extremity of the 
parish. 

The rock which prevails throughout the lower district is a yel- 
low sandstone, sections of which may be observed along the banks 
of the Eden, and at the quarries of Hospital Mill and Bogle Hill. 
It may likewise be observed cropping out on the Walton Hill, a 
little to the east of the burying-place of the Crawfurd family, and

reaching an elevation of about 200 feet above the level of the val- 
ley. The deposit may therefore be considered as of enormous 
thickness. Some of its beds assume a brecciated or conglomerated 
aspect, containing nodules of quartz, and rounded portions of the 
primitive rocks ; also innumerable quantities of clay nodules, which 
are soft, unctuous, of a bluish yellow colour, and generally of a 
globular or semispherical form. In this portion of the deposit, the 
scales, teeth, and bones of fossil tish are abundant. Some of the 
scales found at Hospital Mill quarry, measure nearly three inches in 
length and two inches in breadth. These interesting relics all belong, 
according to Dr Anderson Edinburgh New Philosophical Jour- 
nal, January 1838, to the Gyrolepis giganteus of M. Agassiz ; 
And the discovery of them in this deposit has led him to regard 
it as belonging to the old red sandstone formation, of which it 
constitutes the upper member. It is undoubtedly a continuation 
of the Dura Den, Drumdryan, Wemyss' Hall, and Cupar Muir 
sandstones, in which several new genera of fossil fishes, as well 
as insects, have been discovered and described by Dr Anderson in 
the paper referred to. The direction of this deposit is to the 
south-east, its dip is at an angle which varies from 7° to 12°, and 
its range is westerly. 

The mountain limestone is the next rock which occurs in the 
order of superposition. This rock crops out at a considerable 
elevation above the valley, and like the former ranges in a wester- 
ly direction, dipping towards the south-east at an angle of about 
10°. It may, therefore, although the junction of the two cannot 
be observed, be considered as lying perfectly conformable with the 
yellow sandstone. The main bed is about 14 feet thick, very hard 
and crystalline in its texture, and of a dark bluish colour. It ex- 
tends about a mile and a half iri length, in the course of which se- 
veral dislocations occur, which are termed rums by the workmen. 
These portions of the rock differ considerably from the rest, and 
almost approach the character of a conglomerate, which, along with 
the arch-like appearance of the rums, clearly indicates the nature of 
the cause by which they have been occasioned, as well as the close 
proximity of the trap beneath. Besides this main bed of limestone, 
there are other three, one of which is two, anothereight,and the third 
six feet in thickness. The organic remains in this depositare encri- 
nites of several species, orthocerates, terehratulce, products, spiri- 

fercB, corallines, madrepores, and small microscopic shells. It yields

about 90 per cent, of carbonate of lime, and is much esteemed 
both for agricultural and architectural purposes. 

Several alternating beds of coal, shale, and sandstone repose 
upon the limestone strata. One of the beds of coal is twelve 
inches thick, and may be considered as the lowest of the whole 
series, of which the coal-field in the county is composed. From 
the quarry it may be traced westwards to Front-brae, where it 
may be seen cropping out along the road which leads to Coal- 
town. Here the whole series have been thrown down several hun- 
dred feet, underlying the Burnturk coal metals, and again emerg- 
ing at Forthar hmework in the parish of Kettle. The other beds 
of coal vary from a few inches to about a foot in thickness, and 
are not considered of sufficient value to be wrought. 

One of the beds of shale which overlies the main lime bed is 
composed almost entirely of shells of the genus Mytilm, the pre- 
vailing species being the M. Crassus. These shells appear as 
fresh and entire as if they were still reposing on the muddy bed 
of the primitive ocean, in which they were produced. Not only 
are the external figure and internal texture preserved, but even 
the colour and original shelly matter seem to have sustained but 
little alteration. One cannot look on these interesting relics with- 
out a feeling of admiration of the wonderful methods devised by 
Providence, for preserving so entire bodies of so fragile a kind, and 
out of their remains once deposited on the bottom of the sea, 
forming the rocks and soil, which now minister to the wants and 
comforts of man. 

Of the sandstones reposing on the lime beds, the thickest, which 
IS about 16 feet, abounds in organic remains. These, however, are 
wholly vegetable, being the stems and branches of arundinaceom 
plants. Not a trace of animal matter can be detected in any part 
of this deposit, while in the inferior bed of sandstone before no- 
ticed, the organic remains are exclusively animal ; a fact, we be- 
leve, first observed by Dr Anderson, and serving as the basis of 
his proposed arrangement of the different sandstones found in 
btratheden. The whole of these alternating beds of coal, shale 
sandstone and mountain limestone, have been elevated to the height 
of about 600 feet above the level of the sea, and now constitute 
what are called the Cults or Pitlessie Hills, being apparently a 
contmuation of the Lomond range. 

The whole series of rocks in this parish are capped with masses 
ot overlyuig trap, consisting partly of amygdaloid, and partly of 

I'liK. Nn

greenstone. This rock has obviously burst through the stratified 
deposits, and towards it, as a central nucleus, they all incline. 

Botany. — I have been favoured by a proprietor in the neigh- 
bourhood with a very complete view of the botany of the parish 
of Cults. A brief account of the more notable plants, which 
have been observed by him, is all that can be here given. 

The Chara vulgaris grows in one of the rills on the farm of 
Priestfield ; the Agrostis alba, var. stolonifera, abounds on the lime- 
hills, as also the Briza media and Jvena flavescens ; and the Aira 

aquatica in Pitrachnie den. The Scabiosa arvensis, the smooth va- 
riety, a plant which, Sir James Smith says, has not yet been found in 
England, grows in Cults. The Galium cinereum grows close to 
the mill-dam opposite the Priory garden. The Potamogeton pu- 
sillum, which does not seem to be found near Edinburgh, grows 
abundantly in the old bed of the Eden near Pitlessie Bridge. 
The white-flowered Campanula rotundifolia has been found in 
several places. The Viola lutea is common on the hills. The 
Solanum dulcamara, supposed by Hooker to be rare in Scotland, 
grows in many places on the banks of the Eden ; while Cicuta 
virosa, the most virulent of our poisons, has been found near Cult 
mill. The Triglochin palustre grows on the lime-hills, and the 
white-flowering Epilobium montanum in the woods near Crawfurd 
Priory. The Sedum Telephium grows freely on the banks of the 
Eden, and the S. villosum is not uncommon in marshy places on 
the hills. The Cerastium aquaticum grows near Pitlessie mill. 
The Jgrimonia Eupatoria, a plant much used in making British 
teas, is found in Pitrachnie den ; and the Prunvs spinosa grows 
in considerable quantities among the rocks. As might be expect- 
ed, there is a great variety of the genus Bosa : R. spinosissima and 
tomentosa are very common ; B. scabriuscula abounds on the whole 
range of hills on the south of Stratheden ; the R. rubiginosa is 
not uncommon ; the B. arvensis is frequently to be met with, as 
also the B. canina, now so much recommended for rose stocks. 
The Geum rivale and the Comarum palustre are to be found in 
the rills and marshes. The Papaver BhcBas, so common on the 
coast, but rare in the interior of Fife, grows near Cult mill ; and 
the Nuphar lutea near Pitlessie Bridge. Banunculus sceleratus, 
and R. hirsutus, var. /3, are found on the banks of the river Eden, 
while a beautiful variety of the B. acris with a single flower abounds

in Pitrachnie den. The Caltha radicans is by no means uncom- 
mon on the hills. The Galeopsis Ladanum, var. /3, Smith, which 
he had never seen, is found ; and also the beautiful G. versicolor, 
called bee-nettle, from a resemblance to that insect. The day- 
nettle, by which the reapers are so severely stung, is the Galeopsis, 
including more than one species of it, and not the dead-nettle, or 
Lamium, as stated by Dr Jamieson in his Scottish Dictionary. The 
severity of the wound is caused by a poisonous liquid contained in 
the plant. The dark variety of Euphrasia officinalis is found on 
Hospital Mill farm. The Thlaspi arvense grows in the southern 
part of the parish, on the farm of Skelpie ; the Cardamine hirsuta 
on the banks of the Eden; the Nasturtium officinale 'm the ditches; 
and the Barbarea officinalis near Pitlessie. The Sinapis alba oc- 
curs occasionally ; the other two sorts are very common. The 
beautiful Geranium pratense is found in several places, as also the 
G. dissectum. The Malva moschata, not uncommon in the county, 
grows near Crawfurd Priory. The Spartium scoparium and Ulex 
europeus, from the extent of ground they occupy, there having 
been till very recently a fox cover of seventy acres on the farm of 
Skelpie would lead one to doubt the truth of the statement, that 
they are of foreign origin, and were introduced by the Scottish kings, 
who had their hunting seat at the neighbouring palace of Falk- 
land. The Anthyllis vulneraria grows on the hills, as also the 
Orobus tuberosus, the roots of which have been recommended as a 
substitute for coffee. The beautiful Ornithopus perpusillus has 
been found near Clushford bridge ; the Lotus major near the lime- 
hills; Hypericum quadrangulum and H. pulchrum, the latter very 
common m the marshes, as also the Leontodon palusire. The pa- ' 
rh IS rich m the genus Hieracium ; the H. murorum is found in 
the rocks and walls, the H. sylvaticum in the woods, and the H. 
palustre oni lime hills. Cichorium Intybus is found occasional 
ly. Ihe Cmcus eriophorus is found near Crawfurd Priory gar- 
den, and m other places. The Gnaphalium dioicum is by no 
means uncommon. The Inula Helenium grows near the farm of 
unzeon. The Centaurea scabiosa, not uncommon in the east of

growing on the borders of Lindores Loch. The Alnus glutinosa 
grows wild on the banks of the Eden. The Betula alba, var. /3, 
or weeping birch, is found apparently wild near Bunzeon. There 
are many sorts of willows in the parish, but the only sorts proba- 
bly that ari3 in a wild state are the beautiful species, Salix pentan- 
dra, S. malifuUa, S. repens, S. aquatica, and S. caprea. There 
are many fine trees of S. alba, and some good specimens of other 
kinds. There are no uncommon ferns ; the Aspidium Oreopteris, 
and A. Filixfemina are found ; also Asplenium Trichomanes, and 
Blechnum boreale ; Ophioglossum vvlgatum ; this rare plant is found 
near the lime quarries ; Equisetrim arvense and E. palustre are 
found in the marshy grounds. 

II. — Civil History. 
Early Notices of the Parish — These are very scanty. In the 
taxed roll of the Archbishoprick of St Andrews, drawn up in the 
year 1547, Cults is included under the title of Rectoria de Qwilts. 
See Martin's Reliquiae Divi Andreae. A still more early no- 
tice of it is found in the charters of the College of St Salvador, in 
the University of St Andrews. In the first foundation charter of 
that College, dated 1455, there is contained a disposition and m9r- 
tification for its behoof, by Bishop James Kennedy, of the teihds 
of the parishes of Qwilts, Kemback, Dunninow, Forteviot, and 
Kilmany, together with some chaplainries, all formerly belonging 
to the see.— In the second foundation charter of St Salvador's, 
dated at the Castle of St Andrews, 5th April 1458, it is ordained 
that the College shall consist of a Doctor in Theology, who was 
to be Provost or Principal, a Licentiate of Theology, a Bachelor in 
Theology, four Masters of Arts, and six poor scholars to be taught 
the speculative sciences. The Doctor in Theology being Princi- 
pal, has by this charter the rectory of Qioilts assigned to him as his 
endowment,— the Licentiate, or second master has the rectory of 
Kemback, and the Bachelor, or third master, the rectory of Denino, 
-the teinds of the other benefices being assigned to the Masters of 
Arts and poor scholars. Prior to the Reformation, the Principal of 
St Salvador's continued to be ex officio rector of Cults, serving 
the cure by a Vicar or Curate. On the establishment of the Re- 
formed Church of Scotland, the surplus or unappropriated teinds 
of the parish were still allotted to him as Titular. And in this ca- 
pacity, the principal of the then United Colleges of St Salvador 
and St Leonard opposed the augumentation of stipend sued for 
by the ministers of Cults, and granted to him in 1756. The pa-

tronage of Cults and of the other parishes above-mentioned is still 
vested in the Professors of the United College. 

Antiquities. — " The Walton-hill," says Mr Wilkie in the for- 
mer Statistical Account, " has many fossoR and ramparts cut along 
its side, which are supposed to be the remains of a Roman camp, 
pitched by Agricola, who, when invading Scotland, encamped one 
part of his army here, and the other at Newtyle in Angus." The 
truth of this supposition is very doubtful. The Romans usually 
encamped in the plain, not like the Danes and Britons on the 
hill or hill-side. Mr Wilkie adds, " that many urns and bones 
have been dug up on and near this hill." Of what description 
these urns were he omits to mention. Probably they were of the 
same kind with those Celtic urns of rudely moulded earthenware, 
which have been, at a more recent period, found in great numbers, 
on the adjoining lands of Edenwood, in the parish of Ceres. Urns 
exactly similar to these last have been discovered near Maiden 
Castle, in Collessie, and are described in the New Statistical Ac- 
count of that parish. 

Parochial Registers.— These parish records commence in the 
year 1693, and are continued downwards with little interruption 
to the present day. Prior to J 748, however, the entries are made 
in a very confused and slovenly manner,— the notices of births, 
marriages, and deaths being huddled together with the minutes of 
the kirk-session, and the accounts of the collections and disburse- 
ments for the poor. The older minutes of the Session exhibit 
some curious traits of the characters and manners of the times to 
which they refer. From the account of the collections, it ap- 
pears that these were sometimes made in former times, not only for 
the maintenance of the poor, and for missionary purposes, but for 
the repairing of roads, bridges, and harbours. And it more than 
once occurs that the recusant members of the congregation, who 
tail to give their mite to these occasional contributions, have their 
names reported to a subsequent meeting of the kirk-session and 
recorded in the minute. 

Eminent Men.-Th\s parish has the honour of being the birth- 
place of Sir David Wilkie, the celebrated painter, who was born 
in the manse on the 18th of November 1785. His father, the 
Rev. David Wilkie, for thirty-eight years minister of Cults, was- 
of a respectable family in Mid- Lothian, and was nephew to the 
famous Dr Wilkie, Professor of Logic in the University of St 
Andrews, and author of the « Epigoniad." His mother, Miss Isa

bel Lister, was the daughter of Mr James Lister, a most respec- 
table elder in the parish, and a man of singular sagacity and na- 
tural talents. The young painter shewed at an early period of 
life a strong predilection for that art, in which he has now acquir- 
ed so high and so well merited celebrity. Even the taunts of 
his brothers and companions did not deter him from embracing 
every opportunity, when yet on the very verge of infancy, of exhi- 
biting his natural tastes and prepossessions. And all the aversion, 
at first shewn by both his father and grandfather, to his following, 
what they conceived to be an idle arnd unprofitable pursuit, only 
served to verify the adage of Horace, " Naturam expelles furca, 
tamen usque recurret." His father's successor in the ministry 
has informed me, that when he first came to Cults, he found the 
walls of the nursery completely covered with eyes, noses, hands, 
and other parts of the human body, boldly executed, not with crayon, 
but with the charred end of a stick, — but that subsequently, on his 
return after a temporary absence, while the manse was undergo- 
ing repairs, he was shocked to find these interesting memorials 
obliterated, by the painter's brush no doubt, but by a very 
different one from that, which the young Artist was destined 
afterwards to make use of  Some of Wilkie's earliest perform- 
ances still exist, in the shape of portraits, which are admirable 
likenesses, and valued of course very highly by their fortunate 
possessors. The oldest of his unproductive paintings that I 
have heard of, is an exquisite representation of a poor family, 
the father sitting in tattered clothes, smoking a pipe by the fire- 
side, and his daughter, a buxom girl, bringing water from the well 
in an earthen vessel. It is now in the possession of a widow lady 
in St Andrews. In one person's possession, there are, among se- 
veral others of Wilkie's earlier efforts, two very exquisite likenesses 
of his brother's children, painted long before he reached the acme 
of his fame, — and a domestic scene, his father and mother at fa- 
mily worship, painted in his youth, and not unworthy of being com- 
pared with his recent treatment of a kindred subject, " The 
Cottar's Saturday Night." A report and belief is very gene- 
ral that the " Saracen's head," a sign board in the village of 
Pitlessie, was painted by Wilkie. This we have reason to know 
is a mistake. There is, however, in the possession of Robert Meth- 
ven, Esq. procurator fiscal for the County of Fife, a sign-board re- 
presenting a boy watering a horse, which was really painted by 
Wilkie when a mere boy for a small alehouse in the parish of Kettle- 



CULTS. 567 

" Pitlessie Fair" which was his first regular effort as an ar- 
tist, is now in the possession of a proprietor in an adjoining parish, 
Charles Kinnear, Esq. of Kinloch. It is a fine picture, contain- 
ing upwards of 150 figures graphically delineated and admirably 
grouped, including portraits of Wilkie himself, his father, brothers 
and sisters, and of many other characters well known in the pa- 
rish and neighbourhood, during the painter's earlier years. This 
picture is by competent judges considered equal in merit to some 
of the most admired productions of its distinguished artist, although, 
having never been engraved, it is less generally known. 

To mention or characterize any of his more recent performan- 
ces, would be quite superfluous. These are well known, and have 
been justly appreciated. As an artist he may be well accounted 
the boast not merely of a parish, or of a county, or even of a king- 
dom, — but of the art in general, wherever it is cultivated ; while 
in private life, as is well known, there is r\o man morejustly esteemed 
for his simple and unaffected manners, and his amiable and friend- 
ly disposition. — Sir David Wilkie was appointed by King George 
IV. Limner to his Majesty for Scotland, and in 1836 he received 
the honour of knighthood from King William IV. 

The Rev, David Wilkie, father of this celebrated artist, merits 
a special notice in this place, as the author of a valuable " Trea- 
tise on the Theory of Interest and Annuities ; with an illustration 
of the widow's scheme in the Church of Scotland :" as also Dr 
Thomas Gillespie, the present learned and able Professor of Hu- 
manity in the University of St Andrews, who succeeded Mr 
Wilkie in the ministry of the parish of Cults, and held that office 
for fifteen years. Dr Gillespie, besides numerous other literary 
productions, has published a volume of beautiful sermons on " The 
Seasons contemplated in the Spirit of the Gospel." 

Land-owners and Rental— Theve are tiree land-owners in this 
parish, none of them permanently resident, viz. The Right Ho-

Mansion Houses. — Crawfurd Castle and Priory is the only mo- 
dern mansion which merits particular notice under this head. 
It is a magnificent castellated building in the Gothic style of 
architecture. It was erected in 1812-13, by the late proprietor, 
Lady Mary Lindsay Crawfurd. The old seat of the Earls of 
Crawfurd and Lindsay was Struthers House, now in ruins, in the 
adjacent parish of Ceres. The old mansion house of Bunzeon, on 
the estate of that name, was formerly the seat of the Bruces of 
Bunzeon. Since the junction of this property with the Crawfurd 
estate, it has been converted into a farm-house. Bruce of Bunzeon 
represented the burgh of Cupar in the Scottish Parliament of 
1703, before the Union. 

Monuments. — There are no ancient monuments of any note in 
the church-yard of Cults. On the Walton hill, there is the mau- 
soleum of the Crawford family, a handsome Grecian building, 
erected by the father of the late Earl. And Sir David Wilkie has 
adorned the interior of the church with a noble piece of sculpture 
to the memory of his parents. It is executed by Chantrey in the 
best style of that distinguished sculptor. The medallion liknesses 
which it presents of Mr and Mrs Wilkie, from portraits by Sir 
David, are considered very striking. 

III. — Population. 

The following is a statement of the population of Cults at 
various periods downwards since 1751 : 

Number of inhabitants according to Session records in the year 1751, 464 
Number as returned to Dr Webster in - - - 1755, 449 

Number according to last Statistical Account in - - - 1791 534 
Jumber by Government census in - - - 1801, C99 

1811, 766 
1821, 853 

in 1831, males 435, females 4C8, total 903 

Number in January 1838, 9 [4 

Increase since 1751, 

since 1791, 380 

This progressive increase in the population is to be ascribed to 
the steadily advancing prosperity of trade and manufactures. 

Of the 914 present inhabitants of this parish, 516 reside in the 
village of Pitlessie, and 398 in the country. 

The yearly average for the last seven years of births is 20 

marriages, »i.57 
deaths. 16.14 
Of the 914 inhabitants of this parish there .are under 15 years of age, 322

There are three proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards ; one of them, the Earl of Glasgow, is occasionally 
resident. 

Character and Habits of the People. — There is nothing remark- 
able in the character or habits of the people to distinguish them 
from those of the surrounding district. They are for the most 
part healthy and vigorous ; and, on the whole, enjoy, in a reason- 
able measure, the comforts and advantages of society. 

Thirty-five years ago, smuggling prevailed to a great extent in 
the village of Pitlessie. It has since been entirely abandoned.

the parish is nearly 2250 ; of which there are,

There is no part of the land in a state of undivided common. 

Hushandry.—The system of husbandry adopted varies according 
to the qualities of the different soils. A rotation of five years is ge- 
nerally observed. The farm-buildings are, with a few exceptions, 
good and commodious. A great part of the land in this parish 
stands in much need of draining and enclosures. 

Rent ofLand.~The rent of land varies, according to the qua- 



570 



FlFESHlllE. 



lity of the soil, from IDs. to L. 3, 3s. per imperial acre. The 
average rent may be stated at L. 1, 5s. The duration of leases 
is usually nineteen years, and the rents are paid partly in fixed 
sums of money, and partly according to the fiars' prices of the 
county. 

Rate of Grazing. — The average rate of grazing is L. 2, 10s. for 
an ox or cow, and 7s. for a ewe or full-grown sheep. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle reared or fed in this parish are chiefly 
of the Fifeshire breed, to the improvement of which the farmers 
are most attentive. Few sheep are pastured, and these for the 
most part are of the black-faced and Cheviot breeds. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of a ploughman all perquisites in- 
cluded vary from L. 16 to L. 26. Female house-servants receive 
from L. 4, IDs. to L. 6, 10s. per annum. The wages of male day- 
labourers are from 8s. to 10s. per week; of female day-labourers 
from 4s. to 5s. per week. A mason's wages per day are 2s. 3d. ; 
a carpenter's are 2s. 

TAme-Quames. — There are extensive lime-quarries in this pa- 
rish, along the brow of the Pitlessie or Cults hill. The main stratum 
of limestone, which is 14 feet in thickness, is of a bluish colour, 
and when burnt affords an abundant supply of white lime of the 
finest quality. About 13 feet above it, there is another stratum, 
2 feet in thickness, of a darker blue colour, which, when burnt, 
yields a bluish lime. Both of these strata are regularly quarried to 
a great extent, the open face of the rock being about a mile and a 
half in length. 

Farther down the hill, about 120 yards to the north, another 
stratum may be observed cropping out in several places. This 
consists of what is called boulder limestone, and is 8 feet 6 
inches in thickness. It has been quarried at the eastern and west- 
ern extremities of the parish for road metal, but never, so far as I 
can ascertain, for supplying lime-shells. 

About the same distance 120 yards up the hill, to the south- 
wards of the main quarry, is seen the outcrop of a fourth stratum, 
6 feet in thickness, of superior quality to the lowest bed, but infe- 
rior to the two middle ones. It has been sometimes quarried, but 
not regularly. These different beds of limestone are separated 
from one another by strata of coal, shale, sandstone, and a kind of 
bastard limestone, which the miners call ' sklut." 

The limestone is obtained for the most part by " tirring," or 
removing the superincumbent strata. Mining is permitted by the 
terms of the leases, where the tirring would exceed 30 feet. And 



CULTS. 



571 



some of the under-ground quarries extend 120 yards inwards from 
the face of the rock. 

The quantity of lime sold annually exceeds 25,000 bolls, three of 
which bolls are equivalent to 16 cwt. About one-third of this 
quantity is shipped at Newburgh for Dundee and Perth, whence 
it is conveyed to Diinkeld, Crieff, Methven, Cupar Angus, and 
many other places in Forfarshire and Perthshire. The lime is of 
excellent quality, averaging upwards of ninety per cent, and some 
of it being entirely pure. The demand for it is great, and con- 
stantly increasing, insomuch that a far greater quantity might be 
disposed of annually, were it not for the difficulty that has been 
recently felt in procuring, at a reasonable distance, an adequate 
supply of coals for burning it. The rent paid annually by the 
tacksman is regulated by the extent of rock quarried, and ave- 
rages L, 365. 

The price of the lime when sold at the hill is 2s. 8d. per boll. 
The expense of tirring or mining and burning the lime, averages 
1 Od. per boll ; the expense of shipping a one horse cart-load of 
three bolls at Newburgh, including carriage, tolls, and shore- 
dues, is 4s., or Is. 4d. per boll ; the number of workmen mostly, 
belonging to the parish engaged at the quarries is 43 ; and their 
wages per week are from 9s. to 1 Os. 

Besides these workmen, the lime-quarries of Cults afford em- 
ployment to a number of carters in conveying coals to the kilns, 
and lime to the port of Newburgh. In the summer season, there 
are upwards of a hundred carters from the parishes of Cults, Ce- 
res, Collessie, Largo, Kennoway, Cupar, Kettle, and Cameron, 
regularly engaged in this occupation. The greater proportion of 
these are tenants of small farms, which, but for the carting of coal 
and lime, would not afford sufficient work for their horses. The 
coals for burning the lime are brought principally from Teasses, in 
the parish of Ceres, a small quantity from Burnturk, in Kettle, 
and from Kilmux, in Leven parish. 

Coal Mmes.— There were coalmines wrought, about fifty years 
ago, on the southern declivity of the Cults hill. These, however, 
have ever since been neglected, it being doubtful whether they 
could be wrought to any advantage. There are several beds 
of coal reposmg on the lime strata. One of these is 12 inches 
m thickness, and the coal is obtained from it in the process of tir- 
nng for the limestone. I have just learned, while engaged with 
this Statistical Account, that a bed of parrot coal has been dis 



572 



FIFESHIRE. 



covered, from 1 to 2 feet in thickness, cropping out between the 
two uppermost of the four strata of limestone. Of what extent 
this seam of coal may be, has not yet been ascertained. 

Sandstone Q;/arries. — There are a number of freestone quarries 
in different parts of the parish. The supply of stones is abund- 
ant, and easily obtained, and the quality of them is, in some cases, 
much esteemed. 

Jmount of Raw Produce. — The average gross amount of raw 
produce raised annually in this parish is as under : 

Grain of all kinds, 3400 quarters, with the straw, L. 5100 0 0 

Potatoes and turnips, 6000 tons, 5000 0 0 

Hay, 1200 tons, 3000 0 0 

600 acres, laid down in pasture at L. 1 , 5s. per acre, 750 0 0 

Produce of gardens, 180 0 0 

Thinning and felling of plantations, 140 0 0 

25,000 bolls of lime at 2s. 8d. per boll , 3333 6 8 

Quarrying of freestone, road metal, coal, &amp;c. about 36  3 4 

Gross annual amount of raw produce, L. 17,540 0 0 

Linen Weaving. — This branch of manufactures gives employ- 
ment to a large proportion of the parishioners. The kind of cloth 
woven is Dowlas. The webs are usually 140 yards long, and 30 
inches wide, containing at an average 35 spindles of yarn. The 
materials are supplied by manufacturers in Newburgh, Leslie, and 
Kettle, who have agents in the parish. The number of weavers 
is 85 males and 65 females, in all 150. Of these nearly one-half 
are boys or young women under twenty years of age ; while more 
than a fifth of the whole number are regularly employed at the 
loom only during the winter, the remainder being exclusively 
weavers, and following, except in harvest, no other occupation. 
The average gross wages per web are 17s., or, deducting 2s. 6d. 
for winding, dressing, &amp;c. the clear wages per web may be stated 
at 14s. 6d. The average rent of a loom stance is 9s. per annum. 
The number of webs usually wrought in the course of a year can- 
not be precisely ascertained ; 1700 may be taken as a fair estimate. 
Their value when wrought, at an average of L. 5 per web, is 
L. 8500, the gross sum paid for weaving them at 17s. is L. 1445, 
of which the weavers receive, as their clear wages at 14s. 6d., 
L. 1232, 10s. As to wages per week, few even of the best weavers, 
working steadily twelve or fourteen hours a day, will, after clearing 
all expenses, realize a greater sum weekly than 7s. The clear ave- 
rage wages earned per week may be stated at not more than 5s. for 
a man or woman, and 3s. for a boy or girl. The weaving of linens.

therefore, cannot be considered as at present affording by any means 
an adequate remuneration for the labour employed in it. 

Some of the webs being warped in the parish, there are twenty- 
four old women regularly employed in winding the larger bobbins 
for the warp, — at which they may earn at an average 2s. Id. per 
week. While in winding the smaller bobbins for the woof, the 
weavers usually employ their wives or children. At this latter em- 
ployment, if done for hire, fi-om 2s. 6d. to 3s. may be made per 
week. 

Tow Spinning. — At Hospital Mill, there were formerly a corn 
and a flax-mill, which, in 1821, were converted into a mill for 
spinning tow, at a cost of about L. 4000. The wheel when fully 
supplied with water, Cas it always is except for a few weeks in 
summer, works with fourteen horse power. The mill has six card- 
ing engines, with the other necessary preparing machinery, and 
ten spinning frames, containing 368 spindles. The size of yarn 
spun varies from four to fourteen pounds imperial per spindle. The 
quantity spun annually is from 160 to 180 tons, and its average 
value is L. 7000. The principal market to which it is sent is 
Dundee. 

In this factory, there are employed 50 persons, viz. 7 men at 
wages from 15s. to L. 1 per week; 31 women, 5s. 6d. to 6s.; 12 
children, 3s. 6d. to 3s. 9d. 

There is another factory Russell Mill in the parish of Cupar, 
a few hundred yards beyond the boundary, which also gives em- 
ployment to some of the inhabitants of Cults. These two esta- 
blishments are under the same management. In both of them, a 
most laudable attention is paid to the comfort, morals, and educa- 
tion of the working people, who are distinguished at once by their 
intelligence and their morality. 

Mz7/s.— Besides the spinning-mill, there are in the parish of 
Cults 3 mills for flour, barley, malt, and oatmeal ; 1 for cleaning 
yarn ; 1 saw-mill driven by water ; 1 saw-mill to be driven by steam 
in the course of being erected ; 3 thrashing machines driven by wa- 
ter ; and 6 thrashing machines wrought by horses. 

Tradesmen.— The different tradesmen in Cults are as follows, 
masters, journeymen, and apprentices being all included : 7 
Wrights, 14 masons, 9 shoemakers, 4 tailors, 2 turners, 7 black- 
smiths, 2 bakers, 2 brewers, and 5 grocers.

is Cupar, about four miles to the eastward, where there is a week- 
ly market held every Thursday. 

Means of Communication. — The high road from Dundee to 
Edinburgh traverses the parish, and three coaches, one of them 
the mail-coach, pass along it daily in each direction. There 
is a carrier from Pitlessie to Cupar, every Thursday, and the Cu- 
par and Edinburgh carriers pass that village thrice a week going 
to Edinburgh, and thrice a week returning. Letters are brought 
from the post-office at Cupar, by a messenger who goes thither 
with letters and parcels usually every day. 

Roads. — There are two miles of turnpike-road in the parish, 
and six miles 1615 yards of statute labour roads. 

Villages. — The only village that can be properly so called is 
Pitlessie, containing 516 inhabitants. There are also four small 
hamlets or groups of houses ; Crossgates, Walton, Cults Mill, and 
Hospital Mill, containing from 22 to 70 inhabitants. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated in the centre of the 
parish, but is nearly a mile distant from the village of Pitlessie, where 
the mass of the population are congregated. It was built in 1793, 
and is in good repair. It was seated originally for 360 persons, 
but a want of seat-room having been recently felt, the kirk-session, 
in July 1835, requested the heritors to supply it, by affording ad- 
ditional accommodation. The heritors, with commendable libera- 
lity, acceded to our request, so that there is now ample seat-room 
for 430 persons ; and the church, it may be added, is as well fil- 
led, now that it is enlarged, as it was before the addition was made. 

The manse, which adjoins the church, was built in 1795, and is in 
good repair. The glebe consists of four acres of good arable 
land, and is at present let at a rent of L. 9. There is no foggage 
or grass glebe, — the late Mr Wilkie having, with the concurrence 
of the Presbytery of Cupar, agreed to accept of L. 2 Sterling in 
lieu of it. 

The stipend, exclusive of vicarage and communion elements, 
averages L. 150. It is as follows: barley, 41 bolls, 3 firlots, 
3 pecks, 1\\ lippies; meal, 16 bolls, 3 pecks, 2 hppies ; 
oats, 40 bolls, 1 peck, 2{| lippies; money stipend including 
L. 3, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, L. 12, 7s. 2d. ; sum al- 
lowed from the Exchequer to augment the stipend, L. 60, 2s. ; 
vicarage, L. 2, lis. 8d. 

Religious Denominations. — The number of famihes and indivi- 
duals of all ages belonging to the different religious denominations, 
will appear from the following table : 



CULTS. 



Established CInircli, 150 families. 678 persons. 

United Associate Synod, 29 . 136 

Relief Synod, -13 . 57 

Original Burgher Synod, 2 . 8 

Independents, . 8 . 8 

Besides these, there are two or three families that are not at- 
tached to any religious denomination. 

There is a Dissenting chapel in Pitlessie, in connection with the 
United Associate Synod. Twenty-five years ago, there was in the 
same village an Independent chapel, which has since been con- 
verted into a dweUing-house, the congregation attaching them- 
selves, for the most part, either to the Established Church, or to 
some other Dissenting communion. The number of communicants 
of the Established Church is 348. 

Education. — The parish school is in the village of Pitlessie. The 
teacher has a comfortable house, a spacious school-room, the 
legal extent of garden ground, and the maximum salary of L. 34, 
4s. 4id. The branches of education taught by him are, Latin, 
French, Enghsh grammar, writing, bookkeeping, arithmetic, al- 
gebra, navigation, and land-surveying. The school-fees for the 
different branches are, 2s. per quarter for reading; 3s. forreadino-, 
and writing ; 3s. 6d. when arithmetic is added ; and 5s. for Latin. 
Taking the average of the last seven years, the number of scho- 
lars is 60, the amount of school-fees L. 30 per annum, and the 
emoluments of the teacher derived from other sources, as the ses- 
sion clerkship and registration, are L. 6. There is a private school 
taught in Pitlessie at present, and attended by 45 scholars. The 
branches taught in it are, reading, writing and arithmetic ; and the 
school fees are, for reading, 2s. ; for writing and arithmetic, 2s, 
6d. There is also, in a remote district of the parish, a third school 
taught by a female, and attended by 20 young children at an ave- 
rage, who pay some of them Id. and others 2d. per week. A 
Sabbath school is taught in the church, attended by from 30 to 
40 young people, according to the season of the year. 

Poor.— The average number of paupers receiving regular aid is 
12. The sums allowed to them vary from 4s. to 10s. per month, 
exclusive of house-rent, and coals in winter, with which they are 
also supplied. Besides these, there are some other persons to 
whom occasional assistance is given. The whole expenses of the 
kirk-session, for th'e last seven years, average L. 50 per annum. The 
annual amount of collections at the church-door exclusive of 
those for religious purposes averages only L. 12 ; and the defici- 
ency has of late years been supplied partly by the voluntary con- 



576 



FIFESHIIIK. 



tributions of the heritors, and partly by a gift of L. 100 made to 
the kirk-session by the Honourable Lord Lindsay, as legatee of 
the late Lady Mary Lindsay Crawfurd, of which there are still 
L. 40 remaining. Little delicacy is shewn in applying for paro- 
chial aid, — the independent spirit of the Scottish peasantry hav- 
ing, in a great measure, died away in this quarter. In the course 
of one or two years, a legal assessment for the support of the poor 
will be inevitable. 

Alehouses. — There are 8 licensed ale and spirit-dealers, se- 
ven in Pitlessie, and one in Crossgates. 

Puel. — The fuel principally used is coal, brought for the most 
part from Balbirnie, in the parish of Markinch, about six miles on 
the road to Kirkcaldy. Its cost at the pit is Is. 3d. per load of 
18 stone. 

Pairs. — There were formerly two annual fairs in Pitlessie, for 
the sale of agricultural stock, chiefly cattle, the one held on the 
second Tuesday of May, old style, and the other on the third 
Wednesday of October, old style. The latter has for some years 
been discontinued ; the former is still kept, and is very generally 
resorted to. It is one of the best attended fairs in the county of Fife. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 

In comparing the state of the parish now, with what it appears 
to have been in 1791, when the last Statistical Account was writ- 
ten, little occurs as worthy of remark. Great improvements have, 
as might have been expected, taken place in agriculture. Instead 
of 900 Scots, equal to 1 134 imperial acres, the whole extent of 
arable land in 1791, there are now 1900 imperial acres under re- 
gular cultivation. The extent of woodland has greatly diminish- 
ed, there being now only 115 imperial acres of wood, instead of 
400 Scots, equal to 504 imperial acres. The population was then 
534; it is now 914. The wages of a day-labourer were then lOd. 
per day ; they are now from Is. 4d. to Is. 8d. Houses for labour- 
ers were then let at from 4s. to L. 1 a year ; they are let now at 
from L. 1 to L. 3. There were then only two thrashing-machines, 
there are now nine. The old Statistical Account makes no men- 
tion of manufactures, from which it may be concluded that they 
did not then form, by any means, so important a source as they 
now do, of employment and subsistence to the parishioners. Since 
1791, the following buildings have been erected : a spinning-mill, 
a saw-mill, a yarn-mill, a stone bridge across the Eden at Clush- 
ford, the present Church, the manse, and Crawfurd priory.

ADDENDUM. 

While these pages have been passing through the press, I have 
been informed by Dr Anderson of Newburgh, to whom I am in- 
debted for the geology of the parish, that an omission occurs in 
the series of deposits, as described by him, and that, immediately 
after the second paragraph in which the yellow sandstone is noti- 
ced, several other beds should be stated as following in the order 
of superposition. Immediately above the yellow sandstone, a se- 
ries of alternating beds of sandstone, coal, ironstone, and shale oc- 
cur. There are two thin seams of coal, the lowest of which may 
be observed cropping out at the farm steading of Cults-Dam, and 
the other beds have been quarried about a mile to the westward. 
The thickness of the whole appears to be about 200 feet. 
For «orthocerates,"in the next paragraph, read « orthoceratites."

PRESBYTEEY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

REV. JOHN THOMSON, MINISTER. 



Topography and Natural History 
Name, §-c.— The name of this parish, according to the most an- 
cient orthography, is Balmurynach, Balmerinoch, and more recent- 
ly Balmerino,~ievms obviously of Gothic origin, and compounded 
of two words signifying " Sailor's Town." It would appear that 
the name was first applied to a small village of remote antiquity, 
pleasantly situated on the banks of the estuary of the Tay and 
which, so early as the thirteenth century, attracted the notice of the 
court as an eligible summer residence,-Queen Emergarde having 
requently visited the place for the benefit of her health ; and clos 

r it''"i'''"°"y° S'"' f°"nded an abbey 

lkevlse a term of Gothic origin, which according to the manu- 
-npt register of the priory of St Andrews, w.as ancient w "en 

Sot n7 T hort, and to modern ears less 

tnZl:T: 1 he best 

authorities, had sole possession of the whole of this district of the 



5T8 



FIFESHIRE. 



county, for aperiod of at least athousand years ; and no wonder that, in 
the course of that time, their language should have given names to 
every locality within their dominions, many traces of which are still 
to be found in this immediate neighbourhood. 

Boundaries and Extent— The parish stretches along the south 
bank of the estuary of Tay, from near the mansion-house of 
Birkhill, on the west, to the Wormit Bay on the east. From 
these two points, it ranges in a semicircular form towards the 
small stream of Motray, which constitutes its boundary on the 
south. Its length along the Tay from east to west, is about 3 
miles, and its breadth from north to south about 2 miles. It 
is bounded on the north by the Frith of Tay ; on the west, by 
the parish of Flisk ; on the south by Kilmany ; on the east by 
Forgan or St Fillans. Within this area there are contained about 8 
square miles. 

Topographical Appearances.— Tv/o hilly ridges traverse the 
parish from east to west, and run neariy parallel to each other. 
The Scurr Hill and Coultry Hill form the loftiest points of their 
respective ridges ; the former, which rises in the northern divi- 
sion of the parish, attains an elevation of about 400 feet above the 
level of the Tay ; and the latter, which occupies the southern 
division, is about 500. The manse and church are beautifully si- 
tuated within the intervening valley, which at this point is very 
narrow, but gradually stretches out to considerable dimensions m 
its progress eastward. About the centre of the southern ridge, 
there is a considerable extent of high table-land in which the vil- 
lage of Galdry is placed ; the ground slopes gently down on the 
south towards the valley of Kilmany, and is terminated on the east 
by the ravine of Wormit-Den, which here separates the parish 
from Forgan : the hamlets of Coultry and Corbie Hill he towards 
the western extremity. The northern ridge declines more rapidly 
towards the Tay, the shores of which, along the whole boundary, 
are extremely bold and rocky, rising in some places mto precipi- 
tous mural cliffs. The villages of Kirkton and Bal merino are 
both situated on the western slope of the Scurr Hill ; and a little 
to the south lie the ruins of the Abbey, where the ground gradu- 
ally declines towards the banks of the Tay. The house of Naugh- 
ton is built on the southern accUvity of a small isolated ridge, 
which rises abruptly a little to the east of the church, in the centre 
of the valley, on the summit of which the ruins of an old castle 
still to be seen. A beautiful picturesque dell lies immediate-

cularly to the height of ninety or one hundred feet, and which is 
overhung by the walls of the building; presenting no mean idea 
of the strength of a place that must have frequently been put to 
proof by the rude assailants of a former age. The parish is well 
wooded, every spot almost, which is less adapted for tillage, being 
covered with thriving plantations, and without which, many of the 
grounds, from their elevated situation, would suffer much by their 
exposure to the easterly gales. 

Climate.— Fevf places in Fife can boast of a healthier climate. 
The soil is generally dry, resting immediately, over the greater 
part, on whinstone rock ; and there is neither bog nor marsh to 
interfere with its general salubrity. Ancient history, as well as 
modern experience, attests its superiority in this respect. Martin 
takes notice of the fact in his history of the See of St Andrews. 
" Magdalene, Queen of James V. being," he says, « a tender Lady' 
the physicians choosed this place St Andrews, and the Abacie 
of Balmerinoch, as having the best aers of any places in the king- 
dome for her residence and abode." In subsequent generations, 
dames of meaner degree have been no less indebted to the excel' 
lence of its " aers," as the following well authenticated facts 
clearly prove. The writer of the former Statistical account says, 
" The wholesomeness of the climate appears also from the fruit- 
fulness of the females. The present incumbent has often, in the 
course of ten years, had an opportunity of baptizing twins; and 
there are two families in the parish at present, one of whom has 
had thrice twins, and the other had five sons at two births " I 
may be permitted to add, that that individual, during his incum 
bency, baptized, in the parish, three times trines. 

Few parishes of equal extent contain a greater number of very 
old people. There are at present 35 individuals bordering 
on or upwards of eighty years. One woman is in her ninetv-fifth 
year, and another died last year in her hundredth. From March 
1836 to March 1837 six individuals died, whose united ages amount- 
ed to five hundredand twelve, giving an average of eighty five-years 
first year '"umbent died in March 1836, in his ninety- 

Hydrography.-The Tay, as already noticed, washes the north- 
ern boundary of the parish, and, possessing a considerable pro- 
per ion of salme matter, affords, everywhere along the coast, excel- 
lent opportunities of bathing to the inhabitants. The estuary is

here about four miles broad, but, as high sand-banks stretch out- 
ward for nearly a mile, vessels of limited burden only can approach 
the harbour. No river or stream of any consequence passes 
through the parish, but there are various springs from which a co- 
pious flow of water continually issues, which, along with that col- 
lected from the drainage of the land, afibrds power enough for 
three thrashing and one corn-ntiill. The springs have obviously 
served, in other days, a more dignified and important end than 
the practical and economical one to which they are now applied. 
This appears from the names by which some of them are still de • 
signated, viz. the Lady Well, Prior Well, St John's Well, &amp;c. 

Geoloffi/— The rocks in this parish belong exclusively to the 
sandstone and trap families. Of the former there are two va- 
rieties, both of which belong to the old red sandstone formations. 
One of these is the gray sandstone, which is considered by Dr 
Anderson Edin. Phil. Journal, July 1837, as the lowest member 
of the series, and which, from the organic remains imbedded in 
it, he regards as the same with the beds that traverse the Sidlaws, 
Strathmore, and the upper part of Strathearn. These remains are 
exclusively vegetable, being the culms, leaves, and fruit of the or- 
der Graminese, and which -are found in great abundance in one 
of the softer beds of the deposit that emerges a little to the west 
of Wormit Bay. From this point, where it ntiay be traced across 
the frith to Invergowrie bay, the sandstone ranges westward through 
the parish, cropping out at Demmons, and various other places 
on the estate of Birkhill. It is an extremely compact and dura- 
ble rock, and is admirably adapted for building operations. The 
bed in which the organic remains are found, is friable and soft, 
and seems to abound more in aluminous than silicious matter. 
The mica is also very abundant in this part of the deposit. 

The other variety of sandstone is of a reddish colour. It crops 
out immediately at the harbour, and ranges westward to Birkhdl, 
where it may be observed on the beach beneath the mansion-house. 
It contains a considerable quantity of quartzy nodules, and por- 
tions of other primitive rocks, A scale— only one— has been 
found in it, similar to those which occur so abundantly in the Park- 
hill and Clashbennie beds, also at Dura and Drumdryan, and 
from this circumstance, it may fairly be regarded as acontmuation 
of these interesting rocks. The bed at. the harbour is coarse

grained, compact, and hard, and at one time was much sought after 
for oven floors. 

The trap or whinstone consists of several varieties, namely, amygda- 
loid, trap tuffa, compact felspar, clinkstone, and claystone porphyry. 
Interesting sections of each may be seen along the shore, from the 
harbour towards Wormit Bay. The amygdaloid is generally coarse 
and tufifaceous, but gradually passes, in many places, into a finer va- 
riety, which may be considered as approaching to the characters 
of a greenstone. The numerous cavities contained in the coarse 
kind are lined with white amethyst, flesh-red calcareous spar, 
white felspar, calcedony, agate, green earth, and common quartz. 
In these nodular masses, the calcedony appears to have been first 
deposited and the quartz last. The Scurr Hill is well known to 
the lapidaries and other collectors of these beautiful minerals, 
and no part of the island, perhaps, affords in such abundance, as 
well as such rare and choice specimens of the several varieties of 
agates. The compact felspar becomes porphyritic, is of a deep 
flesh-red colour, and susceptible of a fine pohsh. The whole of 
these rocks, as may be seen at Wormit Bay and Birkhill, are in- 
timately associated with the stratified deposits, and afford the stu- 
dent in geology an interesting view of the manner in which the 
igneous matter has been injected amongst the sedimentary beds ; 
as well as the induration and disruptions among the latter, that 
have resulted from the intrusion of the former. The sandstone 
is, in many instances, by the intrusion of the trap, spht up into thin 
laminae, varying from an inch to a quarter of an inch in thickness; 
it is sometimes tossed into a vertical position ; and in other cases, 
as at Birkhill beach, the two rocks are so blended and mixed up 
with each other, as to render it difficult to distinguish them, or 
toseparate the amorphous from the stratified portions. 

Boulders of primitive rocks are to be found in every locality 
along the shore, as well as on the highest ridges. One of huge 
dimensions, which lay a little to the north of the manse, excited no 
small degree of attention, as well as speculation, among the peo- 
ple, as to the means by which it had been placed, bridge-like, 
across a stream there. It measured about twelve feet in length 
by nine in breadth, and was of great thickness. By the last in- 
cumbent, who was fonder of practical agricultural improvements 
than of plausible and ingenious speculations, it was unceremonious- 
ly committed to the blasting influences of gunpowder, when, after 
being blown into an hundred fragments, it afforded employment

of many days hard work before it could be carted away to the en- 
closures on the grass glebe. It was a primitive hornblend, or 
greenstone rock, and must have been transported from beyond 
" the far distant Grampians" by the agency of floods, of which we 
have now happily no experience. 

Soil — The soil is in general thin, of a'black loamy quality where 
it rests immediately upon the whinstone ; and is fit for carrying 
crops of every description. This is generally the character of the 
fields which range along the southern and northern divisions of 
the parish. Much of the intervening valley consists of either a 
light and gravelly soil, or of a strong plastic till, but, through the 
operations of an enterprising tenantry, it has been rendered com- 
pletely fertile. 

Botany. — The plants which occur in this parish are such as are 
common to the general flora of the Ochils, and, as it can boast of 
neither lake nor marsh, few aquatics are found within it. Along 
the shore, the following are to be met with : Scirpus maritimus, 
Agrostis vulgaris, Hordeum maritimum, Triticum loliaceum, Glaux 
maritima, Rumex maritima, Statice Armeria, Alisma plantago, 
Cochlearia Anglica, Artemisia maritima. Throughout the other 
districts of the parish the following occur abundantly : Fedia 
olitoria, Iris pseudacorus, Briza media, Parietaria officinalis. 
Primula vulgaris, elatior and veris, Agrimonia eupatoria, Geum 
rivale, Bartsia odontites, Geranium srjlvaticum, Malva sylvestris, 
Scrophularia nodosa, Euphorbia paralia, Silene injlata. Lychnis 
Flos-cuculi and dioica, Tussilago petasites, Tulipa sylvestris, once 
abundant at the Abbey, but now very rare. 

II. — Civil History. 

Under this head, few particulars can be gleaned, from any au- 
thentic sources, of sufficient importance to be communicated to 
the public. The history of the Monastery, which will be noticed 
in its proper place, is connected with the earliest transactions that 
are to be found in the records of the parish ; and as there are no 
chartered towns in it, or corporations of any kind, nothing of a 
civic or burghal description requires to be stated. 

Eminent Men.— Among the list of eminent men, however, its 
annals can justly boast of two, if public notoriety or a tragical 
end entitle any to that distinction. One of these was the ce- 
lebrated Lord Balmerino, who suffered for his share in the re- 
bellion of- 1745, and whose history is too well known to need 
repetition here. The family estate was in this parish, and pas-

sed, after its forfeiture to the Crown, into the hands of the York- 
Building Company, from whom it was purchased by the family of 
Moray, and is now in the possession of Francis Stuart, Esq., ne- 
phew of the present Earl. The other individual alluded to is 
Andrew GuUan, who was also a native of this parish, and was 
hanged on Magus Muir as an accessory to the murder of Archbi- 
shop Sharpe, being convicted of the crime ".of holding Halker- 
stone of Rathillet's mare," while the principal conspirators were 
engaged in that bloody deed. 

A name of less questionable distinction than either of the above 
remains to be noticed, — Mr Peter Hay, son of the laird of Meg- 
ginsh, and who becamie proprietor of Naughton about the begin- 
ning of the seventeenth century. This gentleman was author of 
a work entitled " The First Blast of the Trumpet," printed in 
1627, and which is well known to have had considerable influence 
on the stirring events of that reforming age. It excited the spe- 
cial displeasure ef Archbishop Spottiswood, as appears from the 
records of the synod of St Andrews, in which the following allu- 
sion to it occurs : " The Synod haldin at St Androis, 2d October 
1627, my Lord Archbishop desyred that the purpose concerning 
Mr Peter Hay of Naughton his bulk, suld not be mentioned in 
the Publict Synod, and declaired that his Lordship would not be 
present if the sam war spoken of."  

Parliamentary Constituency. — The number of persons who are 
qualified to vote for a Member of Parliament, in consequence of 
the Magna Charta of 1832, amounts to 22. 

Land-owners. — The principal proprietors in the parish are, Mrs 
Bethune Morison of Naughton ; Henry Scrimgeour Wedderburn, 
Esq. of Wedderburn and Birkhill ; and Francis Stuart, Esq. of 
Balmerino. There are five additional heritors, whose properties 
are comparatively small. Two of the principal, and three of the 
small, heritors reside in the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest records of the session, in- 
cluding births and marriages, date from 1652, and have been to- 
lerably well kept. 

Antiquities. — The ruins of the Abbey of Balmerino constitute 
the chief object of attraction under this head. The site of the 
building has been admirably chosen, as -a place at once of beauty, 
comfort, and convenience, standing on an eminence in the imme- 
diate vicinity of the Tay, and commanding a full view of that

noble estuary, as far up as its junction with the Earn. It is situ- 
ated on the south bank of the Frith, about twelve miles from its 
mouth, -and overlooks, towards the north, the rich and fertile Carse 
of Gowrie, where the eye is presented with a wide range of pleas- 
ing and impressive scenery, with the lofty peaks of the Grampians 
towering majestically above the whole ; forming such a richly di- 
versified and striking panorama, as may vie with those of greater 
celebrity. 

This monastery was founded by Alexander II. in the year 
1229, at the suggestion of his mother, Emergarde, widow of King 
William the Lyon, in consequence of the beauty of the situation, 
and the benefit she had derived to her health by her occasional 
visits to the district. It belonged to the order of the Cistertians, 
whose earliest settlement in this country was at Melros, and was 
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and St Edward the Confessor. The 
dress of the Cistertians was a white cassock, whence they were 
called " Monachi alhi" with a narrow scapulary, over which they 
wore a black gown when they went abroad, and a white one when 
they went to the church. The rules of the order were those of 
St Benedict, which, in regard to food and other necessaries for the 
table, enjoined the utmost plainness and abstinence, in the shape 
of everything that approached to luxury. Flesh was allowed only 
to the sick. They might use the. common herbs of the country, 
but pepper and the foreign spices were forbidden. It was direct- 
ed that their monasteries should be situated in the most retired and 
solitary places : and that the monks were to live by the labour of 
their hands, in cultivating the earth, and keeping cattle. When 
any of them went abroad, they were obliged always to go two to- 
gether, to guard and witness each others conduct, and to prompt 
each other to good thoughts. They all slept in the same dormi- 
tory, which was a long room, not divided into separate cells ; and 
each monk had a bed to himself, furnished with a mat, blanket, 
coverlet, and pillow, which was prescribed to be only a foot and a 
half long. The superior ecclesiastics took considerable pains to 
cultivate and promote learning, so that from the strictness of the 
rules, and the works that resulted from their labours, the Cister- 
tian order soon acquired celebrity, and speedily came to have 
monasteries in every country in Europe, all of which had the pri- 
vilege of being independent of the bishop within whose diocese they 
were situated

BALMEUINO. 



585 



The Abbey of Balmerino seems to have been richly endowed, 
when we consider the abstemious habits and severe rules enjoined 
upon the order. Queen Emergarde bestowed upon it the lands 
of Cultrach, Balmurynach and Ardin, which she bought from Sir 
Adam de Stawell for 1000 merks Sterling; and she left 200 
merks, to be bestowed by her executors in purchasing from Lau- 
rence de Abernithy, a full resignation of his interest in the lands 
of Cultrach, Balnedan, Balnedart, Corteby and Balmurynach. 
King Alexander granted the foundation charter on 3d February 
1230,-f- and added to the lands bestowed by his mother, the church 
and lands of Lochmure  in Angus, and Petgornoc and Drum- 
dol in Fife. David de Lindesay gives it an annuity out of his mill 
of Kirkhuet, which was confirmed by King Alexander II. in 1233. 
The preceptory of Gadvan, near Denbog, in Fife, with the house 
and lands, belonged also to this abbey ; and two or three monks 
of their order constantly resided in that place. 1 

Balmerino, in the course of the thirteenth, or early in the 
fourteenth century, received several benefactions fiVm persons of 
the family of Kynner, of lands in the territories of Kynner and 
Cotholoc ; a fishing in Tay from Sir David de Berkeley of Brechin ; 
the quarry of Nydin from Hugh de Nydin ; and numerous small 
burgage possessions in Perth, Dundee, Crail, and Anstruther. 
In the year 1561, at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, 
the revenues of this abbey were, in money L. 704, 2s. lOd.; wheat, 
4 chalders; oats, 1 chalder, 14 bolls, 1 firlot, 31 pecks; meal, 15 
chalders, 12 bolls, 2 firlots; bear 21 chalders, 12 bolls, 3 firlots, 
lpeck; total 43 chalders, 6 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck; and 763 
poultry. 

The monks of Balmerino did not always adhere rigidly to the 
rules of their order. With the progress of their wealth, and the 
benefactions which were from time to time bestowed upon them, 
they became gradually more and more relaxed in their habits, till 
they came, according to the Franciscan of Buchanan, to share in 
all the corruptions of the times. In 1 533,§ a special commission 
was appointed to visit and reform the monasteries thoughout Scot- 
land. The faults which particularly called forth this animadver- 
sion, were infringements of the rule which forbade the brethren to 
possess any private property, but to have all things in common.

It was found that many of the monks, especially in the abbeys of 
Melros, Newbattle, and Balmerino had not only portions and pen- 
sions allowed them for their food and clothing, but that each monk 
had also a garden appropriated to his own particular use and pleasure. 
The visitor, therefore, in his visitation roll specified these things as 
illicit indulgences, which he enjoined them forthwith to relinquish. 
With this the monks did not comply, and after a convocation of 
them had been held at Edinburgh, it was agreed that they might 
retain their private gardens, provided no monk had a larger one 
han another, and that a common way was made through all the 
gardens by opening a passage from one to another, the produc- 
tions of the whole being made a common stock, and applied to 
the use of the convent. The garden ground of this monastery 
seems to have been immediately around the building, as is still in- 
dicated by the name, viz. the orchard and over-yards, by the rich- 
ness of the soil, its black loamy character, and the abundance of 
oyster shells contained in it, and must have comprised an extent 
of many acres. 

The abbey was demolished by the Lords of the Congregation 
on their way from St Andrews in 1 568. The last abbot was Sir 
John Hay, probably of the family of Naughton. He was master 
of requests in the reign of Queen Mary f in 1561. After the Re- 
formation, the abbey was erected into a temporal lordship, in fa- 
vour of Sir James Elphinston of Barnton, created Lord Balmeri- 
noch, 20th February ] 604, whose rise to power, and subsequent 
condemnation and disgrace, are matters of public history. 

The building is now a complete ruin, a small portion of the 
walls and a few pillars being all that remains to indicate the an- 
cient magnificence of the monastery. One arched room, indeed, 
and a cell or dormitory, is still pretty entire ; but to what part of the 
erection these belonged , it is impossible to conjecture. The pil- 
lars are clustered, and the corbals or capitals from which the arches 
spring, and some of the key-stones, bear marks of the elegance 
with which they have been originally finished ; on many of which 
the Ukeness of fruit, flowers, and religious emblems, as well as 
more grotesque figures, may still be traced. A drawing of the 
building as it stands may be seen in Swan's Views in Fife, now 
in the progress of publication. 

The old Castle of Naughton, already alluded to, is equally now

" the shadow of a shade," — all that remains of it being a few 
fragments of the lower parts of the side walls. This place is said 
to have been built by Robertas de Lundon, a natural son of King 
William. Soon after, Naughton was acquired by John de Haya, 
the third son of William de Haya, the first of the family of Errol. 
The Hays are mentioned as Lairds of Naughton about King 
Alexander HI.'s reign, f In 1494, Sir Patrick Crichton got 
the lands in marriage with Janet, the daughter and heiress of Sir 
James de la Hay.]: From the Crichtons, Mr Peter Hay,§ a son of 
the Laird of Megginsh purchased the lands in the beginning of the 
seventeenth century. In the year 1737, the estate was brought to 
ajudicial sale by the creditors of Robert Hay of Naughton, and pur- 
chased by William Morison, Esq. the great grandfather of the 
present proprietor, Mrs Bethune Morison. 

Here, according to Sibbald, there was an establishment of 
Culdees in connection with that of St Andrews. Three churches 
are particularly mentioned in " Extracts from the Large Regis- 
ter :" one at Forteviot, one at Monechata, or Moonzie, and one at 
Doldanha or Nauchton. These buildings, it appears, were all of 
wood ; and, of course, conjecture as to the site of the erection here 
would be vain. Monechata is supposed by Dr Jamieson, in his 
history of the Culdees, to be Monikie in Forfarshire ; but if Dol- 
danha be an allowable transition into Nauchton, there can be no 
reasonable objection upon this ground, to the change of Monechata, 
into Moonzie, which, along with Forteviot, was ever afterwards at- 
tached to the see of St Andrews, when the Culdee establishments 
gave way to the monastic institutions. 

There is a field in the parish called the Battle-law, where the 
Scots, itis said, attacked the Danes after their'retreat from Luncarty, 
again defeated, and forced them to flee with precipitation, on 
board their ships, then lying in the mouth of Tay. Near this 
field, have been found stone-coffins, bones, and pieces of broken 
swords. At the farm of Peashills, about a mile north-east of the 
above-named field, were found some years ago two pieces of gold, 
of the value of L. 14 Sterling. One piece was in the form of 
a ball, and appeared to have been the knob usually attached to the 
hilt of a sword ; the other, which is in the possession of Mrs Mori- 
son of Naughton, has evidently been an ornament of some kind

or other ; but whether it adorned the helmet, the breast-plate, or 
the sword handle, antiquaries have not yet fully agreed. 

Modern Buildings. — There is little to be noticed in this re- 
spect. Birkhiil, the seat of Henry S. Wedderburn of Wed- 
derburn and Birkhiil, is a very elegant and commodious mansion, 
beautifully situated amongst extensive plantations, on the banks 
of the Tay. Naughton House was erected in the end of the last 
century, and has since received many alterations and improve- 
ments. The church and manse were built, — the first in 1811 and 
the other in 1816; the former is rather small for the increasing 
wants of the parish ; the latter, with an excellent set of offices, is 
suitable and commodious. They are all built of stone found in 
the parish. 

HI. — Population. 
The population of the parish has been steadily on the increase 
for many years past, owing to feuing, and to its vicinity to Dun- 
dee, where employment can easily be procured in the manufac- 
turing of linen, &amp;c. 

The population in 1755 amounted to 565 
1491 - 703 

1821 , 965 

1831 - 1055 

1837 - 1170 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is 27, of mar- 
riages 6. There is no register of deaths kept. The average num- 
ber of persons, their ages, employments, and families is as under :

The number of endividuals employed in weaving is about 150. 
The rest are chiefly engaged in agriculture. There are in the 
parish 5 grocers, 3 wrights, 4 shoemakers, 3 blacksmiths, 3 tailors, 
1 medical practitioner, and 5 publicans. 

Character of the People. — The inhabitants are justly entitled to 
be regarded as honest, industrious, sober, and extremely exem- 
plary in their attendance upon the ordinances of religion. They 
are strongly attached to the Established Church, and less than or- 
dinarily given to the following of divisive courses.

Rent of Land. — The valued rent of the parish amounts to 
L. 4085, 10s. Scots. The real rent is about L. 4800 Sterling. ' 
The average rent of arable land is about L. 1, 16s. per imperial acre. 

Rate of wages. — A ploughman's wages averages from L. 10 to 
L. 12, with Q\ bolls of oatmeal per annum and a pint Scots of 
sweet milk per day ; female house-servants have from L. 5 to 
L. 6 per annum ; labourers Is. 6d. ; and female-field labourers 
8d. per day ; masons and wrights have from 16s. to 18s. a 
week ; a good weaver labouring twelve hours per day will average 
about 2s. 

Produce. — The amount of produce may be estimated as follows : 

Value of all kinds of grain, L. 8500 
potatoes, - ] 200 

cattle, . 1440 

L. 11,140 

The produce of the salmon-fishings, which used to be immense, has 
not for some years past paid rent and wages, exclusive of material. 

Cattle are sold off fat, rising three years old, and bring from L. 10 
to L. 15 a-head. Turnips and hay are consumed by the stock, 
except in very rare instances. About 105 cattle are yearly fiitten- 
ed for the butcher, and as many calves reared. There are in the 
parish'-14 thrashing-machines, three of which are driven by water 
power, 47 ploughs, and 98 horses for agricultural purposes. 

Husbandry. — The method of cropping varies according to the 
nature of the soil. On the strongest soils, a rotation of six years 
is adopted, viz. fallow a potatoes, wheat, green-crop, turnip or 
pease, barley, grass, and oats. On the lighter soils, the rotation 
is, potatoes, wheat, barley, grass to lie two years and oats : and 
on the lightest, green crop turnip eaten off with sheep, barley, 
grass to lie two or three years, and oats. The farmers gene- 
rally take grass parks for their young stock, to supply the want of 
pasture at home. 

Fishings. — The salmon-fishery, once so productive here, is 



590

now very inconsiderable, being confined exclusively to tbe toot-net 
method of capturing the fish. The net employed is from 50 to 
80 yards long, and differs little from the common seine or sweep 
net. Instead of being constantly kept m motion, as the latter is, 
it is attached to a boat at anchor, and only hauled when the toots- 
man, who watches in the boat, observes a fish strike the net. It 
is totally unsuited to estuary fishing. 

The number of boats connected with the fisheries in this pa- 
rish amount to 7, and they keep employed 14 men during the open 
season. The fisheries belong to Mr Wedderburn of Birkhill, 
Mrs B. Morison of Naughton, and Mr Stuart of Balmerino, and 
are rented at about L. 50 per annum. 

The spirhng fishery was once productive here also ; but for se- 
veral years back, it has not been pursued, as the spirlings seem to 
have abandoned this part, probably on account of the increase of the 
sand-banks and are only to be found at some of the rapids farther up. 

The inhabitants of this district deeply lament the suppression 
of the stake- net mode of fishing, which was abolished by a deci- 
sion of the Court of Session in 1812, upon a complaint of the up- 
per heritors, and affirmed by the House of Lords upon appeal in 
1816. This decision was founded upon certain old acts of the 
Scottish Parliament, which were directed against a particular kind 
of river fishing, termed weir, yair, or cruive. There is an infinite 
variety of such engines in use ; but there is one peculiarity com- 
mon to them all, viz. that they prevent the ascent of the fish ex- 
cept by a particular channel, in which a trap for detaining them 
is inserted. This mode of fishing, practised at a very early pe- 
riod, is noticed by the most ancient writers, and is the subject of 
legislation in our earliest statutes. It is obvious that fixed en- 
gines of this description, when employed without restraint, would 
have the effect of shutting up the river, preventing the ascent of 
the fish, and destroying the fry. In consequence, the use of such 
engines in rivers was forbidden, except where they had existed for 
a long course of time. Even in those cases, the engines were pla- 
ced under certain restraints, which seem to have been considered 
sufficient for protecting the spawners, and young fish. This mode 
of fishing, efficient in rivers, cannot, it is obvious from its nature, 
be applied with similar success in estuaries and the open sea. Ac- 
cordingly, there has been little fishing, until of late years, except in 
the rivers, — so little, indeed, that the salmon has been vulgarly re- 



4 



BALMBRINO. 



591 



garded as a river-fish. The seals and giampuses have remained 
in undisturbed possession of the salt water fishing. 

In the year 1797, the stake-net was introduced in the Solway 
Frith where it is at present legal  and in the Frith of Tay. This 
engine was constructed by driving strong stakes in a row, from 
the shore towards low water mark, and nearly at right angles to 
the tide. On these stakes, were stretched nets with open meshes, 
three inches from knot to knot, or twelve inches round. Thus a 
wall of open netting was constructed, sufficient to intercept the 
large fish, but through vhich the water, and all small fishes, could 
pass freely. In this wall of netting, were placed courts or labyrinths. 
The salmon, influenced in their movements by the tide, met this 
netted wall, and, seeking along for an opening through which to 
pass, entered these courts, where they were detained and taken out 
at low water. By means of these nets, great quantities of salmon, 
of the first quality, were caught, and exported in boxes packed 
with ice to the London market. The proprietors of the river 
fisheries now got alarmed for their monopoly, and, taking advantage 
of the antiquated statutes referred to above, some of them passed 
by the Scottish legislature more than four hundred years ago, and 
long before it was ever dreamt of that salmon-fishing could be 
successfully carried on in the friths or seas, applied for an interdict, 
and ultimately succeeded in prohibiting the use of such fixed ma- 
chinery : the courts having held, that, as these statutes had never 
been repealed, any infringement of their provisions must be held 
illegal. The effect of this decision has been greatly to deteriorate 
the estuary fishery ; while the proprietors of the river fishings en- 
joy a monopoly price in the market. 

In framing these regulations, the object of the Scottish Legis- 
lature must have been to protect the public interests and prevent 
injury to the fishery generally ; and this is the only ground upon 
which they can yet be defended. Experience, however, has prov- 
ed that this defence of them cannot be maintained. At the early 
period when these regulations were framed, little was known re- 
garding the salmon ; but from what is now known of its habits and 
history, it is perfectly well ascertained, that while in the friths and 
in the sea, where alone stake-nets can be used, none but fish in 
the best condition are caught; in the rivers, salmon of inferior 
quahty, and often in a foul and unwholesome state, are taken 
that it is in the rivers, and in these alone, that any injury can, be 
done to the spawn, or salmon fry, by the heavy ground ropes which 



592 



FIFESHIRE. 



are drawn across the spawn-beds; — that the stake-nets do not 
interrupt or interfere with the river fishings, as it has been proved 
that the quantity caught in the river, since the stake-nets were 
abolished, does not exceed the quantity caught when these were 
in use ; — that, in short, the effect of the prohibition has been to 
secure a monopoly price to the river-fishers, while the myriads of 
salmon which escape from the rivers and find their way to the sea, 
and which might become a valuable article of commerce, and be 
made available as a rich and nutritious article of food to the pub- 
lic, at a moderate price, are totally lost,' or only abandoned as a 
prey to the monsters of the deep. 

The extent of' the loss in the Tay generally, in consequence 
of the suppression of these nets, has been estimated at from 
200 to 300 tons, or from 20,000 to 30,000 head of salmon 
annually. The whole estuary does not now produce above 
3000 fish. Evidence before a Committee of the House of 
Commons, 1827. In this parish alone the loss may be estimated 
in rent at L. 1000 to L. 1200 annually to the different proprietors ; 
and about L. 1000 in the shape of wages. Other evils also have 
resulted. The aged females and others have been deprived of 
an excellent and healthy employment in the working of nets, while 
a hardy and expert race of seamen were regularly trained through 
means of their connection with the fishery. Let us hope that an 
enlightened and paternal legislature, under whose revision the 
fishery laws are again to be brought, will speedily remove the 
present oppressive restrictions upon this lucrative branch of in- 
dustry, by which not individual proprietors alone, but the com- 
munity at large, must be so extensively benefited, and in the de- 
cision of which question they have so deep an interest. 

Manufactures. — Since the destruction of the stake-net fishery, 
many of the individuals employed in that amphibious kind of oc- 
cupation have betaken themselves entirely to the trade of weavers. 
None of them, however, have as yet risen to the dignity and profes- 
sional importance of manufacturers, but derive their webs, at se- 
cond hand, from those of this class in Dundee. About 150 men 
and women are engaged at the loom with materials supplied from 
this quarter. The linens which they weave are called Dowlas 
and Osnaburg, and, as has been elsewhere stated, an expert weav- 
er will earn about 2s. per day. Some of the young men thus em- 
ployed in the winter months, are engaged in the Greenland whale-

fishery during the season of that now hazardous and precarious 
employment. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets Means of Communication. — The nearest market-town 
is Cupar, distant about seven miles. The nearest post-office is 
Newport, and is distant about four and a half miles from the manse. 
There are no turnpike roads in the parish ; but the statute labour 
roads are in good condition, and the means of communication with 
other places are various, and of easy access. There is a passage- 
boat which sails from Balmerino pier to Dundee once a week, or 
oftener if required. Considering the population of the parish, 
this department of our statistics is rather meagre in its details. 
There is neither baker, brewer, nor butcher within its bounds. 
The navigation or shipping interest is upon an equally limited 
scale. Only the passage-boat, which is a joint-stock concern, be- 
longs to the parish. Many vessels with coals, however, discharge 
their cargoes during the season. About fifty years ago, accord- 
ing to the last Statistical Account, this harbour was the chief 
place on the south side of Tay for shipping grain ; now not a single 
boll is shipped here, if we except such parcels of wheat as the far- 
mers in the immediate neighbourhood send by the passage-boat 
to the Dundee bakers. The Messrs Rintoul, however, carry on 
a considerable trade in potatoes, which are sent up to the London 
market. In some seasons, upwards of 6500 bolls have been ship- 
ped from this port by these gentlemen, besides what has been ex- 
ported by them from other places- 

Ecclesiastieal State.— The church is situated about the centre 
of the parish, and is seated for about 400. It was finished in 
1811. It is a plain building without any ornament, but conside- 
rably deficient in point of accommodation for the parishioners. 
The heritors, however, have it in contemplation to enlarge its dimen- 
sions. The manse was built in 1816, and is one of the most commo- 
dious in the presbytery. The glebe consists of about eight acres, and 
the grass glebe as much, including the site of the manse, &amp;c. and 
both are of inferior quality. The stipend is 16 chalders, half 
meal, half barley, and 7 bolls of wheat, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for com- 
munion elements. The collections, exclusive of extra, average 
about L. 18 per annum. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 
195 ; of Dissenting or Seceding families, 20.

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The poor of the parish are sup- 
ported by the collections made at the church, and by the libera- 
lity of the heritors and inhabitants. Those upon the roll get from 
3s. to 6s. a month; others get occasional relief at the new year 
and sacrament, in money, coals, or meal, according to circumstan- 
ces ; and the resident proprietors of Naughton and Birkhill distri- 
bute, during winter, coals and meal to the most necessitous. The 
proprietor of Balmerino has given, for some years back, L. 10 to 
the poor on his own estate. The heritors also assess themselves 
to the amount of L. 20 per annum, for the maintenance of two 
idiots. The number of persons receivingparochial aid is 12 or there- 
by. The average annual amount of church collections for the 
poor is L. 18. 

Educatio7i.— There are two schools in the parish— the paro-  
chial school, and one taught by a female. There are in winter ■ 
generally from 120 to 130 scholars attending the former, and about ■ 
40 at the latter. The salary of the parish school is the maximum, ■ 
and the fees amount to from L. 25 to L. 30 per annum. The branches ■ 
taught in it are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, mathema- 
tics, geography, &amp;c. :— Greek and Latin are not much required. 
The teacher is eminently qualified for his situation, being pos- 
sessed not only of all the requisite information in no ordinary de- 
gree, but pecuharly fitted for communicating it to his pupils. A 
decided improvement has taken place, as well in the amount as in 
the standard of education, since his appointment to this parish :

and it is pleasant to find that his labours are duly appreciated by 
the inhabitants at large. 

Fuel. — This article of domestic economy consists entirely of 
coal, and is chiefly imported from Newcastle and the Frith of 
Forth. The farmers who have the command of carriages supply 
themselves occasionally and their servants from the coal-pits in 
the southern parts of the country ; from the nearest of which the 
parish is distant about twelve miles. English coal is obtained at 
the shore, at the rate of from 4s. 6d. to 5s. 9d. per boll of six cwt. 
according to quality ; and the Scotch at about 6s. per boll of 8 
cwt. The price of the best coal at the nearest pit, which is Drum- 
carro, is Is. lOd. per load of 4 cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The improvements in husbandry and agriculture are abundantly 
manifest in the district, since'the date of last Account. Many wastes 
have been reclaimed, marshes have been drained, and thriving 
plantations are everywhere rising up for shelter and protection. 
The systems of wedge draining and subsoil ploughing are being 
adopted. Turnips are extensively sown ; and the practice of 
eating them off with sheep, in suitable situations, is general. 
The roads through the parish have also been much improved, and 
are, in general, kept in excellent repair. Many of the farm-stead- 
ings are newly erected, and some of them may vie with any in the 
country, either in extent of accommodation, or in neatness and ele- 
gance of structure.

PRESBYTERV of CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. GEORGE MARSHALL, MINISTER  



Topography and Natural History. 
Name.—YusK appears to have been the ancient, as well as mo- 
dern name of the parish. It is possibly connected with the word 



596 



FIFESHIR15. 



Fleasg, signifying in the Irish language wet or 7noist, — a descrip- 
tion applicable to the former state of the soil. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish, situated on the southern 
bank of the Tay, some miles below Newburgh, stretches along 
the margin of the river, which is here nearly a straight line, 
miles ; but its average length is not more than 4 miles. Its breadth 
varies considerably. For fully more than a mile, commencing at the 
eastern extremity, it does not exceed half a mile in breadth ; then 
suddenly widening, it is for 2 miles about three-quarters of a mile 
broad ; and- at the eastern extremity, it extends to If mile from the 
river, — presenting a surface of 3 or 4 square miles. Its general fi- 
gure may be easily conceived from the preceding account of its 
extent, the straight margin of the river being considered as the 
line on which the successive oblongs of which it may be conceived 
to consist, are laid off. It is bounded on the north by the Tay ; on 
the east by Balmerino ; on the south by Creich, a detached part 
of Abdie and Dunbog; and on the west by Dunbog. 

Topographical Appearances. — Along the river, the ground for 
about a quarter of a mile in breadth is nearly level, or has but a 
gentle ascent ; then it rises rapidly, and to a considerable height, 
forming part of that hilly range which runs along the south side of 
the Tay, including within the limits of the parish, Lyndemus about 
750 feet in height, and properly constituting the first rise on Nor- 
man's Law, Logie Law, and Glenduckie Hill. To the south of 
'Glenduckie Hill, it sinks again into a valley; and it is there, it 
stretches to the distance of If mile from the river. 

At each extremity of the parish, the bank of the Tay is mark- 
ed by a rapid slope of about 100 feet, and chiefly covered with na- 
tural grass. The slope of the central portion is more gradual, 
and on it cultivation is carried to the edge of the river. 

Meteorology. — The winds, probably guided by the hills, fre- 
quently take the direction of the river, and sometimes drive along 
with furious violence. Those from the north and east are often 
piercing ; but the air is pure and salubrious, and a good share of 
health seems enjoyed by the inhabitants. Formerly, when the 
lower grounds were marshy, ague prevailed in the spring ; but now 
that the soil is comparatively dry, the disease has disappeared. 

Hydrography. — The Tay, as already noticed, flows so as to form 
the northern boundary of the parish. At the western extremity 
of the parish, and nearly three miles below Newburgh, this noble 
river, at high-water, according to R. and A. Stevenson's survey in 



FLISK. 



597 



1833, is 1 mile in breadth. At Flisk-point, three miles far- 
ther down, and just below the church, it is 2 miles broad ; and at 
the eastern extremity, 2. At low-water, extensive sand-banks 
are left dry on the Perthshire side ; and the fresh-water current, 
which here keeps by this side of the estuary, then confines itself 
to a channel of about one-third of a mile. The beach is clayey, 
and it is fenced with a bed of shingle left by the tide. Several 
dikes have been projected into the river, that the intermediate 
spaces might silt up ; but hitherto without effect. 

There are many excellent springs in the parish. In several, in 
different localities, Fahrenheit's thermometer stood at 43° on the 
J 5th of May ; and at 46°, 47° on the 30th of June 1837. 

Geologxj and Mineralogy.— -The upper series of rocks consists 
chiefly of secondary trap. It is cut by a vein of clinkstone por- 
phyry. Old red sandstone appears by the river, under Flisk Wood. 
The greenstone dike, known by the name of the Flisk-dike, passes 
through Glenduckie Hill, in its course from Newburgh to Norman's 
Law. Agates and also pieces of bloodstone are found in consider- 
able numbers. Diluvium covers the rocky substratum between 
the river and the hilly range. 

A submarine forest of ten miles in length, and similar to those 
of Skaill in Orkney, of Lincolnshire, and of Mount's Bay in Corn- 
wall, lies along the margin of the Tay, stretching from Flisk-point 
under the manse, about three miles upwards and seven down 
the river. It is covered at full tide with four or five feet of water. 
It consists of a bed of peat-moss, and has no alluvial stratum su- 
perinduced. Many stumps of trees with their roots attached, and 
manifestly in the place and position in which they originally grew, 
have been observed. It rests on a bed of gray coloured clay, whose 
surface, with slight variations, is horizontal, and on a level with 
lovp water-mark. 

It seems pretty certain that this moss must be at least ten feet 
below Its original level. In explanation of the phenomenon Dr 
Fleming, in his paper on the subject in the Transactions of the 
Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1822, supposes the former exist- 
ence of a lake in this locality— that it gradually filled up, and be- 
came covered with vegetable matter, till it sufficed for the growth 
of trees— that the seaward barrier was then removed— and that, 
the moisture now freely escaping, subsidence in consequence took 
place, and reduced it to its present level. 

5oz75.— The soil is, in general, a clayey loam. On the lower 



598 



FIFESHIBE. 



grounds by the river, and especially on the three middle farms, 
the intermixture of clay is considerable, forming a fertile, though 
hard soil, from eight to twelve inches in depth. In some places, 
the loam disappears, and gravel and clay beds present themselves, 
chiefly close by the margin of the river. Towards the west, the 
soil is sharp and more friable. The subsoil is chiefly clay and 
till, and in some places sand. On the higher grounds, the loam 
is purer, varies from one to three feet in depth, and lies on rock, 
clay, and till, and here and there on patches of moor-band. On 
the south of Glenduckie Hill, it is good black, easy loam, reco- 
vered from wet and marshy ground ; and the soil removed in mak- 
ing drains and water-courses has been conveyed higher up the 
hill, and forms about twenty acres of arable land, where the rock 
was chiefly visible before. 

The more level portions of the parish, whether on the lower or 
more elevated ground, were formerly very wet ; and the hollows 
were marshes at no very distant date. Innumerable drains and 
large ditches have now, however, rendered the soil comparatively 
dry. 

Boulders were once thickly spread, but are now removed. Some 
idea of their number, and of the labour of clearing the ground, 
may be formed from the fact, that three men and two pair of 
horses were employed on one " balk," on Flisk-mill farm, for a 
fortnight, and that 500 cart-loads of stones were drawn from two 
and a-half acres. Many of the boulders contain from four to six, 
eight, or twelve feet of solid matter ; and others, which required 
to be broken by gunpowder before they could be removed, must 
have been much larger. One lying by the river near Flisk-point, 
and said by marvel-loving tradition to have been hurled by a giant 
from the opposite side of the Tay, and aimed at the church, 
contains about 150 feet; and another, higher up the river, and 
now partly broken and partly sunk into the soil, must have been, 
at least, of equal dimensions. They are generally of the primitive 
rocks, granite, gneiss, mica-slate, and quartz, though some are 
conglomerate, and others compact felspar. 

Zoology. — The common salmon and the spirling, or Salmo eper 
lanus, frequent the river. The seal is an unwelcome visitor. The 
porpoise may be seen playing its gambols, when the tide is up ; and 
the grampus, also, sometimes makes its appearance. Flocks of 
wild geese frequent the river and the hill-sides, for some months 
after harvest. 



FLISK.

Botany. — The common culinary vegetables are, colewort, cab- 
bage, onions, leeks, carrots, peas, beans, potatoes, and turnips- 
The grains grown are wheat, barley, and oats. Peas and beans 
are also sown in the field. 

Plantations. — The plantations are neither numerous nor exten- 
sive. The oldest is Fhsk Wood, which is mentioned in the earliest 
accounts, and fills up the north-eastern corner of the parish, be- 
tween the Tay and Corbie-burn, extending at present over ninety- 
one acres. The largest is that on and around the summit of Glen- 
duckie-Hill, covering 113 acres. The plantations altogether 
amount to 264 acres ; and, with the exception of eighty acres of 
oak in Flisk Wood, they consist chiefly of larch and Scotch fir, and 
are from twenty to forty years old. 

II. — Civil History. 
This parish cannot boast of any historical events of importance, 
or of any occurrences worthy of note. 

Eminent Character. — The greater part, if not the whole of the 
parish, became the property of the Noble house of Rothes, in the 
reign of Robert the Bruce, by the marriage of Sir Andrew de 
Lesley with Mary, one of the three daughters and co-heiresses of 
Sir Alexander Abernethy of Abernethy ; and the Castle of Ballin- 
breich was, for several centuries, their principal residence. 

In 1320, Sir Andrew signed the letter to the Pope, asserting 
the independency of Scotland. His descendant, Norman Lesley, 
son of George Earl of Rothes, was the principal actor in the mur- 
der of Cardinal Beaton, on the 29th May 1546, The following 
year, he surrendered the Castle of St Andrews to the French, and 
went into the service of their king. He gained great reputation 
in an engagement between that monarch and the Emperor, near 
Cambray, in 1554. He enjoyed his honour but a short time, for, 
being wounded, he died fifteen days afterwards. 

Andrew, fourth Earl of Rothes, was buried within the old church. 
The grave is about the centre of the present burying-ground. John, 
sixth Earl of Rothes, was promoted in 1667 to the office of- High 
Chancellor ; and was created Duke of Rothes, Marquis of Bal- 
lenbreich, &amp;c. in 1680. He died the following year; and his 
body was conveyed, first from St Giles's Edinburgh whither it 
had been privately carried to Holyrood House, and afterwards 
to Leslie in Fife, where his Grace had built a mansion, with 
the greatest conceivable funereal pomp. 

Sir James Balfour, Rector of this parish in 1561, was appointed 



GOO 



FIFESHUIE, 



Lord President of the Court of Session, the Court then consist- 
ing of churchmen as well as laymen : he is unhappily stigmatized 
by Robertson as the most corrupt man of his age. 

The Rev. John Wemyss, who was admitted to the parish in 1590, 
became Principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1592. 

The Rev. John Fleming, D. D. author of the " Philosophy 
of Zoology," and of the " History of British Animals," and now 
Professor of Natural Philosophy in King's College, Aberdeen, 
held this incumbency from 1811 to 1832. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners, with the extent of their 
properties, are as follows: — Lord Dundas, now 1838 created 
Earl of Orkney, 1808 acres; Joseph Murray, Esq. of Ay ton, 460 
acres; John Whyte Melville, Esq. of Mount Melville, 218 acres. 
The preceding includes, with the exception of 20 or 30 acres, the 
whole property of the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of baptisms and marriages, 
combining also the accounts of disbursements, and the minutes of 
session, commence 6th May 1697 ; and that of deaths and burials 
1st March 1775. They seem in general to have been kept with 
care and regularity ; the only marked omision being in that of the 
session minutes from 1799 to 1822. It appears from these re- 
cords, that the session, till at least nearly the middle of last cen- 
tury, often held meetings for prayer : and administered discipline 
by private or public rebukes for profaneness, desecration of the 
Sabbath, drunkenness, quarrelling, and intemperate or opprobrious 
language, as well as for violations of the seventh commandment. 

The following extracts are also worthy of insertion, as shewing,

Ajitiqiiitivs. — The Castle of Ballinbreich lies in ruins near the 
western extremity of the parish, overhanging the river, and em- 
bosomed in a small plantation of trees. It is built of red sand- 
stone, 150 feet long, and 70 broad, and without date, arms or in- 
scription. Formerly, a garden lay to the south of the castle ; an 
orchard to the east of the oak avenue ; and fish ponds, and a swan 
pond in the plantations to the west of it. It was long the resi- 
dence of the Earls of Rothes. But, first deserted, then sold to an- 
other lord, it has been suffered to go into decay. Nothing re- 
mains but bare or fallen walls, the ponds have been dried up, 
the garden destroyed, and many of the trees cut down. The 
plough has converted the duke into the utile. Besides the few 
acres of trees surrounding the ruins, two chestnuts which formed 
part of the straight avenue leading to the castle, are still allowed 
to keep their station near the farm-house of Ballinbreich. 

Close by the castle to the east, and within the remaining plan- 
tation, is Chapel-hill, where the foundations of a sacred edifice are 
still to be traced. 

In Flisk Wood, at the opposite extremity of the parish, are low 
ruins, most probably those of a place of worship, and consisting of 
the apparent remains of the edifice, and of an enclosing wall. In 
enumerating the parishes, churches, and chapels in the deanery of 
Fife, in the eleventh year of King William, Sir Robert Sibbald 
mentions « Flisk cum capella." Which of the two noticed above 
formed this capella, cannot now be ascertained. 

Silver coins of Edward III. were turned up a few years ago, 
on the farm of East Flisk. They were given to Dr Fleming, and 
consisted of sixpences, shillings, and half-crown pieces. About 
the same time, on the hill side, and on the farms of East Flisk and 
Belhelvie, several rude stone coffins were discovered, with urns in 
them containing burnt bones. The urns were a mixture of clay 
and rotten rock, baked in the sun ; and most of them fell to pieces 
on being exposed to the air. Burnt bones were also discovered 
m a cairn of stones on the top of Whirly Kip, or rather, perhaps, 
Whitlaw cap, a conical rising ground on Fliskmill farm, between 
Lyndemus and Pittachop. 

On Fhskmill Hill, arc a few stones placed as the arms of a chair, 
and called St Muggin's Seat; St Muggin being probably a cor-

ruption of St Magridin. Tradition is silent regarding the occa- 
sions when this was made the place of the saint's meditations ; but 
it was well chosen, from the noble and extensive view it commands 
of streams, and hills, and vales, for eliciting thought, and giving 
the freshness and sublimity of nature to the imaginings of the soul 
within. 

Modern Buildings. — Not having any resident proprietors, we 
have unfortunately little to state on this subject. There is not a 
single mansion-house. We have but to notice the parish church. 
In 1790, the old building after standing, it is said, for 500 years, 
was pulled down, and the present small but neat edifice erected 
near the site of the former. 

'III. — Population. 

The population at different periods has been as follows : — 

In 1755, according to Dr Webster 318 
1792, stated in last Statistical Account, 331 

1801, according to the census, 300 

1811, do. do. 318

1831, do. do. 286 

1836, private register, - 245 

1837, do. do. - 256 

From this table, it appears that the 'population has diminished. 
The principal cause seems to have been, that neither proprietors 
nor tenants, some time ago, were sufficiently careful to repair or re- 
build the cottages. Several have, in consequence, been pulled 
down, in different parts of the parish. The evil of so small a cot- 
tage population, on so great an extent of cultivated land, is now se- 
verely felt. And the wish at present is, on the part of the farmers 
at least, to have the number of cottages increased. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is - - 10-| 

deaths, - - - - ■ 1

The vast disproportion between the numbers of births and deaths 
must be owing to the fact, that the relative number of farm-ser- 
vants who, of course, are chosen in the healthy and vigorous period 
of life is great.

The migratory habits of much of our agricultural population are 
by no means favourable to their moral and religious character, and 
prevent a permanent character from attaching to a parish like this, 
where so many belong to this class. With this qualification, it 
may be said that the people are respectable, cleanly in their ha- 
bits, and enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts and advantages 
of society. 

The ordinary food of the peasants is oatmeal and potatoes, 
broth and bacon, the cottars keeping one or two pigs in the year. 
Wheaten bread is also used. 

IV. — Industky. 
The number of males employed in agriculture is 59, including- 
7 farmers, 7 cottars, and 45 farm-servants. The number employed 
in manufactures is 12, all weavers, except 2, employed in making 
potato-flour. There are 2 smiths, 1 mason, 1 forester, 7 day- 
labourers, and 1 or 2 who often employ themselves in fishing. 
The men connected with the salmon stations, during the fishing 
season, do not in general belong to the parish.

The greater part of the unreclaimed portion is on the face of 
Lyndemus and Fliskmill Hill. Patches of it might be cultivated, 
but it is more convenient for pasturage as it is. Eight acres, now ap- 
propriated and in wood, on the farm of Logie, once formed part 
of a common which stretched into the adjoining part of Abdie. 

Rerd of Land.— The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 8s per 
imperial acre. It is, in general, partly a money and partly a grain 
rent, paid according to the fiar prices, limited, however, in some 
cases, by a maximum, or by both a maximum and minimum. 

Rate 0/ aes.— Farm-servants, in bothies, receive L. 10; 8 
cwt. 61 bolls Scotch, oatmeal ; 4 pints 1 pint Scotch milk, and 
potatoes for supper, for one-half of the year. Those married have 
i. 8, house, garden of 300 square yards ; milk and meal as

above ; and three cart load of potatoes or three lippies bounds i. e. 
about 300 square yards. The foreman has the same, except L. 12 
instead of L. 8, and a " cow-keep," instead of an allowance of milk. 
Day-labourers have Is, 6d. without victuals, but 2d. less in winter, 
and 2d. more in summer. Women receive 8d. without victuals. 
Reapers receive L. 1, 10s. with victuals, for the harvest; binders 
have 1 Os. more. The harvest-home being now discontinued, each 
receives Is. in lieu at the end of the harvest. Threaving, which, 
however, is not much practised, is at the rate of 3d. for twenty- 
four sheaves of oats or barley ; and 4d. for twenty-eight of wheat. 

The price of an iron plough is L. 3, 12s. ; of a harrow, L. 1, 
6s. ; of a double horse cart, L. 12 ; of a set of horse shoes, 3s. 4d. 
A mason receives 2s. 6d. a-day ; or for a dry dike, 8s. ; a cottage, 
L. 1, lOs. ; and a two-story house L,2 the rood; and for hewing 
freestone 3id. the foot. An ordinary weaver makes 7s. or 8s. 
a-week ; and a woman wins 7d. a-day by winding the bobbins. 

Live-Stock. — The common breed of cattle is the Fifeshire, cros- 
sed with the Forfarshire and Teeswater, but chiefly with the for- 
mer. Sheep are seldom kept. This is a grain rather than a 
grazing or green crop part of the country, — the hardness of the soil 
not being so favourable to the expansion of the bulbous roots. 

Husbandry. — The rotation of the crops is generally for six years, 
and in nearly the following order : On the low grounds, which are 
the richest and strongest, summer fallow or green crop, turnips and 
potato, wheat, peas, barley, grass, and oats. If peas are not sown, 
the grass remains for two years. On the lighter soils of the hill sides, 
in which wheat is rarely sown, green crop, barley, and grass for 
two years, barley and oats. A rotation of five years, which is some- 
times adopted, may be as follows : Fallow or green crop, wheat, 
grass for two years, oats ; or, instead of two years in grass, barley 
and grass. 

Much of the soil being naturally wet and marshy, and a good 
deal of it lying on till, draining has been greatly required. Much 
has been done in this respect, by the farmers from time to time ; 
and although more is still needed, most of the soil is now compa- 
ratively dry and in good condition. Stone-draining is that chief- 
ly used. A little of the surface tile-draining was introduced last 
year, and seemingly with good effect. 

Little could now be transferred from the unreclaimed land to 
the cultivated, much of it lying on steep slopes. And certainly 
the most ornamental, and perhaps also the most profitable, method

of laying it out, would be in wood. A considerable part of the 
low ground was reclaimed, only within the last forty years ; and of 
the high ground, within a much later date. 

The leases are for nineteen years, and seem fairly adjusted be- 
tween the landlord and tenant. 

The farm-buildings are generally good, though still susceptible 
of improvement. There is a considerable deficiency of enclosures, 
especially on the low grounds. They consist solely of stone dikes. 
Some have of late been added. 

The introduction of bone-dust for turnip has been of great ser- 
vice, in the cultivation of the hill lands, rendering it so much more 
. easy to apply manure to them. About sixteen bushels of bone-dust, 
2s. per bushel, mixed with eight of theashes of burnt coal or turf, 
will serve for an acre, and a cart-load of this will cover about four 
acres. Animalized carbon has also been used for manure. Instead 
of eating off the turnip with sheep, it is found equally good to leave 
and plough down the shaws. 

Quarries.— There is a quarry of red sandstone close by the ri- 
ver under Flisk Wood, and two of good clinkstone in other parts of 
the parish ; but none are of any great importance. 

Fisheries.— There are five or six stations for salmon-fishing. At 
some, the sweep-net is used, at others chiefly the lower the tut- 
net, with three or four men to a boat. Stake-nets would be more 
favourable for fishing, but are for the present interdicted. 

The salmon are not caught in abundance,but are of excellent qua- 
hty. The best seasons are in Julyand August, when, the rains being 
over, and the snow melted, the quantity of water in the river is dimi- 
nished, and the boats get nearer the middle of the stream, and within 
the run of the fish. If there is much water in the river in the spawn 
ingseason,thespawnisdeposited too high on the banks; andif there 
lollows a dry February, much of it is destroyed. The salmon fry 
smoults as they are called, pass this from the beginning of March 
about three mches long, and are caught on their return, two or 
three months afterwards, as grilse, six inches or upwards in length 
lour, hve, or six pounds in weight.  

The seals are sometimes so audacious and cunning as to tumble 
over the net, seize a salmon, and make off with it. 

There are two spirling stations, Flisk-point and Kincase, with 

little anLal restored to the -"0 X1 7' -a  '"'"''" "'

two or llft-ee nets at each. The net used is trumpet-shaped, and 
eight yards long. Its mouth is fixed to poles placed in the cur- 
rent, and across the stream ; and the fish are caught in the eb- 
bing tide. They are sold from Is. to 2s. 6d. the hundred, and 
being taken to Perth are despatched by the coaches, for the Edin- 
burgh and Glasgow markets. A few are sent to Dundee. They 
spawn in April and May, when the fishing is discontinued, but they 
are good in November and some months afterwards, particularly 
in January and February. 

Produce. — The following is the average gross amount of raw 
produce raised in the parish as nearly as can be ascertained, and 
at the average fiar price for the last seven years.

Manvfactiires. — A potato-flour manufactory has lately been 
erected on the farm of East Flisk. Two men and three women 
are employed in it. Their time of labour is the same with that 
of other servants on the farm ; and their occupation seems by no 
means prejudicial to health. The potatoes are grated down by a 
rough revolving cylinder kept in motion by a steam engine of 
two\orse power. The machine is the fruit of Mr Morton's own 
mechanical ingenuity. 

Navigation.— A\i\\o\ig}\ the Tay, in its main channel, sweeps 
along the length of the parish, it is of little avail for shipping, from 
want" of a pier. Coal, tile, stone, and slate are occasionally land- 
ed, but grain cannot be shipped. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Mar]iet-Town.~The nearest market-towns are Newburgh, Cu- 
par-Fife, and Dundee, distant from the church, six, eight, and 
including the passage across the Tay, ten miles respectively. All 
these, especially Cupar, are frequented by the farmer, for the sale 
of agricultural produce. 

There is not a village in the parish. The nearest approxima- 
tion to one, is the farm-town of Glenduckie, consisting of the farm 

4 



PLISK. 607 

house and twelve cottages, seven of which are occupied by the 
farm-servants. 

Means of Communication. — The parish is deficient in proper and 
convenient means of communication. The nearest post-offices are 
in Newburgh and Cupar. The same must be said regarding public 
conveyances. There is no turnpike, but the statute labour road be- 
tween Woodhaven and Newburgh, runs through the length of the 
parish, distant about a quarter of a mile from the river. The nearest 
piers are at Balmerino and Newburgh. The steamers between Dun- 
dee and Perth pass and repass daily for a great part of the year, but 
there are no proper and regular means of getting on board. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is beautifully situated on the 
banks of the Tay, one mile from the eastern, three from the western, 
and between four and five from the south-western extremity of the 
parish. Glenduckie, containing, small as it is, about one-fifth of 
the population, lies four miles from the church; and Dunbog 
church being close at hand, the inhabitants generally attend di- 
vine service there. 

The church was built in 1790, and is in good repair, affording 
accommodation for 153 sitters. It was seated by the heritors, and 
portioned off" to the farmers ; and the seats are given by them to 
their servants and cottars. The sittings at the communion table 
are left unallocated. 

The manse was built in 1811. The glebe, exclusive of house, 
offices, and garden ground, is about 5 acres imperial, and might rent 
for L. 7. The stipend is 10 chalders, 8 bolls Scotch of grain, and 
L. 10, 7s. d. in money, L. I, 13s. 4d. of which is grass-money ; the 
average for the last four years is L. 149, and for the first three of 
these only L. 141. There is no separate allowance for communion 
elements. 

The number of families connected with the Established Church 
is 51, comprehending 247 individuals ; and four families, compre- 
hending nme mdividuals, attend Dissenting and Seceding places of 
worship. The average number of communicants in the Establish 
ed Church is 120.

There are no Societies ; but there have been occasional collec- 
tions in the church for religious and charitable objects. These 
have been liberal : but no average can with fairness yet be given, 
as it is only within these few years, they have been at all regular. 

Education.— There is but one school, the parochial— situated a 
mile to the west of the church, and more nearly in the centre of 
the population than is the latter. The branches taught are, read- 
ino-, writing, arithmetic, geography, grammar, and Latin. Read- 
ing 2s. per quarter ; reading and writing, 2s. 6d. ; readmg, writing, 
and arithmetic, 3s. ; Latin, 5s. The teacher enjoys the legal amount 
of accommodation. The salary is the maximum, L. 34, 4s. 4d., 
and the average amount of school fees, L. 12, 

All can read and write who are of age to do so,— attention by 
parents to the education of their children being general. 

There is no parish library ; but, for the last few years, L. 5, from 
the Donaldson fund, has been annually expended on prizes for 
the parochial and Sabbath schools, and greatly with the view 
of forming small family libraries among the parishioners. An ar- 
rangement is contemplated, by which part of this sum may yet go 
to the formation of a parish library. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of paupers nearly 
averages 4, receiving from L. 1 to L 2, 10s. each per annum ; 
or, instead of money, meal, varying from 2 to 4 pecks a month. 
Average collections for the last ten years L. 6, 12s. ; average or 
proclamation for ditto, 4s. ; interest on money L.3, 8s.; total, L. lU, 
4s Within this period, there has been but one legacy for behoot 
of'the poor, L. 10. The deficit in the funds has hitherto been

met by drawing upon the principal in the bank, and by donations 
from the heritors. 

Fairs, — There are no fairs, inns, or alehouses in the parish. 

Fwe/.— Coal is the fuel used. It is chiefly brought in vessels 
to the beach from the north of England, at 13s. 6d., or from the 
banks of the Forth, at 1 Is. 6d. the ton. Sometimes, however, it is 
driven from the Balbirnie pit, twelve miles off, or from Newburgh 
and Balmerino, as sloops will not discharge their cargo on the strand 
during winter. The farmer chiefly consumes English, the cottager 
Scotch coal. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the former Statistical Account was drawn up in 1792, the 
population of the parish has decreased from 331 to 256. The 
number of farms is also less, the parish being almost entirely par- 
titioned at present into seven large farms, from 190 to 490 impe- 
rial acres each. Bothies have been partially introduced. The 
extent of cultivated ground is greater by fully more than one-half 
of what it was in 1792, having increased from 1387 to 2120 im- 
perial acres. Sheep are not now regularly kept ; at a former pe- 
riod, they were. The breed was small. Fed on the natural pas- 
ture during the day, they were enclosed in " tathe-folds" during 
the night. These folds, changed, every few days, for the sake of 
manuring the ground, were built by the shepherd. The fence was 
a turf dike, which was thrown down when the ploughing season 
came. 

The plough, attended by a driver, as well as managed by a plough- 
man, was drawn, in winter, by four cattle and two horses ; and in 
the end of spring, when they went twice to the field in the day, 
by two cattle and two horses. The oldest cattle were sold to the 
grazier after the barley-seed was sown, and, being seven or eight 
years old, were of a good size. The plough itself was a rude in- 
strument nine or ten feet long, all made of wood except the cul- 
ler, sock, and " reeshoe." The wood was supplied by the farmer. 
The iron was worth about 6s. The carpenter and smith were 
not paid for each job, but received so much corn in the year for 
doing the work on the farm. The ploughman was generally a 
married man, and had one or one and a half Scotch acres, about 
one and a quarter or one and three quarters imperial acres. On 
the produce of this, he kept his cow, which he had to purchase for

himself, during the winter. In summer, it grazed along with the 
farmer's own cattle. The goadmen, who were young, and also 
the horse herd, who was generally older, lived in their master's 
house. 

About seventy years ago, the crops raised were not so varied as 
now, and the system of agriculture was different ; oats, barley, and 
pease were what were generally sown. There was no cultivated 
grass, and no turnip or potato. Turnip was first introduced by 
Mr Barclay on Pittachop farm, about fifty-eight years ago. By 
1792 as appears from the former Account a considerable quan- 
tity of wheat was grown, about 190 acres ; but now, it has increased 
to 290 acres. A field of 15 acres contained barley and oats, for 
twenty-two years in succession. 

At the middle of last century, or even later, the rental does not 
seem to have been from one-tenth to one-sixth of what it is now ; 
and even forty years ago, probably, not much above one-fourth. 
This, however, is to some extent only apparent, as the nominal va- 
lue of many other things has undergone a corresponding relative 
change. Part of the rent was paid in grain and meal. A house, 
now the farm-house of Fliskmill; was formerly the girnal for the 
Ballinbreich estate. The meal would sometimes accumulate to 
600 cwt. before it was sold. 

The first two-story farm house was built only sixty-one years 
ago in 1776. All the accommodation the farmer had before, was 
his " but" and his " ben." 

The chief improvements of which the parish seems susceptible, 
are increased draining and enclosing ; the erection of a greater 
number of cottages ; planting the uncultivated lands ; and the 
erection of a ier for the shipment of grain and the easier landing of j 
lime and coal, &amp;c. and for rendering the Perth and Dundee 
steamers available for the convenience of the inhabitants.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OT FIFE. 

PARISH VACANT. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Bo7indaries, Sfc. — Anstuther Wester, a small parish 
in the presbytery of St Andrews, is situated on the Frith of Forth, 
about six miles to the westward of Fifeness. The origin of the 
name is uncertain. It is not known whether the family of An- 
struther, who are the superiors, gave their name to it, or took 
theirs from it. In the former Statistical Account, it is said to be 
derived from the Celtic word Struther, signifying " a low marshy 
place ;" and, as generally happens, something in the situation is 
found or fancied to correspond with the etymology ; " for although 
the site of the town and church, in a hollow at the mouth of a 
small rivulet, is now tolerably dry, there are proofs that it must at 
one time have merited such an appellation." We have our doubts 
as to this derivation ; but are in want of any thing better to offer. 
The parish is bounded on the south by the sea for about half 
a mile ; on the east, by Anstruther Easter ; on the north, by Carn- 
bee and Kilrenny ; and on the west, by Pittenweem. From the 
narrow point of land occupied by the town, church and church- 
yard, the parish, which is of very irregular breadth and form, ex- 
tends upwards of 2 miles to the north-west, and contains about 
600 acres, the greater part of which is arable. There may be 
about 10 acres of grass -lands, upon eight of which the burgesses 
have the privilege of pasturage, and of cutting turf, upon payment 
of a very small sum into the funds of the burgh. 

Isle of May.— The Isle of May, which lies about six miles 
south, is generally supposed to belong to Anstruther Wester ; but 

 Drawn up by the Rev. George Milligaii, Elie, from notes left by the Rev. 
Dr Carstairs, late Minister of the parish, and from valuable information communi- 
cated to him by Matthew F. ConoUy, Esq. town-clerk of Anstruther ; Mr Thomas 
Wilhamson, tenant, Grange-Muir ; and Mr George Taylor, schoolmaster of Anstru- 
ther Wester, in their respective departments.

it is also claimed by Crail. It is about a mile long, and three- 
quarters of a mile broad. On it there is a well of fine water and 
a small lake. It affords excellent pasturage for sheep : and the 
May mutton is famous in all quarters, " A very intelligent farmer, 
who has dealt in sheep above thirty years, and has had them from 
all the different corners of Scotland, says, that he knows no place 
so well adapted for meliorating the wool as the Island of May. 
He adds, that the fleeces of the coarsest wooUed sheep that ever 
came from the worst pasture in Scotland, when put on the Island 
of May, in the course of one season, become as fine as satin." 
It is frequented by a great variety of sea fowl, such as kittiewakes, 
scarts, dunters, gulls, sea-pyets, marrots, &amp;c. One side of the 
rock is composed of stately basaltic columns. There is a light- 
house on the island, which was originally built in the time of 
Charles I. by Alexander Cunningham, laird of Barns. It is said, 
that, as the unfortunate architect of the town was returning from 
the isle, he was drowned in a storm supposed to have been raised 
by some still more unhappy old women, who were in consequence 
burnt as witches. At first the light was only a fire of coals; but 
the property having, in the course of time, passed into the hands 
of the Duchess of Portland, as heiress of the late Major- General 
John Scott of Balcomie, it was purchased from her by the Com- 
missioners of Northern Lights, who in 1816 rebuilt the tower, and 
fitted it up with reflectors and oil lights. On the island are the 
ruins of a priory, which formerly belonged to the Abbey of Pit- 
tenweem, and of a chapel dedicated to St Adrian. Population 
of the island, 2 males and 1 0 females. 

Climate. — The climate, on the whole, cannot be considered as 
unhealthy. In the spring the east winds prevail, and occasionally 
what is called an easterly haar sets in ; during the continuance of 
which, the atmosphere is by no means very comfortable. Some 
of the heaviest gales that visit the coast, come from the south-west 
in winter. There is no epidemical disease which can be said 
to be peculiar to the parish ; and the cases of longevity are ra- 
ther numerous in proportion to the population. Within these few 
years, several have died betwixt eighty and ninety years of age ; 
two at the age of ninety-four ; one aged ninety-five. In 1832, 
while cholera was very prevalent and fatal in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood, there was not a single case that occurred within its bounds. 

Hydrography. — The Frith of Forth bounds the parish for about 
half a mile on the south ; and a small burn called the Dreel, or 



ANSTRUTIIER WESTEl. 



G13 



more commonly Anstruther Burn, divides it from Anstrutlier 
Easter. A tradition prevails that there was once a salmon-fishery 
in this rivulet ; " from the smallness of it, this does not appear 
very probable." Nothing of the kind exists at present ; but 
yet, in former times, the fact may have been as stated ; and 
both the seals of the corporation, the old and the new one, bear 
testimony to it, — the former exhibiting a drave-boat well manned, 
— the latter three salmon crossed. The form of a fish of the same 
kind also floats upon the top of the church spire, in place of a 
weather-cock. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The lithology of the parish belongs 
to the carboniferous formation, and consists of, \st, the inferior 
coal measures ; 21, the carboniferous limestone ; 3d, the upper or 
true coal measure. If a line be drawn from the shore at the point 
where St Monance and Pittenweem parishes meet, to the north- 
east angle of this parish, it will mark the course of the carbonife- 
rous limestone which divides the upper from the lower coal mea- 
sures. 

1. The under coal measures consist of alternations of red- 
dish silicious sandstones, sometimes gritty, shales, fire-clay, and 
thin unworkable seams of coal. The shales contain ironstone 
m bands, and septaria ; and not unfrequently present a slaty 
bituminous character, not unlike to the older slate clay. The 
whole measures are full of vegetable remains, which, if not of so 
frequent occurrence, are at least in far better preservation than 
those of the upper coal measures. Thin beds of shell-limestone 
and shale, with shells, are found subordinate to the general forma- 
tion. Excellent sections of these are exposed along the seaward 
boundary of the parish. 

2. The carboniferous limestone, which is nowhere brought to 
the surface in this parish, is exposed along the shore, east of St 
Monance, and bears in the direction already noticed. This has 
been fully proved by the mining operations carried on west of 
Pittenweem. It consists of four beds, varying from 3 to 10 feet

in thickness, of excellent white limestone, alternating with shale 
and slaty sandstone. It contains all the shells, corallines, and 
other organisms peculiar to this formation. Between the lowest bed 
and the under coal measure, many beds of slate and shale appear, 
in which thin beds of blue limestone, with encrinites, occur. These 
seem tb mark the dawn of this truly marine deposit. 

3. Superincumbent on the limestone are the true coal measures. 
These consist of the usual alternates of sandstone, shale, iron- 
stone, fire-clay and coals, with subordinate calcareous strata. The 
coal not being worked in this parish, it can only be judged of 
from the workings in the neighbourhood of Pittenweem. There 
it consisted of seventeen beds, making an aggregate thickness of 
82 feet 6 inches. Of course, only a few of the lower coals can 
make their appearance in the parish of Anstruther, as they crop 
out to the eastward. Faults and dislocations of various kinds de- 
range them so frequently, that it is impossible to state with certain- 
ty what may be found to the north-west of this parish. This, how- 
ever, we know, that two seams are wrought at Balcaskie ; and as 
the dip is moderate, and these not apparently the lowest, the crop- 
ping of still lower seams must lie between Balcaskie and Grange- 
muir. In the northern division of the parish, the dip is about 10° 
to west north-west.. In the southern, the dip is more irregular, the 
strata being forced up into bosses, or thrown down in troughs. The 
main boss, and in fact the only one, may be stated as having its 
centre in the harbour of East Anstruther, from which point the 
dip is quaquaversal, until, for a mile inland, where they flatten out 
and assume the regular inclination to west north-west. So evident 
and unbroken is this rounding of the strata, that the high ledge of 
Billowness, west of Anstruther, rounds and again makes its ap- 
pearance at Cellardyke harbour, a distance of nearly two miles. 
Two faults occur west of the Billowness, which derange the strata 
for a short distance, throwing them up to the north-east, about four 
or six fathoms. There are no heterogeneous veins ; but heteroge- 
neous veins occasioned by infiltration, occur in the Billowness rock. 
This rock is ferruginous sandstone, traversed by cross fissures, 
which are found filled with arenaceous iron oxide from the stone. 
The water percolating and acting on the inherent iron has produced" 
this uncommon appearance. 

From the extent of the rock measures laid bare by the sea, a 
very excellent field is afforded to the oryctologist. Indeed, to few 
points of the country, could the student repair with greater advan-

tage. Here be might observe the progressive developement and , 
changes which took place in the animal and vegetable economy, 
during the carboniferous era. The following is a list of a few of 
the more remarkable fossil organisms, animal and vegetable. 

Animal. 

Fish scales, teeth, and coprolites. 

Fioles of the Ganoida and Placoida race have been discovered. 

Shells of the Unio, Mytilus, Anodonta, &amp;c.

Ulodendra, frequent. 

Catamites, numerous gigantic specimens. 

Equiseta, exceedingly plentiful. 

Sphenopoteres, do. do. 

Cyllopteres, very beautiful and rare varieties. 

Meuropteres, do. do. do. 

Sphenophylla, plentiful. 

Lycopodites, do. 

Carpothylites, several have been discovered. 
Cannophyllites, exceedingly abundant. 
Graminiae, do. do. 

Many other species occur, and all in excellent preservation, 
owing to the ferruginous indurated nature of the rocks. They are 
easily freed from the matrix, and are every way worthy of the at- 
tention of the fossil collector. 

The only ore worthy of notice is that of iron. It occurs im- 
bedded in the shale and slate-clay in the form of thin bands and 
septaria. This ore is an argillaceous carbonate of iron, yielding 
from 30 to 60 per cent, of iron. The septaria are in general the 
purest, though sometimes containing carbonate of lime, iron py- 
rites, coprolites, and other impurities. It has never been mined, 
but is frequently gathered by the shore, as washed out from the dis- 
integrated strata, and sells at from 9s. to 12s. for 24 cwt. It is car- 
ried to Newcastle at little expense, in ballast bottomed vessels. 
Immediately on the confines of the parish, at Pittenweem, iron 
ore is quarried from the shale to a considerable extent during low 
water. 

The rocks which compose the district being wholly sedimentary, 
the parish presents no field for the mineralogist. The simple in- 
gredients of sandstone, shale, fire-clay and coal are too well known 
to require individual description.s.

The superficial accumulations are Qonfined exclusively to dilu- 
vial clay with boulders, river silt, and peat-moss. The first of 
these entirely overlies the true rock measures, from one end of the 
parish to the other. It varies from six to fourteen feet in thick- 
ness, is of a yellowish or blue tenacious clay, with boulders of all 
sizes, from that of a pebble to blocks of several tons weight. These 
consist chiefly of primitive greenstone, basalt, granite, syenite, 
porphyry, gneiss, and other primordial rocks. They must owe 
their origin to some very general and potent agency, as none of 
these rocks occur in situ within a distance of eighty or ninety miles. 
The transporting power seems to have been of long duration, and 
to have flowed from the west north-west, or nearly so. 

On the south of the Dreel, this clay, from southern exposure 
and long cultivation, has been superficially reduced to a fine loam, 
capable of bearing a system of cropping. To the north, it is still 
to a certain degree cold and retentive ; but from the system of 
draining pursued, and careful rotation, it bids fair to rival the 
southern division in fertility. 

Silt occurs along the valley of the Dreel, from where it enters 
the parish to its junction with Carnbee Burn. Beyond this, the 
united streams have cut for themselves a deep glen or gill, till 
their waters fall into the Frith. Before the erosion of this glen, 
the valley must have formed a lake or swamp, into which debris, 
&amp;c. was washed, which, in conjunction with the growth and decay 
of aquatic plants, would form the present silt. So soon as the 
drainage glen was sufficiently deep, the waters disappearing would 
leave something similar to what we now find, until rendered 
thoroughly and permanently useful by human industry- This silt 
is, in some places, of great depth, is exceedingly fertile, and might 
-with advantage be carted to the barer districts as a compost. 

During land-floods, the Dreel, which rises in the high lands of 
Ciirnbee, still brings down a very considerable quantity of mud, 
which, if any recipient hollow lay in its way, would still form ex- 
tensive beds of silt. 

In the north-west parts of the parish, and immediately west of 
Grangemuir House, a peat-moss existed, which is now planted or 
converted into arable land. This deposit occupies the head of 
the valley or swamp, the very place most favourable to the produc- 
tion of those plants whose continual increase and decay went to 
its formation. Fourteen years ago, when draining and digging this 
moss for use, the inhabitants of the district frequently discovered

trunks of trees, horns, and other organic remains, peculiar to such 
deposits. 

Mines. — There are no mines of any description in the parish, 
though coals have been worked a few hundred yards from the boun- 
daries, at Waterriggs and Balcaskie. During summer 1838, borings 
for coal were made by Lord William K, Douglas ; but thin seams 
only were passed through. These trials seem to have been made 
too far to the eastward, as the workable seams of the St Monance 
basin must crop out considerably farther west. If coals shall ever 
be discovered in this parish, it must be between Grangemuir and 
Balcaskie, and subjacent to the two Kellie seams now in process 
of workinsf. 

There are no quarries in the parish of any note. Stones for 
common purposes are quarried by the sea shore ; — those for finer 
purposes being brought from a distance. 

A considerable quantity of ironstone is to be found along the 
shores of the burgh, which the magistrates let for Is. per ton ; and 
it is afterwards quarried and collected and shipped for Newcastle. 
Copper ore is also found on the shore nearly opposite the manse. 
There are appearances of coal in the parish at diiferent places ; 
and the name given to some acres lying north-east from the glebe, 
viz. the Cowpits or coal-pits, seem to indicate that that mineral 
had formerly been wrought here. Last winter, many of the inha- 
bitants got liberty from the magistrates to dig coal at the sea 
shore, below flood-mark, and supplied themselves with many cart- 
loads. 

" A narrow stripe of flat land above the shore has evidently been, 
at a remote period, covered by the sea, as it is composed entirely 
of sea sand and shells, with a very thin covering of vegetable 
mould ; and the ocean is again fast approaching to its ancient 
boundary, every succeeding storm making new encroachments 
upon the land, in defiance of all that has been done by man to 
guard it against the restless and resistless element. A circum- 
stance worthy of remark is, that the sea is advancing upon a loioer 
level, the smooth bed of shells and sand over which its waters for- 
merly rolled, being now elevated some feet above its surface. 
This may be observed in the face of every break alongst the coast 
here ; and the writer does not know how the fact can be reconciled 
with the modern theory, that the channel of the German Ocean 
is gradually filling up, and its waters consequently rising and over- 
spreading tracts of land on some parts of its shores."

Boiany. — The study of the plants peculiar to any of these soils 
is rendered difficult by the universality of cultivation. The banks 
and waste parts of the Dreel valley seem favourable to the follow- 
ing: — Veronica chamcsdrijs, Tanacetum vulgare extremely abun- 
dant, Geranium, several species, Lotus corniculatus, Alchemilla 
vulgaris, Galium verum. Primula vulgaris, AchillcBa millefolium, 
Myosotis palustris, abundant, &amp;c. At the Billowness are found. 
Campanula rotundifolia, Helianthemum vulgare. Thymus serpyllum, 
Silenc infiata, Tormentilla erecta, Anagallis arvensis, &amp;c. Rare 
plants are also discovered by the shore, but this is perhaps more 
owing to marine influence than peculiarity of soil. 

Zoology. — The animals which delight in peculiar soils are not 
numerous or well-marked, except in the case of the silt before- 
mentioned. There, perhaps, more than in any place of Scotland, 
do water-rats of great size abound. They seem innumerable. 
In going along the banks of the stream, where the silt occurs, one's 
attention is arrested at almost every step by a large rat plunging 
into the water from among the rank grass, and swimming along 
with wonderful rapidity, until it disappears in one of the holes with 
which the banks are thickly perforated. A strong coincidence to 
this occurs in the case of Mugdrum Island in the Tay, which is 
wholly composed of silt. It was so infested with rats, that all 
plans failed of keeping them down, till Dutch cats were imported, 
which was found efficient. 

" Migratory Birds. — The woodcock, fieldfare, and curlew, visit 
the coast regularly in the winter, and the Bohemian jay is some- 
times seen in the neighbourhood ; as are also wild geese, when 
the higher grounds are covered with snow. The swallow, cuckoo, 
water-wagtail, and plover, make their appearance in summer. The 
early arrival of the woodcock and Bohemian jay, indicates the se- 
verity of the winter on the continent ; while the cuckoo's visit is 
a sure mark that fine weather may be soon expected." 

II. — Civil History. 
Tand-owners. — The chief land-owners are. Lord William 
Douglas of Dunino ; Robert Bruce, Esq. of Grangemuir ; Sir 
Windham C. Anstruther of Anstruther and Carmichael. Bart. ; 
Matthew F. Conolly, Esq. ; the Sea-Box Society ; and the Burgh. 
All are resident except Robert Bruce, Esq. and Sir W. C. An- 
struther. Lord William Douglas has a handsome modern house 
at Grangemuir, built originally by the late Mr Bruce, and greatly

enlarged since it came into his Lordship's possession. The grounds 
about it have lately been laid out anew with much taste. The 
place altogether is one of the most elegant in the country, and might 
form a suitable residence to any gentleman or nobleman in the king - 
dom. The town-hall, in which the magistrates and council hold 
their meetings, deserves also to be mentioned as a large and hand- 
some room. 

Session Records. — The earliest entry in the session records, as 
possessed by the present schoolmaster, is in 1651. One or two 
short extracts from them may be interesting. It would appear 
from some items mentioned at this time 1651, that the town had 
had a rather unceremonious visit from the " Inglis." Under the 
date of 16th September 1651, it is said, " paid for ane — to hold 
ye sand-glass ye ould being plundered by ye ' Inglis.' " And 
again, on the 7th October following, it is said, " paid to Matt 
Thomson for drying ye ould bybell, which was cast in ye sea be 
ye ' Inglis,' yn ye towne was plundered." 

" 5th September 1689.— The whilk day Mr Thomas Auchinleck, 
minister of Anstruther Wester, was discharged by the Lords of 
yr Majesty's Privy- Council from exercising the office of the mi- 
nistry in this congregation, for not reading the proclamation, and 
for not praying for King Wilham and Queen Mary; and the 
church was declared vacant by ane sent from the presbytery of 
Saint Andrews and Cupar to that effect. 

" 8th September 1689. — Mr John Law, a Presbyterian minister, 
preached in the kirk, and intimated the proclamation. 

" 15th April 1691.— Mr Hardie preached, — finding no objec. 
tions against seventeen elders, admitted them. 

" May 1, 1700. — " The session appoints aney three elders to clear 
accounts with the schoolmaster, and pay what is due to him by 
the session against Witsunday next ; and likeways informe him, 
that they have no design to keep any schoolmaster nor precentor, 
both upon account of the indisposition of the minister and the 
poverty of the place." And on the 29th of the same month it is 
said,—" This day Mr David Ballingall, schoolmaster, precentor, 
and session-clerk, did dimit." The schoolmaster's salary at this 
time stated at L. 16, 13s. Od. Scots money. 

" February 1, 1701.— Mr William Hardie, minister of Crail, 
preached. Collected for Andrew Simson, skipper in Dysert, and 
his company, who are slaves in Algiers, L. 16, 00, 00. 

Antiquities—" At the west end of the town there is a large

mound called the Chester-Hill, in the middle of which is a fine 
well. Two or three years ago, in digging on the side of this 
mound a foundation for a house, two skeletons were found in the 
most perfect preservation, at a small distance from each other. 
They were inclosed in a kind of coffin, consisting of a large stone 
at each end and side."  In the church therejs the half of a stone 
coffin, — the other half is on the Island of May. It is reported to be 
the coffin of St Adrian, who had a monastery on the isle just 
mentioned, and is said to have been killed during an incursion of 
the Danes. There is no certainty, however, that the tradition is 
correct. 

III. — Population. 
The number of the inhabitants of the parish does not seem to 
be so great as it was in ancient times. Like most of the other 
towns on the east coast of Fife, the burgh, since the Union, has 
fallen greatly into decay, and the population appears also to have 
decreased, in consequence of the losses sustained in the civil wars 
during the reign of Charles I. The people, in general, were zea- 
lous Covenanters ; and many of them fell in the battle of Kilsyth. 
Besides the disaster in the temporary failures of their fishing, An- 
struther shared the fate of its neighbours about the year 1670, by 
an inundation of the sea, which destroyed or choked up the har- 
bour, washed away the bulwarks, and rendered many of the houses 
unsafe to dwell in. An inundation of a similar kind happened 
about the end of the seventeenth century, when nearly a third of 
the town seems to have been swept away. A long street, called 
the Fore Street, was totally destroyed. Scarce a vestige of it re- 
mains. The rock on which the town-house once stood is covered 
by the sea every spring tide, when it also washes the street where 
the principal houses of the burgh were situated. By these means 
the town has been greatly reduced, and the baptisms, which about 
200 years ago, as appears from the session records, were from 
twenty to thirty a year, are at present very few in number. Now, 
however, the scale seems to have turned; and not from any 
outward circumstances, but from the natural tendency of the 
population to increase, a slow but gradual advance in numbers is 
taking place. .

Character, Sfc. of the People,— The inhabitants of the town and 
parish resemble very much in character those of the other villages 
on the east coast. Judging from the session records of former pe- 
riods, there must be a great improvement in point of morals. We 
may not witness the same appearance of zeal which entitled their 
forefathers to the appellation of the « Whigs of Fife but it 
would be wrong not to admit that much attention is paid to out- 
ward propriety of conduct, and that a regular and becoming at- 
tendance is given to the ordinances of religion. Habits of clean- 
liness are on the increase. Altogether, the people enjoy, in a rea- 
sonable degree, the comforts and advantages of society ; and are, 
or, at least, before new notions were put into their heads, were, con- 
tented with their situation and circumstances. 

. . IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture — The parish contains only about 600 acres. Al- 
most the whole of it is arable. Near the sea, the soil is either a 



622 



FIFESHIIIE. 



black loam or a light sand mixed with shells, both of which, though 
shallow, are very fertile. In the higher grounds, there is some 
light soil, but the greater part of it is a deep clay, which yields 
considerable crops in favourable weather. About 25 acres are co- 
vered with wood. 

Rent of Land.— In the landward part of the parish, the rent 
varies from L. 2 to L. 3 per acre ; but the Burgh acres, or those 
lying near the town, are let at a much higher rate. Some of them 
have been held on lease for seven years at L. 8 per Scotch acre, 
so that the lessee of an acre, alongst with a house and yard at L. 2, 
is duly qualified to be a registered elector. On these lands, five 
imperial quarters of barley have been raised from half an acre ; 
and upon one acre, there have been produced ten tons of carrots, 
which are worth about L. 3, lOs. per ton. The average rent may 
be L. 3, 10s. per acre. 

Rent of grazing a cow or ox per annum, L. 3. 

Wacfes.— Wages of farm-servants for the year, when boarded in 
the house, L. 11. If they happen to be married men, the same 
wages are given, together with a house, six bolls and a half of oat- 
meal, a Scotch pint of milk per day, in addition to which they 
have half a boll of potatoes planted. Day labourers receive m 
summer Is. 6d. per day, in harvest more, and in winter Is. 2d. or 
Is. 4d. Female servants have L. 6 a year, with board. 

Leases, cc— The general duration of leases is nineteen years, 
—a term which seems to be considered as one of the most ad- 
vantageous both for landlord and tenant. The houses of the far- 
mers and the steadings are all that could be wished. The com- 
mon breed of cattle reared in the neighbourhood is the Fife. 

Fisheries.-The fish frequenting this part of the coast are cod, 
ling, turbot, halibut, haddocks, skate, flounders, lobsters, crabs, 
herrings, and occasionally mackarel. Many thousands of dog-hsh 
are at times driven on shore by storms, and carried away for ma- 
nure. In the former Statistical Account of the parish, it is men- 
tioned, that lobsters were the only fish sent from this neighbour- 
hood to the London market. Now, however, great quantities 
of salted cod are sent thither; also smoked, or, as tey are 
called, Finnan haddocks, together with abundance of fresh fash, 
are daily, in their seasons, transported to Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
Cupar, &amp;c. from the adjoining towns of Cellardyke, Easter Anstru- 
ther, and Pittenweem, as will be more particularly mentioned in 
the accounts of these parishes. Last year, a greater quantity ot 



ANSTRUTHER WESTER. 



623 



herrings were taken on this coast than at any other fishing station 
in Scotland. 

Anstruther Wester has no direct share in this profitable traffic; 
the harbour not admitting ships of any burden, and being incon- 
venient even for boats. So that none now belong to it except two 
or three of small dimensions, kept for the summer amusement of 
then- owners. There are no fishermen in this parish, and although 
one of the fish-curers, who carries on a pretty extensive trade, re- 
sides and is a burgess in the burgh, yet his curing and drying houses 
are situated in Anstruther Easter. 

While on this subject, a fish-pond here may be mentioned as a 
curiosity. It is of considerable length and breadth, and 14 feet 
in depth, and was dug out of the solid rock a few years ago, at 
no little trouble and expense, by the late Captain James Black, 
R. N. in the garden of his marine villa. The pond communicates 
with the sea by means of a small passage bored through the rock, 
so that its water rises and falls with the tide. It is stocked with 
cod, turbot, and flounders ; a few lobsters and crabs were also in- 
troduced, but these carried on such a cruel and incessant warfare 
against their more defenceless neighbours in the pond, that the 
captain was obliged to exterminate them. The fish are very tame, 
and flock toward the person who feeds them, like poultry in a barn- 
yard. Of course, they are too great favourites to be caught for 
gracing the table ; but they may be useful in giving us more in- 
sight into the nature and habits of the finny tribe. 

Produce.— It is difficult to get any accurate knowledge of the 
amount of raw produce raised in the parish, but as nearly as that 
can be ascertained, it may be as follows : 

Tn1l\°'abom '"''' "" °'  °f domestic

"7'-Antruther Wester is a royal burgh, and, before the 
time of the Reform Bill, used to join with Pittenweem, Anstruther 
faster, Kilrenny, and Crail, in sending a Member to Parliament. 
Uriginally it was erected into a burgh of barony in 1554, but holds 

1 Jt'T-'' '""'P°''°"'  '•oyal burgh, from James VI. in 
15«7. It is governed by a chief magistrate, two bailies, town-clerk, 
treasurer, and eleven councillors, and has a revenue of about L. 70 
\ per annum, which arises chiefly from land. There are also five or 



G24 



FIFESHIKE. 



six acres of town's common, which is occupied in summer as pas- 
turage for horses and cows belonging to the inhabitants, at the 
rate'of Is. 8d. of grass-mail for each beast per night. Owing to 
the smallness of the population, it is one of those burghs which 
have not, as yet, been affected by the late Reform Bill. The 
municipal authorities still continue to be appointed according to 
the old system, under which, notwithstanding all its alleged cor- 
ruption and abuse, the corporation lands have been preserved 
entire ; not an acre having been alienated since the issuing of the 
royal grant in its favour, upwards of 250 years ago. 

The population of the burgh is almost co-extensive with that of 
the parish. There cannot be above thirty or forty people in the 
country. At one time, a considerable trade appears to have flou- 
rished in Anstruther Wester. But from the causes already alluded 
to, it has entirely disappeared. No vessels or even fishing-boats 
belong to the place,— the only business of any kind earned on 
being that which is necessary to supply the wants of the hmited 
population. No regular police is required ; there are, however, 
twelve constables who may be called out on any emergency. For- 
tunately, their services are seldom needed. In the former Statis- 
tical Account, it is stated, that since the battle of Kilsyth the 
people have a strong aversion to a military life,— that, in the course 
of twenty-one years, only one instance of a person enlisting had 
occurred— that there had not been a suspicion of murder for fifty 
years— that one instance of suicide had taken place about the year 
1744— and that no person had been tried before a criminal court 
since 1732. The writer is unable to say whether the same state 
of things continues; but he has reason to believe, that, notwith- 
standing the altered circumstances of the country, instances similar 
to the foregoing are still extremely rare. 

Marhet-Toton.— burgh itself is not a market-town, but a 
weekly market is held every Saturday in Anstruther Easter, which 
is united to it by a handsome bridge over the Dreel Burn. 

Means of Communication.— The post-office is also placed in 
Anstruther Easter. Letters arrive and depart daily, though, from 
the frequent changes which have lately taken place, the hours are 
very uncertain. The length of the turnpike roads m the parish is 
only about half a mile, alongst which the Balcarres coach to Edin- 
burgh runs thrice a week, returning on the alternate days. An 
omnibus also leaves every morning for Largo, and returns on the 
arrival of the steam-boat from Newhaven. Carriers travel regu- 



ANSTRUTHER WESTER. 



615 



larly to Edinburgh, and to all the neighbouring towns of any con- 
sequence in Fife, such as Cupar, St Andrews. In summer there 
is much communication carried on by steam-boats. Those to and 
from Dundee, Aberdeen, and Montrose, pass and repass daily to 
Newhaven, so that a journey, which, less than thirty years ago, oc- 
cupied a whole day, or sometimes two or three, and could only be 
accomplished at a great expense, is now performed in two hours 
anda half, and for a very trifling sum. 

The fences are commonly dry stone dikes, or, as they are called. 
Galloway dikes. In some places, we find hedges ; but no great 
attention seems to be paid to either. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is very conveniently situated 
for the greater part of the population, being built in the burgh, 
where the bulk of the people reside. It may be nearly two 
miles from the north-west corner of the parish, but there is no in- 
habited house so remote as that. There does not appear to be any 
record as to the period when it was built ; but, from the style of its 
architecture, it must have existed a considerable time previous to 
the Reformation. It was new roofed in 1761, and has been fre- 
quently repaired at considerable expense by the heritors. At pre- 
sent, it is in tolerable order. From its situation almost on the sea 
shore, and on the bank of the Dreel, it is liable to be damp and 
cold in winter ; a stove, however, has just been erected in it, which 
will add much to its comfort. The number of seats is fully beyond 
that required by law, and they afford accommodation for all the 
parishioners who are able to attend public worship. Part of them 
belong to the kirk-session. These are let at sixpence a sitting, 
but even that mall rent is very seldom demanded. The last time 
it was so, was during the prevalence of cholera, and the proceeds 
were handed over to the Board of Health. Almost all of the he- 
ritors give seats to their tenants and others. A very commodious 
manse, and what offices were considered necessary, were built for 
the late incumbent in 1835. The extent of the glebe is four acres, 
including fences. It was lately let at L. 26 per annum ; and, con- 
sidering its situation and the rent of the land around it, may still 
be worth that sum. There is no grass glebe, nor any allowance 
in lieu of it. The late incumbent, conceiving that he had a right 
to one, was at a very considerable expense in endeavouring to esta- 
blish his claim ; but failed before the Court of Session. All along, 
however, he had the impression that his cause was just, and that, if 



626 



FIFESHIRE. 



he had carried it by appeal to the House of Lords, he would have 
been successful. 

The stipend consists, 1st, of the whole teinds of the parish, viz. 
63 bolls, 3 firlots, 3 lippies of bear ; 20 bolls of oats ; 26 bolls, 
3 firlots, 2 pecks, H lippie of oatmeal ; 3 firlots, 1 peck,  lippie 
of beans ; and L. 18, 16s. of money, which, on the average of the 
last five years, and deducting L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, 
amounts to L. 103, 13s. lid,; 2d, an allowance granted by Ex- 
chequer of L.24, is. lOd. ; Sd, the sum of L. 16, 13s. 4d. paid 
out of the Bishops' rents. This last sum, however, was lately 
withdrawn by Her Majesty's Commissioners of Woods and Fo- 
rests ; but in place of it the late incumbent had just obtained, un- 
der the small Stipend Act, an addition equal in amount from the 
Exchequer. With regard also to the sum paid out of the Bishop's 
rents, his legal advisers were of opinion that it ought not, at any 
time, to have been taken into account in allocating his stipend, 
and that Her Majesty's Commissioners of Woods and Forests were 
exceeding their powers in depriving him of it, he having himself 
enjoyed it for upwards of thirty years, and his predecessors, at all 
events, since the date of the Union. " But," he adds in his com- 
munication to the Commissioners of Religious Instruction pathe- 
tically, and considering what has since occurred almost propheti- 
cally, " it may be prudent for a man at my time of hfe, with such 
a stipend and a family to provide for, to suffer patiently, rather than 
attempt going to law with Her Majesty's Commissioners of Woods 
and Forests." It is possible that his successor may feel himself 
justified in trying the question. 

The number of Dissenters in the parish is just 15, in addition to 
4 Episcopalians. Almost all the families, and almost all the indivi- 
duals are connected with the Establishment ; and, in proportion to 
the population, divine service at the church is generally well attend- 
ed. The number of communicants borders upon 200. A Bible and 
Missionary Society exists in the parish. Average amount of con- 
tributions for religious and charitable purposes L. 6. There was 
lately a collection, amounting to L. 2, for Church Extension, and 
L. 7, Is. 6d. for the Colonial Churches. These, perhaps, are fully 
the average of what might be expected in any one year. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in the parish. 
In it the branches taught are, reading, writing, arithmetic, geo- 
graphy, Latin, French, algebra, pure and practical mathematics. 
The schoolmaster has the maximum salary of L. 34, 4s. 4d. In 

3 



ANSTRUTHER WESTER. 



627 



1833, when answers were returned to the Lord Advocate's queries 
on the subject of education, the average of fees for the four pre- 
ceding years was L. 74, 16s. 9d., and in addition the teacher en- 
joys L. 4, being the interest of L. 100 left for the behoof of the 
school. It may be doubted, whether the average of the fees is 
quite so high at present. The schoolmaster, who was only lately 
elected, has not furnished me with the means of ascertaining, and 
perhaps could not very well tell ; but I should think, that it could 
not be greatly reduced. The general expense of education should, 
I think, be from 10s. to L. 1, 5s. per annum, according to the age 
or attainments of the children. There do not appear to be any of 
the young betwixt six and fifteen years of age who cannot read or 
write, or who are not learning to do so, neither are there any of 
those upwards of fifteen who cannot read. Two do so very imper- 
fectly. There are about twenty-five grown up people, most aged 
females, who have not been taught to write. The people, in ge- 
neral, are fully alive to the benefits of education ; and even the 
very poorest will make considerable exertions to procure it for their 
children. 

A bursary connected with the United College of St Andrews, 
was endowed by the late Bailie William Thomson, a former chief 
magistrate of the burgh, in favour of some young man belonging 
to the parish. The value of the land mortified by the benevolent 
donor was about L. 700 ; but it was reduced to L. 600 by an un- 
fortunate law-suit. The magistrates and minister are patrons. 
The endowment may occasionally be of use to young men of me- 
rit; but it may also encourage some to become students before they 
are qualified to profit by the education which a college imparts. 

The following short account of an association which exists 
among the parochial schoolmasters in the East of Fife, may be of 
sufficient importance to be noticed in the Statistical Account. — 
The association was begun in 1818, under the designation of 
" The East of Fife Educational Society." At present, it em- 
braces, as members, all the schoolmasters along the coast from 
Elie to Kingsbarns. They meet once a-month at each others 
houses in rotation, and regular minutes are kept of the proceed- 
ings. The object of the association is for the mutual improve- 
ment of the members, in matters connected with education. They 
are in possession of a small and select library, consisting of works 
on education, science, &amp;c. and they have also a set of chemical 
and other apparatus, both of which are receiving additions from 



628 FIFKSHIRE. 

lime to time. At each meeting of the society, a subject is appoint- 
ed for discussion at next meeting. An essay is occasionally read, 
though the stated production of one is not imperative on the mem- 
bers. They are, however, expected to bring before the meet- 
ing any information or suggestion connected with the profession, 
which they may have acquired by reading or observation ; and to 
give an account of the schools which they may have visited, plans 
of teaching, and improvements they may have observed. Such 
communications lead to many an interesting and useful conversa- 
tion, — keep the members alive to the improvements that are going 
on in education, — stimulate their diligence, and prevent them from 
falling behind the time, in the art of communicating instruction. 

At these meetings, the " brethren" really meet as brothers, and 
an unbroken course of good feeling is kept up amongst them. 

I believe the East of Fife Educational Society is unique in its 
kind ; but it might not, perhaps, be unworthy the consideration of 
the schoolmasters in other parts of the country, whether something 
of the same kind ought not to be originated among them. 

Charitable Institutions.— Two friendly societies are in existence, 
called the Mortcloth and Benefit Society, and the Sea Box. The 
former has existed since 1670, but was re-established in 1819. 
Its members pay Is. 6d. quarterly, or 6s. a year. In case of sickness, 
any of the members is entitled to 5s. weekly for nine weeks during the 
year, and no longer. When a member dies, each of the survivors is 
bound to pay 6d. to the treasurer, who gives the amount to the 
widow or nearest relation of the deceased, as funeral money ; and 
each widow is entitled to an annual pension of L. 2, 12s., paid 
quarterly or yearly, as she may require. The writer is uncertain 
whether the Sea Box is a separate society, or whether it is con- 
nected with that of Anstruther Easter. Both of them, however, 
are useful in supplying the wants of their members, and in keeping 
up a spirit of independence, by preventing them from sinking down 
to the grade of paupers. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of the poor on the 
roll is six; but there are others who receive occasional relief. 
None get more than 10s. per month, and none less than 4s. The 
average may thus be about 7s. The sum collected yearly at the 
church door amounts to about L. 9. This, however, is exclusive 
of what is collected upon sacramental and other extraordinary oc- 
casions, which is applied to the occasional relief of individuals in 
indio-ent circumstances, Avho either do not require or do not choose 



ANSTUUTIIER WESTER. 



G29 



to be put on the list of regular weekly pensioners. Besides the 
collections, however, the session are in possession of considerable 
funds derived from the rent of land bequeathed for the behoof of 
the poor, which enables them easily to meet all the demands made 
upon their charity. Several tons of coal are also yearly distribut- 
ed among the indigent. The late incumbent, who had great 
sensibility, was particularly attentive to the poor; and I have 
been informed that intimation has sometimes been made from 
the pulpit, that, if any were in want, they had nothing to do 
but apply to the session for relief. It seems to be the general 
opinion in this quarter, that there is now less disposition among the 
poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief. The spirit of inde- 
pendence appears to be wearing out apace, and many, so far from 
considering it a degradation to be pensioners on the poor funds, 
think that they have a right to them, and cannot get enough. 
There are, however, some honourable exceptions to the remark. 

Fuel. — The fuel commonly used is coal — either obtained 
in the neighbourhood, or brought by sea from Newcastle. 
Scotch coal may cost 6s. or 7s. a ton at the pit mouth — and 
English from 15s. 6d. to 17s. when delivered from the ship. To 
those who can afford the inlay, the latter will be found the cheap- 
est and the most comfortable. But Scotch coal is commonly 
preferred for the kitchen. 

Fairs, Inns, 5fc. — No fair is held in the burgh ; but there is one 
inn, — quite enough for the population, and the effects of which are 
said to be very pernicious. 

MlSCELLAlSTEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 

The burgh of Anstruther Wester has undergone considerable 
improvements within the last few years. Across the burn which 
separates it from Anstruther Easter, a bridge was erected at the 
mutual expense of the two burghs in 1831. Before that period, the 
only communication betwixt them for carriages was by a ford, at all 
times inconvenient, and sometimes impassable. Besides this, there 
may also be noticed, the widening of the main street at the West 
Port, from 13 to 30 feet— its Macadamization,— and the formation 
of a neat footway or pavement, at an expense of L. 450, contributed 
equally by the burgh and county. The town is also now supplied 
with water, the streets lighted, and common sewers and other con- 
veniences constructed, whereby the public thoroughfares and lanes 
are kept in a clean and orderly state. A new manse and offices 
for the clergyman, and a handsome school and dwelling-house for 



630 



FIFESHIRE. 



the schoolmaster, have likewise been lately erected. The landward 
part of the parish has in like manner partaken of the general im- 
provement. Notwithstanding the late depression in all kinds of pro- 
duce, agriculture is carried on with spirit, and not without profit to 
the farmer. At the date of the last account, the rent of land vari- 
ed from L. 1, Is. to L. 1, 10s. per acre : now it is from L. 2 to L. 3, 
10s. Great attention is paid to the breeding and feeding of cattle : 
and this is sometimes found to be one of the most profitable modes in 
which the farmer can employ his capital. Draining, too, is carried on 
to a considerable extent ; and although the parish is small and not 
naturally very fertile, the produce of the land bears a full proportion 
to the surrounding district. In some respects, too, the morals 
have undergone a change for the better. Hard drinking, which 
was formerly so common, is never heard of in any family, having 
the least pretensions to gentility, and it is to be hoped that the 
example of their superiors will not be without effect on the lower 
orders, among whom it is still too generally practised. 

The writer cannot conclude without adverting to the circum- 
stance which has imposed on him the task of drawing up the fore- 
going account, — the death of his much esteemed and lamented 
friend, Dr Carstairs, late minister of the parish. In him, his family, 
the church, and society at large, have lost a very valuable mem- 
ber. All the duties, whether of his public or his private sta- 
tion, he discharged with exemplary fidelity and zeal ; and it has 
seldom been our lot to see any one more deeply or sincerely re- 
gretted. He will long live iri the memory of all that shared in his 
friendship, or with whom he was in any way connected.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV, ALEXANDER LAWSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of the parish has been written in these dif- 
ferent ways, Creigh, Creich, Creche, Crich, and Ci'iech ; but in the 
Session records, is almost invariably written Cr'eich. The parish 
very probably received this appellation from the farm of Creich, 
in the centre of which the old church and the burying-ground are 
situated, and where the manse also was at one time placed. The 
word is generally thought to be derived from the Gaelic word 
Craigich, signifying rocky or craggy ground, — a description appli- 
cable to the appearance of the parish, especially of the grounds of 
the farm of Creich. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is of an irregular figure. 
It extends in length from north to south about 3 miles, and 
varies from 1 mile to nearly 2 miles in breadth, the greatest 
breadth being in the middle, and the least in the north. It is 
bounded on the north by the parish of Flisk ; on the south, by the 
parishes of Moonzie and Monimail ; on the east, by those of Kilma- 
ny and Balmerino ; and on the west, by those of Abdie and Dunbog. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish presents great inequali- 
ties of surface. It consists of hills, which are part of the Ochil 
range, of various sizes and forms, the highest not appearing to ex- 
ceed 550 feet above the level of the sea. Of these, some are cul- 
tivated to the top, others are partly covered with thriving planta- 
tions, which add much to the beauty of the surrounding country ; 
while several still exhibit a rocky and rugged aspect, and produce 
little else than heath and furze. Were these last tastefully and 
judiciously planted with varieties of wood, the ground, which now 
generally affords but a scanty supply of pasture, would be more 
profitably occupied, the climate would be improved, and few places 
would display more varied and beautiful scenery. The sides of 
most of the hilh and the lower grounds are fertile and well cul- 



632 



FIFESHIRE. 



tivated. The soil of the former is a thin sharp gravelly loam, 
that of the latter is deeper, and is in some places moss, in others 
clay, but in general a black loam. 

Small streams run through the intervening valleys, and, uniting 
near to the village of Luthrie, form the Motray, a rivulet which, 
continuing its course through the parishes of Kilmany and Leu- 
chars, falls into the Eden at the inner bridge. 

From the summit of the Black Craig, and also from that of the 
Green Craig, both of which hills are near to the ruins of the old 
church, may be had one of the most extensive and delighful views 
in Scotland, comprehending the estuary of the Tay, the Carse 
of Gowrie, so famed for its richness and beauty, and the Sidlaw 
and Grampian mountains on the north ; the town of Dundee, and 
the fertile country onwards to the neighbourhood of Arbroath on 
the north-east ; and on the west, part of Strathearn, the finely va- 
ried hills about Perth, with Benledi, Benlawers, &amp;c. in the distance. 

Climaie. — The climate is dry and healthful. In the lower parts 
of the parish, it is mild and pleasant, but on the higher grounds, it 
is rather cold and bracing. As aproof of its salubrity, there are many 
instances of longevity among the inhabitants. The late minister, 
Dr Greenlaw, who had almost completed the sixtieth year of his in- 
cumbency when he died, lived to the age of ninety-fo.ir, and he con- 
tinued so vigorous as to visit his parish during the last year of h 
life. His wife attained nearly the same advanced age. 

Geology. — I am indebted to my friend, Dr Fleming of King's 
College, Aberdeen, for the following account of the geology of 
the parish. The rocks of this parish may be considered as con- 
stituting a portion of the trap fonnation of the Ochils, a hilly 
ridge extending from the neighbourhood of Stirling to Ferry- 
port-on- Craig, at the mouth of the Tay. The parish may be 
viewed, on the great scale, as consisting of a bed of amygdaloid, 
which stretches in an easterly direction, dipping towards the south 
at an angle seldom exceeding twenty degrees. The basis of the 
amygdaloid is in general a claystone, sometimes a compact felspar, 
and, in a few instances, greenstone. It contains, in its cells, cal- 
careous spar, quartz, chlorite and agate ; the last mineral, under 
the name of pebble, is collected for sale by several individuals of 
the parish, and specimens of great size and beauty have frequent- 
ly been obtained. Subordinate to the amygdaloid occur lengthen- 
ed masses of other rocks, some of which may be regarded as ra- 
ther uncommon ; in particular, there is a bed of clinkstone tra- 



CREICH. 



G33 



versing the northern extremity of the parish, of great value for 
many practical purposes. It occurs in columnar concretions,' usu- 
ally termed basaltic pillars, in consequence of which it is easily 
quarried. It is readily dressed to any given form, splits easily in 
a direction across the columns, emits a striking ringing sound, 
especially when in thin slabs, and is of a uniformly dark colour. 
It resists the action of the weather, constituting an extremely dur- 
able building material. Where it has suffered by atmospheric in- 
fluence it exhibits a laminar or stratified structure, a circumstance 
from which it is natural to conclude that it is a sedimentary rock. 
When used as road metal it is easily broken, being somewhat brit- 
tle, though it resists the bruising effects of wheels, and is thus va- 
luable on account of its durability. It forms the hills of Craigen- 
crune, Blackcraig, Greencraig, Craigsimmy, Craiglug, Lochy-hill, 
and the Blackcraig of Carphin, — the same bed extending west- 
ward through the parishes of Abdie and FUsk, constituting the 
heights of Norman's Law and Glenduckie. In consequence of 
this rock decomposing slowly, its soil is scanty, and does not ap- 
pear so favourable to vegetation as that which is produced by the 
amj'gdaloid in which it is imbedded. 

Occupying a similar position in the amygdaloid masses of com- 
pact felspar, may be observed a considerable portion of one of these 
rocks, as exposed to view at the north-west side of Lochyhill, con- 
stituting a range of columns apparently underlying the clinksl one of 
which the hill in general is composed. The rock is more or less 
porphyritic, and, when injured by atmospheric influence, it splits in 
various directions, forming irregular angular blocks. At the north 
side of the Blackcraig of Carphin, there is a bed of gray sandstone, 
which may be traced a few hundred yards at the base of the hill, 
and apparently imbedded in the amygdaloid, and in the immediate 
vicinity of the clinkstone. A quarry was opened in this rock a few 
years ago, and building materials of considerable value were ob- 
tained. The sandstone occurs in thick beds, with interposed layers 
of slate clay, and the whole, according to the present section, co- 
vered with slate clay or camstone. It is similar in its relations and 
character to a sandstone which occurs at Birkhill, about two miles 
to the eastward, and is considered as the equivalent of the Kin- 
goody stone, so extensively quarried to the westward of Dundee, 
and on the north side of the estuary of the Tay. The amygda- 
loid is traversed by numerous small veins of calcareous spar, quartz, 
agate and jasper. Veins, however, of a greater size, and such as 



0'' FIFESHIUE. 

are denominated dikes, may be observed, though not in abun- 
dance. One vein of compact felspar, in the direction of the dip, 
may be observed at the Broomhill. It is quarried for road metal, 
being greatly superior in durability to the amygdaloid with which 
it is surrounded. Another mass of felspar traversing the amygda- 
loid in a south-easterly direction, on the Sheep walk hill of Carphin, 
mav be observed. 

The greenstone dike, which has been denominated the great 
Flisk vein, and which may be traced from the neighbourhood of 
Newburgh on the west, enters this parish at Carphin wood. After 
having traversed the clinkstone of Norman's Law, it passes on in 
an easterly direction through the amygdaloid, until it is lost in the 
neighbourhood of the new church of Creich, though it appears to 
be related to the greenstone of Drumnod, &amp;c. to the eastward. 

In consequence of the dip of the strata being to the south, the 
steep sides of the hills in the parish face the north. From the 
great inequality of the composition of the amygdaloid, it has resist- 
ed in a very unequal manner the decomposing influence of the at- 
mosphere, and hence the surface of the parish is exceedingly un- 
even. The harder rocks occupy the eminences, and exhibit an 
irregular outline, while the prevailing softer amygdaloid gives to 
the hills composed of it a more rounded and even surface. 

The rock cover or tirring is in general derived from a decom- 
position of the rocks, though, in a few instances, it is diluvium. 
Gravelly diluvium occurs, though in no great quantity, at Luth- 
rie. Clay diluvium forms the subsoil to the west of Balyarrow 
mire. By the partial filling of a valley, and interrupting the pro- 
gress of the natural drainage, this diluvium has formed by its de- 
position the barrier of a lake. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Individuals — Alexander Henderson. — The Rev. Alex- 
ander Henderson, who acted so prominent a part in favour of Pres- 
byterianism, during the reigns of James the Sixth and Charles the 
First, was a native of this'parish. He was born in 1582 or 1583, as 
appears from his monumental inscription in the Greyfriars Church- 
yard, Edinburgh. His birth is not inserted in any of the registers 
of the parish, in possession of the kirk-session, as none of them ex- 
tends farther back than 1668. In a minute of session, however, 
of date 5th October 1702, it is mentioned, inter alia, that " There 
was a bond of 2000 merks secured upon the lands of Creich, which 
Mr Alexander Henderson, late minister of Luchars, and afterwards 



CllEICH. 



635 



of Edinburgh, had mortifyd for the encuragemeut of a schoolmaster 
in the parish. The said Mr Alexander being born in the toun of 
Luthrie." After having been educated at the University of St 
Andrews, where he acquired considerable literary reputation, and 
where he became a Professor and also Questor of the Faculty of 
Arts, he was presented by Archbishop Gladstanes, about the year 
1612, to the church and parish of Leuchars, of which he continued 
the minister for many years. Though at the period of his induction 
he was attached to Episcopacy, he soon embraced and steadily 
maintained Presbyterian principles. 

From his great talents, learning, piety, prudence, and integrity, 
he obtained a leading part in the management of ecclesiastical af- 
fairs, and was elected Moderator of the General Assembly on 
three different trying occasions, as being the best qualified for the 
office. In the memorable Assembly at Glasgow, in 1638, he was 
Moderator when Episcopacy was abjured, and Presbyterianism re- 
stored to its original purity. Presbyteries were then directed by 
that Court to erect a school in every landward parish, and the 
plan of the parish school, which combines education with religious 
instruction, and which has been productive of the most important 
advantages to Scotland, is said to have been devised by Hender- 
son. He was ever desirous to promote education, and, as a proof 
of the encouragement he gave to it, he was made a burgess of 
Dundee, in 1632, for his good services to the schools in that town; 
and he bequeathed not only 2000 merks for the maintenance of a 
school in this parish, but also mortified a house, garden, croft, two 
acres of land, and L. 4, 10s. 6d. Sterhng for the benefit of a school- 
master in the parish of Leuchars. At the Glasgow Assembly it 
was agreed to translate him from Leuchars to Edinburgh. When 
one of the ministers of that city, being a great encourager of learn- 
ing, he had the honour of being chosen the first Rector of the 
Edinburgh University, in January 1640, and of being annually re- 
elected Rector till the time of his death. He had, moreover, the 
merit of being the first in proposing, and of having a considerable 
share in framing, our Confession of Faith, our Larger and Short- 
er Catechisms, our Directory of Church Government and Wor- 
ship, and also of improving the- metrical version of the Psalms 
which is still used in our Churches. In all matters of public im- 
portance he was consulted by the most influential statesmen ; and 
even King Charles L, who had a great respect for his character,.

FIPESHIHE. 



and a high opinion of his learning and abiHties, knowing his desire 
to have Presbyterianism estabhshed throughout the British domi- 
nions, entered into a correspondence with him regarding the com- 
parative merits of Episcopal and Presbyterian modes of church 
government, but was not induced toigree to the abolition of Epis. 
copacy in England. 

Henderson was a man of amiable dispositions, naturally averse 
to violence, and desirous to unite the friends of true religion ; and 
he was possessed of a sound discriminating judgment, which, while 
it led him to endeavour to prevent those ruinous excesses to which 
" some fiery spirits" of his own party would have carried them, 
led him also, where necessary, to adopt strong measures in order 
to remove grievances, and to accomplish a reformation. 

He was an enlightened, able, and temperate defender of Pres- 
byterianism, and so continued to the last moment of his life. His 
death, which took place in 1646, was deeply regretted as a great 
loss to the Church and to the kingdom. Principal Baillie pro- 
nounced a high eulogium on his character in the General Assem- 
bly of 1647 : and the Presbyterians, in general, honoured his me- 
mory by every expression of their esteem and regard.-f- 

Family of Bethune of Creich. — The first proprietor of Creich 
of the name of Bethune was David, second son of John Bethune, 
Laird of Balfour, and of Marjory Boswell, daughter of the Laird 
of Balmuto. He was highly esteemed by King James IV., who 
created him Great Treasurer of Scotland, and Keeper of the Pa- 
lace of Falkland. " He conquest and acquired the lands of Creich 

from the Littles or Liddels, in 1502." He was married to 

Duddingston, daughter to the Laird of Sandford in Fife. Janet, 
their elder daughter, from whom many of the chief nobility and 
gentry in Scotland are descended, was married, first, to Sir Ro- 
bert Livingston of East Wemyss, and after his death to James, 
the first Earl of Arran of the Hamiltons, and nephew to King 
James HI. Of the issue of this latter marriage was James, Earl 
of Arran, who was also Duke of Chatelherault, and Regent of 
the kingdom. Mary, the younger daughter, was married to Lord 
Lyle. — Sir John Bethune, the second proprietor of Creich, suc- 
ceeded his father, and was married to Janet Hay, daughter of 
John Hay, provost of Dundee, and niece of the Laird of Naugh-

ton, by whom he had four sons and seven daughters. Janet, 
their eldest daughter, who was married, first, to the Laird of 
Cranstoun, second, to the Laird of Craigmillar, and third, to Sir 
Walter Scott of Buccleuch, Senior, to the last of whom she had 
four daughters — is celebrated in the Lay of the Last Minstrel 
for her bold and adventurous spirit, her great influence, and for 
the popular belief of her mysterious endowments. A copy of a 
letter of her's to the Queen Regent Mary of Guise is published in 
the Miscellany of the Maitland Club. All the other daughters 
of Sir John Bethune were respectably married. His eldest son, 
David, who inherited the estate of Creich, having died a bachelor 
in 1539, was succeeded by his brother, Robert, the fourth pro- 
prietor of the name of Bethune. He was page to Queen Mary, 
and accompanied her to France, where she was married to the 
Dauphin. On her return to Scotland in 1561, he was made 
Master of the Household, Heritable Steward of Fife, and Keeper 
of the Palace of Falkland. He married a French lady, Joanna 
Renwall or Gryssoner, a maid of honour to the Queen, by whom 
he had two sons and eight daughters. Mary,f their eldest daugh- 
ter, is well known as having been one of the Queen's four Maries, 
and is celebrated by Buchanan in his Valentiniana :

Mr Macdonald of the Register- House has printed a copy of her 
contract of marriage with Alexander Ogilvie of the Boyne, in the 
Miscellany of the Maitland Club, Vol. 1st. It is remarkable for 
its being subscribed not only by Queen Mary and Henry Darn- 
ley as parties, but by the Earls of Huntly, Argyll, Bothwell, Mur- 
ray, Angus, and Atholl, as cautioners for the bridegroom, by Ogilvie 
himself as Boyne, and by Mary Bethune, many personages who are 
represented in history as having been generally hostile to one ano- 
ther. — David Bethune, the eldest son of Robert, succeeded him 

• " It is observed and reported as a truth," says Martine, " that the race and 
people of Balfour wore always black, and not beautiful and fair, but that ever after the

low-haired for the most part, and of beautiful countenances."— Martin's Genealogi-

as fifth proprietor of Criech, and married Euphan P. B. Leslie, 
daughter of the Earl of Rothes, by whom he had an only child, a 
female, but, being desirous that the estate of Creich should conti- 
nue to be possessed only by those of the name of Bethune, he dis- 
poned it to his brother, James, parson of Roxburgh, who became 
in consequence the sixth proprietor. He married, first, Helen 
Leslie, heiress of Kinnaird, and after her death, Margaret 
Wemyss, eldest daughter of David Wemyss of that ilk, from 
whom it is said the Earls of Wemyss are descended. Their eld- 
est son and grandson succeeded to the property as the seventh and 
eighth proprietors. The latter was married to Lady Margaret 
Cunninghame, daughter of the Earl of Glencairn : but she hav- 
ing no family, and his brother William having no male children, 
he disponed the whole estate of Creich,t being about 80 chalders 
of victual, to James Bethune, then fiar of Balfour, under the bur- 
den of 80,000 or 90,000 merks, reserving to himself the liferent of 
the most part, and to his Lady the liferent of 32 chalders of vic- 
tual. Lament, in his Diary of Fife, mentions that this Laird of 
Creich, soon after disponing the prcperty, died at his' dwelling- 
house at Denbough, on 4th March 1660, and was interred at Creich 
church. 

Family ofSeton of Parbroath.—The first proprietor of Par- 
broath of the name of Seton was John, fourth son of the famous 
Alexander Seton, Governor of Berwick. He became proprietor 
of the lands of Parbroath by marrying Elizabeth Ramsay, heiress 
thereof. Their son, Alexander, was father of Sir Gilbert Seton of 
Parbroath, from whom the lineal succession continued till the reign 
of James VL 

Fa7nily of Baillie.— The Baillies of this parish were descended 
from the frst of the family of Baillie of Carphin, in the upper 
ward of Lanarkshire. He was second son of Sir William Ba.liie 
of Lamington, and of the eldest daughter and heiress of the cele- 
brated Sir William Wallace, the brave defender of Scotland. 
The descent of Baillie of Lamington has been traced as far back 
as to John Baliol, father of John Baliol, King of Scotland. The 
name was changed from Baliol to Baillie. §

From the session records, it appears that the family of Bailhe 
were in possession of Balmeadowside and Parbroath in 1668. They 
subsequently purchased the estate of Luthrie, which at that time 
comprehended the present lands of Luthrie, East Luthrie, and 
Carphin. After having for some time retained possession of all these 
different estates, they sold Parbroath to John, the second Earl of 
Hopetoun, grandfather of George William Hope, Esq. M. P. the 
present proprietor. In 1780, they sold Balmeadowside to D. 
Wallace, Esq., and East Luthrie to Thomas Tod, Esq. The eldest 
son of the former, and the only son of the latter, now inherit the 
respective properties. Carphin was sold to Miss Halkerston of 
Rathillet, great grand-aunt to C. B. Raitt, Esq. the present pro- 
prietor. 

The late Colonel Alexander Baillie of Luthrie, who was pa- 
tron of the parish, and Barrack- Master- General of Scotland, died 
without issue in 1814, and his widow, Mrs Euphan Hamilton or 
Baillie, who was daughter and heiress of Mrs Bethia Hamilton of 
Wishaw, continued in possession of the present estate of Luthrie 
till the 17th September 1823, when she died. A handsome mar- 
ble monument is erected to their memory in the new church. The 
estate of Luthrie was, soon after the death of Mrs Baillie, sold to 
Charles Hill, Esq. whose eldest son is now the proprietor.

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest entry is 1668. 
Marriages and baptisms appear, with a few exceptions, to have 
been recorded with regularity from 1668 to the present time, and 
births have frequently, but not always, been inserted. For many 
years past, births have been always entered along with the bap- 
tisms. There is a register of burials, along with baptisms and mar- 
riages, from 1st October 1783, to 1st October 1794, after which 
time the registering of burials was discontinued, seemingly in con- 
sequence of the Government tax on births, marriages, and burials, 
ceasing at that time by act of Parliament to be uplifted. A regis- 
ter of those who die in the parish has been regularly kept since 
1817. The registers of births, marriages, and deaths, have, for the 
last twenty years, been kept according to a plan recommended by 
the presbytery to the different parishes within their bounds. They 
are annually inspected by the committee of presbytery appointed 
for the examination of the schools, and have uniformly been com- 
mended for their distinctness and accuracy. 

Antiquities. — Ancient Circles of Stones. — In the spring of the 
year 1816, while some workmen were employed in trenching 
a piece of ground a little to the south-west of the manse, they 
came to a number of stones, about eight or ten inches below 
the surface, placed in a regular form. The part of the coun- 
try in which these regularly arranged stones were situated, is 
very uneven. Three ridges of hills, extending in different di- 
rections, terminate on the west in Norman's Law, the most ele- 
vated ground in the north of Fife. On the south side of the most 
northern of these ridges, and about midway between the top of 
one of the hills and a small rivulet which flows along the strath, 
there is a lateral shelf, upon which these stones were discovered. 
This northern ridge extends in a direction from east to west.

in the course of trenching, unfortunately the regular arrangement 
of those above-mentioned was not attended to, until two carved 
stones were cast up, with the figures upon each very entire. This 
circumstance naturally led to an examination of all the stones, to 
a consideration of the manner in which they were originally placed, 
and to an attention to those which yet remained untouched. Upon 
examination, no other figured stone appeared ; but, what was re- 
markable, many of those taken up were sandstone, while the hill 
on which they were placed, and all the hills in the neighbourhood, 
are whinstone rock. Those which remained untouched were set 
on end, and so arranged as to form two arches of concentric circles. 
So far as could be judged at the time of discovery, the whole erect 
stones, which were, in general, from a foot and a half to two feet 
and a half high, were so placed as to make up two figures of a 
circular, or, perhaps, more nearly of an elliptical form, the one 
contained within the other. In the centre was a cylindrical stone 
pillar of the same height with the rest, and near to it were the car- 
ved stones. 

It is to be regretted that most of the stones were taken up be- 
fore their number, their regular arrangement, and individual po- 
sition, were ascertained. This good effect, however, resulted from 
the discovery of this structure, that it induced some workmen, who 
were soon after ploughing a field about five or six hundred yards 
due east of the place above described, to conclude, when their 
ploughs repeatedly struck against some stones, that they had come 
to something similar to what had been so recently discovered at 
so short a distance, and to pay particular attention to preserve 
every stone in its original position. They accordingly proceeded 
to remove all the earth with the greatest care, and their expecta- 
tions of finding another curiosity were soon completely realized. 
Upon acquainting the present incumbent with the circumstance, 
he went and carefully examined the situation of this structure : at- 
tended to its form and arrangement ; then took the dimensions of 
its different circles, and the stones of which they were composed. 
Its situation, hke that of the former, was a lateral flat on the south 
side of the same ridge of hills, and also at an equal distance from 
the summit and the stream below. 

In the centre was placed, in an upright position, a cylindrical 
sandstone, one foot two inches high, and having the diameter of 
Its base one foot. Around this stone, as a centre, at the distance 
of three feet, were sixteen other stones, placed also in an up-

right position, and in the form of a circle. The stones of which 
it was composed were of various sizes, from fifteen to twenty inches 
in height ; from eight to eighteen in breadth, and from four to 
nine in thickness. Due south of the centre, and between it and 
the inner circle, there were placed in a horizontal position, two 
stones containing hieroglyphics in alto relievo, very entire. The 
remaining space between the centre and the circle was laid with 
pavement. At the distance of seven feet and a half from the 
same central pillar, there was another circle of stones, thirty-two in 
number, placed in an upright position, and very much resembling 
those of the inner circle. The stones in both circles were placed 
close together. Between the circles there was neither pavement 
nor stone of any description. Neither were perfect circles, the 
diameter of one, from north to south, being fifteen feet one inch, 
while its diameter from east to west was only fourteen feet nme 
inches ; in the same manner, the diameter of the other, from east 
to west, was five feet ten inches, while from north to south it was 
six feet one inch. 

Tt is curious to observe, that many of the stones here found, like 
those discovered the year before, were sandstone, while none of the 
same kind can be got nearer than a quarry at Cupar moor, which 
is seven miles distant. 

At the distance of a few yards on the south, there were also 
discovered under ground two curious whinstones ; one resembles 
in shape the frustum of a cone, with a small projection at the 
greater end, through which is a round hole. From this, at the 
distance of nine inches, and also near the base, is a slit two and a 
half inches in length, and extending inwards about an inch and a 
half; on the side directly opposite to this slit, part of the stone is 
broken off. The perpendicular height of the frustum is seven 
inches, the diameter of the small end is seven and a half inches, 
and the diameter of the greater end is eleven. At the top or 
small end of the stone, there is an excavation, around which is a 
margin of rather more than half an inch in breadth. From this 
cavity, which is five inches in depth, and capable of containing a 
quart, there is a round hole reaching to the bottom of the stone. 

The other stone is much broken. Its shape appears to have 
originally much resembled that of the former. Its present per- 
pendicular height is seven inches, the diameter of the greater end 
is eleven, and that of the small end nine. Like the former, it has 
a hole in the side near to the base, and reaching about three 



CREICH. 043 

inches inwards. It has also a cavity at the top, and a perforation 
extending from the cavity to the bottom. The perforation in this 
stone is four inches in depth, exactly double the depth of the per- 
foration on the other. 

The above described monument was allowed to remain for- ten 
days in its original form for public inspection, but as some people, 
from a love of mischief, or from an expectation of finding hidden 
treasure, were beginning to lift and injure some of the stones, and 
as no method of preserving them in safety in their original situation 
could be easily adopted, it was considered necessary to remove 
them. They were taken up in presence of a concourse of people 
who had assembled to gratify their curiosity, when underneath one 
of the carved stones, were found burned human bones and charcoal. 
George Tod, Esq. of Luthrie, on whose property these ancient 
circles were discovered, with much civility presented them to the 
present incumbent, and they are now placed precisely in their 
original form in a wood behind the manse, a good subject for the 
examination of the antiquary. Figures of them are given in the 
Edinburgh Magazine, December 1817. 

It has been supposed by some, that these ancient circles were 
small Druidical temples or rather oratories for families, that the 
excavated stones were meant for containing holy water, which the 
Druids, as well as the Greeks, the Jews, and other ancient nations 
were accustomed to use, and that the burned bones were the remains 
of the sacrifices here offered. It has been supposed by others, with 
seemmgly greater probability, among whom is Huddleston, the 
learned Editor of Toland's History of the Druids, that these are 
sepulchral monuments, and that the hieroglyphics on the stones are 
sepulchral inscriptions— that one of these, which is the figure of a 
spade, IS an emblem of mortality, and as such is still seen on 
tombstones ; that the figure of a pair of shoes, and of a shield turn- 
ed upside down, may naturally signify that the owner has no far- 
ther use for them, and may remind one of the reversing of arms 
at a soldier's funeral ; that the circular figures may represent ring, 
which have often been found in sepulchral monuments; that the 
circular figure with perforated knobs may represent an antique 
vase vMh giMcB lachrymales ; that the cross inscribed in a circle 
may represent the wheel of .some ancient carriage, while the 
hgure to the left may represent the body of the machine disjoined 
from It, as if no more required. The stones found near to the 
above structure may have been entirely unconnected with it.

Ancient Fort. — On the Greencraig, a little to the eastward of 
the manse, are two concentric circles of rough stones, at no great 
distance from each other, which extend round the hill, near to its 
summit, except on the north side, where it is precipitous. 

Some have supposed that they are the remains of an ancient 
camp of the Danes, which had two lines of circumvallation ; that 
when the Danes invaded the country for plunder, they here depo- 
sited their spoils, until they found it necessary, from being attack- 
ed by the natives, to remove their pillage to their boats in the 
Tay. Others have supposed that they are the remains of a fort 
erected by the natives, for the purpose of defending themselves 
and their property against the predatory incursions of the Danes 
or other enemies. 

An ancient quern was lately found here by some workmen when 
employed in trenching, and was kindly presented to the present 
incumbent by Mr Mitchell, tenant of the farm on which it was 
discovered. 

Urns, c. — Besides the two jars mentioned in the forrper Sta- 
tistical Account, as having been found in a rising ground near to 
the manse, two urns were discovered many years ago a Uttle to the 
west of the present house of Parbroath, and two stone coffins a little 
to the east of it. Urns have also been found on the lands of Balmea- 
dowside. All these were deposited on knolls, and contained human 
bones ; but nothing worthy of notice is remembered regarding them. 
Creich Castle, the ancient residence of the Bethunes,is now a ruin. 
It is 47 feet in length, by 39 in breadth, and three stories high, 
with a court-yard on the west. Within this court-yard the present 
farm-house is situate. The castle has been a place of very con- 

• Since the above was written there was discovered, on the 8th of February 1839, 
when digging a grave within the old church of CreicD, a few inches under the pave- 
ment, a grave-stone, 6 feet 7 inches in length, 2 feet 8 inches in breadth, and 4 
inches in thickness. On the top of the stone are carved two figures,— one of a nian 
in a complete coat of mail, and another of a lady in a long embroidered robe. Above 
the figures are canopies of tabernacle work, finely designed. Upon two shields arc 
emblazoned the arms of the families of Barclay and Douglas. This stone- was found 
lying partly within and partly in front of a niche, on the top of which are the Barclay 
arms. On the outer edge of the stone, which is bevelled, is the followmg uiscnption, 
in old English characters. Two of the words, which are a little defaced, are omitted:

Tlie figures, although not in relief, are executed with great freedom and artist-like 
skill and the lettering of the inscription is done with a correctness and beauty that 
could scarcely be equalled at the present time. From there being hollows cut m 
the stone for the faces and hands, it appears that these had been inserted in met"'-

siderable strength. It was defended on the south-east by a mo- 
rass, which has lately been drained, and on the other sides by 
strong outworks, part of which has been taken down. It bears no 
date to mark its age. The proprietor, a few years ago, very ju- 
diciously upheld its ruined walls by a repair, clothed them with ivy, 
and near to them planted some trees for shelter and ornament. It 
is said that, at a short distance from the castle and a little to the 
north of the church, formerly stood a brewery, to which was at- 
tached a ploughgate of land, denominated Pitfigies. 

The old Parish Church, where divine service was performed so late 
 as the 9th December 1832, is surrounded by the burying-ground 
and in the immediate vicinity of the castle. In the interiorof oneof 
the walls are two niches, on the top of one of which is a coat of arms, 
which appears to be that of the Barclays of Collairnie, who were, 
at a very early period, proprietors of Kinsleith, in this parish, and 
who sold that portion called Easter Kinsleith, in 1727, to James 
Miller, Esq. the great grandfather of the present proprietor. 

Ancient House ofPurhroath. — Of this house or castle, which be- 
longed to the family of Seton, nothing now remains to mark the site 
save part of an arch surrounded by a few old trees, which has been 
carefully preserved by desire of the late Earl of Hopetoun. It stands 
near to the place where the road between the Forth and Tay fer- 
ries crosses the road from Cupar to Newburgh. The house is 
said to have been surrounded by a moat, over which there was a 
draw-bridge, and the park in which they were situated is still called 
the Castlefield. There is a tradition that one of the late farm-build- 
ings at Parbroath, which was long used as a barn, had at one time 
been a chapel, and that at it, and at the church of Creich, divine 
service was performed on alternate Sabbaths. In confirmation of 
a chapel having been here, it may be stated, that, a few years ago, 
when the foundation of a wall was dug up close by the site of the 
old barn, some graves were discovered, which probably formed part 
of the burying-ground connected with the chapel. 

It is not unlikely that this chapel may have been the capella 
belonging to the parish of Creich, mentioned by Sibbald in his 
History of Fife.

It is stated in the last Statistical Account, that the diminution 
of one-fifth of the population which had taken place in the ihirty- 
five years preceding 1 790, was probably owing to one village be- 
ing allowed to go to decay, to the union of farms, and the use of 
two horse ploughs. Since that time, several additional houses 
have been built in the other villages, and some are occupied by 
numerous families, which may account for the increase. 

There is often a very considerable diiference between the po- 
pulation of one year and that of another, arising from the changes 
of farm-servants and others, some of whom have numerous families.

There is no insane person in the parish, but there is one who

Prevailing Amusements. — The favourite amusement in this pa- 
rish is curling. Many of the landed proprietors, almost the whole 
tenantry in the neighbourhood, and others of different professions, 
resort to the ice on Balyarrow, and enjoy this innocent, healthful, 
and invigorating exercise. The Balyarrow Curling Club is said 
to be the oldest in the north of Fife. 

Character and Habits of the People— They are industrious, 
peaceable, and orderly in their habits. They enjoy in a rea- 
sonable degree the advantages of society, and are civil and ob- 
liging. They live comfortably without extravagance, and are 
contented with their situation. In their food and in their man-

ner of dress, there is no peculiarity. On the Sabbath, they ap- 
pear in church in their best attire, which is neat, respectable, and 
becoming. They show a regard for religious institutions and in- 
struction ; and may, in general, be considered an intelligent, 
moral, and religious people. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — From answers to my inquiries by the different 
proprietors and tenants, I am enabled to state that the number of 
standard imperial acres in the parish is 2324 ; that of these 1803 
are cultivated ; that 276 remain constantly waste or in pasture ; 
that scarcely any could with a profitable application of capital be 
added to the cultivated land ; that 41 acres are occupied by roads, 
houses, farm-steadings, barn-yards, church-yard, and burying- 
ground ; and that- the remaining 204 are under plantation. 

Woods. — The trees are chiefly Scotch, larch, and spruce firs, 
in the larger plantations intermixed with several kinds of hard- 
wood. In one of smaller extent, and in some belts and clumps of 
planting, they are chiefly hard-wood ; and in the grounds about 
Luthrie House there are some fine old elms, planes, and horse- 
chestnuts, &amp;c. A few years ago a plantation of Scotch fir of fifteeu 
imperial acres, on the north-east extremity of the farm of Creich, 
and last year about nine acres of a plantation on Luthrie, were cut 
down and sold, — the trees having come to full maturity at the age 
of seventy years. The ground on which they grew has been 
trenched, and is now bearing excellent crops. 

Rent. — Many of the proprietors farm their own properties ; but 
a fair average rent of the arable land in the parish is considered 
by good judges to be L. 2, 2s. per Scots acre, or L. 1, 13s. 3gd. 
per imperial acre, and of the uncultivated ground to be 53. per 
Scots acre, or about 4s. per imperial acre. According to this es- 
timate, the rent of the parish is L. 3056, 14s. 2d. The average 
rent of grazing is at the rate of L. 3 for an ox; L. 3, 10s. for a 
cow ; 12s. for a ewe or full-grown sheep for the year ; and L. 5 
for a mare and foal. 

Rate of Wages. — Unmarried ploughmen receive each from L. 10 
to L. 12 in money, and six bolls and half of oatmeal, Dutch 
weight, annually, and a Scotch pint of milk daily, as it comes 
from the cow. They are lodged in bothies. Married ploughmen 
receive each annually about L. 10, JOs., the same quantity of meal 
and milk, a free house and garden, the driving of their coals, and 
about 27 falls of ground for planting potatoes. This small por- 



348 



FIFESHIRH. 



tion of ground generally produces as many potatoes as afford a suf- 
ficient supply for the family, and enable them to feed a pig. 
The foreman or principal servant receives in addition to the above 
from L. 1 to L, 3, and all the milk of a cow, instead of a pint of 
milk per day. Men employed as day-labourers receive each gene- 
rally Is. 6d. per day in summer, and Is. 4d. in winter. Women when 
employed in the fields get each 8d. per day of nine hours work, but 
when taking up potatoes they receive Is. per day and their dinner. 
Female domestic servants receive about L. 6 per annum. Shear- 
ers are paid for cutting and binding, wheat 4d. a threave, and for 
barley and oats 3gd. a threave. When the crops of grain are cut 
by the acre, the sum given per acre is 12s. Masons receive ge- 
nerally from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 8d. per day of ten hours without vic- 
tuals. The rate of mason work is, for Gallowaiy dikes from 7s. 6d. 
to 8s. 6d. per rood of 36 square yards ; for close dry stone dikes 
10s. 6d. ; for stone and lime dikes, from 16s. to L. 1 ; for ruble 
building, from L. 1, 8s. to L. 1, 12s. Smiths usually contract to do 
the work of the farmer by the pair of horses at L. 2 annually. 
This includes their shoeing, and keeping ploughs, harrows, 
grapes, and forks in good repair. Carpenters receive from Is. 
lOd. to 2s. per day of ten hours and their victuals, or from 2s. 4d. 
to 2s. 6d. without victuals. The price of wood is, ash, 2s. per 
cubic foot, Scotch fir, lOd., larch fir. Is. 2d., and elm, 2s. 

Prices. — The price of different articles manufactured in the pa- 
rish for the purposes of rural economy is, a two-horse cart with iron 
axle completely mounted, L. 10 ; a single horse cart do. L. 9 ; an 
iron two-horse plough, L. 3, 15s; do. with iron swingle-trees, 
L. 4, 10s; an iron grubber for drilled crops, L. 3, 3s; an iron 
drill harrow, L 1, 10s; a pair of iron common harrows fully mount- 
ed with rider and swingle-trees of iron, L. 2, 10s ; a pair of wood- 
en common harrows, fully mounted with rider and swingle-trees 
of wood, L. 1, 14s. The wooden harrows in the parish are gradu- 
ally giving place to those of iron, and iron ploughs are universally 
in use. There are in the parish eight thrashing machines worked 
by horses, every farm having one. The flail is entirely laid aside, 
except by those who have less than twelve acres of ground. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle are generally of the old Fife breed, 
which is greatly preferred by all the rearers of stock in the parish, 
except by one individual, who thinks more highly of the improved 
short horns or Teeswater, and whose lands, from being rich and well 
sheltered, are well adapted for them. The number of milk cows 



CIIEICH. 



fi49 



in the parish is 70, and the number of cattle of all ages, including 
cows, is 346. The cattle are generally sold when fat, about three 
years of age. No particular attention is paid to the breed of horses. 
The number of horses of all ages is about J 06. There are at pre- 
sent in the parish 13 scores of sheep. No decided preference is 
given to any particular breed. They are generally bought when 
young in the month of August, and sold when fat in the month of 
June of the following year. 

Husbandry. — The most improved mode of husbandry is prac- 
tised. A rotation of six is in general observed in cropping, viz. 
1, summer fallow, potatoes, or turnips well manured ; 2. wheat, the 
land half-manured ; 3. barley, sown with perennial rye-grass ; 4. 
grass ; 5. grass ; 6. oats. On very rich land there is frequently 
a rotation of four or five having one year's grass. On inferior land 
wheat is seldom sown ; barley, with grass seeds, follows the turnips 
and potatoes. The turnips are manured with bone dust, and one- 
half is eaten on the field by sheep. Three crops of grass are fre- 
quently taken. In mossy ground, oats are sown with grass seeds 
in preference to barley. Where the green crop has been pota- 
toes in one rotation, it is turnips in the next, so that the land may 
produce the same kind of crop as seldom as possible. When the 
half of the turnips is to be eaten on the field by sheep, all the two 
alternate rows are previously carted home for feeding cattle, and 
the remainder left for the sheep. When the turnips are not eaten 
on the field by sheep, another method has been practised within 
these few years of cutting off the shaws leaves, and immediately 
ploughing them down in the ground. The good effects of adopt- 
ing this method have been fully shewn by the excellence of the suc- 
ceeding crop. The turnips which are usually raised in the parish 
are globe, to be used first, yellow next, and Swedes, which are 
least apt to be injured by the frost, last. The potatoes which are 
most generally raised are the Perth red. Many of them are ex- 
ported for the London market, where this kind is in the great- 
est demand. The price given here, which is very much regulat- 
ed by the price in London, varies from 5s. to 14s. per boll of five 
cwt. 

It may be worthy of notice, that when, in the autumn of 1836, a 
severe frost, which set in early, and continued long, prevented the 
potato crop from being taken up in safety, George Tod, Esq. 
of Luthrie m this parish, allowed most of his potatoes to remain 
m the ground all winter, and took them up in the spring com-

paratively little injured. They were in consequence eagerly sought 
after for seed, and in due time produced an abundant crop. The 
weight of the different kinds of grain in the parish is as follows : 
Barley from 52 to 56 imperial pounds per bushel, average 53 ; 
wheat from 60 to 66, average 63; oats from 40 to 45, ave- 
rage 42.

The above is calculated by the average of the fiar prices for 
the last seven years, but the grain in this parish, being better than 
the average of the county, may be considered as Is. per quarter of 
more value. 

The greater part of the parish is inclosed partly with hedges 
and partly with stone dikes. More inclosures are in progress, and, 
from the present disposition of the proprietors and tenants, it is pro- 
bable that all the grounds in the parish will be inclosed at no dis- 
tant period. 

The common duration of leases is nineteen years ; a period which 
meets with general approbation, unless where great improvements 
are to be made upon a farm, when it should be longer, to afford 
time to the farmer to reap the benefit of what he has expended on 
improvements. 

Farm-Buildings. — The farm-houses are generally good, and the 
steadings are suitable and commodious. Since the former Statistical 
Account was published, at least 200 imperial acres of waste land 
have been brought by draining, trenching, and liming, into a state 
of hio-h cultivation, and to produce excellent crops. There has 
been drainfhg also to a considerable extent in lands which have 
long been under the plough, and the results have been very bene- 
ficial. The late Mr William Reid, tenant of Parbroath, who was 
highly esteemed as a skilful agriculturist and an intelligent upright 



CREICH. 



G51 



man, practised on his farm, upwards of twenty years ago, the pre- 
sent approved mode of furrow-draining, with great success. More 
draining is necessary, and the farmers, who are well aware of its ad- 
vantages, are carrying it on in the most approved and judicious 
manner. Deep ploughing is resorted to, in order to renew the soil, 
and to get it cleared of stones. 

Quarries. — There is an excellent quarry of basaltic clinkstone 
on East Luthrie, the property of George Tod, Esq. with stones 
from which many of the houses in the parish and neighbourhood 
have been built. On Carphin, the property of C. B. Raitt, Esq. 
there is a gray sandstone quarry. Particulars regarding these quar- 
ries are stated in the account of the Geology of the parish. 

Manufactures. — The chief branch of manufacture is hand-loom 
weaving. Osnaburghs, brown and plain white sheetings, and dow- 
las of almost all qualities, are worked here. Two resident manu- 
facturers, and some resident agents of manufacturers in Cupar 
and Newburgh, give employment to all the weavers in the parish, 
and to many in the neighbourhood. The average quantity of cloth 
■woven by them annually, as I am informed by one of the manu- 
facturers after a careful examination, is 177,200 yards, the value 
of which is L. 5293, 6s. 8d. Of this quantity, 84,000 yards are 
woven by the weavers . employed by the resident manufacturers, 
the value of which is L. 2916, 13s. 4d., and the sum given for 
weaving which, is about L. 612, 10s. The price of all the weav- 
ing at l|d. per yard is L. 1292, Is. 8d. The number of weavers 
of all ages in the parish is 89, of whom 27 are males and 12 are fe- 
males, and there are 19 winders all females. The average income 
of each of the weavers is about 7s. per week throughout the year; 
good hands from 9s. to 10s. They work about fourteen hours per day. 
A winder receives 6d. per day when employed, but the employ- 
ment is not constant. Since the introduction of machinery the 
spinning-wheel has been almost entirely laid aside, as no adequate 
remuneration for labour can be procured by it. There is but one 
in operation in the parish, and that one only occasionally, 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish. The 
nearest is Cupar, which is distant from the centre of the parish 
about five miles. 

Villages. — There are two villages, Luthrie and Brunton, which 
are pleasantly situated, and at the distance of a mile from each 
other. The former contains a population of 145, and the latter 



652

of 91. The inhabitants are chiefly weavers and other handicraft 
tradesmen. In the village of Luthrie are a brewery, a bakehouse, 
a small public-house, a meal-mill, and a barley-mill. 

Means of Communication. — There is a regular communication 
with Cupar, which is the nearest post-town, on Thursdays and Sa- 
turdays, and with Dundee, on Fridays, by carriers of small parcels. 
A turnpike road, between the ferries of Pettycur and Newport, 
passes through the parish on the south, and along by its southern 
boundary about a mile and a half, and the turnpike from Cupar 
to Perth intersects it on the south-west. A statute labour road 
leads on from the ferry turnpike through the parish eastward to 
Balraerino, and another leads off from it at Luthrie westwards, 
and on through the barony of Balenbreich to Newburgh. The 
length of the former in the parish is 2 miles 450 yards, and of 
the latter 1 mile 160 yards. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which is a new and 
handsome edifice, was first opened for public worship on the 
16th December 1832. It is situated on a small eminence above 
the village of Luthrie, near to the greater part of the popu- 
lation, and not above two miles from the most distant. It was 
built to contain 252 sittings. These were divided among the 
heritors according to their valued rents, and the division was 
sanctioned by the sheriff. The heritors, after having accommodated 
themselves with seats, gave those which remained free to their ten- 
ants, servants, and others. It would have been desirable, how- 
ever, had a considerable portion of the sittings been set apart for 
the public ; for although there would be a sufficiency of accom- 
modation were every seat well filled, yet some individuals are un- 
able to procure sittings, and there is a natural dislike to intrude 
into the seats which have previously been obtained by others. 

Legacy. — The late Mr George Davidson, schoolmaster of the 
parish, who died in "1745, bequeathed tlie sum of 450 merks 
Scots to the Session for the purpose of purchasing communion 
cups ; and two handsome plain silver cups, which were bought with 
that sum, are now used at the communion service. 

A stable has been erected near the church for the horses of 
those who choose to ride, or to come to church in their convey- 
ances, and a gig-house has been built for the accommodation ot 
the minister. 

The manse and offices were built in 1816, and are suitable and

of the parish, and at the distance of a mile from the church. The 
glebe consists of about 4| acres of thin sharp soil, and its 
yearly value is about L. 8. The stipend consists of 1 boll, 3 
firlots, and 3i Hppies, wheat ; 8 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks barley ; 
3 bolls, 1 firiot, 3| lippies meal; 6 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks, If 
lippies oats; and Ij. 209, 15s. Sgd. in money. 

There is no Dissenting chapel in the parish. The number of 
famiUes belonffino- to the Established Church is 84, and the num- 
ber of individuals of all ages belonging to the Established Church 
is 380. The number of families of Dissenters is 10. The num- 
ber of individuals of all ages of Dissenters is 45. Divine service 
at the Established Church is generally well attended. The num- 
ber of communicants at the Established Church, taking the ave- 
rage of the last seven years, is 198. 

This parish has contributed liberally for religious and charita- 
ble purposes. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in the parish. 
The usual branches of education are taught in it, and in a manner 
which reflects credit upon Mr Miller, the present schoolmaster, as 
being an able, diligent, and successful teacher. The school is 
generally attended in the winter months by about 65, and in the 
summer by about 50. The fees per quarter for English reading 
are 2s., and for writing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, 
and mathematics, 6d. each additional, and for Latin 5s. The 
children usually enter school at from four to six years of age, and 
leave it at from ten to thirteen. The people in general are alive to 
the benefits of education, and parents, in particular, are very desir- 
ous to procure a good education for their families. When, from 
poverty, any are unable to do so, the session is always ready to 
assist them, and there is none in the parish above eight years of 
age who cannot read. The schoolmaster has the legal accommo- 
dations of a dwelling-house, school-room, and garden. He has 
the maximum salary, school fees amounting to about L. 18 per 
annum, and the yearly interest of L. 2000 merks Scots. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving regular parochial aid is 5. They receive according to 
their circumstances, each usually from Is. to Is. 6d. per week, 
and each family a cart-load of coals at the beginning of winter. 
Occasional aid is always afforded to a few, and to some there is 
given merely a cart-load of coals during the year. The tenants 
and resident proprietors give the driving of all the coals gratis.

The parochial funds from which the wants of the poor are supphed 
consist of collections at church, amounting annually on an ave- 
rage of the last five years, to L. 12, Is. Id.; of proclamation 
fees, to 13s. 9d. ; of mortcloth fees, L. 1, 2s. 3d. ; and of rent of 
land and houses, and interest of money, to L. 20, 5s. lOd. ; in all, 
L. 34, 2s. 1 ld. There exists among the poor in general a laudable 
spirit of independence, which renders them reluctant to apply for 
parochial aid, and the acceptance of which they consider as de- 
grading. 

Alehouses. — There is only one in the parish, which is evidently 
necessary and quite sufficient for the accommoda:tion of the public. 

Fuel. — The common fuel is coal, which is partly driven from the 
pits at Balbirnie and Orr Bridge, a distance of from eleven to thir- 
teen miles from the centre of the parish, and partly from Bal- 
merino, a distance of five miles, -"vhither it is imported from New- 
castle and Alloa. 

The price at Balmerino of English coals is from 4s. 6d. to os. 
9d. per boll of 42 stones, or six cwt. and of Scotch coals at about 
6s. per boll of 56 stones or 8 cwt. The present price of coals at 
Balbirnie is Is. 6d. per load of 18 stones, and at Orr Bridge is 
Is. 3d. per load of 28 stones. Many of the poorer classes use 
considerable quantities of wood for fuel, which they get from the 
neighbouring plantations. 

 Of this money, L. 100 Sterling were bequeathed for behoof of the poor bj- the 
late Colonel and Mrs Baillie of Luthrie, and L. 30 by the late David Gillespie, Esq. 
of Kirkton.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. J. SIEVERIGHT, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries. — Markinch is bounded on the north, by the pa- 
rishes of Falkland and Kettle ; on the south, by Dysart and 
Wemyss ; and on the east, by Kennoway and Leven. The ge- 
neral form of the parish is quadrilateral, the lines of boundary 
being pretty regular, except on the eastern side, which is deeply 
indented by the parish of Kennoway. 

Name. — The church and village of Markinch are situated on 
the summit and declivity of a gentle eminence, which, at a remote 
period, has, doubtless, been surrounded by water, but in more re- 
cent times, by a deep morass, which, though now drained, and in 
many parts covered with buildings, may still be distinctly traced 
throughout its original extent. If it is considered, then, that, at 
the commencement of the present era, the whole country was co- 
vered with a dense and impenetrable forest, — the appropriateness 
of the name will be sufficiently apparent, Mark or Mcerk, in the 
language of Scandinavia, signifying a. forest, and Ynys or Insch, in 
ancient Celtic, an island. — hence the Celto-Pictish name Markinch 
or " Island of the Forest."f 

Within the insular limits we have thus described, are included 
the knoll or eminence on which the church stands, towards the 
south ; and Markinch hill, towards the north ; — the two being con- 
nected by a sloping ridge, along the summit and sides of which, the 
primitive habitations were necessarily constructed ; but since the

nium, fines terrae— but both, we apprehend, are derived from Mark, sylva, as the ra- 
dical word— forests in ancient times often forming the principal boundaries between 
different countries and states, and their minor territorial subdivisions. This is one of the 
few words, which, with little variation in sound or orthography, are found in most 
languages, ancient and modern. West. Goth. Mark, Marke, sylva, nota, limes. Fin.

drainage of the marshy ground in the neighbourhood, the village 
has extended itself on all sides, and now contains a population of 
1300 inhabitants. Being neither a royal burgh, however, nor 
burgh of barony, its annually chosen magistracy is but a nominal 
thing ; while want of funds, and much more of the authority neces- 
sary to levy an assessment, has hitherto prevented the adoption of 
those measures of internal police and embellishment, which are 
really indispensable to the health and comfort of a crowded and 
increasing population. 

Extent. — The extent of the parish is about 6 miles in length by 
5 in breadth. Its superficial area may be estimated at 10,200 im- 
perial acres. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general aspect of the country 
is varied and picturesque. From the Lomond Hills, as a back- 
ground on the north, it slopes gently toward the south and east. 
The parish is intersected by four fertile valleys, watered by as 
many streams, which unite towards the eastern extremity. The 
valleys are separated by corresponding ridges of low hills ; each 
chain rising gradually above the other in the direction of the sum- 
mit level. Nor are thriving and extensive plantations wanting to 
heighten the natural beauties of the landscape, — and the varied 
succession of hill and dale. The proportion of wood is conside- 
rable, and being principally of the ornamental kind, and in the vi- 
cinity of gentlemen's seats and villas, it is so disposed as to pro- 
duce the most favourable effect. 

Geology. — In this department we shall confine ourselves to a 
plain statement of facts, abstaining as much as possible from spe- 
culative conclusions, and avoiding all reference to conflicting theo- 
ries. 

We first notice the remarkable range of low hills, composed of 
fine sand and water-worn stones, skirting the northern side of the 
valley of the Leven. These hills vary in height, generally ac- 
cording to their distance from the course of the stream, or lowest 
level. Those of them that are isolated and detached, form an 
acute angle with the axis of the valley ; that is, supposing the 
valley of the Leven to run in a south-easterly direction, the emi- 
nences in question extend lengthways, almost due east and west. 
The southern slope will be found to be in almost all instances 
very gradual, while the declivity towards the north is as invariably 
bold and abrupt. Hence, if our observations are correct, we think 



MARK INCH. 



the conclusion obvious, that these elevations have been generated 
by the action of a tidal wave, ascending in the direction of Loch 
Leven, and having a lateral action diverging from the Frith of 
Forth, as the central line of direction of the great tidal stream. 
Hazarding tlie opinion, that these hills were formed by the action 
of an ebbing and flowing current, we find undeniable proofs of 
marine agency in the marl beds which lie within a few feet of the 
surface, at the distance of less than a mile from the parish church. 
These beds vary in thickness from 3 to 4 feet, and consist en- 
tirely of marine shells, among which the Mytilus, Buccinum, and 
Cardium aculeatum predominate. In connection with this fact, 
we have to notice the incredible numbers of water worn-boulders, 
of all sizes and dimensions, found upon and near the surface, or 
imbedded in the diluvial clay of which the subsoil is composed. 
These rolled masses comprehend most varieties of the primitive 
rocks, among which, basalt, greenstone, and porphyry predomi- 
nate. Granite, gneiss, and micaceous schist are next in the order 
of abundance. None of these rocks are found in situ for many 
miles, and then only in a westerly direction. The clay in which 
these boulders are imbedded, is nearly, if not altogether, devoid 
of organic remains, while their appearance clearly betrays long 
exposure to the action of a powerful current. Whence, and in 
what manner, these boulders were brought into their present po- 
sition, and in such incredible numbers, it is difficult to conjecture ; 
unless we may suppose that they have been transported thither 
by a powerful current flowing from the westward, continuous in 
duration, rather than of the nature of a sudden and transient erup- 
tion. This conjecture derives countenance from the fact, that 
the boulders are imbedded in the clay at various depths, and that 
those of them that belong to the trap family, differ very materially 
in their character, from the great trap vein or dike by which the 
parish is intersected from east to west, and which is of the por- 
phyritic kind, spotted with nodules of sulphuret of iron, and with 
micaceous laminae. This remarkable dike is traceable from the 
Leven, about a mile south of the village, intersecting the Balgo- 
nie coal-field, in a straight line to Kingsdale, near Kennowly, 
where it is protruded. At the .point where it crosses the Balbir- 
nie coal basin, near Plasterer's Inn, it is said to form a solid 
compact mass, 30 feet in thickness. In approaching the trap, 
the coal is thrown up in a remarkable manner, till at last it is cut 
off altogether. A bore carried down to the depth of 100 yards

on the south side of the dike, traversed successive beds of clay, 
sand, and gravel, but no indications of coal or of rock of any kind 
were discovered. The trap is projected through the great bed of 
sandstone, on which the whole of this part of the country reposes. 

Sandstone. — The consistency of this rock varies from a minute 
breccia to the utmost degree of fineness and hardness ; the colour 
from a deep yellow to the purest white. The colouring matter is 
derived from iron in a state of chromate, with which the superin- 
cumbent soil is strongly impregnated. The dip of the sandstone 
beds seems to depend almost entirely on accidental circumstances. 
The strata are found in all positions from the horizontal to the 
vertical. In many instances, it is found in what the quarrymen 
term binearts, that is, in solid cone-shaped masses of immense di- 
jnensions, unstratified, and without cleavage in any direction. In 
this state, on being broken up, the surfaces often present a blis- 
tered or sintry appearance. But this is peculiar to the fine-grain- 
ed and harder qualities of the sandstone. The coarser sort is re- 
gularly stratified in layers of uniform thickness, easily separated by 
means of the wedge and lever. It is in this kind that organic re- 
mains are almost exclusively found. These remains consist of 
cacti, and trunks of trees protruded perpendicularly ; the roots re- 
posing sometimes on the coal beds below, but for the most part 
without trace of branches or leaves. Impressions, however, of the 
bark, branches, and leaves of trees are not unfrequent on the sur- 
face of the strata. 

Organic Remains. — With regard to fossils, we may state that 
vegetable remains are found in the greatest abundance and va- 
riety in the softer bituminous and harder shales, and in the slate 
clays. They comprehend principally impressions of the leaves and 
stems of plants, and are common, we believe, to the whole coal- 
field on the eastern shores of Fife. 

Mineralogy. — Besides the concrete and stratified rocks already 
briefly enumerated, the department of mineralogy supplies speci- 
mens of rock crystal containing various extraneous substances. 
Crystals of quartz of great beauty are occasionally found in the 
sandstone and trap rocks ; to these may be added, though more 
rarely, nodules of agate, carnelian, chalcedony, and jasper. 
Ironstone.— Ivomtone is found in the parish in great abundance.

gy of the East Coast of Fife. Transactions of the Higlilntxl and Agricultural Society

Soon after the publication of the last Statistical Report, a company 
from Newcastle, projected an iron-work on the Balgonie estate. 
Much expense was incurred, and the scheme had a sufficient trial, 
but ultimately proved unsuccessful, and the enterprising indivi- 
duals engaged in it suffered considerable loss. It has long since 
been abandoned. The stone, however, containing in some por- 
tions as much as 80 per cent, ore, has frequently been exported 
to the Tyne for smelting. At present the working of it inter- 
feres with a seam of coal, and is entirely suspended. 

Balbii'rde Coal. — The coal so denominated lies on both banks 
of the Leveu, principally on the estate of Balbirnie, but partly in 
the lands of Rothes and Coull, in one continuous seam. A por- 
tion of the field belonging to the Earl of Rothes has at different 
times been leased to the proprietor of Balbirnie, who possesses pecu- 
liar advantages for working it, as the greater portion of the coal that 
is level free, and also more than half the under level, are in the Bal- 
birnie estate. This coal was wrought at a very remote period, but 
not extensively, previously to the year 1730, — when the nature of 
the field was more accurately ascertained by means of bores, — 
proceeding from the old wastes in the direction of the river, from 
whence a mine carried across the metals, rendered the field level 
free to a very considerable extent. In fact, no other means of 
drainage seems to have been resorted to for a period of forty years, 
during which time upwards of 365,000 tons of coals are computed 
to have been raised and sold. The Balbirnie coal is now drained 
by means of water-engines on the Leven ; that on Coull by a 
steam-engine. 

The field is somewhat irregular in shape, but approaches most 
nearly the figure of an ellipse or horse-shoe. It is what is called 
a Trough Coal. The dip of the Balbirnie seams is very irregu- 
lar. On the east side it is sometimes 45°, on the west 12°. The 
seams are three in number, and in thickness as follows : — Is, Up- 
per coal, a soft cherry, 1 foot 6 inches ; 2d, Main seam, cherry 
and splint, 4 feet 6 inches ; 3c:, Under coal, cherry, 2 feet. 

The following is a section of the strata passed through in sink-

But the strata vary in thickness, as well as the coal scams, at 
different points in the field. In general the depths from the sur- 
face to the different seams may be set down as follows: — From 
surface to upper seam, 17 fathoms; to main coal, 23 do.; to 
under coal, 30 do. 

At Balbirnie the engine is erected on the main seam, with a 
draft of 25 fathoms, two fathoms being cut below the coal for what 
is called a sump or well, so that there are no shafts 30 fathoms 
deep. Cuts are carried right and left from the bottom of the shaft 
to the upper and under seams, the depth being 25 fathoms, or 50 
yards, as noted above. This engine stands on the lowest part of 
the seam, the coal rising on either side of it. The whole field is 
thus rendered accessible to the miner, if we except about twenty 
acres of the lower seam, which can only be drained by an addi- 
tion of power to the water-engine, and by sinking the shaft seven 
fathoms deeper. Various bores have been made with a view to the 
discovery of new seams of coal, but without success. One in par- 
ticular, from the pavement of the main coal, near the centre of 
the coal-field, was carried down to the depth of 67 feet 4 inches, 
till interrupted by a bed of stone, so hard, that in a whole week 
only six inches were bored through, and the attempt was, there- 
fore, relinquished. 

The average price of Balbirnie coal may be stated at 8s. per 
ton ; but the price varies according to the quality. 

The colliers, in addition to their daily earnings, are allowed a 
free house and garden. Coals for their own use are charged to 
them at the hewing rate. The following table will give a compa- 
rative view of the rate of wages for the years specified. We pre- 
mise that a single collier is reckoned to hew at an average ten 
loads per diem.

Dislocations and Obstructions.— The trap dike by which the 
Balbirnie coal-field is intersected, has already been noticed under 
the section of Geology, as well as its effects in throwing up and cut- 
ting off the coal seams. A similar vein of trap cuts off the coal to 
the north of Coull engine. Occasional hitches are met with in all 
parts of the field, raising or depressing the strata, but without offer- 
ing any very serious obstacles to the operations of the miner. 
The upper coal being only 18 inches in thickness, and the diffi- 
culty of sufficiently enlarging the galleries, from the nature of the 
strata in immediate contact with it, being very considerable, the 
men suffer severely from a confined and hampered position, and 
from bad air, so that their general health and appearance are there- 
by, in process of time, sensibly affected. Asthma and consump- 
tion are the complaints to which they are most liable, and at the 
age of thirty many of them look old men. Formerly, when en- 
gaged on the main seam, many reached the ages of sixty, seventy, 
and eighty. Now, what with the thin seams, bad air, and an un- 
guarded use of ardent spirits, it is rare to find an old man among 
them. 

Balgonie Coal, the property of James Balfour, Esq. of Whit- 
tingham, has been worked for centuries. In the old valuation of 
the county in the year 1517, Coaltoun is mentioned as one of " the 
pertinents" of Balgonie. The waste may be traced for several 
miles along the line of bearing, and the coals have been exhausted 
in the same direction to a depth of 14 fathoms, as far as the free 
level admitted. In 1731, a water engine was erected, which drain- 
ed the coal to the depth of 30 fathoms, but in succeeding years, 
this engine was overpowered by the increased accumulation of water 
from hitches, and the tacksman to whom the field had been leased 
substituted a windmill farther on the crop. Operations were car- " 
ried on in this way till the year 1743, when it was found impos- 
sible any longer to compete in the market with the Balbirnie 
coals, and the working was consequently relinquished. This sus- 
• pension continued for more than forty years, till at last, in 1785, 
more powerful engines were erected, and the coal throughout the 
whole field rendered accessible to the former depth of 30 fathoms, 
but still only reaching to the 9 feet or upper seam. This coal is 
presently worked at Thornton, near the bridge of Orr, by steam 
power. The Balgonie is known to be a continuation of the Dy- 
sart coal. The strata dip towards the south-east, and consequent- 
ly crop out in north-westerly direction, at an angle of from 25° to

21°, or a rise of I in 2| or 3 ; but the angle varies at different 
points; in the field at Thornton, for instance, the rise is only 
or about 1 in 8. 

There are two seams of coal along the whole line of bearing; the 
depth on the level is from 25 to 35 fathoms to the first, or what is 
comrrionly called the 9 feet seam, which consists of

are 13 feet wide, and the pillars 15 feet; the width of the rooms 
contracting on neariiig the crop, or where the roof is msecure. 

The average number of colliers employed may be stated at .30. 
They are paid at the rate of 2id. per load of 20 stones Dutch, for 
large coal, which sells at Is. per load. The small coal costs l|d. 
per load for hewing, and sells at 6d. The sale was originally con- 
fined to the country demand, but latterly the manufactories on the 
Leven and Orr waters, and in Kirkaldy, have drawn their supplies 
from hence. With more po.werful engines for drawing off the 
water, the coal seams on Balgonie may be regarded as inexhaust- 
ible, as they dip to the east, and are never found to rise to the sur- 
face in a direction opposite to the line of bearing. 

TI. — Civil History. 
Antiquities.— Markinch Hill — This remarkable hill, on the 
southern slope of which the village is partly built, is an object 
alike interesting to the geologist and the antiquary. It is com- 
posed of a fine sand, intermixed with water-worn stones, and rises 
to the height of about 100 feet above the level ground in the vi- 
cinity, extending in a continuous ridge from east to west about 300 
yards. At either extremity it sinks abruptly, and is flanked by two 
smaller eminences, that to the west terminating in the marshy 
ground along the line of Balbirnie Park wall, while that on the 
east is separated from Dalginch Law by a deep and narrow ravine, 
through which Balbirnie burn flows. The southern slope of the 
hill is sufficiently gradual, but on the northern side it is naturally 
precipitous, and has been rendered more so by the labours of art. 
The whole of this side of the hill from the base upwards is cut 
into terraces, which seem to have been continued round its extre- 
mities. On that towards the east, indeed, they may be still dis- 
tinctly traced, but towards the west they are obliterated, the hill 
having been cut down, partly to allow a passage for the road, and 
partly for the purpose of obtaining sand and gravel. These ter- 
races, six in number, are of an average breadth of 20 feet, and rise 
each above the other in regular gradation from 10 to 12 feet. 
They overlook a level field .of about twelve acres, which, before 
being drained, must have formed an impassable morass. There is 
no very definite tradition why or when these terraces were formed. 
The most probable conclusion is, that they are the work of the 
Roman invaders, who, under Agricola, overran this part of the 
country, covering it with entrenchments and fortifications, as a

basis for more distant operations. For advancing this opinion in 
preference to any other, our reasons are briefly these : — \st. In a 
military point of view, and according to the modes of warfare then 
in use, the position is one of the strongest which the whole coun- 
try affords. The natural advantages of its situation, indeed, must 
have rendered it nearly impregnable with but a handful of defen- 
ders, while, as a fortified camp, it was capable of receiving several le- 
gions. Idly, It forms one of a chain of similar fastnesses, most 
advantageously situated for commanding the surrounding country, 
for mutual support, and for keeping up a direct communication 
with the coast and with the interior. Qcl, The extent of the works 
above described, the great amount of labour and industry required 
for their completion, and, above all, their form and regularity, so 
little in unison with the rude and desultory habits of the aborigi- 
nal inhabitants, and so unsuited to their savage modes of wai&amp;re; 
while in all these respects they very exactly characterize the en- 
terprise and skill of their invaders, and their superior advancement 
in the art of defensive warfare. 

Maiden Castle.- At the eastern extremity of the parish, and in 
the immediate vicinity of the village of Ken noway, are to be seen 
the vestiges of ancient fortifications, running along a narrow but 
somewhat elevated ridge of sand-hills, commanding the surround- 
ing plain. In the case of an invasion from seaward this would na- 
turally have been regarded as the first defensible position, being 
scarcely two miles from the mouth of the Leven, and forming the 
key to the interior of the country towards the north and west. 
Whether the Scots, Romans, or Danes were its first occupants it 
is now impossible to determine. That it has been the scene of 
some bloody conflict is evident from the number of stone-coffins 
containing human bones, that have been dug up in the immediate 
neighbourhood. Farther westward, in the direction of Markinch, 
weapons of war, peculiar to the Romans, have from time to time 
been found. The highest point of the ridge in question rises to 
the height of perhaps 80 feet above the small stream which runs at 
the foot of it. On this knoll, the Pretorium or citadel, known by 
the name of the Maiden Castle, has stood. Its form has been 
that of a square, and it measures about 30 paces across. Accord- 
ing to Boethius, this was a castle of Macduff, Thane of Fife. His 
description of it is sufficiently precise, and is valuable as the only 
plausible record concerning a spot, that has once evidently been of 
some importance. " Supersunt inter Divi Kenethi templum et

Levenam amnem, eadem in regione, arcis septemvallis olim septae 
totidemque fossis uti nunc est videre, vestigia ; ubi hujus clarissi- 
mi viri post eum vita functum posteritas longa secula habitavit." 
Dalginch, which Hes to the east of the village of Markinch, at 
the distance of a quarter of a mile, is the reputed site of another 
of Macduff's castles. Its more modern name is Brunton,-|- and a 
subterraneous opening from the present house, but which has long 
been closed, is said, in popular tradition, to communicate with the 
Maiden Castle above-mentioned, which is distant in a straight line 
between two and threa miles. The supposition is too absurd to 
admit of being reasoned upon. However, that, at a comparatively 
recent period, Dalginch was a place of considerable note, will ap- 
pear by the following extract from the Ancient Digest of Scottish 
Laws, known by the name of Jtegiam Majestatem, ascribed, we 
believe, to the usurper Macbeth.

Family Seats. — The most ancient residence of note in the pa- 
rish is the Castle of Balfour or Bal-orr, so designated from its si- 
tuation near the confluence of the Orr and the Leven. It was 
originally the seat of the family of Balfour, who thence derive their 
name, — one of the most ancient and respectable in Fife. About 
the year 1360, John de Bethune, described as " familiaris regis 
Roberti," married the daughter and heiress of Sir Michael de 
Balfour of that Ilk, and with her obtained the estate of Balfour. 
The Bethunes are undoubtedly of French extraction, and are re- 
puted to derive their name from Bethune, a considerable town in 
French Flanders. They came into England with William the 
Conqueror. One of them was the companion of Richard Coeur 

• Boeth. Hist. Lib. x. fol. 206. 

t Now called Barnslee, the seat of Mrs Colonel Paston. 

X In the edition of the Regiam Mnjestalem, anno 1606, the following note is in- 
scribed in the margin :— " N. B. Terrs de Dalginche pertinebant olim Jacobo Cock- 
burn, tempore Jacobi II. Regis, nunc dicuntur terra de Bruntoun, et per Wardlaw 

dominum de Torrie possidentur et sunt contigufE terris de Markinche." How long 

Dalginche continued a principal seat of justice we have no means of ascertaining j 
probably as long as the Thanes of Fife maintained an independent jurisdiction. 
Markinche must have been a place of some note as late as 1296, in which year it was 
visited by Edward I. in his progress from St Andrews to Stirling, as we Jearn from 
the Diary of his expedition, Cott. Coll. in old French, quoted apud Tytlcr, Hist, 
of Scotland, Vol, i. his first stage being Markinch, and his next Dunfermline.

tie Lion during his return from the Holy Land, and was made 
prisoner along with him by the Duke of Austria, Duchesne in 
his " Histoire de la Maison de Bethune," derives the Scotch 
branch from a certain Jacobin de Bethune, who, he says, came to 
Scotland about 1448; but there are authentic documents to prove 
that the family were settled in this country as far back as 1165. 
Those of them whose names are most distinguished in history are 
James Beaton, Archbishop, first of Glasgow, and afterwards of 
St Andrews, and Chancellor of the kingdom. St Mary's or New 
College, founded in 1537, remains a monument of this prelate's 
munificence and zeal for learning. He died in 1538, and was suc- 
ceeded by his nephew, David Beaton, Cardinal, Legatus a latere, 
and Chancellor, assassinated by Norman Lesley and his associates, 
May 3d 1546. A nephew of the Cardinal, James Beaton, was 
elevated to the see of Glasgow. Our limits do not permit us to 
enter at greater length into the annals of this ancient and honour- 
able house. It may not, however, be deemed superfluous to re- 
mavk, that the estate of Balfour has been transmitted, in the di- 
rect line of hereditary succession, for the space of 480 years, and 
in the direct male line for upwards of four centuries. 

Westward from Balfour, and on a steep bank overhanging the 
Leven, stands the ancient baronial Castle of Balgonie. The most 
ancient part of this venerable structure consists of a donjo7i or keep, 
80 feet in height, and 45 feet by 36 over walls. The basement 
story, dimly lighted by a single narrow slit in the massive thickness 
of the walls, seems to have served as a prison. It is vaulted, as 
well as the storey above. The summit is surrounded by slightly 
projecting battlements, with circular tourelles at the angles. The 
roof is flat, and paved with square slabs of freestone. On the ter- 
race thus formed, and several feet within the external battlements, 
on three of the sides is erected a lodge of an oblong form, with 
chimnies and sloping roof, serving probably in former times as a 
corps de garde for the garrison. Along the bank, looking north- 
ward, the first Earl of Leven erected a house of three stories, 
communicating with the tower, and a wing fronting east was ad- 
ded by one of his successors, but, from the unusual solidity of the 
substructions, and from the range of cellars which they compre- 
hend, in structure evidently far from modern, it is to be conjectur- 
ed, that buildings equal in extent originally occupied the site of 
the present edifice, constituting, as now, two sides of a qua- 
drangle ; the other two sides being formed by a strong wall of ma- 



MAUKINCH. 



667 



sonry. The space thus enclosed forms an oblong area of 108 
feet by G5. The main entrance into the court is by an arched 
gateway, flanked on each side by towers, which bear marks of hav- 
ing been at one time provided with battlements and machieoulis. 
Over the arch are the remains of a chamber, communicating with 
the tower by a narrow passage conducted in the thickness of the 
wall. The castle has once been surrounded on three sides by a 
deep fosse, and a strong rampart of earth. On the side of the 
river no defence was needed other than the inaccessible nature of 
its position. With all these stern appliances and means to pro- 
voke assault and to resist aggression, history records no tale of 
siege sustained, nor doughty feats of arms performed under its 
walls, or within the fair and ample domain by which it is surround- 
ed, — nor are its precincts stained by any of those deeds of blood 
or torture which throw an interesting gloom over so many similar 
monuments of feudal times. The earliest proprietors of Balgony, 
of whom there is any record, are the Sibbalds. It afterwards pass- 
ed by intermarriage to a cadet of the family of Lundin. In the 
reign of Charles I. the lands of Balgonie were purchased by Ge- 
neral Alexander Leslie, who was created .Earl of Leven by that 
hapless monarch, with succession to heirs-general of his body, 
lawfully begotten. Owing to the failure of male heirs in the per- 
son of Alexander, third Earl of Leven, the title and estates de- 
volved to his sister, Lady Catherine Leslie, who was married to 
the second son of the then Earl of Melville, and became Countess of 
Leven in her own right. By the death of his elder brother, the Lord 
Raith, her husband succeeded to his paternal title and inheritance, 
thus uniting the two earldoms in one family. In 1823, the beau- 
tiful and extensive estate of Balgonie was purchased for the sum of 
L. 104,000, by James Balfour, Esq. of Whittingham, brother of 
the late General Balfour of Balbirnie, who, it is understood, de- 
signs to rebuild the castle, at present fast hastening to decay, on a 
scale answerable to his ample fortune, and the ancient grandeur of 
the pile. 

The principal seat of the Balfours was the castle of that name, 
as already mentioned. They reckon their descent from the time 
of King Duncan, and their names appear as sheriffs of Fife, and 
as present at successive Parliaments, down to the reign of Robert 
II. The ancestor of the Balbirnie branch was a cadet of Balfour 
of that Ilk ; who, having married a daughter of Thomas Sibbald 
of Balgonie, obtained with her a grant of the lands of Dovan, in 



668 



FIFESHIRE. 



the reign of Robert III. One of his descendants having obtained 
a charter of the lands of Lalethan from Lundin of that Ilk in 1576, 
was designed of Lalethan, and afterwards of Balbirnie, acquired 
by purchase from a family of the same name. 

Balbirnie House, now the property of John Balfour, Esq., is 
situated about a mile to the west of the parish church. The house 
is an elegant modern structure, erected by the late General Bal- 
four. The principal entrance, which is on the south front, is by 
a handsome portico, formed by columns of the Ionic order, with 
corresponding pilasters. The whole materials were drawn from 
freestone quarries on the estate. The house is pleasantly situated 
in a romantic hollow, sheltered from every wind that blows by those 
detached and gently undulating eminences, which form so remar- 
kable a feature in the scenery of the vale of Leven. These heights, 
clothed with some of the finest trees in the country, are rendered 
accessible on all sides by means of walks and alleys, so contrived, 
as to command at every turn varied and picturesque views of the 
surrounding country, from the Lomonds to the shores of the Frith 
of Forth, and the coast beyond. The shrubberies around the house, 
and along a small brook which meanders through the grounds on 
the east, are laid out with exquisite taste and effect, and contain, 
in great variety and profusion, such plants and shrubs, native and 
exotic, as are hardy enough to withstand the rigors of the winter. 
The park, including garden and shrubberies, extends over a sur- 
face of 200 acres. As a complete and elegant residence, Balbirnie 
is surpassed by few north of the Tweed. 

The only other residence in the parish which deserves particu- 
lar mention on account of its antiquity is Kirkforthar, the seat of 
George Johnstone Lindsay, Esq. a cadet of the noble and ancient 
family of Crawfurd. Kirkforthar formed part of the Lord Lind- 
say's ancient estate of Struthers, and became a separate branch in 
the following manner : David, Lord Lindsay of Byres, espoused 
the cause of King James III. in opposition to the views of his son, 
James IV.. who was stirred up by the confederated nobles to be- 
come their leader in a foul and unnatural rebellion. Lord Lind- 
say commanded the father's adherents. The two hostile armies 
having met at Sauchieburn, a battle took place, which issued in 
the defeat and death of the unfortunate James III. Immediately 
after, Lord Lindsay was arraigned of high treason. Although he 
was an excellent soldier, and had great experience in the service 
of foreign states, yet he was but little gifted with court phraseology, 

3 



MAR KING II. 



669 



or versed in judicial procedure, and in his defence made a cutting 
and sarcastic speech, which drew down upon him the displeasure 
of the king and of his judges. But Patrick Lindsay, his brother- 
german, who was bred a lawyer, on hearing his brother's speech, 
and witnessing its effects, craved permission to plead his cause, 
which he did with so much address, that Lord Lindsay was acquit- 
ted. The old Baron, touched with a piece of service so seasonable 
and important, immediately exclaimed, " Well spoke, Pat; for your 
pyot tongue tak' ye the mains of Kirkforthar."  

Besides the above, several families of note once made part of 
the parish aristocracy, but are now extinct, and scarce a vestige of 
their dwellings remains. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish has increased at a rapid rate during 
the last century. Wilhin the last seventy years it has considerably 
more-than doubled. As population and means of subsistence are 
intimately connected, this great local increase may be attributed, 
in a great measure, to the introduction of new branches of pro- 
ductive industry, which, by supplying regular employment, both 
retained the native population, and attracted influx from less fa- 
voured districts — emigration even of individuals being very rare. 

Years. . 1755, 1790, 1801, 1821, 1838, 
Population, 2188. 2790. 3130. 4661. 5396. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of acres under cultivation amounts 
to about 8500, 350 of which are let in small lots varying from 1 
to 10 acres, and on leases varying from one to seven years.. The 
remainder is let in about forty-three farms of various sizes. There 
are about 400 acres in feus or small holdings in perpetuity, for an an 
nual payment, varying from a merely nominal acknowledgment-to 
L.16 per imperial acre. These feus are chiefly in the villages, 
and extend from a few poles to several acres each. There are 
about 800 acres under plantations, and a moss, the only one in the 
parish from which peats are dug for fuel, may contain 100 more. 
The quantity of land held by proprietors of bleachfields and of 

 Lindsay or Lindessay was originally an Anglo-Saxon earldom in the county of 
Lincoln ; and one of the great divisions of that county bears the name of Lindsay to 
this day. The son of the Earl of Lindsay, after the fatal field of Hastings, accom- 
panied Edward Atheling into Scotland to the court of .Malcolm Canmore. The two 
principal branches or stems of this once potent family were represented — the one by 
the Earls of Crawford, the other by Lord Lindsay of the Byres, until the reign of 
Charles I. when the whole honours of the family were vested in the person of John 
tenth Lord Lindsay of the Byres, fourteenth Earl of Crawford, and first Earl of Lind- 
say. The family of Kirkforthar, bear the arms of Lord Lindsay of the Byres, Earl 
of Lindsay, and of Mure, Lord of Abercorn.

other public works, may extend to 100 acres ; the remainder, say 
300 acres, may be regarded as taken up by roads, water-courses, &amp;c. 

In order to insure greater accuracy in this important branch 
of statistical inquiry, we have divided the parish into three sec- 
tions, each of which will be found to differ from the other in va- 
rious respects : — 

1,9. That part which lies on the north bank of the Leven, em- 
bracing the highest cultivated land in the parish. In this quarter 
the soil consists of loam, gravel, or clay, resting upon a porous 
subsoil of sand and gravel ; here drainage is for the most part easy, 
so that the land is in general dry and fertile. 

2c. District lying between the Leven and the Orr. Soil, wet 
loam, sand and clay, upon a retentive subsoil, consisting of blue till, 
patches of sand, silt and stones. 

3d. District between the Orr and the boundary of the parish to 
the south and east. Soil, a thin wet loam, clay and sand, part 
moorish. Subsoil retentive stiff clay or till. 

In some parts of the second and third districts the subsoil is par- 
tially impregnated with iron immediately below the soil, forming 
a pan or crust nearly impervious to water. Where this is the case, 
the soil must be considered decidedly bad ; indeed, where it exists 
in any considerable degree, heath is the natural production. These 
soils also contain boulders in extraordinary quantities, principally 
trap, some of which are several tons in weight. In many fields of 
the same districts, and within fourteen inches of the surface, a suffi- 
cient quantity of these boulders can be obtained for filling drains 
at so small an interval as nine feet asunder. 

Drainage. — The prevailing mode of draining is that of furrow- 
drains from two and a half to three feet deep, filled with stones 
turned out in working the soil. When the materials are found in 
this way properly broken, built and packed in the drain, this me- 
thod will be found both economical and efficient, when the drains 
are on a hard bottom. Tiles are preferable where the bottom is 
soft or where stones are not plentiful, and where the water con- 
tains ochre or deposits a sediment. 

Products of the Soil. — The system generally adopted is that of 
raising grain and rearing and feeding cattle of the Fifeshire breed.

The first year's g-rass is often cut for hay. It is then sometimes 
pastured for one or more years, according to the promise of grass 
or the wants of the farmer. Supposing the lands in the parish 
divided into ten equal parts, the proportions of the various kinds 
of crop maybe estimated as under: 

Fallow or green crop, 2. Wheat,. Barley,. Grass, 3. Oats, 3. 

Pease, beans, or flax are but little cultivated. The above esti- 
mate is exclusive of the space allotted to roads, fences, water- 
courses, and pleasure grounds. 

Manures. — Bone manure is used in dry land ; rape cake has 
been tried successfully in clay and wet lands. The principal ex- 
traneous stimulant applied is lime, from Forthar, Chapel, Pitles- 
sie, or Inverteil lime-wprks. Besides the farm-yard manure, a 
considerable quantity is obtained from the neighbouring villages. 

Amount of Produce. — Adhering to the sectional divisions al- 
ready referred to, the following estimate is offered of the average 
produce per Scotch acre : First district, wheat, Q\ quarters ; bar- 
ley, 4 do. ; oats, 6 do. Second district, wheat, 4 quarters ; 
barley, 85 do. ; oats, 5 do. Third district. In the western part 
of this district, little wheat is sown ; the same is the case with re- 
gard to barley. Oats may be estimated at 5| quarters per acre. 

Leases. — The usual endurance of leases is for nineteen years. 
Farms are let by private offers, — a mode which, while it obviates 
the injurious tendency of public competition, enables the landlord 
to exercise his judgment in the selection of the tenant, with a just 
regard to the interests of both. A fixed sum of money is now al- 
most universally substituted for the antiquated, though perhaps 
more equitable, mode of rent in kind. 

Bent and Value of Land.— In consequence of the increased de- 
mand for all sorts of agricultural produce on the breaking out of 
the French Revolution, the rentals of many estates were doubled. 
At the close of the war, however, the value of farms fell from 15 
to 20 per cent. Since the practice of furrow-draining was intro- 
duced, wet-bottomed lands, such as we have described above, have 
risen considerably in value. 

Wages. — Men-servants are hired by the year from Martinmas 
to Martinmas. Married men receive of wages L. 11 Sterlinar in 
money; 6 bolls oatmeal; coals, carriage free; and from one 
Scotch pint of milk to two imperial quarts daily. They are also 
allowed a free house, with eight falls of garden ground, besides 



G72 



FIPESHIRE. 



twenty-four falls for planting potatoes. Unmarried men receive 
L. 12 Sterling per annum, lodgings, potatoes for six or seven 
months, with meal and milk as above. Female servants get from 
L. 5 to L. 6, 10s. with board and washing. 

Manufactures. — Local facilities for the establishment of all 
those branches of productive industry which require the aid of ma- 
chinery, are peculiar and numerous. The most remote part of 
the parish is but an inconsiderable distance from the coast. It is 
traversed by excellent roads in all directions, rendering communi- 
cation with the great manufacturing town of Dundee, through the 
shipping ports of Newburgh and Newport, on the one hand, and 
with Edinburgh, by Kirkaldy and Pettycur on the other, neither 
difficult nor expensive. The water power supplied by two consi- 
derable streams, the Leven and the Orr, is unlimited and inexhaust- 
ible. Coals are abundant and cheap, and excellent stone for 
building is found in all directions, and at a trifling depth below the 
surface; while seven populous villages furnish an abundance of 
hands for all those operations where manual labour is required. At 
the period of Dr Thomson's statistical return, there existed in the 
parish no machinery save what was used in corn and flax mills, of 
which there are at present in use of the former, 1, and of the lat- 
ter, 4. Since that time a class of public works has sprung up, 
which have been greatly beneficial to the industrious classes. The 
following statement is made up from the proprietors' returns, which 
have been obligingly furnished. 

Paper-Mills. — Rothes Paper- Mill was erected in 1806 by Mr 
William Keith, and worked as a two-vat mill. Some years after, 
it became the property of Mr David Lindsay, who enlarged it con- 
siderably, and latterly erected a paper machine. In 1836, it was 
purchased by Messrs R. Tullis and Co. Brown and gray wrap- 
ping-papers are the sorts now manufactured here, for which about 
25cwt. of flax waste, coarse bagging, or ropes", are used daily. Em- 
ployment is here afforded to about 20 men and 10 women. 

Auchmuty Paper-Mill was erected by Robert Tullis and Co. 
as a four vat mill, and began working in May 1810. The vats 
are now all thrown aside, the paper being made by a Fourdrinier 
machine, such as is generally used. Above a ton of fine rags is 
consumed here daily in making cartridge, coloured, printing, and 
writing papers. There are upwards of 50 women employed in 
sorting and cutting the rags, who are paid at the rate of lOd. per

day of ten hours. About the same number of men are required 
to attend the machinery, and manage the diflPerent processes, or 
engaged as wrights, carters, labourers, &amp;c. The wages of these 
latter vary from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per day. The hands at the 
Rothes Mill are remunerated at the same rate. The annual 
amount of excise duty paid by the two mills is about L. 6500 
Sterling, and, as the duty is ld. on each pound of paper, this 
gives a total of 1,040,000 lbs., or 465 tons of paper manufactured 
annually. 

Balbirnie Paper-Mill was erected in the year 1816, by the late 
Mr Alexander Grieve, and was continued with two vats and one 
engine, until 1834, when J. Grieve and Co. introduced a machine 
and four engines. The papers made here are principally for the 
London market, and consist chiefly of two kinds, the one very 
strong, such as is principally used by grocers ; and the other very 
thin and transparent, for the use of drapers and si,lk -mercers. 
The raw materials employed are, damaged yarn, flax waste, bag- 
ging and ropes, of which, when making light papers, 24 cwt., and 
when making heavy papers, 37 cwt. are consumed daily. The 
• quantity of paper manufactured yearly averages 44,000 reams, 
weighing about 560,000 lbs., or 250 tons, and contributing to the 
pubhc revenue the sum of L. 3500 per annum. The number of 
hands employed on the works are 30, of whom 16 are men, and 
14 women ; the former earn from Is. 6d. to 2s. 8d., and the lat- 
ter from lOd. to Is. Id. per day 

Woollen Manufactory— Balbirnie Bridge Factory, established 
by Mr Drysdale, 1835. The stuffs manufactured here are plaid- 
ings, blankets, and shawls. The wool employed is chiefly of Bri- 
tish growth. The carding and spinning processes are carried on, 
on the premises, by means of two roving -machines and two double 
sets of jennies of 144 and 168 spindles respectively. There are 
10 power-looms and 4 hand-looms employed, producing 3, 7, 8, 
9, and 10 qrs. widths. The average daily consumption of raw 
material is 8 stones of 24 lbs. each. The hands employed are 
27, of whom 10 are men, 11 boys, and the remainder women 
and girls. The men earn from 10s. to 16s. per week, and the 
others from 3s. 6d. to 6s. The power-loom weavers, 6 boys and 
4 girls, earn as much as Is. each per day of twelve hours. The 
articles manufactured are principally for the Glasgow market. 
I he wholesale prices are, of blankets, from 7s. to 17s. each, and" 
of plaidings, from lOd. to Is. 3d. per yard. .

Linen Manufactorij.-YvQv'xous to the year 1810, the brown 
linen manufactory of this parish was hmited to some 50 or 60 
operatives, who sold their Silesias and window-blind Hollands to 
the merchants at Auchtermuchty and Kettle, from whom the 
yarns were generally purchased. The yarns chiefly used were 
hand-spun, the produce of Scotland and Ireland, with some Ger- 
man yarns imported from Hamburgh; but in a few years this 
branch of the linen trade very much declined, and was at last al- 
most entirely relinquished. About the year 1804, the manufac- 
ture of Dowlas, sheetings, and various kinds of towellings, was in- 
troduced from bleached, mill, and spun flax, and tow yarns, and 
this branch of the trade has continued to increase, till it now em- 
ploys from 800 to 900 individuals, including winders, warpers, 
weavers, and lappers. The hands thus employed do not all be- 
long to Markinch. The work is given out to be performed at 
their own homes, and many of them reside in the adjoining pa- 
rishes. During the summer months, nearly a third part of the 
weavers go to out-door work, and return to the loom when wmter 
sets in. Steady workmen, at the present rates, will earn at 
Dowlas weaving about 7s.; at sheetings, 8s.; and at towellings, 
9s. per week. The winders are chiefly old and infirm persons, 
or married females who have time to spare from their domestic 
duties ; they earn from Is. to 4s. ; warpers a-ud lappers, 10s. 
per week. The whole of this branch is in the hands of Mr 
Robert Inglis. 

Flax Spinning-Mill— \gome mills, the property of Messrs 
Baxter and Stewart, for spinning flax and tow. The works com- 
mand the entire use of the Leven, and the machinery is dnwn 
by two water-wheels of fifty-five horse-power. 1. For flax spm- 
ning, dry or long staple, there are twenty frames, containing 1000 
spindles, with a full system of screw-gill preparation to corre- 
spond. The size of the yarn spun is from H to 3 pounds per 
spindle, or, in other words, from 30 to 16 lea yarn. 2. For flax 
spinning, wet or broken staple, there are eighteen frames, contam- 
ing 1170 spindles, with full system of circular-gill preparation for 
the same. The size of the yarn spun is from 12 ounces to half a 
pound per spindle, or from 30 to 60 lea yarn. 3. For tow spui- 
ning, there are three systems of spinning, each with suitable 
preparation, including twelve 6 feet carding engines, viz. five franies, 
296 spindles, for spinning yarn from 2 to 3 pounds per spindle,

or 24 to 16 lea ; ten frames, 400 spindles, for spinning yarn from 
3i to 6 pounds per spindle, 14 to 8 lea ; four franaes, 160 spindles, 
for spinning yarn from 10 pounds to 24 pounds per spindle, 3 to 
2 lea. The principal buildings of which the mills are composed 
form three sides of a rectangle, 160 feet by 140. Two of the 
sides are occupied by machinery, and the third is occupied by 
three spacious warehouses, with heckling rooms above. There is 
a large store warehouse detached, capable of holding 200 tons of 
flax, as well as large conveniences in the way of stabling, smithy, 
and gas-work. There are about 265 individuals employed at the 
mills, of whom about 95 are full grown men, 120 women, and 46 
of both sexes under seventeen years of age. The wages paid 
each fortnight are about L.200, averaging say 12s. per week for 
each man, and 5s. per week for each woman and for the younger 
hands. The quantity of flax manufactured in the year 1838 was 
475 tons, of which 340 tons was Baltic flax, 65 tons Archangel, 
and the remaining 70 tons Dutch, French, and Irish. Besides 
the tows from these flaxes, about 100 tons of imported tow were 
used. The total cost of the whole material was above L.25,000. 

The yarns spun are, with the exception of the heavier tow 
yarns, either sold in the district adjoining, or exported to France. 
The heavier tow yarns are manufactured by the proprietors into can- 
vas, sacking, &amp;c. chiefly for the Ijondon market. This branch of the 
business is carried on in Dundee, and at present employs from 60 
to 100 looms; but arrangements are at present making for transfer- 
ring it to Balgonie ; and when this is eff'ected, it will cause an ad- 
dition to the number of persons already employed of about 100 
men, and 50 women and children. 

The village of Miltown, adjoining the mills, has, since the en- 
largement and extension of the works in 1836-37, nearly doubled 
its population. The present population is 580. The houses are, 
in general, ueat, substantial, and fully beyond the average of the 
country as to comfort. The rent of a house of two rooms, with a 
few falls of garden ground and a pig-stye, is from L.2 to L.2, 10s. 
per annum. 

Haugh Spirining-Mill was erected in the year 1794, for the 
purpose of spinning chiefly canvas yarns from flax and tow, which 
was carried on by various companies up to 1 832, when the pre- 
sent proprietor sold all the old machinery, and introduced a com- 
plete set of new, for spinning fine yarns adapted for home made li- 
nens. Half the machinery works upon the long staple, and half upon

the short staple principle. An addition was made to the work in 1835, 
and the mill now contains upwards of 2000 spindles, capable of 
turning off about 600 spindles of yarns per day. The machinery 
is propelled by two water-wheels of about 40 horse-power. The 
mill consumes from 25 to 30 tons of flax per month, consisting 
chiefly of the finer qualities imported from Holland, Belgium, and 
France, and also from Archangel, Riga, and St Petersburg. 
The yarns are for the most part wove in the county of Fife, into 
almost all descriptions of family linens. 

Haugh Bleachjield.— In 1836, there was added to the mills a 
bleachfield, capable of bleaching about two tons of linen yarn daily. 
The work-people employed at the mill and bleachfield are in num- 
ber 183, of whom two-thirds are females from fourteen years of age 
and upwards, earning from 4s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per week. The men 
earn from 9s. to L.l weekly. Most of the hands are accommo- 
dated with dwelling-houses on the premises. Upwards of twenty 
families are thus accommodated, besides a good many board- 
ers; the whole may be estimated at an average of 280 to 320 
souls. Their moral and religious character is generally good, 
and their attendance at church very respectable, both in point of 
numbers and of outward deportment. 

Lochfy Bleachjield, on the water of Lochty, in the vicinity of 
the new and thriving village of Thornton, is the property of David 
Landale, Esq. Kirkaldy. About two tons and a-half of linen yarn 
are bleached at this field per day, the greater part of which is ma- 
nufactured into cloth in the county ; but part is exported to 
France, and some sent to Ireland. At this field the residuum of 
the chlorine stills is converted by the usual process into carbonate 
of soda, and mixed with potash, as a detergent for the yarns. 
From 80 to 100 hands, mostly women, are employed at this 
bleachfield. The women are paid 5s. 6d., and the men 10s. to 

12s. per week. -r. u j 

Balgonie Bleachjield, the property of Messrs William Russell and 
Co. was established in 1824, for bleaching hnen yarns. About 480 
tons of flax and tow yarns are bleached here annually. The num- 
ber of hands employed is 70, who are paid at the same rate as at 
the other bleachfields. The machinery is worked by water-power 
supplied by the Leven, on the banks of which the works are si- 

tuated. ,  ij 

Rothes Bleachjield, the property of Mr D. Donaldson, was 
erected in 1800. The quantity of yarn bleached on an average

is as follows : From December to March, inclusive, 292 tons ; 
from April to November, inclusive, 390 tons. The number of 
hands employed is — of men, 30; women and girl§, 80. The men 
earn from 10s. to lis. per week; women and girls, 3s. 6d., 4s. 6d., 
5s. 6d., according to age and capability. 

Besides the above public works, there is a very extensive grain 
distillery at Cameron Bridge; and there has lately been establish- 
ed at Thornton a vitriol manufactory, for supplying with that ar- 
ticle the surrounding districts, which, previous to this erection, 
were subjected to the expense of carriage from Glasgow. The 
works at Thornton are a branch of a Glasgow firm extensively en- 
gaged in the vitriol manufacture. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — According to an entry in the " Great Re- 
gister Book" of the Priory of St Andrews, the church of Markinch 
was given to the Culdees by Malduinus, the son of Gillander, se- 
venth Bishop of that See, who flourished in the early part of the 
tenth century. " Malduinus Episcopus St Andrese dedit eis eccle- 
siam de Markinch cum tota terra." It seems to be a fact suffi- 
ciently well authenticated, both by records and histories of the pe- 
riod, that the first Bishops were themselves Cuidees, and elected 
from among the general body of pastors by a majority of votes. 
But as the influence of these holy men became gradually under- 
mined by the emissaries of Rome, and the insidious abettors of Pa- 
pal domination, they were stript, one by one, of their privileges and 
possessions, and finally ceased to exist as a distinct and influential 
body in the church. At what time they ceased to hold possession 
of the cure and lands of Markinch, we have no means of ascertain- 
ing very precisely ; but, by a deed of Eugenius, son of Hugo, a 
second son of Gillemichael M'Duff", fourth Earl of Fife, we find 
it was mortified to the Priory of St Andrews, towards the close of 
the twelfth century. This deed was confirmed by a charter of 
King William. From this period the patronage of the parish con- 
tinued vested in the Priory of St Andrews, till, on the suppression 
of religious houses at the Reformation, it was resumed by the 
Crown. The names of the earliest incumbents after the downfal 
of Popery are not preserved, — the session records reaching no far- 
ther back than the month of July 1626, at which period they be- 
gan to be kept with an exactness and detail long since discontinued, 
exhibiting an inieresting picture of the manners and opinions of the 
time, and shewing with what vigilance and vigour the discipline of 



678

the church was carried into effect, and its government maintained 
throughout the most trying and stormy periods of its history. 
• From these records it appears, that collections for the poor were 
regularly made on Sundays, and on occasions of baptisms and mar- 
riages. The sums thus collected were statedly distributed to the 
regular poor on the roll, while incidental cases of want or of more 
urgent distress were liberally relieved on the application of the ne- 
cessitous. The names of the principal proprietors in the parish 
appear as the collectors and the distributors of the poor's funds, 
as patrolling in turn the streets of the village during the hours of 
Divine service, delating offences against social order and good mo- 
rals, and enforcing the salutary discipline of the church against 
graver delinquencies. Among other respectable members of the 
kirk-session up to the Reformation, we find the names of Sir Da- 
vid Achmuttie of that Ilk, and of the Lairds of Balbirnie, Bandon, 
■Bruntoun, Coul, Carristoun, and Kirkforthar, — names related to the 
first families in the kingdom, and who disdained not to exert the in- 
■fluence which their rank and wealth conferred in promoting the in- 
terests of religion and morality. In addition to the usual immorali- 
ties cognizable by the session, and which were then punished by 
fine and by rebuke in the face of the congregation, we find not a 
few delated for pursuing their ordinary avocations on the Sabbath, 
for absenting themselves from church and from the administration 
of ordinances, for slandering neighbours, for profane swearing, for 
drunkenness, and frequenting houses of public entertainment dur- 
ing the hours of Divine service. In 1643, Mr Frederick Carmi- 
chael is admitted minister of the parish, the " ministrie of the 
Presbyterie" having met at the kirk of Markinch for that effect. 
His predecessor would seem to have been deposed as "aneenemie 
to ye Covenant," notwithstanding the testimony borne in face 
of the kirk-session by the Laird of Bruntoun in his behalf, that " he 
was als honest a minister, als faithful a minister, and als conscien- 
tious a minister as any minister in Fyffe." It appears, however, 
that the great majority of the elders and people were heartily en- 
gaged on the side of the common cause. Numbers of the pa- 
rishioners flocked to the national standard, with arms in their hands, 
while contributions in money were not wanting to attest thegene- 

 Besides the objects for which the liberah'ty of the congregation was appealed to, as 
stated in the text, it appears from the records that collections were occasionally made 
for suffering churches abroad ; and at home, for building bridges, and for similar pub- 
lie improvements locally distant, and which nothing but enlarged views of national 
utility could have prompted at a time when money was so sparingly held, and the 
jtieans of acquiring it so few and unproductive in his inland parish.

ral zeal for the cause of the kirk and the Covenant. Several in- 
stances occur in which " the sessioun thought it meit yt the volun- 
tarie contribution should be carried to ye armie by ye minister, and 
to be delyvered ther." That the incumbent during these years 
was a zealous promoter of the popular cause is manifest from the 
above extract, if, indeed, he was not one of the council of mini- 
sters appointed to attend the General in the field ; for not only do 
the weekly entries show that his pulpit was at frequent intervals 
supplied by one of his brethren of the Presbytery, but we also find 
such intimations as the following : — " The qlk day our awin mi- 
nister taught Ps. xxxiv. 19, being returned for ane space from 
the armie," and again, " 13th July 1645, Our awin minister re- 
turned from England." We refer to one other entry to show that 
the victims of war were not forgotten by such of their brethren as 
tarried at home ; for under the date of August 24th, 1645, we find 
it noted, that a messenger was dispatched by the session " to 
Montrose-, his ligure, to try if any prisoneris of this paroche be 
thaire." Nor were demonstrations of piety, of which the times fur- 
nished such signal examples, wanting to second the efforts of a ge- 
nerous patriotism. The adverse vicissitudes of those troublous 
•times are duly marked by days of public humiliation and fasting, 
-for which the reasons are recorded at length, while the successes 
of the national leaders are as duly celebrated by public acts of 
thanksgiving. Days of thanksgiving were ordained " for ye vic- 
torie obtained be our armie at York against Prince Rupert his 
armie," — for " the victorie our armie obtained at Newcastle," 
. — for " the happie victorie obtained be Leivtenant Generall 
David Lesslie, against James Graham, sometyme Earle of Mon- 
tros, and his rebellis, at Philip Haugh, neir Jedburgh, upon ye 
13th of September 1645." In this manner the principal events in 
this most eventful period of Scottish history are noticed up to the 
Restoration. Such was the political education of our fathers. Their 
guides and instructors were their ministers and elders, the former, 
for the most part, men of large minds, as well as of an ardent piety; 
deeply versed in the principles of civil not less than of ecclesiasti- 
cal polity; while the latter, were, by their birth, education, and mo- 
ral worth, entitled to the respect and esteem of those over whom 
they were called to rule, of whom moreover, they were the local and 
legitimate protectors. The principles and the proceedings of those 
days have been sometimes wittily ridiculed, and sometimes gravely 
denounced as hostile to monarchy, and subversive of liberty of con-.

science ; nor have they wanted able vindicators. But discussion 
were here out of place. Suffice it to remark, that so fixed and firm 
was the attachment of our forefathers to the revered institution of 
monarchy in the State, and presbyterial order in the Church, that 
neither the example, nor the caresses, nor the menaces of the 
" English sectaries" availed to repress, much less to vanquish them. 

A system grounded on principles so holy, and aiming at results 
so salutary, — a system so deeply rooted in the habits and affections 
of a whole people, — none but the most licentious monarch, and the 
most unprincipled administration that ever swayed the destinies of 
the British empire, would have wished, or ventured to assail. After 
the re-establishment of Episcopacy the altered state of matters is 
lamentably manifest. The meetings of session are no longer stated 
and regular, — no fasts are ordained but those which precede the 
communion — no days of thanksgiving set apart, but the 29th of 
May " for his Majestie's happie returne." Yet the Sabbath-day 
ministrations never seem to have suffered any serious interruption 
during the long and troubled night of Episcopal domination ; nor 
is the most distant allusion made in the Minutes of Session to any 
change of form, under the new order of things, unless the follow- 
ing may be so interpreted : " 30th November 1662, reading befor 
and after sermones did begin again." In the course of the suc- 
ceeding year, the names of those elders who were landed proprie- 
tors are no longer found, as present at, or concurring in, the deli- 
berations of the session ; they devolved on meaner men those 
duties which the arbitrary temper of the times rendered it dange- 
rous for them any longer to discharge. The acts of their succes- 
sors are no longer bowed to with deference and submission ; threats 
are held out of making " applicatione to my Lord St Andrews for 
purchasing of a warrand" in " mitigatione" of the required " satis- 
factione." " My Lord St Andrews, through his commissary, en- 
joins the " mitigatione" prayed. But our limits do not permit to 
enter more minutely into details. If similar instances of arbitrary 
interference served to weaken the bonds of discipline, and to lessen 
the respect due to the immediate pastors and rulers of the church, 
they served to prepare the minds of all good men and true patriots 
for welcoming the glorious dawn of civil and religious liberty usher- 
ed in by the Revolution of 1 688. 

After the Revolution-settlement, when civil and religious liberty

were placed on a secure basis, the church, if not a faultless, at 
least exhibited a fair and well-proportioned institution, as efficient 
an instrument for publishing the Gospel, and instructing the peo- 
ple, divested of religious pageantry and superfluous appendages 
as latter ages have witnessed. From that happier period, the pa- 
rish seems to have enjoyed a succession of not only sound, but 
able ministers — all of them faithful, and some of them eminently 
successful in their day. The patronage, which is vested in the 
Crown, was exercised judiciously, chiefly by means of the Earls of 
Leven, who till lately held the rank of principal heritor, and long 
diffused a salutary influence over the parish. No unpopular settle- 
ment, I believe, ever took place, and those who advocate the advan- 
tage of such management, will no doubt be anxious to ascertain 
the result. 

Now, though every minister in his day has had sufficient rea- 
son to deplore the limited success of his ministry, it is due to truth 
to make the statement I now do, that, after twenty years connec- 
tion with the parish, I have found among its ancient families, as 
compared with new-comers, transplanted from fields placed under 
a different system of spiritual husbandry, an order, decency, and 
moral bearing, obviously superior, even where much might be 
lacking as to the full standard of wished-for piety. This general 
statement admits many exceptions on the one side and on the 
other; but enough remains to warrant the assertion, that a sound 
Christian agency is the best calculated to induce moral order, and 
did, in fact, in this place, largely prove its adequacy to that effect. 

As to literary distinction, few of the pastors referred to had 
leisure, or inclination, it is presumed, to enter the lists with com 
petitors for fame. One or two of them were deemed fit to be 
transferred to St Andrews, to occupy in that University the place 
of principal. Another, who furnished the former Statistical report, 
published an agricultural survey of the county, about the time of 
his translation to a city charge ; of the rest, nothing remains be- 
yond a few sermons, mostly of an occasional and ephemeral sort. 
Their works, however, we doubt not, will bear a last-day review 
without shame, as they are without pretension. 

Owing to the rapid increase of population, the parish field soon 
became unmanageable for a single labourer, especially as secular 
business increases on the hands of the Established clergy in pro- 
portion to the census. Household ministrations necessarily became 
rare, and the effects of one visit had vanished before another could

be given to confirm the impression. Church accommodation, too, 
was unrighteously straitened ; for a place of worship built for a popu- 
lation of 2000 or 3000, left many among 6000 or 6000 unprovided 
for. Neither had there been any Dissenting place of worship erected 
here, previous to 1834, owing, no doubt, to the popular settlements 
that had so long prevailed. In that year, a chapel in connection 
with the United Secession body, and seated for 380, was opened, 
though so placed as to aflbrd little aid for unaccommodated 
parishioners in the remote villages; for it was put down in 
close neighbourhood to the parish church, while several considera- 
ble villages, at from two to four miles distance, were overlooked. 

It was then, however, the Church Extension scheme came into 
action, and here it was speedily and efficiently applied, first at 
Tliornton, a village four miles off, with more than 500 inhabitants ; 
and next at Milton of Balgonie, having nearly 600 indwellers, be- 
sides a populous district lying beyond it. The church at Thorn- 
ton is seated for upwards of 400, and that at Milton for 650 ; 
while a new erection at Methill, on the border of Weymss parish, 
has supplied accommodation for a large village of 400 inhabitants, 
situated on the coast, and more than six miles distant from the 
church at Markinch. In the latter village, Inverleven, a small 
Dissenting chapel had long existed, and nearly one-half the inha- 
bitants, who adhered to the Established Church, were obliged to 
cross the Leven to attend public worship at the church of Scoonie, 
the minister of which, indeed, had taken the virtual charge of them 
for many years. 

The church at Thornton was built by general subscription, that 
of Milton solely by the heritors and people of the district to be 
benefited by the erection ; and it is due to the respectable heritors 
of the parish to record their liberality on that occasion, in grateful 
terms. Both churches have now ordained pastors ; and seats 
being furnished at a low rate, Sabbath privileges are accessible to 
all. But after these erections have so greatly relieved the pres- 
sure on the parish minister, a body of about 3500 remain, among 
which to exert his still inadequate pastoral superintendence, though 
he has done what he could to remedy the deficiency, by calling a 
qualified assistant to aid him in the work. It were much to be de- 
sired that his unendowed fellow-labourers in the new parishes 
were on an equal footing as to stipendiary compensation.f

The present stipend, augmented in 1822, is 18 clialders, half 
barley, half meal, paid at the rates of the county fiars, the fluctua- 
tion of which is very considerable, ranging betwixt the highest and 
the lowest in the proportion of one to five-eighths, within the period 
of the writer's incumbency. The glebe contains nearly 9 acres, 
which may be valued at L.32 per annum. The manse is of very 
ancient construction, by much the oldest in the presbytery. It 
has undergone repairs and alterations so numerous, as greatly to 
affect its. apparent identity. The site has been long regarded by 
incumbents as very insalubrious and more has been expended to 
obviate dilapidation, than would have built a wholesome and com- 
modious dwelling. The church is in excellent repair. 

According to a census taken in 1836, the whole population of 
Markinch amounted to 5328, or 1189 families. Of these, 159 
families are Dissenters from the Established Church; 51 families 
are of a mixed composition; 30 of them having one Dissenting 
member; and 14 having two in each ; the rest three or more ; 25 
of the first class 159 reside in the far off village of Inverleven. 
Making these deductions, there remain within the bounds of the 
civil parish about 1079 families, exclusive of those of a mixed pro- 
fession, in connection with the Established Church, or owning no 
other connection. Since last census, the population has increased, 
but without materially affecting the above proportions. No marvel 
that the class of non-attenders at any place of worship should have 
increased, when church accommodation, till recently, was so dis- 
proportionate, and more especially, that, to supply the public works, 
strangers, not always of settled principles, or church going habits, 
are often attracted to the parish. 

Education. — This has always been a prominent object in our 
parochial system. No other country has ever exhibited so close 
an alliance betwixt religion and education, or shewn a parish 
church and parish school in such harmonious and undivided neigh- 
bourhood. Of this conjunction, the beneficial effects have been 
incalculably great, both as to intellectual improvement and intel- 
ligent piety. The earliest records of the kirk-session evince the 
attention paid to means of education ; for, besides the parochial 
school, we find order taken to have the remoter localities supplied. 
Thus, in 1702, the following entry was made : " The minister hav- 
ing acquainted the session, that he had found, on his going throw 

lated to the parish of Dtinbog, and was succeeded by the Ucv. Mr M'Ewaii, the pre- 
sent incurnbent. Ihe first minister of 'I horiiton. the Rev. Mr Adainsoii, is still there.

that part of the parish, that the people of Coltoun stand in great 
need of an English school for teaching their children, — the ses- 
sion, taking the case to their consideration, not only what is repre- 
sented, but further, that there is a dangerous water betwixt this 
and Coltoun ; and that many poor things of that toun must be 
lost entirely as to instruction, if there be not a school there, and 
that parents who have substance of the world, and are obliged to 
send their children abroad out of the paroch, will be hereby en- 
couraged to keep them at home, and that the doing of this is ane 
necessary and Christian duty, and for the special benefit of that 
corner of the paroch, and not in the least lyable to any reasonable 
exception, did unanimously agree that there be a school in Col- 
toun, and offered to the minister their ready concurrence with his 
project to that effect." 

Equal interest, however, was not shown by the people at all 
times in availing themselves of school-training, for on the " 20 
Martii 1643," this minute occurs : " The said day, George Ro- 
bertson did give over his office of ye school and ye kirk, and ye 
session, and yat because his deutie was small arid ewil paved,'' &amp;c. 
Probably, George Robertson might have set down the people's in- 
difference to his own remissness or want of skill. In the present 
day, at least, the desire for good education pervades all classes in 
the parish, nor are the means for accomplishing it sparingly en- 
joyed, — nine schools, besides the parish one, being in active opera- 
tion. Of these nine, two only, on the Balgonie estate, have any 
shadow of endowment ; the one at Balgonie Square, enjoving an 
annual allowance of L. 10, with dwelling-house annexed, the other, 
at Thornton, having L. 5 simply. These sums had been allowed 
by the former proprietor, and are continued by the present, with 
a becoming liberality. Another school, at Balbirnie coal-hill, 
merely provides the teacher with a house. Of the rest, none have 
any other means of support for the teacher, save school-fees, — a very 
precarious and inadequate source of remuneration for a class of men 
whose meritorious labours are of so much importance to the com- 
munity. A female school in the village derives pecuniary aid from 
the private subscription of a few ladies connected with the place, 
chiefly of the Balgonie, Balbirnie, and Barnslee families. 

The parish school may be held up as a model, so admirably is 
it conducted by Mr Duncan Stewart. Previous to his appoint- 
ment six years ago, little could have been said in favour of its ma- 
nagement; but it is now efficient in the highest degree, and, in point

of system, will bear a comparison with seminaries of the first class. 
After this, it need not be said that it is well attended. Indeed, 
want of room is the chief impediment it labours under, and though 
the heritors have already done much in the way of affording ac- 
commodation, more is needed for the due working of the im- 
portant institution. When Dr Thomson gave his Statistical Re- 
port, the salary of the schoolmaster was L. 10, the dwelling-house 
also being old and incommodious. Mr Stewart's salary is L. 34, 
4s. 4H.; school-fees, L.70 ; other emoluments, L. 17, 10s. ; total 
income per annum, L. 121, 14s. 41 d. The dwelling-house is of 
late erection, and affords accommodation considerably beyond the 
statutory amount, though by no means beyond the station of the 
occupants. 

Besides week-day means of instruction, the Sabbath school sys- 
tem is diligently worked under the efficient direction of the assist- 
ant minister, aided by a number of gratuitous teachers, who de- 
vote a portion of the Sabbath to this excellent purpose. Oral in- 
struction is aided by the gratuitous use of a small, but gradually 
increasing collection of appropriate books, which convey to many 
houses, ill-provided with such furniture, means of information and 
materials for thought, on subjects of momentous importance. The 
Dissenting chapel has also its collection of books in useful circu- 
lation. 

Benefit Societies. — There are several Associations that belong to 
this department, the strength and resources of which are shewn in 
the subjoined table : 

Name. No. of Members. Strrte of Funds. Entry. Quart. Payt. 

Friendly Society, 224 - 1.. 1000 00 L026 L.016 

Brotherly do. 107 - 300 0 0 

Apron do. 160 - 400 0 0 

Equitable do. 180 never exceeds 30 0 0 weekly payment, 0 10 

The last is of recent origin, and for the time, the most popular, 
as requiring a moderate payment of Is. weekly, tillthe collective sum 
amounts to L. 30; each in his turn, which is determined by lot, is 
put in possession of that sum, continuing the weekly contribution, 
nevertheless, till his payments shall have replaced the amount 
drawn, with interest. Thus, each has his contributions realized 
to him, and a mutual accommodation results to the whole. 

The object of the other three Societies is to make provision for 
widows and superannuated members, and to help when disabled 
by sickness or incidental casualty. The widow's allowance from the 
Friendly Society is L. 1, 4s. per annum ; sick members receive for a

time 4., and, if permanent aid is required, 2s. per week. Some of the 
others allow less. 

There is, however, less alacrity now than in time past among 
young men to enrol themselves in these Societies, and as their suc- 
cess and stability depend on new accessions to supply the vacancies 
made by death, there is reason to apprehend a less permanent exist- 
ence to some of them than their benevolent projectors contemplated. 

There has not been shewn any strong disposition to make use 
of savings banks, nor has any branch of those institutions been 
here established, though, doubtless, an investment in them would 
possess many advantages in the way of encouraging economy and 
counteracting improvidence. A branch of the Commercial Bank, 
Edinburgh, has been recently introduced, which will afford new 
facilities to the business part of the community. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Though this class must have increas- 
ed with an increasing population, yet it has done so by no means in 
the same ratio. In •]621, the ordinary poor were 21 in 1645, 23 ; 
the intermediate years exhibiting little fluctuation. At present, and 
for the last twenty years, the ordinary poor average 50 on the roll 
for stated supply. In few cases, is full maintenance afforded, the 
weekly pension being chiefly given to persons disabled by sickness 
or-age from industrial employments, and wanting relations in a 
condition to relieve them fully, though, with a little assistance, 
well disposed to contribute to the utmost of their power. The 
rate of allowance varies with the circumstances of the individual's 
case, there being as many under Is. 6d. per week, as there are 
above that moderate sum. A heavy charge, however, occasional- 
ly occurs by having whole families devolved on parish support, 
either by the death of parents, or by their desertion. Cases in the 
latter predicament have, of late, become nore frequent, and will 
necessarily multiply in proportion as moral principle is undermined, 
by the insidious fallacies of opinion, which of late have been in- 
dustriously propagated on the questions of property and the mar- 
riage contract. 

Besides the ordinary poor, occasional relief is administered, to a 
considerable extent, to persons not claiming regular supply, though 
incidentally requiring assistance. It is always an object to keep 
this class distinct from the others, as far as the principle of public 
charity will allow. In general, there is no indisposition to receive 
eleemosynary aid, though far less among recent settlers, than the 
ancient residents. When cases of lunacy occur among the work- 
ing classes, the parish, for the most part, is called on to defray the 



MA UK INCH. 



expense of their admission into a public asylum. At present, there 
is one individual so maintained at Perth. In general, recovery 
is by no means hopeless, when the case is not too long neglected. 

To meet these charges, the permanent funds of the parish are 
very inadequate. These funds comprise church door-collections, 
dues on marriages and mortcloths, and interest on money in bank 
deposit. The first named class of revenue is variable, and it is to 
be regretted that the younger portion of church-goers are less ex- 
emplary in the Sabbath offering than their fathers. Injurious 
opinions, indeed, are by some inculcated, to the effect that such 
contributions, going only to exonerate the proprietors of the soil, 
who are legally bound to support the poor, form an act of gratuitous 
generosity on the part of the unlanded community, as if charity 
were the business of a class, and not the general concern of a 
virtuous community. 

Other causes operating unfavourably on church-door collections 
might be mentioned, did the nature of this report allow more than 
general views. It must, moreover, be taken into the account in 
stating' an average, that the quoad sacra parishes, having their own 
collections, must cause a diminution at the parish church. By the 
terms of their constitution, they are allowed to apply their collec- 
tions for their own objects, provided they collect twice annually for 
the parish funds. It is a remarkable fact, that, in one of those new 
erections, that at Thornton, not a single pauper has claimed to be 
relieved. Since these disjunctions took place, the average col- 
lection at the parish church is under L. 1. Thrice annually, 
at two sacramental occasions, and first Sabbath of the year, 
extraordinary collections are made,  the proceeds of which 
are distributed in addition to the ordinary supplies, and chiefly to 
persons not on the stated roll. Collections for objects not elee- 
mosynary are also occasionally made, averaging from L. 30 to 
L. 40 per annum. These include the General Assembly's 
Schemes, books for Sabbath school library, &amp;c. 

The return for mortcloths has of late years greatly declined, 
the right of the kirk-session to exact a fee being occasionally disput- 
ed, and not by Dissenters alone, though it was first challenged on 
thatside. The payment is undoubtedly legal, but can rarely be en- 
forced without violating the decencies due to interment of the dead. 

There is a deposit fund of L. 400 belonging to the parish, the in- 
terest of which only is at the disposal of the kirk-session. A Female 
Society for aged women in destitute circumstances lays out about 
• These are always liberal.

L.50 annually, and is so conducted as to prove an excellent auxili- 
ary to the kirk-session. The principal ladies connected with the 
parish patronize it. 

It must not be omitted, that a great deal of private charity is 
unobtrusively distributed by the families of the principal heritors, 
whether resident or otherwise. It is pleasant also to state, that 
among the humbler classes, many instances occur of an habitual, 
though little noticed readiness to communicate of their little to a 
neighbour having less. The finest charities of life are thus produced. 

The two great coal proprietors, Mr Balfour of Whittingham 
and Balgonie, and Mr Balfour of Balbirnie, make liberal donations 
of coals each winter. The former not being resident, places his 
coal bounty at the disposal of the kirk-session, and never reduces 
the list of expectants made up by the elders. The Barnslee 
family also do much in the way of private distribution to the 
deserving poor. In the eastern part of the parish, the family of 
Balfour has been long distinguished in this respect. 

With all these accessories, the parish funds present a large de- 
ficit, which the heritors have hitherto met by voluntary assess- 
ment. This is gradually becoming more onerous, and the kirk- 
session experience augmenting difirculties in their management. 
Indeed, in so far as relieving the poor ceases to be regarded as a 
branch of charity, and passes into the predicament of an abso- 
lute legal claim, it becomes the more difficult for a kirksession 
to administer beneficially. Their position is pressed on the one 
side by applicants, on the other by heritors, who have to provide 
for deficiencies. In this conflict, their moral influence is exposed 
to damage, and as it perishes, their usefulness suffers in propor- 
tion. Yet the substitution of a machinery divested of all church 
associations, and worked by legal power only, destroys one of the 
healthiest agencies ever introduced into the parochial economy. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 

On minor branches of parish statistics, it is not necessary to 
dilate. It may be mentioned that the public health is under the 
care of three active and well-qualified medical practitioners; 
whereas, long after Dr Thomson wrote his Report, not one was 
resident ii the parish. These three reside in the village of Mark- 
inch. There is nothing that requires special notice in the de- 
partment of disease ; here, as in other parts of the island, cases 
of pulmonary consumption forming the largest class. The 
mortality of the last forty years shows an average of 69, the 



MARKINCH. 



689 



greatest amount in 1834 being 130; llie lowest in 1802 53. 
Several instances of a longevity exceeding ninety years have occur- 
red during the last twenty years; and one, a few months ago, who 
had gone beyond ninety-six. The ardour of politics had curried 
him, two years before, to a polling-place six miles from his habi- 
tation. 

As to the general morals of the community, it were indelicate 
to go into specialities of detail. Crime, as the term is usually un- 
derstood, is exceedingly unfrequent. Petty breaches of the peace 
occasionally occur, but will become rare, as the cause of temper- 
ance gains ground,— and happily it does gain on the opposite vice, 
— solicited as that vice is by a too promiscuous system of licensing 
public-houses, the number of which is still excessive, and ouffhl to 
be reduced. The class of immorality that most falls under the 
cognizance of the kirk-session has sensibly diminished ; and, upon 
the whole, the community has an improved moral aspect. This 
is much aided by the excellent regulations maintained at the lead- 
ing public works, whose proprietors insist on moral conduct as ah 
indispensable condition of being retained in their employment. 
Several of them, too, have provided libraries for the use of  heir 
work people, which operates in many ways in producing a benefi-. 
cial result. And, in proportion as the popular mind is well-in- 
formed, it will cease to lend a facile ear to the propagators of opi- 
nions subversive of virtuous order and religious obligation. The 
parochial system, not less than other institutions of the land, has 
of late years been exposed to unsparing aggression, and nothing 
less than its ruin will satisfy assailants. We wish its downfall 
averted,. in the persuasion that it is a righteous instrument for pro- 
moting an host of objects, each of which, we cannot help thinking,, 
is worth more than the most exaggerated cost of the lohole

PKESBYTERY Oi' DUNFEKMLINE, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. WILLIAM GILSTON, MINISTER. 



X, TOPOGRAPHV AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

. ]sfame In the former Account of the parish, it is stated, that 

the words cair or cairn, and knock, of which Carnock is supposed 
to be a compound, signify " a village, or collection of houses 
adjoining to a small hill." Another etymology has been given, 
which makes the name signify "a cairn, or barrows on a hill," and 
this, probably, is the true derivation. 

Extent and Boundaries.— Th\s parish lies very compact, being 
about 3 miles from east to west, and about the same from north 
to south, though narrowing considerably in the latter direction. 
Its whole extent is about 9 square miles, or 2260 square acres. 
It is bounded on the extreme west by the parish of Culross, in the 
county of Perth ; on the north-west, by the parish of Sahne ; on 
the north-east and east, by that of Dunfermline; and on the 
south and south-west, by that of Torryburn. 

Topographical Appearances.— The surface is pleasingly undu- 
lating and varied ; and being well wooded, present.s, from several 
points of view, landscapes of considerable beauty and richness. 
There is no eminence deserving of the name of a mountain ; 
but the Camp's Bank and Carneil Hill, which form a continu- 
ous range of rising ground, are of considerable elevation, and 
command extensive views of the Frith of Forth and the adjacent 
country, from Stirling on the west, to Edinburgh on the east. 
I.uscar Knolls, or Knoios, also the Clune of Newbigging, and part 
of the Clune farm, which lie further north, and are somewhat 
more elevated, command rich and varied prospects; and from 
fnostof them are seen in the distance, the Ochils, Benlomond,

and other western mountains, together with the Pentland hills, 
and the rising grounds to the east. 

Hjjdrography. — There are but few streams in the parish, and 
all of them unimportant, except as watering the localities through 
which they flow. They run from east to west, and after joining 
other rivulets, fall into the Frith of Forth, beyond the bounds of 
the parish. From external appearances, there seem to be a few 
mineral springs, chiefly of the chalybeate kind ; but they are little 
attended to. Of other springs, there are several, which are all 
perennial, and which furnish an abundant supply of excellent water 
for the use of the inhabitants. Under this head, also, should 
perhaps be mentioned the Ink Craig, in the neighbourhood of the 
village of Carnock, which is so called from its producing a liquid 
resembling ink. " A chemical analysis," says the former Account 
of the parish, " was made of this liquid by the ingenious Dr Black, 
when it was found to contain a mixture of coal, flinty earth, and 
clay." Its appearance to the eye is simply that of water oozing 
through a black substance resembling coal, with which it has be- 
come impregnated. The liquid forms a very tolerable ink, and 
might, for ordinary purposes, be used as such. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks of this parish are chief- 
ly sandstone, limestone, and different varieties of trap. The 
strata dip in all directions ; but in the north side of the parish, 
the dip is generally to the north-west, north, or north-east; while 
in the south, the dip is to the south and south-west. Sandstone 
is the most extensively diffused of all the rocks, being met with 
in almost every part of the parish ; and in one part, where it pre- 
sents a continuous bed of many acres extent, and of great thick- 
ness, lying so near the surface as to be entirely exposed, or only 
partially covered with a thin coating of moss and heath. In some 
places, the freestone beds seem to have been raised by an under- 
movement ; and hence the rock is frequently found in a shivered 
state, and sometimes forming knolls above the more compact beds 
below. 

Trap or whinstone, also, is of frequent occurrence, and many of 
the elevations of the parish are formed of it. Where the masses 
are exposed, they are usually found to rest upon sandstone or lime- 
stone. Different varieties of it are met with ; but nowhere does 
It assume the columnar form. Greenstone is not uncommon. 
Carniel Hill presents us with loose sand and freestone raised to a 
considerable elevation, as if by some under-movement, and with 



692 



FIFESHIRR. 



masses of trap overlying these like a cap. On the top of the hill, 
there is a hollow of some depth, which is always more or less 
filled with water, and which, without a stretch of imagination, 
may be supposed to have been the aperture through which the 
igneous matter forced itself. Indeed, the appearance of the trap, 
as seen distinctly overcapping the sandstone, and forming preci- 
pitous masses on one side of the hill, strongly countenances the 
idea of its having partially upheaved, and at last forced its way, 
when in a liquid state, through the strata on which it now rests. 

In the neighbourhood of the village of Carnock, there is a bed 
of white indurated clay, apparently of considerable depth and ex- 
tent, which is usually denominated caioni, and is much sought after 
for domestic purposes. It dips towards the south, and lies im- 
mediately under a stratum of rich soil and clay of considerable 
depth. The layers are very regular and compact ; but the jomts 
are numerous, and extend in all directions, so that no piece of 
any great magnitude is ever dug out. This stone receives a fine 
polish : and being so soft as to be turned on an ordinary lathe, 
it is frequently manufactured into small articles. The bed seems 
gradually to pass into the strata of slaty and shaly substances that 
lie to the east of it. It is not found in any other part of the pa- 
rish, nor, so far as we can learn, in any great quantity in any of 
the neighbouring parishes ; and hence, as it is in some request, 
it is carried to considerable distances for sale. 

Ironstone is frequently met with in the parish, especially on the 
lands of Pitdinnies and Blair. The quality is considered rich, 
particularly of that which is found on the Pitdinnies ; but on nei- 
ther estate has the ore been wrought. 

Coal is di[rused generally throughout the parish, and was at no 
distant period wrought in five different places. The only mine 
at present in operation, is on the estate of Blair, in the west of 
the parish. It has been wrought for a long time past, but with 
greater spirit of late years than formerly. It consists of four dif- 
ferent seams of coal. The uppermost, a three feet seam, is a 
blind coal, used by brewers and maltsters. The others are house- 
coal of different qualities, and are 6, 4, and 2i feet in thickness 
respectively. Part of all these seaiTis have been wrought, and are 
at present working. The produce, which is about 2000 tons an- 
nually, is almost wholly used in home consumption. The entire 
depth of the pit, which is at present wrought, is twenty-three h- 
thoms. A dike cuts one of the seams near to the pit, causing a 



GAIINOCK. 



693 



considerable derangement in tlie strata, and changing altogether 
the quality of the coal. The coals were, till of late, drawn up by 
a horse gin ; but a small engine, upon the high pressure principle, 
which was set up for keeping the pit clear of water, now draws up 
the coals also. 

The coal in other parts of the parish, though not wrought, is 
not exhausted. On the north-east, most of the upper seams, 
branching off from Lord Elgin's coal-works, in the parish of Dun- 
fermline, and cropping out iii Carnock, have been wrought out. 
The lower seams, however, have not, it is understood, been yet 
touched. 

Limestone was formerly quarried in considerable quantities on 
the lands of Luscar ; but though it still exists there and in some 
other spots, none is at present wrought in any part of the parish. 
In the neighbourhood of the places where it is known to exist, 
there sometimes is found what the workmen call bastard, limestone, 
or a mixture of whin and limestone.  

Freestone is quarried in several places. The principal quarry, 
however, in the parish, is on the estate of Carnock, where the rock 
is of great extent and considerable thickness, and may be wrought 
without almost any tirring. The stone of this quarry, though 
somewhat softer than the freestone in the south part of the parish, 
is more easily quarried, and may be cut out of almost any length. 
Owing to the distance from water carriage, and the abundance of 
excellent freestone in the neighbouring districts, the demand for 
stones at this quarry is not great, except in the immediate locality. 
There are three kinds of stone in the bed which composes this 
quarry : the first being white and soft when dug, and gradually 
hardening when exposed to the weather; the second being of a 
somewhat darker colour, and harder quality ; and the third being 
of a bluish-black colour, and capable of receiving a fine polish. 
This last lies alongside of the others throughout the whole extent 
of the bed, and seems to form part of the same rock. The direc- 
tion and dip of the strata appear, so far as they can be traced, to 
be uniform throughout ; and the fissures, though numerous, 
scarcely occasion any derangement in the component parts of the 
rock. Yet the stone passes from the one colour, to the other frcr 
quently in the smallest discernible space. The colouring substance 
of the black stone is evidently of a bituminous nature ; but how it 
should have impregnated one part of the bed and not the other is 
not easily accounted for. The outer portion of the black rock.

which is more exposed than the rest of the quarry, is, in some 
places, broken into large masses, and assumes a cliff-like form. 
But whether the mass may have been, at any former period, sub- 
merged under any fluid which could have given it its dark hue, 
can only be matter of conjecture. It is certain, that the substan- 
ces, which at present are thinly spread over its surface, could not 
have produced this effect ; for they are the same as these \vhich 
partially cover the face of the while portion of the rock. In the 
former Statistical Account of the parish, the writer, speaking of 
the black rock, says, " This stone will stand the fire, and the 
longer it is exposed to it, it becomes the more durable, and con- 
tracts the blacker hue." This, however, is a mistake ; for the fact 
is, that this stone, when subjected to the heat of an ordinary fire, 
soon becomes red-hot, loses entirely its black colour, exhibits to 
the eye a coarser texture than before, and is more friable. 

No fossil organic remains belonging to the animal kingdom have 
been, so far as is known, found at any time in the rocks of this pa- 
rish. A few belonging to the vegetable kingdom have been met with, 
which were chiefly lepidodendrons. And, as marking the action of 
the watery element, it may be mentioned, that some of the slabs 
\\hich have been dug out of the freestone quarry on the Carnock 
estate show very distinctly the ripple of the wave upon them. 

The chief alluvial deposits are sand, gravel, loam, clay, and 
moss. In the last mentioned of these, trees in a considerable state 
of preservation are found imbedded. The soil varies much and 
often within a small space. In the southern division of the parish 
it is more fertile ; yet in some of the northern parts it is scarcely 
inferior. But the difference of exposure gives a considerable ad- 
vantage to the former in point of climate. In some places, the 
soils have much depth ; but generally they are the reverse, — rest- 
ing principally on sandstone, whinstone, and a hard clayey subsoil, 
rather wet than otherwise, and consisting chiefly of loam, clay, and 
gravel. Boulders are frequently met with near the surface ; but 
none of them have been found of any great size. They consist 
chiefly of whin. Moles are frequent in the loamy soils. But the 
tarmers seem not to consider therfi hurtful, as no mole-catchers are 
employed in the parish. 

Zoology. — The birds are those ordinarily met with in the dis- 
trict. The very rare visitant, the greater butcher-bird, was seen in 
the parish in the spring of 1838. The whinchat, a bird rather 
uncommon in the district, is occasionally found here. Snowflakes

appeal- in large flights during- severe winters. Attempts have been

and the depredations of the poacher have prevented their success.

Wood. — The plantations in this parish cover several hundred acres 
of ground ; and, being laid out with considerable taste and skill, 
they serve both to beautify and shelter the lands. They consist 
chiefly of the different kinds of fir, intermixed with oaks, elms, 
planes, &amp;:c. On the lands of Clune there is, besides several belts and 
hedge- rows of trees, a considerable plantation of Scotch firs, of 
nearly a hundred years growth, and of superior quality. And on 
the same estate, there is a large clump of aged beeches, which 
both shelter and ornament the surrounding grounds. In Luscar 
Dean, which is all planted, and where a few trees of considerable 
age and height are found, there was a venerable beech, of which 
mention is made in. the former Account of the parish, evidently of 
great antiquity, but the age of which was unknown. It was digni- 
fied by the name of the " Queen of the Dean." Growing on the 
slope of a confined glen, and closely surrounded with other trees, 
it was not seen to advantage. But even near at hand it appeared 
a magnificent tree. Its girth at the ground was 16 feet, and at 
seven feet above that point, 13 feet 8 inches. Of the two large 
limbs into which it separated, the one was 9 feet thick, and the 
other nearly the same. Its height was upwards of 100 feet. This 
tree, however, was blown down one stormy night in the spring of 
last year. 

Of late years, a large number of trees, which must have been 
planted above a hundred years ago by Colonel Erskine, and which 
had attained their full growth, or were partially going into decay, 
have been cut down on the estate of Carnock. A considerable 
number, however, evidently planted by the same spirited gentle-

man, and disposed chiefl' in rows, still remain. They consist 
principally of oak, plane, ash, and beech. One of the beeches, 
which grows near the village, is worthy of notice, both for its size, 
being 11 feet 10 inches in circumference at the ground, and 11 
feet 3 inches at seven feet from the ground ; and especially for its 
long, pendulous, and limber branches, which, when the tree is in 
full flourish, give it an appearance of singular beauty. Upwards 
of a hundred acres of this estate lying together were planted nearly 
forty years ago, besides patches of considerable extent at different 
periods since. 

On the lands of Blair, the plantations cover about 120 acres; 
some of them upwards of seventy, and others of them thirty, and 
fifteen years old. They are all in a thriving state, and profitable. 
Those which are near the mansion-house are tastefully disposed 
and ornamental. The southern part of the parish, comprehend- 
ing Whinny hill, and the Pitdinnies, shews also several belts of 
planting judiciously placed, and these, together with an extensive 
plantation on the immediately neighbouring grounds, skirting along 
the whole eastern boundary of the above named farms, and lying 
partly within the parish, give this district also the appearance of 
being well wooded. 

II. — Civil History. 
The principal notices regarding this parish are to be found in 
its session records, and in the records of the Presbytery of Dun- 
fermline. From these, it appears to have been formerly of much 
smaller extent than it is at present :— comprehending only the 
barony of Carnock, which included the present estate of Carnock, 
together with the lands of Blair, and Easter and Wester Camps. 
The Pitdinnies, the lands of Luscar, and those of Clune, origin- 
ally belonged to the parish of Dunfermline, and were disjoined 
from it, and annexed to Carnock in the commencement of the year 
1650. The following entry is found in the Presbytery record, 
August 19, 1619. "The Presbytery having considered the re- 
port of Mr John Dunn and James Sibbald, appointed to peram- 
bulate and consider the distance of Pittdinnies, Easter and Wes- 
ter Luskar, and the Clune, from the kirk of Dunfermline and the 
kirk of Carnock, they find it necessary that the said landis be dis- 
joined from the kirk of Dunfermline, and annexed to the kirk of 
Carnock ; and recommend the same to the commissione for the 
plantation of kirks, to be ratified by their authoritie." And from 
a subsequent entry, it appears that this recommendation was car- 



CAllNOCK.

ried into effect in the following year. Sibbald, in his History of 
Fife savs, that « the Lord Lyndsay of Byres got this parish by 
marriage of a brother daughter of Dalhousie ; and they kept it 
till King Jame VI.'s time, that Sir George Bruce, the predeces- 
sor of the Earls of Kincardine, got it." The Acts of the Parlia- 
ment of Scotland 1609, inform us that the lands of Pitdinnies 
were conveyed to Edward Bruce of Kinloss, and his wife, along 
with the patronage of the kirk and parish of Torrie, The char- 
ter conveying the barony of Carnock, with the patronage of the 
kirk thereof, to Sir George Bruce, is dated, as appears from the' 
same Acts of Parliament, the 4th May 1602. From the same 
writing we learn, that the church of Carnock belonged originally 
to the ministry of Scotland-well, and was disjoined from it when 
Sir George Bruce received infefcment of the barony. 

Chalmers in his Caledonia says, that "in the year eighty-three 
of the Christian era, Agricola the Roman general, in endeavour- 
ing to conquer the northern parts of Scotland, passed the Forth, 
and encamped his army in the now parish of Carnock." And the 
circumstance that the name Camps is given to one of the localities 
in the parish, and that several Roman urns were dug up some 
years ago on Carneil hill, renders his statement probable. He 
says again, " Upon Carneil hill, near Carnock, the Horestii ap- 
pear to have had a strength, as we might learn from the prefix of 
the name : the caer of the British signifying a fort." 

Eminent Men. — The connection of the Bruces with this parish 
appears, from what has been already mentioned, to have commen- 
ced in the year 1602. Edward Bruce, the first Lord Kinloss, 
" was a man of superior talents, learning, and integrity," and was 
eminently instrumental in the peaceable accession of James VI. to 
the throne of England. His second son, Thomas, third Lord 

' The people of Carnock were formerly staunch Covenanters. The following no- 
tice regarding the first swearing of the Solemn League and Covenant is worthy of be- 
ing recorded. It is extracted from the earliest of the session records, and is in the 
handwriting of John Row. " The 5 of November 1643. The covenant of tliir three- 
kingdoms, Scotland, England, and Irland, wes solemnlie sworne to, and subscribit 
be the parishioners of Carnock, and all that cude wreat subscribit their names in the- 
book qrin the printed covenant was, and the rest of the parishioners ytculd not sub- 
scribe themselves subscribit be Jhone Andersone, Notar pvblik Dunferlyne, he- 
tuiching their hands as the use is, at the communion table in the kirk of Carnok, as- 
the book qlk is in ray possession will testifie. Qlk action was done verrie solemnlie 
after I had taught the historie of Joshua's covenant, Josh. 24 cap. fra the 14 verse- 
to the 29." Again, during the ministry of Mr Belfragc, we find the following entry. 
" Dec. 17, 1648, The quhilk day the Solemne League and Covenant was rcnewit 
and sworne, and the public confession of sins was read over iigaine. The fast was. 
lykewise solemnlie kept this day.

Kinloss, was created Earl of Elgin, by patent, dated 21st June 
1663. Sir George Bruce of Carnock appears to have been a 
person of ability and sagacity. He settled at Culross, where he 
established extensive and flourishing coal-works. He was repre- 
sentative for the burgh of Culross in the Scottish Parliament, and 
appears to have been frequently on the commission for the plan- 
tation of kirks. Edward, his grandson, was created Earl of Kin- 
cardine, and Lord Bruce of Torrie, in 1647; and dying without 
issue, was succeeded in his title and estates by his brother Alex- 
ander. The character of Alexander, as drawn by Bishop Burnet, 
shews him to have been no ordinary man. He died in 1680, and 
was succeeded by his son Alexander, third Earl of Kincardine, 
in whose time the estate of Carnock was brought to a judicial 
sale, and came into the possession of Lieutenant-Colonel John 
Erskine. 

From statements made in the session records, it appears that 
the Earls of Kincardine occasionally held baronial courts at Car- 
nock, and sometimes assumed the power of expelling the refrac- 
tory from the parish. 

Among other individuals who have resided in the parish, or 
who have been connected with it by birth or office, there are a 
few whose names deserve to be mentioned as having honourably 
distinguished themselves, either by the influence which their coun- 
sel and example exercised, or by the active part which they took 
in questions of public interest. Of these, not the least distin- 
guished was the above-mentioned Colonel Erskine, who became 
proprietor of the barony of Carnock in the year 1700. He was 
son of David, second Lord Cardross, and of Mary, sister to the 
first Earl of Kincardine. Being a zealous Presbyterian, he was 
a determined opponent of whatever measures tended to injure the 
Presbyterian cause. He was frequently returned as elder from 
the Presbytery of Dunfermline to the General Assembly, and was 
one of the three commissioners whom the Assembly of 1735 sent 
to London for the purpose of endeavouring to effect a repeal of 
the Act of the 10th of Queen Anne, restoring patronage. He is 
spoken of also as a zealous and successful agriculturist, and the 
estate of Carnock still bears marks of the attention which he paid 
to planting. 

The colonel was succeeded in his estate of Carnock by his eldest 
son John, who became a distinguished member of the Scotch Bar, 
and was, for a long period of his life, Professor of Scotch Law in 



CARNOCK.

the University of Edinburgh. The well known Institutes of the 
Professor were composed, it is said, in his house of Newbigging, 
in this parish, where he usually resided during the summer months. 
He resided latterly at Cardross, in Monteith, where he died in the 
year 1767. 

The property belonging to the family in this parish descended 
to his eldest son, the late Dr John Erskine of Edinburgh. The 
doctor, who was an eminent minister of the Church of Scotland, 
and whose "worth and talents were well known and highly appre- 
ciated both at home and abroad, was first settled at Kirkintilloch, 
afterwards at Culross, in the Presbytery of Dunfermline, and final- 
ly was translated to the Old Greyfriars, Edinburgh, where he 
had for his colleague the celebrated Principal Robertson. Dur- 
ing the period of his residence in Edinburgh, he took an active 
part in church afiairs ; and as to much energy of character, and 
great industry, he joined an ardent piety and an enlightened zeal, 
he contributed not a little to maintain the purity and the efficiency of 
the Scottish Kirk. Like several of his ancestors, he was a warm 
friend both of religious and civil liberty. His thirst after know- 
ledge was great, and continued unabated to his death, which hap- 
pened A. D. 1803, in the eighty-second year of his age, and the 
fifty-eighth of his ministry. 

Another individual long connected with this parish by office, 
was Mr John Row. He seems to have been the third minister of 
it after the Reformation. Livingston, in his memoirs as quoted 
by Gillies, says, that " he was a godly, zealous man, who was care- 
ful to collect the most observable passages of Providence in his 
time. He helped at the General Assembly at Glasgow 1638, to 
discover sundry corruptions of the former time." His father, 
who was one of the Reformers, and who was a distinguished He- 
brew scholar, and the first that taught that language in Scotland, 
early initiated him into the knowledge of the Hebrew, so that when 
eight years of age he read the Hebrew chapter in the family. 
Being firmly attached to the Presbyterian Church government, 
and an enemy to the encroachments of Episcopacy, he suffered 
frequent hardships in consequence, during the ascendancy of the 
latter. But, being much respected for his piety and integrity, he, 
though a nonconformist, was permitted to live at his charge ; and 

• D.ivid Ferguson, afterwards minister of Dunfermlinp, and James Stewart, were 
his predecessors. Vide Row's Ilistorie, p. 471 , just published by the Wodrow Society.

after mourning for a long period over the defections under Pre- 
lacy, he was privileged to witness its overthrow, and to assist in 
effecting the second Reformation, His father-in-law, he cele- 
brated David Ferguson, first Presbyterian minister of Dunfermline, 
and coadjutor of John Knox, began to write a history of the 
Church of Scotland, which Mr Row continued. This history, 
which consists chiefly of an abridgement of the Acts of the Gene- 
ral Assembly, and which bears the name of Row's MS., has been 
published both by the Wodrow Society, and the Maitland Club. 

Mr Row was settled minister of Carnock in 1592, and died 
June 26th 1646, aged seventy-eight years. 

The eldest son of Mr Row was named John, and attained to 
such eminence both for his literary accomplishments, and for his 
zeal in church affairs, that he deserves to be mentioned in con- 
nection with his native parish. He was for some time rector of 
the grammar-school at Kirkaldy, and was afterwards translated to 
the rectorship of that of Perth, where he taught during twenty 
years with distinguished ability and success. Subsequently, he 
turned his attention more particularly to the church, and having 
gone to Aberdeen he was ordained one of the ministers of that 
city. In 1652, he was appointed Principal of King's College, 
Old Aberdeen, in room of Dr Guild, who had been deposed the 
preceding year. When at the head of this college, he gave great 
encouragement to learning, and was much respected. He was de- 
prived of his office of Principal after the Restoration in 1661. 

 His death is thus noted in the session records : " Junnie 28. — My father, Mr 
Johne Row of worthie memorie, being departed this life, I, his youngest sone, Mr 
William How, minister of Seres, did preach, and after sermone did hold session." 
His monument in the church-yard here, which seems to be of considerable antiquity, 
though the date of its erection is unknown, has llie following Latin inscription in 
raised capitals : " Hie jacet M. Jo. Row, pastor hujus Ecclesiee Fideliss. visit ac- 
cerriraus veritatisct foederis Scoticani assertor : Hierarchias Pseudoepiscopalis et Ro- 
manorum rituura cordicitus osor : in frequenti symmystarura apostasia eubi instar 
constantissimus, Duxit Gricelidem Fergusoniam, cum qua annis 51 conjunctissime 
vixit. Huic F.cclesiae annis. 54 prjel'uit. Obiit Junnii 26, anno Oom. 1646, setatis 78. 
Obiit et ilia Januarii 30, 1659. 

On another part of Row's monument is the following inscription : " Here lyes 
Adam Stobie of Wester Luskar, born 1620, died 1711, and Margaret Gibbon, grand- 
child to Mr John Row, born 1630, died 1670." This Mr Stobie, who belonged to 
the parish, was a zealous Covenanter, and met, in consequence, with much hard usage. 
Botli tradition, and the facts mentioned by Wodrow, fully establish the truth of the 
following statement regarding him in tlie Religious Monitor for October 1808. 
' He was a gentleman much respected in the country, a man of great spirit and ex- 
emplary piety. His house was the resort of many of the ministers and others who 
were persecuted for conscience sake, in the profligate reign of Charles 1 1. He him- 
self was fined, iuiprisoned, sent to the Bass, and condemned to be transported beyond 
seas ; but by a wonderful interposition of Providence, was landed in England, and 
got safe home to his family." 



CARNOCK. 



701 



Orem,inhis History of Aberdeen, says, that he demitted his charge. 
He published a grammar and vocabulary of the Hebrew lan- 
guage, besides several tracts, both of a political and of a religious 
kind. 

Nor should we omit to mention Mr Row's immediate successor, 
the Rev. George Belfrage, who was ordained minister of this pa- 
rish in the year 1647, and who appears to have been distinguish- 
ed for his piety and zeal. He lived in troublous times, and suffer- 
ed for his attachment to the principles of the second Reformation. 
Being amoiig the nonconformists in the time of Archbishop Sharpe, 
he was first suspended, and then deposed from the ministry by ap- 
pointment of that prelate. 

Connected with this parish also, as minister for nearly thirty- 
five years, was the Rev. James Hog, an able, learned, and pious 
man. After his return from Holland, whither he had gone to 
complete his education, he received license as a preacher in the 
Scottish Church, and was first settled as minister of Dalserf. 
While here, he became involved in. a dispute with his Presbytery 
in consequence of his opposition to the oaths of allegiance and ab- 
juration. Though of undoubted royalty, yet he greatly dreaded 
theerastian principles which appeared to him to bespreading, and 
felt himself constrained to testify against them. Subsequently he 
demitted his charge at Dalserf, and did not for some years accept 
of another. In 1699, however, he became minister of Carnock, 
and continued to labour there with general acceptance and much 
success till his death. The same piety and the same zeal for the 
liberties and the efficiency of the church as he had shown before, 
distinguished him now. He took an active share in the Marrow 
controversy, and was one of those who, in the year 1720, were 
censured by the General Assembly on account of it. The first 
edition of the Marrow published in Scotland was prefaced by him, 
and, besides some of the ablest tracts that appeared in its defence, 
he wrote several other piece.s of considerable merit. He died in 
the year 1736, leaving behind him a name for distinguished worth 
and usefulness. 

Another minister of this parish was the celebrated Thomas Gil- 
lespie, afterwards founder of the Presbytery of Relief. He was 
licensed to preach the gospel in the year 1740, and in the year fol- 
lowing was ordained by a class of Dissenting ministers in England, 
of which Dr Doddridge was moderator. The same year he re- 
ceived a call to this parish, and was settled in it on the 4th Sep-

tember. In the discharge of his pastoral duties while in Car- 
nock, Mr Gillespie showed great diligence and fidelity. And 
though there are few now alive who have any personal recollec- 
tion of him, yet his memory is still cherished throughout the dis- 
trict. Having, with other members of his Presbytery, refused to 
attend, or to acquiesce in the settlement of Mr Richardson at In- 
verkeithing, he was summarily deposed by the General Assembly 
of 1752. This sentence of deposition he received with the Christ- 
ian meekness which uniformly marked his demeanour. And 
whatever opinion may be entertained of that part of his conduct 
which constituted the sole ground of the sentence pronounced 
against him, no one will question but that he was actuated by a 
sense of duty. His deposition, however, gave rise to a new sect of 
Dissenters. But he himself continued " partial to the Establish- 
ment to the end of his life ; and of this he gave a striking proof, 
when, on his deathbed, he advised his congregation to apply to 
the church after his decease, to be restored to her communion : 
which they afterwards successfully did." His death happened in 
the beginning of the year 1774. 

Before closing these notices, it is right to mention the name of 
Mr Thomas Marshall, who was a minister of Carnock in the time 
of Episcopacy, and who seems to have suffered for his adherence 
to it. The following entry regarding him is found in the session- 
record of the period : " Sep. 4, 1689, Mr Tho. Marschal, minis- 
ter, was silenced by the counsell, in not giving obedience to qt 

 An idle report has been circulated, and gained credit in certain quarters, that 
Mr Gillespie, before his induction, subscribed the confession and formula with re- 
servations and explanations regarding the power of the civil magistrate. Whatever 
opinions he may have entertained on this subject, it is certain that he tendered no ex- 
planation regarding it to the presbytery, wlien he adhibited the usual subscription. 
And we believe that he was too single-minded and honest a man to subscribe with 
any mental reservation. The following extracts, however, from the minutes of Pies- 
bytery, and from the book which contains the usual autograph signatuies to the for- 
mula, should, it is thought, set the matter at rest. After narrating certain circum- 
stances connected with Mr Gillespie's residence in England, &amp;c. the minute of Pres- 
bytery proceeds : After all which, the Presbytery being satisfied with what hjd 
been offered, Mr Gillespie was called in, and havii.g declared his adherence to the 
doctrine, worship, and government of this church, and judicially signed the Confes- 
sion of Faith and formula, the moderator put the call from Carnock into bis hand, 
which he judicially accepted of, upon which Mr Wardlaw took instruments, and the 
Presbytery appoint the settlement to take place, Friday, 4th September. ' Then 
in the book containing the formula is the following entry in Mr Gille-pie's own 
handwriting: " Dunferniling, August 19th 1741, I, Mr Thomas Gillespie, minis- 
ter of the gospel, do subscribe the above written Confession of Faith as the confession 
of my faith, according to the above written formula. Witness my hand at Dunferm- 
ling, the 19th day of August one thousand seven hundred and forty-one. Tlios. 
Gillespie."

then was enjoyn'd." The same record shows him to have been 
diligent and exemplary in the performance of his pastoral duties. 

Land-oioners. — The principal land-owners of the parish, ar- 
ranged according to the extent of their property in it, are, John 
Stuart, Esq. of Carnock ; Sir Peter Halket of Pitfirrane, Bart.; 
Adam Rolland, Esq. of Gask ; Lady Buchan Hepburn of Smea- 
ton Hepburn ; and Mrs Mill of Blair. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers, which consist of 
minutes of session, records of marriages, birth, and burials, and 
accounts of collections and disbursements, commence in 1642, 
and come down, with a few intervals, to the present time. They 
are comprised in eleven volumes of various sizes, some of which 
are much injured, and one of them the duplicate of another that 
is now scarcely legible. An earlier volume than any of the pre- 
sent seems once to have existed ; but it appears not to have con- 
tinued long in the hands of the session, as the following entry in 
the record intimates: " Junii 20, 1647, The kirk registers were 
produced, viz. the covenant and declaration, the acts of the Gene- 
ral Assembly holden at Glasgow 16.38, &amp;c. The old session book 
was amissing." The loss of this volume is much to be regretted, 
because it evidently comprehended the early part of Mr Row's mi- 
nistry, and would probably have thrown much light on the state of 
the parish at that period. The covenant also, another precious 
relic, with its signatures, disappeared at a subsequent time. 

The first of the existing volumes wants thirteen leaves at the 
beginning. It contains the minutes of session from January 30, 
1642, to February 16, 1662; as also an account of collections and 
disbursements, and a few notices of baptisms. The first part of 
this volume appears to be in the handwriting of Mr Row, and 
contains several interesting particulars, both of a local and a gene- 
ral character. The greater part of the remainder of the volume, 
which comprehends the incumbency of Mr Belfrage, seems to 
have been written by the schoolmaster of the time. This latter 
fact is noticed on account of the beauty of the writing, which 
shows the schoolmaster of that period to have been a superior 
penman to most of the clerks that succeeded him, and which in- 
dicates a higher degree of literary attainment than what some men 
are willing to admit as belonging to the time. 

The principal blanks in the registers are from February 1662, 
to February 1665, and from March 2, 1693, to October 23, 1699. 
The more early of these records throw considerable light on the

times to which thoy refer, and bear a strong testimony to the ad- 
vantages which the country at hirge derives from the National 
Church, and show with what intelligence and zeal the men who 
then administered her affairs laboured to reform a rude people, 
and to promote their intellectual and moral advancement. The 
discipline exercised was strict and minute. And, though the 
power that was sometimes assumed may now appear unwarrant- 
able, yet, when we consider the state of the times referred to, and 
the faithful ministrations with which it was accompanied, we shall 
be constrained to admit both that it was not overstretched, and 
that it was used simply with a view to the good of the people 
themselves. Indeed, almost all beneficial undertakings seem to 
have then originated with the Established Church, or to have 
been countenanced and furthered by her. The interests of edu- 
cation, the maintenance of the poor, the ransoming of such as had 
been carried into slavery, the repairing of damage occasioned by 
fire, the building or improving of harbours, bridges, and other 
public works — these objects, in addition to the more peculiar du- 
ties of their office, engaged the attention of ministers and elders, 
and showed them to have been men of sagacity and benevolence 
no less than of piety. 

 The following extracts may be regarded as confirmatory of these remarks, as well 
as interesting in themselves :— " The 3 of November 1643, We, ministeris of the Pres. 
♦ byterie of Dunfer. haifing resolvit to intertene a bursar at the new colledge in St An- 
drews, we stentet qt every kirk within the said Presbyterie suld pay, yt he mycht

1647. Having mist some of our people out of the church this afternoon, it was en- 
acted, that some of our elders, day about, should go through the parish one the Lord's 
day, and see who was absent remaining in their houses ; and if some just and lawll 
cause detained them not, that they should be censured." This regulation was long 
after continued in Carnock — " Oct. 29, 1647. I did exhort the elders tliat they 
wold be carefuU to search and try the parish if ther wer any neighbour at discord

Antiquities. — In the charter granted to Sir George Bruce of 
the barony of Carnock, mention is made of the tower of Carnock; 
and tradition assigns a Roman camp to a farm in the parish which 
bears the name of Camps. No vestiges of either, however, are 
now to be found. Remains of Roman urns were dug up by the 
plough on Carneil hill more than twenty years ago, and a few 
coins have been occasionally met with ; but no certain information 
about them has been obtained by the writer. 

In the former Statistical Account of the parish notice is taken 
of " an ancient cross," situated in the northern division of the vil- 
lage. " This cross," it is said, " is of a circular form, containing 
six rounds of stone steps, rising one above another, and gradually 
diminishing in diameter as they ascend. In the middle grows a 
venerable thorn tree, which was, even within these few years, co- 
vered with leaves and blossoms in summer; but is now much de- 
cayed." This venerable thorn, which was probably more than two 
hundred years old, being reduced at last to a decayed trunk and a 
single branch, and in constant danger of falling, was a few years 
agfo cut down. The cross itself has also been removed. The 
road-maker being abroad, and finding the venerable " rounds of 
steps" in his way, first got them remodelled, and then pulled down 
altogether. And thus, though our carriage-way has been greatly 
improved in consequence, we have been deprived of almost the 
only relic of the olden times that we possessed. Several referen- 
ces are made to the " thorne" in the session record. The fol- 
lowing entry is characteristic: " Feb. 6, 1653. Forasmuch as it 
has been found yt many breaches of the Lord's holy Sabbath has 
been occasioned by people's gathering about the thorne on the 
Sunday afternoone, some by yr buying and selling of servant's 
come in the harvest, and some by other frivolous and idle dis- 

meeting of this date, granted leave to certain pejsons to erect a seat for themselves in 
the church, and'' every one of'them are to give in 24s. to the poor." — " 12 July 1657, 
The elders wer appointed once in the moneth to give ane accompt of those under yr 
scverall charges, and to see who are sick, under necessity, scandalous in yr carriage, 
or defective in familie deuties."' — «' 21 Feb. 1658, A collection was publickly inti- 
mat for the relief of a poor man in Sauling, called Rot. Harrower, who had his

The designation Law Know, given to a small eminence m the 
neighbourhood of the village of Carnock, may be also mentioned, 
as pointing out a place where, it is probable, in feudal times, the 
vassals and dependents were assembled by their superiors for de- 
ciding their differences, and administering justice. 

Modern Buildings.— these there are few to be noticed. 
The mansion-house of Newbigging, in which the Institutes of the. 
Law of Scotland were composed, is still standing. It was design- 
ed, it is said, by one of the Adams, and affords but an indifferent 
specimen of his art at the time. It is at present used as a farm- 
house, and considered a very indifferent one. There is a plain and 
substantial house on the estate of Blair, which was budt about 
thirty years ago. And at Luscar a handsome residence, in the 
old English ov Elizabethan style, has been lately built. And on 
the estate of Carnock Mr Stuart has just erected a small but com- 
modious dwelling. A new church has also been lately erected, 
which, though it be a plain structure, is yet, independently of its 
utility, a great ornament to the place. It is in the Saxon style, 
and in the form of a cross, with a handsome spire, and groined 
ceiling. There is a single corn-mill in the parish. It goes both 
by water and steam. 

in. — Population. 
Nothing very certain can be mentioned regarding the ancient 
state of the population of the parish, except that it seems to have 
been more scattered than it is at present. Judging from the re- 
gister of births, the number of inhabitants, nearly 200 years ago, 
vvould not amount to much above 350. At that time, the village 
of Carnock was the only one in the parish, and of small extent. 
The others are of comparatively recent date. And as manufac- 
tures had then made little progress, the population was chiefly 
engao-ed in agricultural pursuits, and in the domestic labours which 
werehen requisite for procuring the necessary supplies of lood 
and clothing.

According to Dr Webster's survey in 1755, the population was 583

The cause of the decrease shown by the census of 181 1 appears 
to have been the ceasing of some coal-works in the parish, about 
the commencement of the century; and the increase which the 
subsequent surveys give is sufficiently accounted for by the im- 
provements in trade, manufactures, and agriculture.

Agriculture. — The number of imperial acres in the parish 
which are cultivated, is 1665. The number uncultivated, besides 
what are occupied with roads, fences, &amp;c., is about 45 ; and of 
these only a few acres could be profitably added to the cultivat- 
ed land. 450 acres are under wood. 

There is no natural wood in the parish, The plantations con- 
sist of larch, spruce, and Scotch firs, oak, beech, elm, chestnut, 
and ash. The different kinds of fir, the oak, and the beech seem 
to be best adapted to the soil. The wood of the ash and the elm

is said to be of an inferior quality. Sonne of the plantations have 
not been much attended to. The management of them, however, 
has, of late years, been much improved, and their value in conse- 
quence been increased. 

Prices. — A close cart and wheels with iron axle costs from L.8 to 
L.IO, according to the quality ; open carts for corn and hay cost 
L.3 ; with wheels, L.6 ; an iron plough costs L.4 ; and a wooden 
plough, L.2 ; a pair of harrows mounted costs L.2 ; a break har- 
row for two or three horses costs from L.l, 10s. to L.2; fanners 
vary in price from L.6 to L.8; a turnip barrow costs L.l ; a stone 
roller from L.3 to L.4 ; the price of an iron drill pbugh is L.2, 
10s., and of a wooden one, L.l ; a horse-hoe costs L.l ; a grub- 
ber, L.8 ; a paring plough costs L.2 ; a drill sowing-machine va- 
ries in price according to the width : one used in the parish cost 
L.11 ; riddles average 3s. 6d. each ; a bushel costs 12s. ; a potato 
firlot, 1 Os. 6d. harness of a pair of horses for cart and plough is 
bought for L.10 ; a grape costs 3s. ; a spade, 3s. 6d.; a shovel, 
4s. ; a mattock, 4s. ; a horse-shoe made and driven costs 9d., iron 
furnished by the smith ; laying plough-irons. Is. 3d., iron also fur- 
nished by the smith ; sharpening plough-irons, 2d. ; shoeing a 
pair of cart wheels, including iron, L.l, 7s.; building ruble wall 
per rood, exclusive of material, L.2, 5s. ; plastering per yard, do. 
3d. ; a horse and cart per day, 4s. 6d. ; a day's ploughing, 8s. 

Livestock.— A considerable number of sheep are grazed in the 
parish. The cattle commonly reared are the Fife and Teeswater ; 
but small attention is paid to the improvement of the breed. The 
number of cattle reared in the parish is not great,— the attention 
of the farmers being more directed to the raising of grain than to 
grazing. The horses differ not from those generally used in the 
district, and are, for the most part, kept in good condition. 

The general state of husbandry in the parish is at least equal 
to that in the surrounding district. Ploughing is executed, for the 
most part, in a superior style ; but the reaping is often done m ra- 
ther a careless manner, much grain being left on the field. Dram- 
iug, both with stones and tiles, is at present carried on with much 
spirit, on almost every farm in the parish, and with the most bene- 
ficial results. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years ; and these are 
chiefly, it is believed, drawn up in such a way as to be mutually 
advantageous to the proprietor and the tenant. 

Farm-buildings have been much improved of late years ; and 

• Of late, however, a good many have been fattened for slaughter. 



CARNOCK.

the whole of them are now in a respectable and comfortable con- 
dition. Some of them are very complete. They are all covered 
either with slate or tile. Thrashing-mills are attached to them 
all, except one; and of these, six are driven by horses, one by 
water, four by steam, and one by steam and water. At three of 
the farms are saw-mills. The enclosures also have been of late 
much attended to, and considerably improved. They consist both 
of stone fences and hedges. The latter are increasing. A con- 
siderable extent of stone wall, in the south part of the parish, has 
lately been removed, and been replaced by hedges ; and of the 
many new enclosures which have been recently formed, not one 
has been of stone. The hedges are in general well managed, and 
in good condition. 

The rents are generally a fixed money rent, without reference 
to the fiars. The tenantry, for the most part, are in comfortable 
circumstances; and the families of several of them have been lonar 
on the farms which they at present occupy. They are a sober 
and industrious body of men. But, perhaps, a greater command 
of capital on their part, and greater encouragement on the part of 
proprietors, would be necessary to enable them to turn the whole 
capabilities of the land to account.

Manufactures. — There are no spinning-mills nor public manu- 
factures in this parish. No fewer, however, than 205 persons ar e

employed in weaving,— 155 males, and 50 females. They are 
all, with the exception of one or two, who do country work, de- 
pendent upon the neighbouring town af Dunfermline, and get their 
webs from thence ready for the loom. The kinds of cloth worked 
are table-linens and table-covers. These last consist of cotton and 
worsted. The number of looms in the parish is 208. Of these, 
159 are mounted with Jacquard machines, and may average m 
value, along with the machine, L.15. The remaining looms, 
which are without machines, may average L.4 each. The value 
of the whole looms, in the parish may be estimated at L.2500, 
reckoning them at what they cost when new. A gross of pirns, 
value 2s., is generally allowed to each loom. Connected with this 
branch of manufacture, also, there are in use 83 pairs of wheels 
and swifts. Each pair, consisting of a wheel and a swift, costs 
from lis. to 14s. These are used in winding pirns,— a depart- 
ment of the trade which is generally allotted to females or to young 
persons. Each loom may consume a boll of potatoes during the 
year in the shape of dressing, or a quantity of flour equal in value. 
Nifflers and rollers, which are used in beaming webs, are also pro- 
vided by the weavers, and cost L.3 the set. And as a number of 
persons are required to beam a web, the weavers form themselves 
into societies, commonly called quarters, and have a set of nifflers 
to each. 

Weavers receive so much a spindle for their work ; and as that 
varies with the kind of cloth, and as the quantity wrought by dif- 
ferent workmen in a given time differs considerably, it is not easy 
to ascertain with accuracy theiraverage earnings, either by the 
day or by the week. It may be stated, however, that at present 
those employed in weaving can scarcely be said to have a fair re- 
muneration and support from their labours.  

V._Parochial Economy. 

Marhet-Toion.— There is no market-town in the parish. The 
nearest is Dunfermline, three miles distant from the centre of 
Carnock, where there are weekly markets and frequent fairs. 
The villages in the parish are, Carnock, Gowkhall, and Cairney- 
hill. A fair for cattle, &amp;c. is held annually at Carnock, on the 
2Gth May ; and when that happens to be Sunday, the fair is held 
on the Saturday previous. 

. This account of the manutactures is properly descriptive of their state a year or 
two So for at present, many of the weavers are out of employment. But .t ,s to 
te hoped that the depression of trade will only be temporary.

Means of Communication.— k penny-post, in connection with 
Dunfermline, was procured for the village of Carnock in the year 
1838, and has proved a great convenience to the inhabitants. It 
passes daily. The Culross and Kincardine posts also pass through 
Cairneyhill twice a-day. The only stage-coach is that between 
Kirkcaldy and Glasgow, which passes daily through Cairneyhill. 
But from Dunfermline there is communication with Edinburgh 
twice a-day by coaches ; and the steam-boats between Sliding 
and Edinburgh are easily accessible to our population. Carriers 
go twice a-week from Cairneyhill to Edinburgh, and once a-week 
from the same to Auchterarder, Crieff, and Comrie. 

The length of turnpike roads in the parish is only between five 
and six miles. They are kept in good repair. The statute-la- 
bour roads, however, are generally very indifferent. The one es- 
pecially between the villages of Carnock and Cairneyhill, and 
which forms the principal parish road, was, until lately, in a 
wretched state. The line is bad, and there is little prospect of 
getting it altered ; so that the intercourse between these villages 
is very much impeded, especially in winter. 

There are six bridges in or on the confines of the parish. 
They are all small, but in good condition. The two oldest have 
had an addition made to their width, subsequent to their first 
erection. Above the arch of the one of these, which is in the 
village of Carnock, there are two stones with an inscription on 
each. The one contains the following in raised letters ; MR. t. 
ROW PASTOR ANNO D. 1638; and the other contains the words 
GEORGE BRUCE OF CARNOK. But whether this date marks the 
age of the oldest part of the bridge, or of a previous erection, is 
somewhat uncertain. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The former parish church stood near the 
.village of Carnock, and was conveniently situated for upwards of 
one-half of the population. It was distant from the furthest ex- 
tremity of the parish a little more than two miles, and from the 
nearest somewhat more than one mile. It was old, inconveniently 
small, and most uncomfortable. The time of its being built is 
unknown. The date 1602, with the letters g. b., appears on it ; 
but it is evident that part of the building at least was much older 
than that. From Row's Historie just published, it appears that it 
was repaired in the year 1602, when the roof of heath was re- 
placed by one of heavy gray slate. It was again repaired in the 
year 1641; and in the year 1815, the gray slate roof was replaced 



A-

by one of Eisdale slate. A few years ago, some further repairs 
were made on it, which rendered it more comfortable. But in 
1838, the presbytery, on a report by Gillespie Graham, Esq. 
Architect, condemned it, and issued a decreet for building a new 
church, in which the heritors unanimously acquiesced. The 
greater part of the walls still remain, and form an interesting re- 
lic of the olden times. The old church bell bore the date 1638; 
but it was lately recast. On the pulpit, which was of oak, was the 
date 1674, with this motto, Sermonem vitce prcehenti, Phil. ii. 16. 
The materials of this pulpit have been converted into a chair and 
table, for the communion elements, in the new church, preserving 
as much of their original appearance as was consistent with what 
they have been adopted to. 

The new church, which was planned by John Henderson, Esq. 
Architect, Edinburgh, contains 400 sittings on the ground-floor ; 
provision being made for the erection of galleries afterwards to 
contain 200 more, if required. It is an exceedingly comfortable 
place of worship. The site chosen for it is only at a short dis- 
tance from that of the old church ; no other place being more 
convenient, considering the localities of the parish. It was opened 
for worship in May 1840, and proves a great accommodation to 
the parish. 

The manse was built in 1802. It underwent some repairs in 
1829, and is in pretty good condition ; though, from the defects 
of its construction originally, it is still cold. The old offices were 
removed in 1829, and the present ones built. They are small, 
but comfortable. A barn and cart-shed, however, are still to be 
erected. The glebe contains a little more than eight acres, ex- 
clusive of the space occupied by the manse, offices, and garden. 
It is at present worth L.24 a-year. 

The stipend is one of those which receive aid from Government. 
It consists of 6 1 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 1 lippy of meal ; 30 
bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck, 3,| lippies of bear; 19 bolls of oats; and 
L.216, Is. 4d. Scots, being the whole teinds of the parish. The 
Government allowance is L.36, 10s. 6d. 

The number of persons belonging to the Established Church 
is 652. Tlie number of families, 127. The average attendance 
durino' the summer months mav be estimated at 220. The num- 
ber who are in the habit of attending throughout the year, but not 
all present at any one time, amounts to upwards of 350. Several 
persons, belonging to the Establishment, are in the habit of at- 



CAIINOCK.

tending worship in the neighbouring parish churches. The num- 
ber of communicants on the roll at last communion, belonging to 
the congregation, and exclusive of those who worship in other 
parishes, was about 200. Previous to 1828, the number on the 
roll was 93; and in 1833, it was 151. 

There is one Dissenting meeting-house in the parish. It ori- 
ginated about 1748, and is situated in the village of Cairneyhill. 
The congregation belongs to the United Associate Synod. The 
number of sittings in the meeting-house is 400. The minister's 
stipend is L.96, derived from seat rents and collections, besides a 
house and garden, and a glebe of two acres. The whole number 
of Dissenters of all denominations in the parish is 598. Of these, 
about 400 profess to belong to the congregation at Cairneyhill ; 
two are Episcopalians, and one a Roman Catholic, who occasionally 
worship in the parish church; and the remainder, adhering to 
the United Secession, the Rehef, and the Original Burghers, 
attend places of worship belonging to their respective denomina- 
tions in Dunfermhne. Of those not known to belong to any re- 
lioious denomination, the number is 19. 

The average amount of church collections, &amp;c. yearly for re- 
ligious and charitable objects, besides the ordinary weekly collec- 
tions for the poor, may be estimated at upwards of L.IO. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish ; one, the pa- 
rochial school, in Carnock village ; and the other at Cairneyhill. 

The branches of instruction taught in the two schools at present 
existing, are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, English gram- 
mar, geography, and sometimes Latin and Greek. The parochial 
schoolmaster has the maximum salary, and a small mortification 
of the value of 5s, 6d. annually. This mortification is the inte- 
rest of 100 merks bequeathed the kirk-session of Carnock, for 
behoof of the schoolmaster, by Principal Row, " calling to mynd," 
as the deed of mortification in the principal's hand-writing states 
" the place of my birth, and first initiating in letters." The 
schoolmaster at Cairneyhill has a free school-house ; but is other- 
wise wholly dependent upon the school fees. 

Besides the faciUties afforded for the education of the young 
by the two schools already mentioned, the inhabitants of the east- 
ern portion of the parish have the privilege of sending their chil- 
dren to a well-conducted school, which is connected with a public 
work in the parish of Dunfermline. 

In 1834, the number of children at school was 210. Subse- 



714 



PIFESHIRE. 



quently, the number decreased considerably, and has never since 
reached that number. This diminution, especially of late, has 
been owing to the depression of trade. 

The parochial teacher has barely the legal accommodation. 
The school-room is small and ill -furnished ; and the dwelling- 
house, which is above, is in ill-repair and uncomfortable. 

A seminary for young ladies has for a number of years past 
been successfully conducted at Cairneyhill, by Mrs More. Be- 
sides the ordinary branches of education, there are taught French, 
Italian, English composition, music, drawing, and other branches, 
both useful and ornamental, that are usually taught in the most 
respectable boarding- schools. The terms are moderate, and the 
seminary is flourishing. 

Libraries. — There are two libraries in the parish ; one in the 
village of Cairneyhill, which has existed several years ; the other 
in the village of Carnock, which was established by means of col- 
lections and subscriptions by the minister in the year 1840, and 
which now consists of about 250 volumes. The desire for read- 
ing has of late been increasing among the people. 

Friendly Societies. — The only association of this kind in the pa- 
rish is what is called the Dead Fund, the object of which is to 
assist in defraying the expenses of funerals. On the occasion of 
a death in the family of a member, a certain sum is paid out of 
the fund to the survivors, each member contributing a shilling or 
a sixpence, as the sum to be paid may be greater or less. This 
association has proved very beneficial. 

Savings' Banks. — There is no Savings' Bank in the parish. 
The nearest is in the town of Dunfermline. A Savings' Bank 
was established there a good many years ago; but as a national 
•one was opened in 1838, the deposits of the old bank were trans- 
ferred to it. Few persons, however, in this parish avail themselves 
of the advantages which it offers. 

. Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
on the permanent poor's roll, including those that are dependent 
upon them, is 12. Of these some receive 5s. a month, and some 
as low as 3s. 6d. One pauper receives 2s. a week. Besides those 
on the permanent roll, there are several that receive occasional 
relief. The funds to meet these expenses consist of collections at 
the church doors, mortcloth-dues, the interest of L.200 of money 
accumulated in former years by the session, and now invested in 
the Dunfermline gas stock, and a voluntary assessment by the 



CAUNOCK. 



713 



heritors when required. The average annual amount of church 
collections for relief of the poor may be estimated at L.ll, 7s. 7d. 
The mortcloth-dues now yield a very small sum, as m these days 
of reform many think it better to support a small concern of then- 
own/than to be the means of contributing a little for the relief ot 
the poor by using the parish mortcloth; and the heritors do not 
choose to litigate the matter with them. The burden on account 
of the poor of this parish, however, is by no means heavy. The 
sum annually distributed among paupers on permanent roll, in oc- 
casional relief to persons not on roll, and in the education of poor 
children, has not, on an average of several years, exceeded L.36 ; 
a fact which testifies to the general comfort of the population, and 
shows that there is a creditable disposition among the poor to re- 
frain from seeking parochial relief. 

Fairs.— On\y one fair is held in the parish in the year. It is 
chiefly a cattle and shoe market, and is held on the 26th May, 
except when that happens to be Sunday, in which case the fair is 
held on the 27th. Much busiriess used formerly to be transacted 
at it ; but now the attendance is comparatively small. 

jfins. When the former account of the parish was written, the 

number of inns or alehouses appears to have been ten, viz. four in 
Carnock, five in Cairneyhill, and one at Blair. A considerable 
improvement has since taken place in this respect, for the number 
of these houses now amounts only to five, viz. two in Carnock, two 
in Cairneyhill, and one at Gowkhall. 

Puel.—Co&amp;\ is the only fuel used in the parish. It is procured 
either at the Blair colliery in the parish, or at some of the pits in 
the neighbouring parish of Dunfermhne. The price of the for- 
mer varies from 5s. to 6s. a ton of 20 cwt., and that of the latter 
from 5s. to 6s., and sometimes more, a ton, at the pit mouth. 
Miscellaneous Observations- 
Since the former Statistical Account was written, the general 
appearance of the parish has evidently been much improved. 
With the exception of a few acres of moor, and of what is occu- 
pied by wood, roads, fences, and water, the whole surface is under 
cultivation. Agriculture has greatly improved ; the means of 
communication has much increased ; trade and manufactures have 
received a new impulse. Farms have been enlarged. Oxen are 
no longer employed in husbandry. Thrashing-machines are in ge- 
neral use. Draining is now much attended to. Bone-dust is 
used extensively in turnip husbandry. The rental of the parish,

which in 1791 amounted to L.llOOa year, including the proceeds 
of the feus, may now be estimated at nearly L.3000. And it 
is not to be doubted that the population generally have kept 
pace with their neighbours, in the ordinary comforts of life, and in 
their endeavours to increase them.

PaESBYTERY OF DUNFERMLINE, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. HUGH RALPH, LL.D., MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Extent, 8fc. — The name Aberdour, in Gaelic, signifies 
"the mouth of the water," referring in this instance to a rivulet, which 
empties itself into the Forth, a little below the village. It is 
bounded by the parish of Dalgety on the west ; by those of Beath 
and Auchtertoul, on the north ; by Kinghorn and Burntisland, on 
the east ; and by the Forth, on the south ; being, at an average, 
about three miles from east to west, and as much from north to 
south. A small part of the parish is detached from the rest, by 
the intervening parishes of Burntisland and Kinghorn, and lies at 
the distance of four or five miles. The number of acres may be 
about 5000. The parish is divided by a ridge of hills, running 
nearly from east to west. The north part is a cold and bleak track, 
considerably above the level of the sea, and, excepting what has 
been done by one of the heritors on the north-west corner of 
the parish, altogether unsheltered, either by hedges or plantations. 
The soil is cold and sour. On the south of this ridge, both the 
soil and the climate are much more kindly. 

Coast. — The parish stretches along the shore above two miles. 
From the east boundary the coast is rugged and steep, and gene- 
rally covered with wood to the water's edge. The trees have 
been planted with a proper regard to effect, and the jutting 
rocks which appear in different places, render the whole ex- 
tremely picturesque and beautiful. This wood is intersected with

AUERDOUR.

walks cut out on the face of the hill, from which the prospects are 
rich and varied. On the west, there is a beautiful white sandy bay, 
surrounded with trees. Here the grounds rise gently to the west, 
bordered by thriving plantations ; and stretching southward, they 
terminate in a perpendicular rock washed by the sea. — By this rock 
on the east, and by headlands on the south-west, the small har- 
bour of Aberdour is well -sheltered from all winds. 

II. — Civil History. 
Inchcolm.— The parish of Aberdour belonged to the monastery 
of Inchcolm. This monastery was founded about the beginning 
of the twelfth century by Alexander I. in consequence of a vow. 
Sibbald says, that the western part of Aberdour was given by one 
of the Mortimers to this monastery, for the privilege of bury- 
ing in the church. There is a tradition, that the corpse of one of 
the family was thrown overboard in a storm, which gives the name 
of Mortimer's Deep to the channel between the island and the 
shore. This western part of Aberdour, together with the lands 
and barony of Beath, are said to have been acquired from an 
Abbot of Inchcolm, by James, afterwards Sir James Stuart, 
second son of Andrew Lord Evandale, grandfather by his 
daughter to the admirable Crichton, and by his second son, Lord 
Doune, to Sir James Stuart, who married the daughter of the 
Regent Murray. Lord Doune was Commendator of the monas- 
tery of Inchcolm at the Reformation. The whole of the above- 
mentioned property, together with the island itself, is still in the 
family of Moray, with the title] of St Colme. The Earl of Mo- 
ray attempted to cover the island with trees, which would have 
increased its picturesque appearance, but the attempt did not suc- 
ceed. — Old Stat. Account. 

Antiquities. — Not far from the village of Aberdour, on a flat on 
the top of a hill, there is one of those cairns or tumuli so frequent- 
ly met with in Scotland. A coffin and several earthen vessels, 
containing human bones, were found in it. A small plain tomb- 
stone erected on the south wall of the old church to the memory 
of the Rev. Robert Blair, minister of St Andrews, in Fife, and 
Chaplain to Charles I., who was ejected from his charge by 
Archbishop Sharp in 1661, and died at Couston, in this parish, 
1666. The inscription is in Latin, but nearly defaced. 

Parochial Registers. — These consist of minutes of kirk-session, 
commencing in 1649; baptisms in 1663; distributions to poor, 
1658; collections at the kirk, 1659; marriages, 1609; deaths,

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. J. MACDONALD, D. D., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of this parish in old writings is variously 
spelled Camback, Kembek, and Kembok. It is by some held to 
be the modern form of Kemp-achar, " the field of battle ;" 
but it is more generally supposed that the first syllable is de- 
rived from the name of the Kem or Kame, a brook which, 
taking its rise in the hills of Scoonie parish, about seven miles 
west, traverses Kemback parish and is there united to the 
Eden. The course of this brook through a broken and wood-

FIFESHIRE. 



ed glen is highly picturesque, and although on a smaller scale 
bears much resemblance, in its natural features, to the celebrat- 
ed pass of Glen Farg at the north-west extremity of Fifeshire. 
And while Dura Den, as this ravine is called, is the chief attrac- 
tion to the lover of landscape, the rest of the parish, from the un- 
dulating character of the ground, and the abundance of timber, 
has altogether a richer appearance than most parts of the country, 
and contrasts favourably with the bare though highly cultivated 
districts which surround it. 

Extent and Boundaries. — Kemback is bounded on the east, by 
a line of two miles in length, running nearly due north and south, 
which divides it from the parish of St Andrews. Its northern 
boundary is the river Eden, separating it from Leucharsand Dair- 
sie; it joins Cupar on the west, and Ceres on the south. Its 
greatest length, which is from north-east to south-west, is about 
three miles, and it is at few places more than a mile and a-half in 
breadth. It is formed by a ridge of hills called Nydie or Kem- 
back hills, running through it from east to west, sloping gently to- 
wards the south, and somewhat abruptly to the north. The highest 
point of elevation is Clatto hill, which is 548 feet above the level 
of the sea. Nearly the whole of this range of eminences, not 
long ago a barren heath, is now covered by thriving plantations. 

Climate. — From the sheltered position, and the increase of 
wood, the climate is milder than most of the surrounding country : 
and many of the inhabitants have attained to a very advancd age. 
The beneficial effect of cultivation and drainage on climate and 
health is shown by the fact, that some of the older inhabitants who 
have resided in the parish all their lives, recollect that, about fifty 
or sixty years ago, ague was a very prevalent disorder every 
spring; whereas this complaint is now scarcely known. 

So27.— The parish contains almost every variety of soil, as bar- 
ren black sand, peat, gravel, black and brown loam, and rich 
strong clay of great fertility. Much has been done of late years 
in draining the cold wet soil, with manifest advantage ; but on 
the greater part of the north side of the parish, this is unnecessary, 
the immediate subsoil being dry loose gravel. 

Pishing.— The Eden affords tolerably good trout-fishing in 
spring and autumn, and there is a right of salmon fishing attached to 
the lands of Kemback, which, however, is now quite unproductive. 

Geology. The rocks consist of sandstone, ironstone, shale, and 

trap. The sandstone is of two kinds, and belongs to two great de- 

3 



KEMBACK. 



21 



posits ; one of which is connected with the coal formation, and the 
other with that of the old red sandstone. The geological corre- 
sponds with the geographical position of the parish, which occupies 
an intermediate place betwixt the coal-field on the south, and the 
old red sandstone on the north. The lower beds of the former 
rest inconformably' on the upper beds of the latter. The trap 
consists of veins of greenstone and a few isolated patches of clink- 
stone. A vein of lead ore also occurs in the series. 

Dura Den, a beautiful and interesting valley, traverses the pa- 
rish nearly at right angles to the plain of the sedimentary depo- 
sits, and exhibits a well-defined section of the entire series of these 
beds. Without leaving the road, the whole are laid open to the 
eye of the observer, and may conveniently be examined in detail. 

The geology of this district has lately acquired very considera- 
ble celebrity. Dr Anderson was the first who drew the attention 
of the learned to its interesting relics, in his essay on the Geology 
of Fifeshire, published in the Transactions of the Highland So- 
ciety. Since that time it has been visited by some of the most 
eminent in the science, and commented upon in various publica- 
tions. 

The sandstone beds, which belong to the old red, are here of a 
bright yellow colour, and attain a thickness of from three to four 
hundred feet. Their position in the series is determined by their 
organic remains, which are identical in every respect with those 
found in the red formation. They also lie conformably on that de- 
posit, as may be observed at the out-crop at Dairsie church, both 
having an inclination of nearly 10°. Towards the base of the rock, 
the sandstone assumes a variegated reddish appearance, where 
soft beds of marl or clay are interposed, and which vary from an 
inch to several feet in thickness. The lineal extent of the depo- 
sit, of which a section is here laid open, is nearly a mile, and rises 
in precipitous mural cliffs of great height, indented with caves, in 
which the persecuted of a former age are said to have found an asy- 
lum. 

The whole deposit is extremely rich in organic remains. Seve- 
ral entire fishes, with fins, tail, scales, and thinnest filmy members, 
have been procured. Along with three or four belonging to com- 
pletely new species, if not genera, and of which no account has 
yet been published, specimens of the Holoptychius, N., and Pte- 
richthys are to be found in the greatest abundance. Beautiful 
flates of five distinct animals are figured in Dr Anderson's Essay. 



722 FIFESHIUE. 

" The place in the rock," says this accurate observer, " which 
these curious relics occupied was towards the base, and immedi- 
ately under the argillaceous marly beds mentioned above. Ex- 
ternally they have undergone but little change in their form, co- 
lour, or scaly covering ; being still as perfect in their organic de- 
velopement, even to the minute silken tin, as when they sported 
in the waters of a distant primeval age. The substance of the 
body, however, and every trace or vestige of internal organization, 
have entirely disappeared, and the material of the rock has been 
substituted in their place,— the enamel of the scales being less 
soluble than the more calcareous matter of which the bones are 
composed." 

A vein of greenstone separates the sandstone now described 
from the beds which belong to the coal formation, throwing them 
up to an angle of 26°. The junction is extremely well defined ; 
the sandstones are contorted in every possible form, as well as 
highly indurated, by the infusion of the volcanic rock. Two thm 
seams of coal may be observed at this locality. The ironstone 
and shaly matter occur about a quarter of a mile to the south, 
where they have assumed a nearly horizontal position. " The ga- 
lena," says Dr Anderson, " occurs on the farm of Myretown of 
Blebo, and was noticed so early as the year 172-2, when large out- 
liers or masses of ore were found on the surface of the ground. 
The papers in the possession of the present proprietor. General 
Bethune, describe these as weighing from ten to twenty-four stones 
in weight. A vein was opened about two feet thick, but would 
seem to have been speedily abandoned in consequence of the 
hardness of the rock, which required to be blasted with gun-pow- 
der. Subsequently, and a little to the north, another vein was 
discovered, probably a continuation only of the first, which is 
described as containing a " rib" of metal of three inches, and 
gradually increasing to seven inches in thickness. Various at- 
tempts were made from time to time to work the mines, but the 
disturbed and ruptured state of the strata, and frequent intrusion 
of the trap, prevented the operations from being successfully car- 
ried on. The vein bears in a north-east by south-west direction." 

Civil History. 
Remains of tumuli may be traced in one or two places, and re- 
lics have at dilferent times been discovered, both of Roman ori- 
gin, and of feudal times, but not of any peculiar interest. There 
are in the grounds of Kemback, the remains of an old burying-

ground, but there is no trace of its history or of any building con- 
nected with it. 

Land-owners, c-c— The number of heritors is five, of whom the 
principal is General Alexander Bethune of Blebo, &amp;c. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest registers are those of bap- 
tisms and burials, which both commence in the year 1735. That 
of proclamations begins 1st October 1783. The records appear 
at one period to have been made irregularly ; and there is no ac- 
count of the burials from 1738 to 1750. The only session book 
extant commences in the year 1732, and continues with some m- 
terruption to April 1775.

which the property- tax was assessed in 1815, was L.3441 Ster- 
ling, and in the new valuation roll, drawn up by order of the Com- 
missioners of Supply in 1841, the gross annual value of the land 
is stated at L.3889, 2s. 8d. Sterling.

About 500 acres of the arable land is occupied by the proprietors 
themselves, and the extent let to tenants is 1480. The leases 
under which it is held are generally for nineteen years ; though 
some now nearly expired are for ninety-nine years. A proportion 
of the rents are payable according to the fiars' prices of grain, and 
the average rent, under recent leases, may be estimated at L.l, 
12s. per imperial acre. 

Part of the land adjoining the river Eden, and consisting of 
rich alluvial clay, is exceedingly fertile, and has been known to 
produce 64 bushels of wheat on a Scotch acre. Of late years, 
however, the crops of this grain have been very unproductive, 
partly from the inclemency of the seasons, and partly, it may be 
supposed, from the gradual exhaustion of the chemical elements 
in the soil, which are most favourable to its production. One 
farm, held under a long lease, has for many years been constantly 
in pasture, some of the inclosures of which were let during the 
last season for above L.6 per Scotch acre. 

A considerable extent of the lands of Blebo were feued by a 
former proprietor of that estate, and about 100 acres are now held 
in this way, in lots of from two to fifteen acres, at moderate feu- 
duties, nearly all of it having been reclaimed from unproductive 
heath. The number of resident families in possession of these 
feus is about twenty, and most of them are partly or principally 
employed in other handicrafts, or as labourers on the adjommg 
farms. 

Wages.— The average wages of farm-labourers is, for men, Is. 
ed. ; and for women, 8d. per day. 

The usual number of horses kept for agricultural purposes is 
about fifty-four. There are nine thrashing-machines, seven of 
which are worked by horse-power, one by steam, and one by water. 

Manufactures.— There are two mills for spinning yarns m the 
parish, both occupied by Mr David Yool, and both situated on 
the Kame or Ceres Burn : 1. Yoolfield Mill, built in 1839, 
driven by a water-wheel of 39 feet diameter, and 10 feet wide, 
assisted, when the water is scarce, by a steam-engine. There are 
now employed at it 98 women and giris, earning on an average 
5s. per week ; 7 wrights, at 12s. 6d. ; 10 men, at 12s. ; 7 boys at 
4s • 6 labourers, at 9s. ; and 30 hecklers. 2. Blebo mills, further 
up 'the stream, worked by a water-wheel and steam-engine of ten- 
horse power, at which are employed 4 men at an average at 13s. 
per week; 3 boys, at 4s. ; and 37 females, at 10s. 3L

At Blebo mills, there is also a meal-mill, a barley-mill, and a 
flax scutching-mill. 

At Kemback mill, on the same stream, but further down, and 
also tenanted by Mr Yool, a wheel of sixteen horse power impels 
a meal-mill, a saw-mill, and a bone-mill, by which from 500 to 
600 tons of bones are ground annually, and about 150 tons of 
rape-cake. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Stipend and GMe.— The stipend is, wheat, 4 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 
pecks, 1 lippy; meal, 3 bolls, 3 pecks; bear, 21 bolls, 1 firlot, 
S lippies; oats, 29 bolls, 1 firlot, 3 lippies ; and money, L.109, 
8s. 9d. The glebe extends to about 5 Scotch acres. 

In the year 1446, Robertus de Ferny and Mariota Olifert, his- 
wife, lady of Kemback, granted to Gilbert de Galbrath, rector of 
the church of Kemback, and to his successors, four acres of the 
lands of Kemback with three cows' grass, and one horse's grass for 
ever, to be held on condition of the rector being always bound to 
say two masses weekly in the said church, for them, their parents, 
and benefactors, " purgatorii poenas demoUire, et fidelium ani- 
mas in paradisi gaudiis coUocare." The deed and confirmation 
by the Bishop of St Andrews is witnessed by James, abbot of the 
monastery of Lundoris ; John, archdeacon of St Andrews ; Hugo 
Kennedy, chaplain of St Andrews ; John Beatoun, rector of Dairy ; 
and rector of the University of St Andrews ; John de Balfour, vicar 
of Lynlytholk ; James Treyle de Malgaske ; Thomas de Wemyss 
de Myrtyn ; James Butellere de Rumgally ; Alexander de Forsitb 
de Nydy, and others. 

Patronage c. — The teinds and right of patronage belonged to 
the archbishopric of St Andrews. By the original charter of 1458, 
founding the old college of St Salvador's, they were appropriated 
by Bishop Kennedy, the founder, to the licentiatus or second 
master of that college, who was appointed ex officio rector, or par- 
son of the parish, with a pension of L. 10 Scots for a vicar to b&amp; 
presented by the rector. In 1579, the University was remodelled 
by James VI., when the office of licentiatus was suppressed; but 
the right to the teinds and patronage of Kemback was reserved to 
the college; and as the second master had the right of presenting 
the vicar, the college, which came in place of the second master, 
continued to present. Since the union of the Colleges of St Sal- 
vador's and St Leonard's, in 1747, the Principal and Professors of 



726 FIFESHIKE. 

the United College have been patrons of the parish, and titirlars 
of the teinds. 

The following is a list of the ministers of the parish since the 
Reformation. The three first in the list were masters of St Sal- 
vador's, and ex officio ministers of Kemback : 

1. Mr William Ramsay was minister in 1666; died 1570.

4. Mr George Nairn, admitted 1596, translated to Kennoway 
1604. 

5. Mr David Monypenny, who resumed the charge 1604, at 
the desire of the congregation, who petitioned the Presbytery to 
that effect on Mr Nairn's translation. He was deposed for forni- 
cation, October 7, 1617.

It is worthy of remark, that only two mductions have taken place 

since 1703, a period of 139 years, and only one since 1736 ; Mr 
Walker having been minister of the parish fifty-five, and the 
present venerable incumbent the long period of sixty-one years

Education —There is one unendowed school besides the paro- 
chial school ; the number of scholars at both together averaging 
from 70 to 80. There is also a girl's school at Kemback mill, 
partly supported by ladies in the parish. 

The parochial teacher has the full legal salary ; but the present 
incumbent, being incapacitated from performing his duties, the he- 
ritors at present employ another teacher in his place at a salary of 
L 14 per annum. He states his annual profit from fees at L. 16 ; 
and he has also about L. 3 as session-clerk. The common 
branches of elementary education only are taught, there being but 
one pupil taking lessons in Latin. 

Poor.— The number of poor regularly supplied is from 15 to 20. 
The amount of voluntary assessment is about L. 11, 10s., besides 
which the session possess a fund bequeathed by one of the family 
of Blebo, amounting to L. 250.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNFERMLINE, SYNOD OF FIFE . 

THE REV. THOMAS DOIG, A. M., MINISTER. 



L Topography and Natural History. 

Name, c. — The parish of Torryburn consists of the united pa- 
rishes of Torrie and Crombie. Crombie appears to have con- 
sisted of the district of the present parish south of the burn of 
Torrie, and of certain detached lands, distant about seven or 
eight miles, and now annexed quoad sacra to the parish of Saline. 
In lieu of these, the lands of Inzievar and Oakley, belonging, 
quoad civilia, to the parish of Sahne, but cut off by the interven- 
ing parish of Carnock, have been annexed, quoad sacra to Tor- 
ryburn. Torry, the original name of the parish to which these 
annexations have been m'ade, is said to signify, in Gaelic, the 



- FIFESHIRE. 

king's height ; while the more modern name of Torryburn may 
be traced to the circumstance of the parish church being situated 
by the side of the biam of Torrie. 

Situation and Extent. — The parish, as now constituted, forms 
the extreme south-west corner of the county of Fife. It is bound- 
ed on the west, by the parish of Culross, in the county of Perth ; 
on the north, by the parish of Carnock ; on the east, by the 
parishes of Carnock and Dunfermline ; and on the south and 
south-west, by the Frith of Forth, which separates it from the 
parishes of Carriden and Bo'ness, in the county of Linlith- 
gow. It is about five miles in length, and from one to two in 
breadth, comprising an area of five or six square miles. The 
surface is beautifully varied. The higher grounds command se- 
veral fine views of the frith and its opposite shore; and, in the 
distance, the castle and part of the city of Edinburgh are seen. 

Hydrography. — Besides the burn of Torrie, there are two small 
streams, by which the parish is partially bounded, at its eastern and 
western extremities. A small loch, which at one time existed on the 
lands of Oakley, is now drained. There are several chalybeate 
springs in the parish. The tide, at low water, recedes to a consi- 
derable distance from the shore. By care and industry not a little 
land might have been gained from the frith. 

Geology, 8fc. — Under this head the following facts have been 
eommunicated by Mr Cadell, tacksman of the Torrie colliery : 
The whole of the parish stands upon the coal measures, forming 
part of the basin which stretches across Scotland from south-west 
to north-east. Although the strata are very irregular, being in 
many places thrown up by the trap and dislocated by slips ; yet 
in no part of the parish are any of the inferior beds of carbonife- 
rous limestone, or old red sandstone, visible ; nor does it appear 
that any of the superior beds of magnesian limestone, or new red 
sandstone take on. In the south-west part of the parish, at the 
shore, the strata crop out to the east at an angle of about 45°, 
being apparently thrown into this angular position by the trap-hill 
on which Torrie House is built. About 400 yards east of the 
burn, which bounds the parish on the west, the strata dip to the 
south-east at about one in five. This rise increases opposite to 
the village of Torryburn, when the strata again dip into the east. 

The proprietor of Torrie has this year 1839 been at consi- 
derable expense in proving the coal-field along the shore ; and,, 
feom several borings, the basin between Torrie and Torryburru

At the north-west corner of the parish, where there is a colliery 
now at work, the strata are found dipping to the north-west. The 
general section, as obtained in the engine-pit;, is as follows, viz. 

Fathoms. Feet. 

Shale, with thin beds of sandstone, .... 8 0 

Coal, mostly wrought out, .... 0 4

and two bands of ironstone further proved, . 19 0 

Above the strata is in general found a bed of blue stiff clay, 
full of rounded nodules of coal, whinstone, sandstone, &amp;c. Above 
this, in some places, is a bed of sand ; and, in others, of fine 
brown clay, suitable for making bricks and tiles. 

II. — Civil History. 
There is no record, apparently, of the time when either Torrie 
or Crombie was first erected into a parish. The earliest notice 
of the former, which we have seen, is in a list of parishes said to- 
have been drawn up in the reign of King William the Lion, quoted 
in a recent publication from Sibbald's History of Fife. Crombie 
appears to have been dependent on the Abbey of Culross. In 
the " Booke of the Universall Kirk of Scotland," Torrie and 
Crombie are noticed as separate parishes in the years 1581 and 
1586, and it is thought that their union was effected towards the 
close of the same century. One of the first notices in the session, 
records is an intimation, of date_Juue 21st 1629, that " the ses- 
sion convened at the kirk of Crombie, appointed ane stent for re- 
pairing the kirk of Crombie, extending to 30 lb., to be paid by 
parishioners." But there is nothing in the record to enable us to' 
ascertain whether that church was then, or afterwards, used for 
public worship. 

By the session records, it appears that there was a school in- 
Torryburn in the earlier part of the seventeenth century; for,. 
June 1 7th 1632, Alexander Rae was " discharged from teaching 
bairns ia the parish of Torrie ;" and, April 28th 1633, William. 



730 



FlFESUlll'R. 



Duddingstone was " received to read in the kirk before sermorf, 
and to teach the bairns to read and write." In 1644, " the school- 
master was found unfit to teach such a number of bairns as comes 
to school," and an assistant teacher was in consequence appointed. 
The elders appear to have gone through the parish, from time to 
time, " to gather money to pay the master's house-mail and school- 
house ;" and, July 7th, 1644, mention is made of a " bond be- 
twixt schoolmasters and session, subscribed by so many as could 
wreat, in name of the rest, except by Johne Dalgliesh." The 
fees of poor children were paid by the session, that there might 
be no excuse for absence from school. In illustration of the in- 
terest taken by the church at that period in the cause of educa- 
tion, we give the following extract from the record : " March 18th 
1649, the schoolmaster being inquired if the bairns attend the 
school, he complained that manie faythers did withdraw their 
children, and the names of the bairns' faythers that were absent 
were given in to the session." They were " ordained to be sum- 
moned again the nixt day." And accordingly, " March 25th 
1649, compeared the faythers of the bairns that were withdrawn 
from the school, and promised to send them to the school owre 
the nixt week without faile." Whenever there was a falling off 
in school attendance, the elders appear to have visited their se- 
veral quarters, to deal" with the parents to send their children 
to school, and to keep them there as long as possible, instead of 
sending them away to " the herding." In 1655, there appear to 
have been four schools in the parish, one of which was in Torry 
or Newmill, and another in " Crunibietoune." And, about this 
time, " it was the desire of some that their bairns might be taught 
the Latin tounge." 

While the record proves that great efforts were made by the 
kirk-session to promote the cause of education, so also to see that 
fmiily worship was observed, that the Sabbath was sanctified, 
and that drunkenness, swearing, evil speaking, and lewdness were 
discouraged. Offenders were fined, and publicly rebuked before 
the congregation. 

In 1643, " the Covenant was read and explained;" and, De- 
cember 10th 1648, "the Covenant was renewed, and solemnly 
sworn to by all, and subscryved to by as manie as could writt: the 
rest were desyred to come in upon Tuesday following, for subscryv- 
ing the same by themselves, or by some at their desire." About 
this period, too, so memorable in the history of our fathers, there 



TORKYBURN. 



731 



appears to have been great anxiety to wait upon rehgious ordinan- 
ces. Thus, June 6th 1647, it is noticed, " that the kirk was too 
little to contain the people of the parish and that « hundreds 
were constrained to ly in the kirkyard in time of sermon, about 
the doors and windows." An application was in consequence 
made to the heritors, who enlarged the church accommodation by 
building an aisle. After the occupation of Scotland by Cromwell, 
the record exhibits complaints of " disorder," occasioned « by the 
troubles of the time;" of disorder "by Englishmen," and " by 
English souldiers." Ahd, October 16th 1653, the mimster re- 
ports to the session, that there were in the parish " ignorant, per- 
sons, scandalous livers, persons who had not attended diets of ex- 
amination, and those who did not profess to keep family worship, 
in all near to 200 persons." 

As illustrative of the spirit of our fathers about this period, the 
following public collections may be noticed, which were made in 
the parish between the years 1631 and 1658 : 

1631, For tbe distressed Germans, . • L.30 0 0 Scots- 

1 632, For the captives of Dysart and Kirkaldy, . or iq 4

Under the Episcopal usurpation, during the reigns of Charles 
11. and James VII., the discipline appears to have been maintain- 
ed with considerable strictness. None of the festivals or saints' 
days seem to have been observed ; and the communion was dis- 
pensed on a Sabbath, and sometimes on two successive Sabbaths, 
by appointment of the session. The first Presbyterian minister 
after the Revolution, Mr Allan Logan, was ordained July 24, 
1695. His session consisted of thirteen elders; and discipline 
continued to be exercised with a very searching strictness. Dur- 
ing his incumbency, till he was translated to Culross, in 1717, 
many curious notices are to be found in the record. Under this 
head we may notice an oath of purgation, administered, in 1703, 
to one Curry, who had been accused of adultery; the appearance

before the session, in 1705, of one Dr Sibbald, a physician, who- 
appears to have been a very worthless character ; and the exami- 
nation, in 1704, of one Lillias Adie, accused of witchcraft, who 
afterwards died in the jail of Dunfermline, and was buried within 
the flood-mark between the villages of Torryburn and Torrie. Mr 
Logan's great hobby appears to have been the prosecution of 
witches; and, April 4, 1709, Helen Kay was rebuked before the 
congregation for having said that the minister " was daft," when 
she " heard him speak against the witches/' 

In 1697, a great mortality prevailed in the parish, the burials 
that year amounting to 114. It was a time of great scarcity all over 
the country ; and the tradition is, that the people died in conse- 
quence of unwholesome food, and of an immoderate use of a particu- 
lar kind of fish which they caught in the frith. Nothing is remem- 
bered of a more modern date that is worthy of notice. Only it 
may be noticed, that Torryburn appears to have been in its most 
flourishing state about sixty or seventy years ago. As a place of 
enterprise it never has recovered from the ettects of the failure of 
the then proprietor of Crombie. The coal and salt works, which 
had previously been in full operation, were abandoned ; and, in so 
far as a flourishing trade invests a locality with importance and in- 
terest, it must now be said of Torryburn, that it has seen better 
days. 

Chief Land-owners. — Without reckoning the lands annexed 
quoad sacra to Saline, but including that part of Saline annexed 
quoad sacra to Torryburn, the parish is divided among seven pro- 
prietors, whose valued rent is L.5377 Scots, and whose real 
rental may probably amount to nearly the same sum in Sterling 
money. The present proprietors, with their valued rent in Scots 
money, are : — 

Andrew CoWille of Ochiltree and Crombie, . L.1640§- 

Captain James Erskine Wemyss of Wemyss and Torrie, , . 1475 

Andrew Wellwood of Garvoch and Pitliver, .  . 738 

Henry Beveridge of Inzievar, . . « 718 

The Heirs of Sir Robert Preston, Bart, of Valleyfield, . 414 
The Heirs of General Farquharson of Oakley, . . 335 

Miss Erskine of Dunimarle, &amp;c. . . 56 

Antiquities. — These are few in number, comprising the ruins of 
the small church of Crombie, occupying a commanding situation 
overlooking the frith; and a large stone at a place called the 
Tolbzies, supposed to have been erected as a memorial of a fight 
at some remote period. 

Modern Buildings. — The only edifice of this description worthy

of notice is the House of Torrie, which is finely situated, and has 
a handsome appearance. A valuable collection of paintings, 
which once gave to it an interest, fell by bequest, at the death of 
the late Sir John Erskine, Bart., to the University of Edinburgh. 

III. — Population. 
By referring to the average annual number of births and bap- 
tisms, the population may be estimated at 1250 in the year 1640 ; 
at 1800 in 1670; and at 1550 in 1680. During what may be 
considered to have been the most flourishing period of the history 
of the parish, between 1770 and 1780, the population, by a simi- 
lar reference, may be estimated at from 1800 to 1900 souls. In 
1755, the return of the population made to Dr Webster was 
1635; and, in 1792, it is stated in the former Statistical Account 
at 1600.

In the enumeration of 1836, seamen belonging to registered 
vessels are included ; a class excluded from the Government enu- 
merations of the four preceding periods. These are 18 in num- 
ber. The actual increase of population since 1831 has been oc- 
casioned by the re-opening of Torrie colliery, and the influx in 
consequence into the parish of 13 families of colliers, consisting of 
65 souls. 

Of the population in 1836, residing in villages, that of Torry- 
burn was 655, of Torrie or Newmill, 394; of Crombie Point, 81 ; 
and of Crombie, 47.

During the lastthirty or forty years, the register is not complete ; 

parents not unfrequently neglecting to have the names of their 

children inserted in it ; while, unhappily, there are families who 

are altogether indifferent about religious ordinances, and whose 

children in consequence are unbaptized. Including those which 

have not been inserted in the register, the average annual number

Of the entire population, 1097 were born in the county of Fife, 
310 in other parts of Scotland, 25 in England, 1 in Ireland, 1 of 
English parents abroad, and 1 of foreign parents abroad. 

Of the 360 families in the parish, 52 consisted of 1 person in 
each, 58 of 2, 68, of 3, 45 of 4, 46 of 5, 38 of 6, 25 of 7, 18 of

In 1836, the total number of persons of all ages belonging to 
the agricultural class was 359 ; to other classes, 1135. 

In 1831, in the return made to Government, of the male popu- 
lation upwards of twenty years of age, there were, agricultural oc- 
cupiers of the first class, 15 ; do. of the second class, 5 ; agricul- 
tural labourers, 54; manufacturers or weavers, €3 ; retail trade 
and handicraft, 81 ; wholesale, capitalists, clergy, and professional, 
7; labourers not agricultural, 44 ; all other males upwards of twenty 
years, 28 ; male servants upwards of twenty years, 3 ; female ser- 
vants of all ages, 35. In 1831, of the males above twenty years of 
age employed in retail trade and handicraft occupations there were, 
carriers and carters 7, slaters 7, bakers 6, carpenters 6, sawyers 6, 
shoemakers 6, cabinet-makers 5, publicans 5, tailors 5, black- 
smiths 4, masons 3, wheelwrights 3, grocers 3, butchers 2, millers 
2, plasterers 2, house-painter 1 , clock and watchmaker 1, drysalt- 
er 1, earthenware 1, cattle-doctor 1, maltster 1, shopkeeper I, 
flax-dresser 1, wood-merchant 1. The number of persons thus 
classified in the return to Government in 1831 is much the same, 
now. A few of the weavers are employed in the damask manu- 
facture, for which Dunfermline has long been celebrated ; but most 
of them keep by the cotton manufacture for the Glasgow market. 
This last has long been a poor trade ; but being easily learned, 
and the workman being his own master, it is generally preferred. 
The tambouring and sewing of muslin give employment to a con- 
siderable number of females. But there is not that briskness in 
any of these departments which would indicate a flourishing state 
of trade. The extensive salt and coal works, which at one time 
contributed to the industry of the parish, were given up in the 
latter part of the last century. One colliery only now remains, 
in which about thirty pickmen, and thirty labourers and others, 
are employed. During the last six years, the working has been 
confined to a seam of 3 feet, containing in some places 1 feet of 
parrot coal of very fine quality, suitable for gas-works. The an- 
nual produce may be stated at 2500 tons of parrot coal, and 
6000 tons of rough or splint coal, in all 8500 tons, of which two- 



736 ' FIFESHIRE. 

thirds are shipped, and one-third sold in the adjacent country. 
The only other public work in the parish is that of a wood-mer- 
chant, whose establishment is extensive and flourishing. 

Rent.The rent of land in the parish varies from L. 1 to L. 4 
per acre. The average rent may be stated at L.2, 10s. per acre. 
The number of farms is 11. Several of them may be consider- 
ed large ; and m all of them, we believe, the most approved modes 
of husbandry are followed. 

Like many other small towns on the coast of Fife, Torryburn 
■was more of a seafaring place formerly than now. There are still, 
however, seven vessels belonging to this parish, registering about 
330 tons. There is a small pier both at Crombie Point and at 
Torrie, but the latter stands much in need of repair. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest market-town is Dunfermline, distant about three 
miles from the eastern boundary of the parish, and four and one- 
third from the parish church. 

The villages are, Torryburn, Torrie or Newmill, Crombie Point, 
and Crombie, with a population respectively of 656, 394, 81, 
and 47. 

By means of a private post from Dunfermline, letters and news- 
papers are regularly received. There are upwards of four miles 
of excellent turnpike road in the parish ; but some of the other 
Toads are in bad condition, and during the winter months, in many 
places almost impassable. This is a great inconvenience to se- 
veral families, as it respects their attendance at church ; and the 
evil has recently been aggravated, since the shutting up, by the 
proprietor of Torrie, of a footpath, which, from time immemorial, 
had been understood to be a kirk road. A similar road in another 
;part of the parish was shut up several years ago by the then pro- 
prietor of Crombie. Along the turnpike road a stage-coach from 
Kirkaldy, by Dunfermline to Falkirk, communicating with Glas- 
gow by the Forth and Clyde Canal, passes every lawful day ; and, 
iby means of a boat at Crombie Point, travellers have access to the 
steam-vessels that ply on the Forth between Edinburgh and 
Stirling. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church, rebuilt in 1800, is in 
good condition, with the exception of one of the gables, which is 
rent from top to bottom. It is situated at the east end of the vil- 
lage of Torryburn, and is not inconveniently placed for the great- 
er portion of the inhabitants; 1135 of the population being dis- 
tant from it not more than one mile, and 1289 not more than two 



TORRYBURN. 



737 



miles. The number of sittings, allowing 18 inches to each, is 
502, the occupancy of which was found, in 1836, to be engrossed 
by a total population of 818. Of the sittings, 214 were formerly 
let, besides others let in a smuggled way by some of the farmers. 
But it is believed that few, if any, will be let in future ; the peo- 
ple being convinced, since their attention was recently directed to 
the matter, that the imposition of seat rents is illegal. An end, 
it is hoped, has thus been put to what the minister regards, and 
has publicly denounced, as a system of ungodly merchandize. The 
church is by far too small for the parish. 

The stipend awarded by the Court of Teinds in 1815, was 216 
bolls, half meal and half barley, besides 6 bolls meal, in lieu of 
the old glebe of Crombie ; L. 1, 13s, 4d. for foggage, and L. 8, 
6s. 8d. for communion elements. But, when allocated, owing to 
an apparent want of funds, the amount, including the allowimce . 
for the glebe of Crombie, for foggage and for communion elements, 
was found to be only 91 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck, 3 lippies meal ; 
85 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck, 3 lippies, barley ; and L, 20, 6s. 
in money. The glebe of Torryburn consists of three acres, and 
is let at an annual rent of L. 9. The manse was built in 1768, 
and' repaired about thirty years ago. Most of the apartments are 
small and inconvenient. 

There is no Seceding or Dissenting place of worship in the pa- 
rish. The great body of the people profess to adhere to the Es- 
tablished Church. In 1836, the religious profession of the pa- 
rishioners, including children with their parents, was as follows : 

Communicants. Total adherents.

The sacrament of the Lord's Supper is dispensed twice a-year; 
the average number of communicants being in winter 340, and in 
summer 370. There are two Sabbath schools, attended by about 
60 children. In the church there are two diets of public wor-

ship all the year round ; and these, for the most part, are remark- 
ably well attended. We trust that an increasing value is bemg at- 
tached to public worship as a Divine ordinance. But, for a long 
period, the views, in regard to this, of a considerable part of the 
population in the west of Fife, appear to have been extremely 
low. Many seem never to have thought of attendmg public wor- 
ship, unless as hearers or spectators on a communion Sabbath. 
This must have been the case in Torryburn during the earlier 
part of the last century, when, with a population greater than at 
present, there were no Dissenters. So, also, it must have been 
in the adjoining parish of Dunfermline, where, before the Seces- 
sion took place, the only place of worship was the old parish 
church, capable of accommodating a congregation of from 1200 
to 1400, while the population of that parish was then about 8000. 

There are no regularly constituted societies for religious pur- 
poses. A few individuals contribute to defray the expenses of a 
monthly distribution of tracts. The number of copies distributed 
annually is about 3400. Yearly collections are made in aid of the 
General Assembly's schemes for promoting the cause of Christ. 
These in 1839 were, for colonial churches, L.3; for church ex- 
tension, L.3, 2s.; for education, L.3, 8s.; for the India mission, 
L.4, 16s.; for the Jews, L. 5, 4s.; in all, L. 19, 12s.; besides 
L. 14 contributed by individuals to particular exertions m connec- 
tion with the Church Extension scheme. 

Education.-Bes\des the parochial school there are three others. 
Two of these are partly sewing-schools, taught by females. 1 he 
instruction in the parochial school consists of EngHsh reading and 
grammar, writing, arithmetic, geography, and Latin when requir- 
ed. The schoolmaster is qualified, in addition, to give lessons in 
Greek and French. His salary is L. 34, 4s. 4d The fees, 
with other emoluments, may amount to L. 46. 1 he house pro- 
vided for him is far from commodious. The school-room, which 
is merely rented by the heritors, is unworthy of the parish. Ihe 
number of children attending the several schools in the parish may 
be about 140, The number of children between five and fifteen 
vears of age, who have been taught to read, is 351 ; and taught 
'to write 194. The total number attending school, including those 
who frequent schools in the adjoiningparishes, is about 210 There 
are three males and three females, grown up, who admit that the 
ave never been taught to read. On the whole, the benefi . f 
education do not appear to be so generally -Pl-'-'fj J/ 
be wished; and by many the school fees are very irregularly paid- 



TORRYBURN. 



739 



There is a small parochial library, but not much of a taste for 
reading. 

Friendly Societies.— k most useful institution of this description 
is " the dead-box," out of which the contributors receive a[]sum at 
the death of any member of their families to defray funeral ex- 
penses ; L.6 at the death of a grown-up person, and L.2 at the 
death of a child. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — During the years' 1835, 1836, and 
1637, the average annual amount of collections for the poor at the 
parish church was L.36, 4s. 9d. ; of voluntary assessment by he- 
ritors, L.I50, lis. Id.; and of the sum arising from mortcloths, 
L.1, 15s. 8d. The extravagance of the fees for mortcloths had 
the effect, about ten years ago, of leading to the formation of a 
private mortcloth society, which is very generally countenanced. 
The average number of paupers on the permanent roll is 33, and 
the average amount of the sums distributed amongst them annuaU 
ly, L.141, 14s. Id. The average annual expenditure on occa- 
sional paupers is L.3, 7s., and on the education of poor children, 
L.6. The highest annual rate of relief to paupers on the perma- 
nent roll is L.7, 12s., and the lowest, L.2, 12s. Coals and soup 
are distributed annually, in addition, to the amount of about L.31 ; 
and several poor children are educated at the expense of the Hon. 
Mrs Colvile of Ochiltree, the lady of one of the heritors, to whose 
bounty in articles of clothing also many of the poorer parishioners 
are indebted. Generally speaking, the reverse of a spirit of re- 
luctance to receive parochial aid is manifested ; and, in the vil- 
lages of Torryburn and Torrie, one family in six receives occa- 
sional charity in one shape or another. 

Fairs. — There is one held annually at the west end of Torry- 
burn village, on the second Wednesday of July. No business is 
now transacted beyond the sale of confections and crockery. In 
the evening, there is usually a horse-race. 

Inns, Alehouses, -c— Of these, there are not fewer than 14, 
not to mention another, which, although not within the parish, is 
within a hundred yards of its western extremity. A year or two 
ago, the number within the parish was eighteen ; and for the di- 
minution which has since taken place, and which, it is hoped, will 
go on progressively as the holders of licenses die out or remove, 
we are mainly indebted to the enlightened interference of Mr Be- 
ve ridge of Inzievar.

PRESBYTERV OF KIRKCALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JOHN ALEXANDER, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
][ame. — There seems to be no good reason for doubting tlie 
accuracy of the derivation commonly given of the name. It is 
said to be compounded of Cil or Kil, and Celedei or Keledie, the 
Culdees. Prior to the introduction and establishment of Popery 
in Scotland, the Culdees, who had erected several religious esta- 
blishments in Fife and Kinross, had one of their houses, called 
cells, here ; hence the place was called Kil-celedei. During the 
Scoto- Saxon period the name was changed into Kirkcaledie, and 
subsequently it was contracted into Kirkcaldie and Kirkcaldy. 

Extent and Boundaries— The parish was originally large, but 
is now very small, in consequence of the erection of the adjacent 
parish of Abbotshall, the greater part of which was disjoined from 
Kirkcaldy. The parish consists of one small farm ; a piece of 
acre-land, which has been divided, from time immemorial, among 
a number of small proprietors ; the burgh acres ; and the com- 
monties, with the moss and moor, which at one time belonged to 
the town. It is 2 miles in length, and scarcely 1 m breadth : 
and is bounded on the south-east, by the Frith of Forth ; on the 
north-east, by the parish of Dysart ; on the north-west, by the 
parishes of Dysart and Auchterderran ; and on the south-west, by 
the parish of Abbotshall. 

Topographical Appearances.— It rises towards the north, for the 
most part very gradually, to an elevation of 300 feet above the level 
of the sea. The sea-beach is level and sandy. The parish em- 
braces about three-fourths of a mile of the sea-coast. A short

KIRKCALDY. 



3istance inward from the sea'the land is nearly level, and then it 
rises rather abruptly. On this flat ground, along a section of a 
spacious bay on the north side of the Frith of Forth, the town 
stands. It is ten miles due north from Edinburgh. 

It may be proper to mention, while speaking of the town of 
Kirkcaldy, that it comprehends much more than the royal burgh, 
though this be all of it that lies within the parish. When it is 
viewed as a considerable sea-port, and an important manufacturing 
town, it must be regarded as comprehending Linktown, in the pa- 
rish of Abbotshall, West Bridge, in the parish of Kinghorn, and 
all this is included within the Parliamentary burgh. To this also 
may be added Pathhead and Gallaton, in the parish of Dysart. 
These places are all adjoining, and form one town, though they 
are looked upon as distinct by the inhabitants, more from the divi- 
sions of parishes than from any thing else. The town, in this 
extended sense, has a population of 15,000 ; and little more than 
5000 reside within Kirkcaldy proper. 

C/zmafe.— The climate is dry and salubrious, and favourable to 
longevity, of which there are numerous instances. On account of 
the great and sudden variations in the temperature of the atmo- 
sphere during the end of spring and beginning of summer, croup, 
bronchitis, and other forms of thoracic inflammatory complaints 
are prevalent. 

Hydrography. — This parish presents scarcely any thing worthy 
of notice under this head. The East Burn, a small stream, after 
receiving one or two nameless tributaries in its course, which does 
not exceed three miles, falls into the sea at the point where the 
parishes of Dysart and Kirkcaldy meet on the coast. This rivu- 
let deserves to be mentioned chiefly on account of its romantic 
and richly wooded banks, which are commonly called the Den. 
These woods and banks are intersected with walks, to which the 
proprietor allows the public to have access ; and thus the inhabit- 
ants have the privilege and advantage of a beautiful and agree- 
able retreat in the immediate vicinity of the town. 

Minerals: — The limited extent of this parish, the absence of 
rocks on its sea coast, and the fact, that, in very few places, 
the strata make their appearance on the surface, render it scanty 
in geological phenomena. The general dip of the strata, where 
their bearings are regular, and have not been deranged by the 
convulsions which threw up the trap rocks, that intersect this coal- 
field, and are so troublesome in the working of the coal, is south- 



742 FIFESHIIIE. 

south-east, from a ridge near the northern extremity of the parish. 
The prevailing strata are sandstone, slate, clay, and till, contain- 
ing a number of seams of coal, varying in thickness from 9 inches 
to 3i feet. Above the coal, which is now being wrought, there is 
a bed of whinstone 8 fathoms thick. There is only one coal-pit 
in operation at present. It is 46 fathoms deep. The bed of coal 
is 5 feet in thickness ; but the expense of turning out this coal 
is much increased, in consequence of its being composed of two 
seams, separated by a stratum of clay 15 inches thick. This, 
however, only lessens the value of the coal-field to the proprietor, 
and does not raise the price of coal to the consumer ;— for this is 
prevented by the competition of other coal-works in the neighbour- 
hood. 

Considerable quantities of iron ore are also found in this coal- 
field in globular masses. About thirty years ago, when the iron 
trade was more profitable than it is just now, this ore was wrought 
along with the coal, and was sold at 10s. 6d. per ton to the Car- 
ron Company. The working of it has been discontinued for many 
years. The present tacksman of the Dunnikier colliery could 
find buyers of the iron in England ; but the prices offered are not 
sufficiently remunerating to encourage him to embark in this 

branch of trade. 

Soil.— The soil of the plain along the coast, on which the town 
is built, as may be seen in all the gardens on the south side of the 
High Street, is exceedingly sandy. To the north of the High 
Street, where the ground begins to ascend, and all along the back 
of the town in its immediate vicinity, the soil is dry rich loam, and 
very productive. On the rising ground farther north, the sub- 
soil' becomes retentive, and the land is cold, wet, and clay_ey. 
The part of the parish most distant from the sea is what was for- 
merly the town's common moor ; and, though much has been done 
for it by cultivation and improvements, it still remains comparatively 

unproductive. . 

2ooZo//.— Between twenty and thirty years ago, a little insect, 
whose effects are denominated the American blight, made its ap- 
pearance here. Ever since that time, it has been very destructive 
to apple trees in this parish. Once visited by it, they seldom after- 
wards recover health. Various expedients have been tried to pre- 
vent its attacks, and to discover a remedy for the disease it leaves 
behind it : but all such attempts have hitherto been unsuccesstul. 

....-Interesting as is this district of Fife to botanists, the 
parish of Kirkcaldy moy be said to be destitute of botanical riches. 



KIRKCALDY.

No plants are found in it, except what are common in similar lo- 
calities. The adjacency of the spot to this parish may justify us 
in noticing here, that around Ravenscraig Castle, in the parish of 
Dysart, these two rare plants are found, the sea -fern {Aspknium 
marimm, and Alexanders [Smyrnium Olusatrum. 

The only plantations in the parish are about Dunnikier house, 
and in the den already mentioned. They are between sixty and 
seventy years old, and contain various kinds of fir, beech, elm, 
and oak ; but they present nothing remarkable. 

II. — Civil History. 

No historical account of this town has ever been published. 
Nor do the burgh records throw any light on its earlier history. 
It seems, however, to have been a" place of considerable import- 
ance at a very remote period. The obscurity of antiquity conceals 
what accident or causes led the Culdees to plant an establishment 
here ; and the date of these Christians coming to occupy this as 
one of their stations is unknown. Of the existence of one of their 
houses here, no reasonable doubt can be entertained. Its sup- 
pression, or at least it being brought into subjection to the religi- 
ous estabhshment at Dunfermline, under which it subsequently 
continued for a long time, very probably took place in the earlier 
part of the twelfth century. David I., before the middle of that 
century, introduced thirteen English monks from Canterbury, be- 
lono-ine to the order of St Benedict, into the Culdee establish- 
ment at DunfermUne : and thus brought it under the dominion ot 
the Pope. Such an innovation awakened the alarm of the Cul- 
dees, by threatening their independence with overthrow. To re- 
concile them to the change, and to divert their attention from the 
danger of their contemplated overthrow, the king elevated the 
priory of Dunfermline to the rank of an abbey ; and to flatter 
them still farther, it is said he, at the same time, suppressed the 
Culdees of Kirkcaldy, or made them subordinate to, and depend- 
ent on, the newly erected abbey. 

The first authentic notice of the town, except what is vague 
and general, from which the commencement of its history must 
be dated, is its erection into a burgh of regality in the year 1334. 
David II. at this date mortified Kirkcaldy to the abbot of Dun- 
fermline, and his successors. For more than a century, it was 
held by this monastery, and used in all probability as the princi- 
pal sea-port of Dunfermline. In 1450, the commendator and con- 
vent of Dunfermline, "gave, granted, and disponed to the bailies 
and community of the burgh of Kirkcaldy, then present, and their

successors, for ever, the burgh, the harbour of the same, and all 
burgage forms of the said burgh, with the small customs, lie tolls, 
stallages, with courts and their issues; also common pasture 
■within the muir of Kirkcaldy, and pertinents thereof, as freely in 
all and by every respect as the burgesses of the burgh of Dun- 
fermline have enjoyed and possessed." Not long after this dis- 
position was granted, the holding of the burgh was changed. 
From being one of the burghs of the lordship of Dunfermline, it 
was erected into a free royal burgh, with all the privileges of other 
royal burghs. The original charter having been lost, the date of the 
royal burgh's erection is unknown. Charles I. granted a charter of 
confirmation to Kirkcaldy in 1644, ratifying all its former rights 
and immunities ; and erecting it de novo, into a " new free burgh 
royal," with enlarged powers and privileges. Prior to the grant- 
ing of this charter, the magistracy consisted of two bailies and a 
treasurer, but the charter of Charles gave power to choose " a 
provost, bailies, a dean of guild, and a treasurer, for administra- 
tion of justice, and government of the burgh." The provost has 
also the title of admiral. 

Historical Notices.— Th\s town suffered severely during the civil 
war that followed the contest between the English Parliament and 
Charles I. ; and also in the struggle maintained by the Covenan- 
ters in Scotland. It appears from a statement in the burgh re- 
cords, that no less than 94 vessels belonging to this port, of the 
value of L.53,000 Sterling, 'were lost at sea, or taken by the enemy, 
between the beginning of the war and the restoration. The pub- 
lic authorities and inhabitants of Kirkcaldy espoused the cause of 
the Parliament, and opposed the Royalists. 

The cause of the Covenanters also was well supported here. 
The presbytery records show, that the cause was popular in th&amp; 
district, and that the covenant was very generally subscribed. 
This parish added a large force to the Covenanters, as may be 
inferred from the circumstance, that the battle of Kilsyth alone, 
in 1645, is said to have left 200 widows in the town. The ge- 
neral feeling may be gathered from the session records, in which 
we find " runawayes from their cullors warnit," and " declaired 
contumacious." Sums were allowed from the poor's funds " for 
horses to cary woundit men," and to be given to " woundit men.' 
On the margins of both the presbytery and session records, spe- 
cial notice is taken of the « batell of Kilsyth."

have existed previous to 1809. A plan of the burgh was drawn that 
year by Mr Moore of Abbotshall, preparatory to apphcation be- 
ing made to Parliament for a police bill. This map is still pre- 
served. Another was made by Mr Wood of Edinburgh in 1824, 
which is also in possession of the Town-Council. Mr John Sang, 
civil-engineer, Kirkcaldy, executed a plan of the burgh, including 
the whole of the royalty, in 1840, when the assessment under the 
new Prison Act was to be levied on the county : one copy of 
which was deposited with the commissioners of supply, and ano- 
ther with the town-council of Kirkcaldy. 

Eminent Characters. — Henry Balnaves of Halhill, who acted a 
conspicuous part in the reigns of James V. and his daughter Mary, 
was the son of poor parents in the town of Kirkcaldy. After 
attending school at St Andrews, he went to Cologne, and prosecut- 
ed his studies. While receiving a liberal education there, he was 
at the same time instructed in the principles of the Protestant 
faith. After his return to Scotland he was appointed a Lord of 
Session in 1538 ; and had a seat in several Parliaments. He took 
an active part in forwarding the work of the Reformation, and 
oftener than once sutfered imprisonment for his zeal. He lent 
valuable assistance, when he was in parliament, to the passing of 
an act, that the enemies of the reformation violently opposed, for 
allowing " baith the New Testament and the Auld," to be trans- 
lated into the vulgar tongue and read. The sixth General Assem- 
bly of the Church of Scotland, appointed him, along with others, 
in 1563, " to advise the Booke of Discipline viz. the first Book, 
diligentlie, consider the contents thereof, noting their judgments in 
writing, and to report to the nixt General Assemblie of the kirk." 
Mr George Gillespie and his brother Patrick, whose names 
are intimately associated with the history of the Church of Scot- 
land, during the period immediately subsequent to the second Re- 
formation, were sons of Mr John Gillespie, second minister of 
the collegiate charge of Kirkcaldy. George was born in 1613,. 
and Patrick in 1617. George was sent to college as the presby- 
tery's bursar, and was supported by contributions from the kirk- 
sessions, as appears from the following extract from Kirkcaldy ses- 
sion records : November 1629, " The session are content that

fixing the boundaries of the said burgh, and which is referred to in their minute of 
this date.

Mr George Gillespie shall have as much money of our session 
for his interteynment, as Dysart gives, viz. 20 merks, being our 
presbytery's bursar." He was ordained to be minister of Wemyss, 
on the " supplication" of the kirk and parish, and in opposition 
to the wish and order of the Archbishop of St Andrews. Mr 
Robert Douglas, minister of Kirkcaldy, who will be noticed after- 
wards, presided at the ordination. Mr Gillespie was soon afte»' 
translated to Edinburgh ; and in 1643, he was nominated and ap- 
pointed by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, to 
be one of the Scotch Commissioners to the Westminster Assembly 
of Divines. He was one of its youngest members, and his abili- 
ties, acuteness, knowledge, and skill in debate, often astonished 
the assembly and confounded his adversaries. He is described 
by Principal Baillie as " the verie learned and acute Mr Gilles- 
pie, a singular ornament of our church, than whom no one in the 
whole assembly Westminster, speaks to better purpose." On one 
occasion, as is related, after Selden, with all his talents and eru- 
dition, had maintained, in an eleborate speech, the supremacy of 
the civil magistrate in the government of the church, Baillie, feel- 
ino- strongly the necessity of the arguments advanced being an- 
sw°ered, said to Gillespie,'" Get up, George, and defend the kirk 
of your fathers." He replied with so much learning and abdity, 
that Selden, feeling the overpowering force of Gillespie's strong 
arguments and conclusive reasoning, is reported to have whispered 
to a friend beside him, " that boy has, in the course of one speech, 
overturned the labours of my past years." George Gillespie wrote 
Miscellanies, and published also an acute and able work, entitled 
«« Aaron's Rod Blossoming," for which he is most justly celebrat- 
ed. He was chosen moderator of the General Assembly in 1648, 
and died at Kirkcaldy in the end of the same year. A monu- 
ment was erected to his memory, which, as an inscription on a 
plain tablet, that still stands, informs us, was thrown down 
through the " malign influence of Archbishop Sharp." It was 
re-erected in 1745, by his grandson, the Rev. George Gillespier 
minister of Strathmiglo. The tablet is still to be seen in the south- 
east porch of the present church. 

Mr Patrick Gillespie, besides being a native of Kirkcaldy, was 
for some time minister of the parish. After the death of Charles I. 
he favoured the side of the Commonwealth, and was appointed 
Principal of the University of Glasgow. He had to encounter 
much opposition and many difficulties, before he could be installed 
into the office. At the Restoration he was ejected.

Mr Robert Douglas, another of the five commissioners ap- 
pointed by the General Assembly to repair to the Westminster 
Assembly, was for some years one of the ministers of this parish. 
It does not appear that he ever attended at Westminster. He 
became one of the ministers of Edinburgh, was moderator of the 
General Assembly, and preached at the coronation of Charles II., 
which took place at Scone in 1651. 

Three individuals were born in this town in the earlier part of 
last century, who attended the burgh school at the same time, 
and contracted a friendship there that continued through life ; and 
each of them attained a certain degree of eminence in the station 
he occupied, and the duties he undertook. We refer to James 
Oswald, Esq., Dr John Drysdale, and Dr Adam Smith. 

Mr Oswald of Dunnikier represented the county of Fife in one 
Parliament, and the Kirkcaldy district of burghs in three, between 
1741 and 1768. During his parliamentary career, by attention 
to his duties, and his talent for business, he recommended himself 
to the ministry of the day, and gained their confidence. He thus 
secured for himself some of the honours of the State, and for his 
friends, as well as himself, the advantages of office. He was a 
privy-counsellor, and at different times he held the offices of a 
Commissioner of Trade, a Lord of the Treasury, and Vice-Trea- 
surer of Ireland. 

Dr Drysdale, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, was clerk to 
the General Assembly, and was twice chosen moderator. He 
obtained his presentation to a church in the city through the in- 
fluence of his friend and school companion, Mr Oswald. It may 
here be noticed, that, previous to the appointment of Dr Drysdale, 
the magistrates and town-council had entrusted the election of the 
city ministers to the general kirk-session. But in his case the 
council commenced to take the choice into their own hands, " for 
good reasons," according to the statement of the Doctor's bio- 
grapher and son-in-law. 

The last, but by far the greatest and most celebrated of the 
three, was Dr Adam Smith, the author of the Inquiry into the 
Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, — a work which laid 
down principles and unfolded views of political science, that startled 
men by their novelty when they were first propounded, but whose 
soundness in general, whose enlightened and philosophical cha- 
racter, have long been admitted and applauded by political econo- 
mists. He was also the author of a work entitled the Theory of 



748 



FIFESHIRE. 



Moral Sentiments ; but comparatively little of his well-merited 
and widely extended fame has arisen from this treatise. He was 
born here in 1723. After he left school, he was absent from the 
town for many years, following his literary pursuits, and dis- 
charging his professional duties in the chair of Moral Philosophy, 
which he for a time occupied in the University of Glasgow. But 
he returned again to Kirkcaldy, and resided here while he was 
composing his celebrated work. He died in 1789. It seems 
strange that no monument to his memory has ever been erected in 
Kirkcaldy. This want appears to indicate a prevailing insensibility 
to the high honour conferred on the town, by its being the birth- 
place and long the residence of a man of such universal celebrity. 

Land-owners.— James Townsend Oswald, Esq. of Dunnikier, 
is proprietor of seven-eighths of the landward part of the parish. 
The other eighth is much subdivided. 

Parochial Registers.— Fbe classes of registers are preserved, 
viz. minutes of session, registers of proclamations and marriages, 
of births and baptisms, of deaths and burials, and accounts of the 
collections and disbursements for the poor. The first and the 
last of these are nearly entire, and in a good state of preserva- 
tion ; the other three are much mutilated. The oldest volume of 
the session records commences with January 1614, and the same 
volume contains, besides the minutes of session, a register of bap- 
tisms and marriages, commencing with the same date. The mi- 
nutes of session from 1645 to 1663 are wanting. In consequence 
of leaves being torn away at the beginning of a volume, the mi- 
Dutes for the year 1632 are lost. With these exceptions, the 
minutes from 1614 are complete and well kept. There are du- 
plicates for considerable periods, the scroll copy of the minutes 

having been preserved. 

Jntinuities.-Yavhus relics, such as sculptured arms and in- 
scriptions, furnish grounds for supposing that a religious house 
must at one time have stood on the north side of the High Street. 
Senulchral remains also have been found in this locality. Stone 
coffins, and large quantities of human bones have been discovered 
in different places, by vorkmen digging for foundations. This 
town, like many others in ancient times, had gates. They were 
can d the east and v.est ports. The places where they stood 
sTi retain the names. These ports or gates, and the cross 
'hLh stood at the market-place, were taken down early in the 
Hs century, of which notice is taken in the minutes of the town- 
counc 1. Nothing like a ruin is found in the parish.

Modern Buildings. — Besides the parish church, which will be 
noticed more particularly elsewhere, we may mention here, a new 
and elegant church which stands close upon the sea, on the High 
Street, and was erected last year. It cost nearly L.2000, and is 
an ornament to the eastern part of the town. 

The town-house and jail form one building, and it is situated 
near the middle of the town. It is a small, but very neat and hand- 
some building, in the Saxon Gothic style, and cost L.5000. The 
town-hall or council-room, in which the courts and meetings of 
the public bodies of the town are held, is spacious and well-finish- 
ed. It has lately been furnished with a portrait of Walter Fergus, 
Esq. of Strathore, copied by Colvin Smith, Esq. from an original 
painting by Raeburn. A number of gentlemen in the town pre- 
sented it to the council, to be hung up in the hall, as a memorial of 
Mr Fergus's connection for many years with the advancement and 
prosperity of the trade and public affairs of the burgh. 

The town is chiefly indebted for recent and extensive architec- 
tural improvements to the banks. The Bank of Scotland, the 
Commercial Bank, the National Bank of Scotland, and the Glas- 
gow and Ship Bank have all branches here. They have all built 
large and elegant offices, and houses for the agents, on the High 
Street. Besides the ornament of the bank buildings themselves 
to the street, it may be remarked, that they have improved the 
style of building around, and thus the aspect of the town has been 
greatly changed of late years. 

In the parish there is Dunnikier House, the seat of James 
Townsend Oswald, Esq., and in the town, or its immediate neigh- 
bourhood, there are three villas meriting notice, viz. that of John 
Fergus, Esq. of Strathore; Balsusney, the property of Colonel Fer- 
guson of Raith ; and St Brice-dale, the property of William Stark 
Dougall, Esq. of Scotscraig. 

III. — Population. 
No traces remain of any census of this parish having been 
taken prior to 1755; but the parochial registers furnish data upon 
vvhich we may approximate at least to the amount of the popula- 
tion at a much earlier date. The births, annually registered, on 
an average during the ten years commencing with 1614 were 
1 15. This number is much larger than the register has annually 
received for many years past. The practice of registration was 
more general then, we apprehend, than it is at present ; for the 
injury done to the interests of children by the inattention of pa- 



750 



FIFESHIRE. 



rents to this duty is matter for regret. If we suppose the popu- 
lation to have been as 35 to 1 of the births, it must have been at 
this period 4025. Its rapid increase after this date may be infer- 
red from the facts, that the church required to be enlarged in 
1643, and in 1650 Abbotshall was disjoined from Kirkcaldy, and a 
new church was erected. From 1640 to 1650, the average of 
births was 174, making the population 6090. This, it will be ob- 
served, included the present parish of Abbotshall, the population 
of which, together with that of Kirkcaldy, is at present about 
10,000. This gives an idea of the comparative size and import- 
ance of this parish, at dates two centuries distant. The trade of 
the town was nearly annihilated, and the number of its inhabitants 
was greatly reduced during the forty years that intervened between 
the death of Charles I. and the Revolution. The population has 
been gradually increasing for a century past.

The following abstract of the census taken on the 7th June 1841 ,

This must be rather under than above the number of deaths in

No noble family has a residence within the parish, and very few 
others, except annuitants, that live upon their fortunes indepen- 
dently of business. There are only two landed proprietors whose 
yearly incomes from their land within the parish exceed L.lOO, viz. 
James Townsend Oswald, Esq. of Dunnikier, and John Fergus, 
Esq. of Strathore. The property of Mr Fergus, however, lies 
chiefly in adjoining parishes. 

A spirit of enterprise, directed and regulated by that prudent 
caution which naturally accompanies the possession and employ- 
ment of real capital in business, pervades this manufacturing and 
commercial community, and prevents the town from being visited 
with those sudden and ruinous convulsions, which the rashness of 
mere speculators, whom injurious facilities of obtaining credit 
raise up and sustain for a time, too frequently brings upon other 
trading districts. The habits and conduct of the merchants and 
manufacturers, who are commonly capitalists to a greater extent 
than is general throughout the country, in the management of their 
business, and the nature of the trade itself, give a steadiness to 
the various branches of industry, and exercise a very salutary in- 
fluence on the community generally. 

The demoralizing practice of smugghng, chiefly from Holland, 
prevailed here at one time to a great extent. It has now almost 
entirely disappeared. Of late years, the officers have never de- 
tected smuggling, except, and this very seldom, in the case of 
small craft from France, which sometimes bring along with their 
cargoes of fruit, larger quantities of brandy than the crew may be 
thought to require as sea-store. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — This parish contains 1050 imperial acres, of which 
160 acres are planted. With this exception, all of it is under cultiva- 
tion ; but, from its small extent, it affords little scope for remarks 



752 



FIFESHIRE. 



under this head. The land near the town, from its superior qua- 
lity, from facilities for obtaining manure, and from the ready mar- 
ket found for produce, especially in the early part of the season, 
brings a rent varying from L.4, 10s. to L.6, 6s. per acre. The land 
becomes less valuable in the remoter part of the parish, not only 
from locality, but also from inferiority of soil, and its rent is from 
L.2 to L.3 per acre. The average rent per acre of the whole pa- 
rish may be stated at L.3, 10s. 

Mines.— One coal-pit is at present in operation. Forty [pick- 
men colliers are employed in it, besides labourers, and young per- 
sons to draw the coals below ground. 

Manufactures.— The capital of the burgesses seems at one time 
to have been chiefly employed in shipping. This interest receiv- 
ed a shock, during the civil war in the reign of Charles I., which 
aff-ected the prosperity of the town for a century and a half. After the 
shipping interests declined, and were destroyed, manufactures were 
introduced. With the increase and prosperity of manufactures, 
the shipping of the port has been revived, and the town, from the 
union of the shipping and manufacturing interests, now numbers 
amon. its inhabitants not a few, who are entitled to the honourable 
appellation of British merchants, and occupy no mean place among 
them, whether we regard the capital they employ, the sp.nt of en- 
terprise they manifest, or the extent of their business. 

The principal trade of the town is the manufacture of various 
descriptions of linen, with the collateral branches of --H---' 
h\eJ\nr, and machine-making. This trade was probably int o- 
duced from Holland and Flanders about the time of the Revolu- 
tion, or early in the last century. It was long very limited, it 
Tde little p'rogress till after the middle of tl- l-t century as 
following facts demonstrate. In 1733, no more than 1 / '740 ja ds 
of linen were manufactured in this district, including Ahbotshal , 
Dv art Leslie, &amp;c. It had increased in 1743 to 316,550 yards, 
Uie value of which was L.11,000. The infancy of the trade, the 
want of facilities for extending it, and the advancement it made 
I"ng these ten years, may be seen in the anxiety and ca e 
Manifested by the authorities to afford it all possible encourage-

benefit of the town and country that a heckler of hnt be esta- 
blished, they, therefore, unanimously resolve to make application 
to the trustees that a heckler be settled here with such a salary, 
and under such regulations, as the trustees judge proper." About 
the same time advantages were held out to bleachers, and encou- 
ragement was given them to settle in the neighbourhood. The 
goods manufactured at this time consisted chiefly of linen checks 
of inferior quality, which were commonly sold to Glasgow mer- 
chants for exportation ; and linen handkerchiefs, checks, and a 
coarse description of ticks not now manufactured ; all for the home 
trade. The goods were conveyed by the manufacturers on horse- 
back to the various towns m Scotland, and were mostly sold at 
fairs. 

Towards the end of the last century, a great stimulus was given 
to the linen trade of Kirkcaldy by the judgment and energy of Mr 
James Fergus, — a name justly associated with the extension and 
prosperity of the trade of the town. He set himself to produce 
ticking for the home-trade in England. After he had discovered 
the tweel, and had provided materials for making this fabric of the 
first quality, he was unable to find weavers who could give the 
cloth the requisite stiffness and smoothness. The difficulty was 
at last overcome by a weaver discovering the effect of what is still 
denominated " the open stroke." The effect of this stroke in the 
weaving upon the cloth is, in the language of a workman, to make 
it as smooth as a " buik leaf." This opened up a new trade, and 
ticking is still the staple article in the manufactures of Kirkcaldy. 
Mixed cotton and linen-checks were made for the same market • 
they were produced in large quantities, and continued to be sold 
with profit till they were superseded by the cheaper and more 
showy article of cotton. Besides ticks, there are now manufac- 
tured in the town, drills, dowlas, sheetings, ducks, and sail-cloth. 

It was difficult at one time for manufacturers to extend their 
business, in consequence of being obliged to provide houses for 
their weavers. Their trade was proportionate to the number of 
weavers they could accommodate. This practice is not' yet alto- 
gether done away, but weavers now generally find houses for them- 
selves, and seek after manufacturers who are willing to employ 
them. Females began to weave here between forty and fifty years 
ago : and they now form a considerable proportion of the number 
employed. 

The trade is carried on chiefly by eight manufacturing houses

or establishments. Besides these, there are a few individuals who 
occasionally make webs. The manufacturers employ 1 100 weav- 
ers. Of this number 113 work in two factories, erected for the 
manufacture of canvas. This branch of trade was introduced in 
1811; and the manufacturers of sail-cloth here generally obtain 
a share of government contracts for the navy. Only 119 weav- 
ers exclusive of the factory workmen, are accommodated with 
looms within the parish. Accordingly, many weavers in the ad- 
ioining parishes and surrounding villages, are employed by the

scriptioiis of linen goods annually manufactured in the town may 
be reckoned at not less than L. 200,000. Besides the home trade 
in England and Scotland, these linens find markets in Canada, 
the United States, South America, the West Indies, and Australia. 

The manufactures have created an extensive trade in bleaching 
and dyeing. Some manufacturers dye their own yarns, others em - 
ploy public dyers. There are only two bleachfields in the parish, 
one of them is doing very little business ; but there are other five 
in different parts of the county, belonging to merchants and ma- 
nufacturers in the burgh. The yearly receipts for bleaching yarns 
at these seven bleachfields amount to fully L. 30,000. 

Previous to the introduction of mill-spun yarn, manufacturers 
got their flax dressed in the town, and sent it to agents through- 
out the country, to be given out to women to be spun. Inferior 
yarns were imported in large quantities from Germany and Prus- 
sia. Hand- spun yarns were also brought from Ireland, and par- 
cels were occasionally procured from the north of Scotland. The 
difficulty of obtaining supplies of yarn was so great, that orders for 
goods had often to be refused. Yarns continued to be imported 
till witliin the last ten years. 

Cotton spinning was carried on here till about 1805. It was on 
a very limited scale however, as may be inferred from the fact, that 
neither steam nor water power was ever apjilied to it. 

Flax-spinning, by machinery, was introduced into this neigh- 
bourhood from Darlington about 1793. At first the frames were 
small, and were driven by the hand. In 1807, a steam-engine of 
six horse-power was applied to flax-spinning. The price of mill- 
spinning after its introduction was from Is. to 2s. perspyndle; at 
present it is not more than 3d. to 5d., and the price of a spyndle 
of yarn used in the common manufacture of the district, is from 
Is. 6d. to 2s.. At present a girl will attend fifty spindles, and 
will produce 25 spyndles of yarn per day. About forty years ago a 
girl attended 24 spindles, and produced seven spyndles per day. 
Mills are now erected in Kirkcaldy or the neigbourhood, belong- 
ing to merchants and manufacturers within the burgh, which con- 
tain 13000 spindles, the cost of erecting which must have been 
L.90,000, and they will produce 6000 spyndles of yarn per day. 
Besides supplying the manufacturers in the district, the spinners 
now export large quantities of linen yarns to France. Notwith- 
standing the difficulties interposed by the additional import duties 
on linen yarns lately imposed by the French government, the trade 



756 



FIFESHIRE. 



with France is still carried on. The yarns annually exported for 
the previous two years, from Kirkcaldy, may be estimated at about 
700 tons, the value of which will be upwards of L.60,000. 

The progress and prosperity of flax-spinning called for en- 
gineers and machine-makers, consequently a large and import- 
ant branch of this trade has recently sprung up. There are 
in the parish three works, engaged chiefly in making steam-en- 
gines, and flax-spinning machines, in executing mill-wright work, 
and in founding iron and brass. In these three works 200 men, at 
an average wage of I5s. per week, are employed. The mills in the 
district have not furnished sufficient employment for these esta- 
blishments, especially during the depression of late years; but ex- 
tensive orders have been executed in them for Ireland, the conti- 
nent of Europe, and the British colonies. The capital invested in 
these works will amount to L.21,000; and steam-engines, equal 
to twenty horses power, are constantly employed in them. 

Navigation.— Vhe port of Kirkcaldy, including the sub-port of 
Anstruther, extends from Aberdour, in the Frith of Forth, to 
Guard Bridge, in the upper part of St Andrews Bay, bemg about 
fifty-two miles of coast. The registered shipping consists of 160 
vessels, with a tonnage of 12,077. There belong to the head port 
91 vessels— 8911 of tonnage. Two smacks ply regularly between 
• London and Kirkcaldy; and there are regular traders from Kirk- 
caldy to Leith and Glasgow. Two vessels are engaged in whale- 
fishing; the rest in trading to North and South America, the 
Mediterranean, France, the Baltic, and occasionally beyond the 
Cape of Good Hope. The foreign ships which usually trade 
to this port are Norwegian, Danish, Hanseatic, Hanoverian, 
Prussian. On an average of years there have been 92 vessels 
from foreicrn parts. The principal articles of import are flax and 
timber ; of export, coals and linen yarns. Nearly thirty years ago 
ve'sels began to sail from Kirkcaldy to the whale-fishmg in Davis 
Straits. For a number of years this trade increased, and was 
very profitable. In 1828, nine vessels belonging to this port, with 
a tonnage of 3008, were engaged in this fishing. A few prospe. 
rous years succeeded, and large profits were realized. In 18cJd, 
the Kirkcaldy ships brought home 900 tons of oil, and 60 tns 
of bone, the value of which was not less than L.30,000. I he 
fishing trade has declined since 1835; and, but for the partial 
success of last year, the fishing would very probably have been 
this year entirely abandoned. .

fessedly for encouraging or improving any branch of industry, is 
an Agricultural Society. It meets twice a year for competition 
among its members in seeds, crops, and stock ; and it might be very 
advantageous to farming interests, if the proprietors in the neigh- 
bourhood were more generally to give its meetings the support and 
countenance, by premiums and attendance, which they justly deserve.. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
MarAeifs.— Kirkcaldy is the market-town, not of the parish only, 
but of an extensive district. Retail dealers in the surrounding- 
towns and villages are supplied with goods by Kirkcaldy merchants. 
This creates business for carriers, who frequent the town chiefly 
on Tuesdays and Fridays, and cause considerable bustle on the 
streets. A corn-market is held on Saturday. It was at one time 
only a sample market, and most of the buyers came from Leith. 
After the sales, the grain was shipped at the ports along the coast 
most convenient for sellers. The town- council erected a stock- 
market, and opened it for business in 1827. Not only is the grain 
grown in the neighbourhood mostly sold in this market, but large 
quantities are brought to it from within a circuit of fourteen or sixteen 
miles. The attendance of merchants belonging to the burgh, and 
buyers from other places, is numerous; and prices are generally a 
shade higher here than in any other market in Fife. The market 
was unpopular at first, and not a third part of the grain raised 
in the district was brought to it for some years after it was opened. 
When the fact came to be known that better prices were obtained . 
when grain was sold in stock than when sold by sample, the pre- 
judices of the sellers were removed, grain was brought from more 
distant places, and the quantity offered weekly for sale increased, 
so that this has now become the leading corn market in the county. 
About 2.5,000 quarters of grain are annually sold in the Kirkcaldy 
stock market; and 10,000 quarters more are annually sold in the 
market by sample. The success of this market has operated fa- 
vourably on other branches of business, by augmenting the num- 
ber of weekly visitors, and adding not a little to the circulation of 
money in the town. In this as in other stock markets, all sales are 
for ready money, and the effect of this upon the retail trade in the 
town is beneficial. The market-dues are ld. per quarter, and 
no shore-dues are charged on market grain, if it be shipped within 
fourteen days after it is sold. 

Few places in Scotland have a better flesh market. Besides 
furnishing the town and neighbourhood with a regular supply of 



758 



FIFESHIRE. 



superior butcher- meal, the fleshers have been in the practice for 
some years of sending large quantities of meat, of all descriptions, 
to the" London and Glasgow markets. No regular fishers are re- 
sident here. The town is supplied with fish from Buckhaven and 
other villages on the south coast of Fife. The fish is commonly 
carried by land, though boats occasionally expose fish for sale on 
the beach ; but the vicinity of Edinburgh has a tendency to keep 
up the price of this article of food in Kirkcaldy. 

There are a number of large and handsome shops in the town, 
in some of which there is carried on an extensive wholesale and 
, retail trade. In this respect a great change has taken place within 
the last fifty years. It was not uncommon in the end of last cen- 
tury for grocers, drapers, and other merchants from Edinburgh 
and Leith to make regular calls on families here for orders, and 
many families were supplied with goods in this way. About the 
same time oatmeal was regularly imported into the parish for 
consumption from Mid- Lothian, whereas now great quantities of 
grain are constantly exported for the Edinburgh market. 

Burgh.— T\\Q town-council consists of 21 members, who are 
elected by a constituency of 250,— the number of parliamentary 
voters within the ancient royalty. The council elect from their 
own number a provost and admiral, two bailies, a dean of guild, and 
a treasurer, on whom the management of the municipal affairs in a 
great measure depend. The burghs of Kirkcaldy, Dysart, King- 
horn, and Burntisland return a member to Parliament. 

The town has no police ; but the magistrates, the convener of 
the incorporated trades, and sixteen inhabitants, chosen by pro- 
prietors and tenants, being possessors of heritable subjects, withm 
the burgh, of the yearly rent or value of eight pounds, are consti- 
tuted, by Act of Parliament, a board of trustees, « for widenmg, 
pavincT, liahting, cleansing, and otherwise improving and keepmg 
in rep°air the streets, lanes, and passages of the said royal burgh,' 
« and for bringing water into the same:" and they are empowered 
to levy for these purposes an assessment, not exceeding five per 
cent, on the rental. This assessment realizes at present upwards 
of L 500, and enables the trustees to light the streets with gas, to 
do something to keep them clean, and to supply the town with 
water, brought from a distance, and carried through the streets 

'"larLr— " The harbour of Kirkcaldy, though the property

sioners, chosen in terms of a statute passed in 1829. The commis- 
sioners are, the provost, two baihes, dean of guild, and treasurer of 
the burgh, and the convener of the seven incorporated trades ; three 
commissioners chosen by the Prime Gilt Society, which is com- 
posed of ship-owners and ship-masters ; three chosen by the mer- 
chant traffickers; and two chosen by the county of Fife." The 
revenue of the harbour belongs to the town, and the trustees have 
no funds, except such sums as may be granted to them by the town- 
council for the use of the harbour. It has been improved and ex- 
tended at various times ; but, being accessible by heavily laden ves- 
sels only at spring-tides, it is exceedingly inconvenient and disad- 
vantageous for merchants, whose profits now depend so much on 
quickness of dispatch. It is also unsafe and incommodious for 
vessels. The want of a good harbour here has long been felt and 
complained of; and this seems to have an adverse influence on 
the increase of the trade of the town. Attempts are now making 
to supply this want. About a month ago, the town-council resolv- 
ed to improve the harbour by extending the east pier, according 
to a plan furnished by James Leslie, Esq. civil-engineer, Dundee. 
Contractors have been advertised for, and the work is expected to 
proceed this year. It will cost L.10,000. This, however, is only 
a part of the proposed improvement and extension. The comple- 
tion of the plan is supposed to require from L.30,000 to L.40,000 ; 
but the council have wisely determined to proceed according to 
their pecuniary means, and not all at once to overburden the town 
with debt. The revenue of the harbour is the chief income of the 
town ; and this seems to impose on the council an obligation to 
provide as good accommodation as possible for vessels that fre- 
quent the harbour. The shore-dues have increased very rapidly 
of late years. The tacksman of the shore-dues complained to the 
council, in 1744, of the loss he was sustaining by his lease. For 
the ease and encouragement of the tacksman, " the council doe 
agree to set him the shoar-dues for this current year at four pounds 
Sterling, and recommend to the clerk to get him to enact there- 
fore with a sufficient cautioner." 

In 1791 the shore-dues were L.135 ; in 1811, a little above 
L.300 ; in 1823, let at L.625. In 1825, the council took the 
collection of them into their own hands ; and in 1827 they amounted 
to L.1191 ; and in 1842, including the commuted anchorage of 
steam-boats, and exclusive of the charges of collecting, they 
amounted to L.1716.

Revenue.— The funds of this burgh have long been managed 
with great economy. The honour of correcting abuses in this de- 
partment of the town council's administration was not reserved for 
the operation of the Municipal Reform Act. The debt of the 
town is now nearly liquidated,— a state of affairs found in few Scot- 
tish burghs, and this is at once a practical testimony of the judi- 
cious management of the public functionaries, and of the town's pro- 
sperity. At the Revolution, the town had a debt of 60,000 merks, 
or L.3333 Sterling. It seems never to have been liquidated. In 
1791, it was L.2430; in 1832, L.7649. At the balance in Oc- 
tober last, it was only L.775, 6s. 2d. The income of the town, in 
1788, was L.284, lis. lid.  The revenue last year was L.2312, 
1 s. 6d. The town has no landed property. The commonties, 
consisting of 487 acres, at one time belonged to the town ; but 
these lands were all feued out in J 723 and 1750. Their full 
value at the time seems to have been obtained for them ; and the 
grassum paid for them, as well as the price of redeeming the feu- 
duty, appears to have been laid out in repairing the harbour, for 
the " pier met with a disaster be and through the late violent 
storme, that it is dung through and through." This was one of 
the council's reasons for disposing of their lands, and the invest- 
ment of the price in the harbour is perhaps better for the town 
than if the lands had still been retained. The revenue of the 
burffh arises from shore-dues, feu-duties, petty customs, the mar- 

ket-place, warehouses, &amp;c. 

Means of Communication.-~The town has a post-office, and the 
letters are delivered twice a-day. Daily coaches either start, from 
the town, or pass through it, to Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, bt 
Andrews, and Glasgow. A steam-boat constantly plies the ferry 
between Newhaven and Kirkcaldy. During the summer, it makes 
eiaht passages, affording four opportunities of crossing from each 
side; durino- the winter months, there are only six passages. A 
railway is, at present, projected from Lochgelly colliery to the 
town and l-.arbour of Kirkcaldy, a distance of eight miles ; and no- 
tices have been served of application being to be made to the farst 
session of Parliament for a bill giving power to the shareholders 
to carrv this railway through. , ■ nx ■ 

The collector of excise for Fife and Kinross has his office in 
Kirkcaldy The revenue realized from the excise-duties within 
the bounds of this collection amounted last year to L. 167,420. 
In 1819, it was L.95,700. This increase is chiefly owing to the

duty on spirits sent to England being now paid in Scotland, 
whereas, prior to 1826, this duty was paid in England. The in- 
crease would have been L. 40,000 more, had not the duties on 
beer, candles, tiles, leather, and salt been repealed since 1819. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church stands upon the rising 
ground to the north of the High Street, near the middle of the 
town, — a convenient situation for the population. It was erected 
in 1807. It is large and handsome, and Gothic in its style. It 
is oblong, with the pulpit at the end of it, und contains 1500 sit- 
tings. The fitting up and finish of its interior are chaste, without 
any superfluity of ornament ; and it has an air of elegance supe- 
rior to what is commonly met with in churches in Scotland. The 
building, from its style and elevated situation, would be an orna- 
ment to the town, were its architectural effect not destroyed by 
part of an old tower being attached to the west end of it, which is 
not only in itself devoid of beauty, but is destitute of historical in- 
terest, and even of the common attraction of a ruin, which, in the 
estimation of antiquarians, might have justified its preservation, to 
deface an elegant building, and offend the eye of strangers. It 
must indicate to strangers either a scarcity of money, or a want of 
taste in the inhabitants. Its removal, and the erection of a tower 
or spire, which would form a prominent and commanding object 
from Leith to the mouth of the Frith of Forth, have long been 
projected and talked of, but have hitherto been prevented, chiefly 
from the difficulty of raising the requisite funds. 

The age of the old church was unknown. It was repaired and 
enlarged in 1643. It required repairs in 1806 that would have 
cost L.700. Instead of expending such a sum in repairs, the he- 
ritors resolved to erect a new church, if money for this purpose 
could he raised. The novel method adopted by the heritors to 
free themselves from the expense of erecting it, has done much 
to restrict accommodation for the parishioners in the present 
church. Instead of providing funds by an assessment, as law di- 
rects, they resolved to procure plans, and to ascertain, before pro- 
ceeding to build, what sum could be realized by the sale of pews. 
After the plan of the proposed church had been exhibited for the 
inspection of the inhabitants, a committee of the heritors, appoint- 
ed for the purpose, proceeded to sell the pews by public roup. In 
the articles and conditions of sale, the following clause was insert- 
ed : " in case a sum sufficient for finishing the church shall not 
be received from the sale of seats, it will be in the power of the 



762 



FIFESHIRE. 



heritors to adopt such other method in building the church as they 
shall be advised, and in that case the sale to be made in virtue of 
these articles to be null and void." The sale of seats realized 
L.3428, and the estimate for executing the plan was L.2740. It 
would appear, however, that by extra work, changes on the plan, 
law-expenses in settling disputes with the contractor, and addi- 
tional work to make the church sufficient, the whole of the money 
was expended ; for a gallery was afterwards sold to the kirk-ses- 
sion for L.'205, Us. and a small assessment additional was requir- 
ed to settle the accounts. No detailed account of these money 
transactions can now be found ; and it is commonly said, that no 
such account was ever rendered by those who took charge of the 
business. 

Hitherto there have been no free sittings in the church. The 
kirk-session have charge of the communion or table- seats con- 
taining 160 sittings, and a gallery, which they purchased with 
poor's money, containing 200 sittings. These sittings have 
hitherto been let, and the rents applied in maintaining the 
poor. As this exaction in parish churches has been found to 
be illegal, it will, in future, be discontinued, and these sittings 
will be free. All the rest of the church is private property, 
and is occupied or let by the proprietors. Great inconvenience 
is experienced by the letting of sittings being in the hands of a 
great numiber of proprietors. It is difficult for those who want ac- 
commodation to find out where sittings may be got ; and families 
coming to the parish often find it exceedingly difficult to get them- 
selves accommodated, not so much because there is no room, for 
the church is not filled, the average attendance will be from 1200 
to 1300, but because they cannot find proprietors willing to let 
their seats. Pews of eight sittings have of late been selling for from 
L.40 to L.50. This is a virtual exclusion of the poor from the 
area of the church, in which these pews are situated, for they can- 
not acquire such pews ; and those, whose worldly circumstances 
allow them to advance such a sum for church accommodation to 
" their families, are often unwilling, by receiving a rent, to admit to 
sit beside them their less opulent neighbours.  

• An accident, attended with great loss of life, happened in this church in 1828. 
The Rev Edward Irving of London was to preach on the evening of the sacrament- 
al Sabbaih. and the church was densely crowdedbcfore the hour when worship was 
to commence. Before he entered the pulpit, the gallery upon the north side of the 
church o.ave way. in a moment and without warning, and precipitated not ess than 
250 indfviduals upon an equal number in the area below. " The scene," says an 
fe witness, - thlt immediately ensued baffles all descipt.on. The cloud ol dust 
thatlrose, the prayers and supplications for mercy, the howhngs, the groans and la-

' The manse was built in 1808, and is in good repair; but the 
offices are in a ruinous state. About six acres of land belong to 
the minister, consisting of glebe-land, and land enjoyed from a 
private mortification, in very nearly equal proportions. Its annual 
value is about L.36. 

The modified stipend is 19 chalders, but teinds to this amount 
have not yet been found. A protracted process of locahty was 
carried on, which was terminated in 1840; and there is a defi- 
ciency of L.48, 8s. 9d. of teind to make up the stipend modified. 
The interest of the money spent in this process would very nearly 
have paid this deficiency to the minister in all time coming. The 
expense of the process first and last must have been L.IOOO. The 
present stipend is paid according to a decreet of locality obtained 
in 1737, and is 120 bolls, 2 firlots, and 1 hppies barley; 79 
bolls, 3 firlots; and 2 lippies oats ; and L.13, Is. 3/gd. for vicar- 
age and communion elements. The late augmentation is 1 firlot, 3 
peeks, and of a lippie of barley, and L.44, Os. 9f d. in money. 
The decreet of 1737, which is still the rule of payment, gives the 
teind of fish according to use and wont ; but nothing is realized 
from this item. 

The ecclesiastical state of this parish has undergone several 
important changes. From an early date, and for a long period, 
the ministerial charge of the parish was collegiate. The Crown 
is patron of the first charge, and the town-council were patrons of 
the second. Prior to 1650, one-half of the second minister's sti- 
pend was paid by the town, the other half by the heritors. This 
is stated in the beginning of the oldest volume of the kirk-session 
records : " Steipend payed to the second minister of Kirkcaldie, 
viz. 800 raerks, equalie divyded by the toune and parosch." In 
1612, the town agreed to be assessed for their proportion of the 
second minister's stipend. The same day, October 14, 1612, 
" David Huchone, baillie, declarit to the haill nybouris of the 
comunitie thair present, that Mr Ihone Gillespie, minister, was 

mentations of the wounded, the frantic and terrific-like appearance of those emerg- 
ing from the broken beams and rafters, are circumstances not easy to be effaced from 
the minds of those who were called to witness them." It was a considerable time, 
amid the panic and confusion that immediately followed the dreadful crash, before 
the amount of destruction could be ascertained. The killed and wounded were as 
speedily as possible extricated from the ruins, when it was found that sixteen females 
and twelve males had perished. Few were killed by the falling of the gallery. The 
greater part of the twenty-eight were either sulTocated by the pressure of the crowd 
striving to get out, or having lost their balance, fell down, and were trodden to death. 
A lively recollection of the awful scone makes many nervous, and fills them witli 
alarm when there is an appearance of the church being crowded.

Qu'unto they maist willinglie agreit, approving and allowing the 
agrement w the said Mr Ihone to be ane gud and ane godlie wark, 
and that they willinglie agreit to be stentit to that effect." After 
1650, the date of the parish of Abbotshall being disjoined from 
Kirkcaldy, the town paid the whole of the second minister's sti- 
pend. No hesitation in appointing, and no doubts of the town's 
liability to support the second minister, seem to have arisen till 
about 1740. The difficulty of continuing to maintain this living 
was occasioned by a considerable portion of an augmentation, ob- 
tained by the first minister in 1737, having fallen on the town for 
the lands they had feued, in the feuing of which the town reserved 
for itself all public burdens, as if for the purpose of publishing an- 
nually, that the town had once been possessed of considerable pro- 
perty in land. The town's desire to reduce the ecclesiastical 
establishment by discontinuing the second minister, in order to 
relieve the funds from the burden of his stipend, was first mani- 
fested in 1741. A vacancy was prolonged at this time for up- 
wards of two years. On various grounds, the town craved delay 
from the presbytery, always professing that there was " no inten- 
tion to sink the said charge." The council applied to the Lord 
Advocate of the day for an opinion as to their liability to appoint 
and maintain a second minister. After reasoning on the memo- 
rial, his Lordship concludes thus : " After what has been been 
said I must be of opinion, that the presbytery has a power, after 
the lapse of the patron's time, to settle a minister, and that he 
will be entitled to 1000 merks stipend, that has uniformly been 
paid to the second minister for so long a time." On receiving 
this opinion, the town-council appointed a minister. When the next 
vacancy occurred in 1759, the town offered to pay the first minister 
a certain portion of the second minister's stipend if he would un- 
dertake to discharge the whole duties. This offer was accepted 
by the minister, and connived at by the presbytery, and thus the 
council accomplished, by an unworthy compromise, what they had 
previously found they could not accomplish by law. This agree-

ment was not disturbed till the death of the incumbent in 1767. 
From this date, the town has retained the wbole of the second 
minister's stipend, and the charge has remained vacant. Among 
the evils entailed by the sale of the town's lands, with a reservation 
of all the public burdens, this suppression of a ministerial charge, 
though by no means the smallest, is seldom heard of. The pur- 
chasers have gained by the bargain, the town-council have gained, 
the church and the religious interests of the community have 
chiefly suffered. 

Application was made to the presbytery in 1649, by the heri- 
tors of this parish, requesting inquiry to be made as to the neces- 
sity for erecting another church in the parish ; the heritors expres- 
sing, at the same time, their willingness to provide a church and 
stipend for an additional minister, should the Presbytery think this 
necessary. Heritors and presbyteries appear to have understood 
in these days the principles of church extension. The Presbytery 
recommended to the Commissioners of the Parliament for sur- 
renders and tithes, " that, besydes the church wtin the burgh of 
Kirkcaldie, for ye present usuallie attendit be two ministers, a 
church sould be erectit in ye landward for a distinct congregation." 
The proposed disjunction took place in the following year, and 
the present parish of Abbotshall, which contains almost the whole 
of the landward part of the original parish of Kirkcaldy, was 
erected. 

The Rev. Robert M'Indoe, a member of the original Burgher 
Associate Synod, who had a congregation in this parish, lately re- 
turned with many of his brethren to the communion of the Church 
of Scotland. A new church, containing 840 sittings, has been 
erected for this congregation, which cost L.2000. It was opened 
' last year. It is situated near the east end of the town, is called 
the East Port Church, and has the eastern part of the burgh, 
containing a population of 1977, assigned to it as a parish quoad 
sacra. The stipend is derived from seat-rents and collections, 
and varies according to the number of members. The minister 
has no bond for his stipend. 

Besides the two churches in connection with the Establishment, 
there are four places of worship in the parish belonging to different 
religious denominations, viz. United Secession, Episcopalians, In- 
dependents, and Scottish Baptists. A few Bereans and old In- 
dependents regularly meet for worship, but neither of them has a 
church.

These stipends are raised from collections and seat-rents. 
There are two diets for public worship each Sabbath in all the 
churches ; in sonae of them there are frequently three. These 
congregations are collected from a number of parishes; and, on 
the other hand, many from this parish attend a United Secession 
congregation in Abbotshall, and a congregation of Original Se- 
ceders in Pathhead, and a few go to a Relief church in Dysart. 

Religious ocieties. —There are two Bible Societies in the parish, 
a Tract Society, a Sabbath Evening School Society, and a Parochial 
Association in connection with the General Assembly's Schemes. 
Some of the congregations have missionary associations within 
themselves. The average amount annually collected for purely 
religious purposes by the societies within the parish cannot be less 
than L.150. The interest of L.400, mortified by Robert Philp, 
Esq. for the circulation of the scriptures, is annually sent to the 
British and Foreign Bible Society, agreeably to the directions 
given in his trust-deed. 

Education.— Theve are 15 schools in the parish, attended by 
773 scholars. Eight of these, with 206 scholars, are taught by 
females ; three for young ladies, who are instructed in French, 
music, &amp;c; and five for girls, who are taught needle-work, as 
well as the elementary branches of English reading, writing, and 
arithmetic ; one of them called the Ladies' School, because it is 
supported and superintended by a committee of ladies, is partially 
maintained by subscriptions ; and another is supported chiefly by 
the benevolence of one family. There is an infant school includ- 
ed in the eight, which is also supported by subscriptions. 

The heritors have never been burdened with the maintenance 
of a parochial school in this parish. The town's funds bear the whole 
expense of the burgh school. For a long period this school had 
two teachers, who received small salaries, and were quite inde- 
pendent of each other ; and in order to prevent interference or 
opposition, they were restricted by the council to teach particular 
branches. The burgh school is now under the charge of Mr John 
Lockhart, as rector, with one assistant. He is allowed L.50 of

salary, without a house, and L.40 for his assistant. There are 
upwards of 170 pupils attending the school. The present school- 
house is insufficient for the accommodation of such a number ; 
but measures are at present in progress for erecting new and more 
commodious school-rooms in a more open and airy situation than 
that of the present school- house. The elementary branches are 
taught in all the schools, and in three of them, Greek, Latin, 
French, and mathematics are taught. In the burgh school, the 
fees vary from 3s. to 10s. per quarter, according to the branches 
taught. In some of the other schools the fees are higher, and in 
some a shade lower than the rates fixed by the council for the 
burgh teacher. " Scale of fees in the burgh school, fixed by the 
magistrates : English alone, 3s. per quarter; English with writing, 
4s. 6d. ; English grammar, arithmetic, and writing, 5s. 6d. ; 
arithmetic, rudiments of Latin, geography, and writing, 6s. 6d. ; 
writing alone, for one hour, 2s. 6d. The above fees include pens, 
and no charge is to be made for coals or janitor." 

" Any branches taught besides the above, to be by special agree- 
ment with the teacher ; but in no case can more than 3s. 6d. per 
quarter be charged, in addition to the highest rate of 6s. 6d. as 
above, making in all 10s. per quarter." 

Robert Philp, Esq. a native of this parish, long an extensive 
manufacturer in the town, and an elder in the Established Church, 
who died in 1828, left the munificent bequest of L.74,000, the 
interest of which is to be expended in educating and clothing 400 
children, who are " most needy," in this district Schools have 
been erected and teachers appointed under this trust in Kirkcaldy, 
Pathhead, and Abbotshall. In Pathhead, 150 children are taught 
and clothed ; in Kirkcaldy, 100 ; in Abbotshall, 100 ; and 50 chil- 
dren are sent to the parish school of Kinghorn and clothed by the 
trust. Children are not admissible under six years of age, and they 
are notallowed to remain after they are fifteen. Well-behaved scho- 
lars, on leaving school, are allowed a sum " to enable them to 
begin the world." At present, the funds allow them from L.7 to 
L.IO, according to their merits. The management of the fund is 
committed to eighteen trustees, consisting of the two oldest jus- 
tices of the peace within the burgh, the minister of Kirkcaldy, 
three ministers of the presbytery of Kirkcaldy to be elected, four 
elders from the kirk-session of Kirkcaldy, also to be elected, and 
eight of the burgh trustees. Some of the details of managing the 
schools without the burgh are devolved on a board of managers

provided for in the trust-deed. The Kirkcaldy school is entirely 
under the management of the eighteen trustees. The teacher's 
salary in Kirkcaldy is L.lOO, and a schoolmistress is engaged to 
teach the girls to sew, at a yearly salary of L.15. The branches 
taught are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, and music. The 
testator provides for a Sabbath school being taught in all the four 
districts, and allows an annual sum of L,10 to each district for 
this purpose. 

The sum of L.780 was mortified by Mr John Thomson, mer- 
chant in Kirkcaldy, who died in 1810, the half of the interest of 
which is to be expended " in paying school wages, and providing 
school-books for poor children of the parish of Kirkcaldy." 
About 20 children of the class described receive education from 
this fund. 

Few places in Scotland enjoy such educational advantages as 
Kirkcaldy. There are few, if any in the parish, above twelve 
vears of age, who cannot read ; there are very few who cannot 
write a little. Nor need there be any. With such faciUties for 
obtaining a gratuitous education, the neglect of it in the poorest 
would be inexcusable. It may be inferred, from the number and 
urgency of applicants for the benefit of the trust-funds of Philp 
and Thomson, that the advantages of education are generally ap- 
preciated. 

Literature.— There are five public libraries in the parish, viz. 
Kirkcaldy Subscription Library, with 4000 volumes ; Kirkcaldy 
Mechanics' Library, 1500; United Secession Congregational 
Library, 340 ; two circulating libraries, 2600. 

Scientific Association.— k scientific association was formed here 
a few years ago, which provides u course of popular scientific lec- 
tures for the community during ihe winter season. These lec- 
tures have frequently excited considerable interest. They have 
been generally well attended, and have diffused much valuable 

information. n 1 1 

There is a public reading-room in the town, and a small weekly 

newspaper is published on Saturday. 

Charitable Institutions.— About thirty years ago, a few friendly 
societies were formed in the parish, but being based on erroneous 
principles, they soon began to decline, and they have all been long 

extinct. r-u n '

port, and for their widows and orphans, and for the relief of ship- 
wrecked seamen, has existed in this parish from a period prior to 
1591. Officers and men, in vessels belonging to the port, long 
paid a per rentage of their wages into this society. These con- 
tributions are no longer paid. A proposal was made a few years 
ago to dissolve the society, and divide the funds among the exist- 
ing members. This was prevented by interdict, and the Court of 
Session ultimately found, that the society cannot be dissolved, and 
that the whole property of the society is held in trust for the so- 
ciety called the " Prime Gilt Box of Kirkcaldy." The value of 
the property belonging to this society, the income of which will in 
future be applied in relieving poor seamen, their widows, and or- 
phans, is from L.2000 to L.3000. 

The half of the interest of L.780, mortified by Mr John Thom- 
son, the other half being for educational purposes, is applied 
" towards the support of respectable inhabitants of Kirkcaldy who 
have seen better days,"

Bank was established here three years ago.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — No legal assessment has yet been 
imposed in this parish. The poor are maintained from the collec- 
tions at the church door and subscriptions among the inhabitants. 
The amount of annual church collections is about L.200 ; L.33 
have hitherto been got from seat-rents ; and the additional sum 
required has been furnished by subscription. A sum upwards of 
L. 400 is annually required to maintain the poor. The average 
number of paupers on the roll for a few years past is 1 10. 

Besides the provision made for paupers by the kirk-session, 
much is done in the town for the relief of the destitute, by a La- 
dies' Benevolent Society, a Clothing Society, and a fund annual- 
ly raised to supply the poor with coals. In very few parishes are

the poor more liberally provided for, and are the wants of the 
destitute more promptly attended to and relieved  

Prison. — The Kirkcaldy jail is the best in the county of Fife. 
Under the New Prison Act, its management has been much im- 
proved. The prisoners are constantly employed, and great care 
is taken that proper attention be paid to their health, their diet, 
their education, and religious instruction. It is now a place more 
for the reformation than the punishment of prisoners. 

Inns and Ale-houses.— lu the parish 54 houses are licensed to 
sell ardent spirits. Vigorous and successful efforts have been made 
of late to detect the irregularity of some of the houses, and to 
bring their possessors to punishment ; and it is to be hoped that 
this system of vigilant superintendence will be kept up, and that 
it will succeed in checking and preventing that noise and rioting, 
especially on Saturday nights and Sabbath mornings, of which 
there has been good reason to complain.

THE REV. ANGUS MACGILLIVRAY, MINISTER. 



I, — Topography and Natural History. 
Situation and Surface.— Tms parish is of an irregular form, 
extending from the south-east to the north-west, two Scots miles, 
and from the south-west to the north-east, nearly as much. Its 
general appearance is that of a gently rising ground. The soil 
is for the most part fertile, and in many places rich and deep. 
The air is generally dry and healthy. There are no considerable 
rivers in this district, except the Eden, which forms its boundary 
to the south and south-east. 

Craigfoodie Hill is the highest point of land in the parish, and 
may be about 500 feet above the level of the sea. It pre- 
sents a fine precipitous mural and somewhat columnar front to 
the south-west. Another height towards the west is Foodie Hill, 
planted on which a whinstone quarry has been opened. The lower 
parts of the parish, near the river Eden, exhibit freestone in 
abundance.

Rivers. — The river Eden abounds in salmon and trout, and the 
" Dairsie streams" are well known to the lovers of ancrlincr. 

The only other river except the Eden is the Middlefoodie Burn, 
in which there are some trout. It intersects the parish towards 
the north, and runs eastward till, joining the Mottray, both of these 
streams run into the Frith of Eden, near the Inner Bridge, about 
two miles from the German Ocean.

ties are as follows : Chapelwell and Dairsie, Judge Erskine ; New 
Mill, Mrs Bayne ; Todhall and Middle Foodie, the Trustees of 
James Cheape, Esq. ; Fingask, Heirs of the late Mr Somerville, 
now sold to Thomas Whitson, Esq.; Wester Craigfoodie, William

Mansion-houses. — These are, Craigfoodie, Mr Meldrum ; Pitor- 
mie, Mr Meldrum ; Newmill, Mrs Bayne. 

Castle of Dairsie. — The old Castle of Dairsie, now in ruins, 
although still in wonderful preservation, is situated on that part of 
the estate of Dairsie parish known by the name of Dairsie, the 
property, at this time, of Judge Erskine, by his marriage with Miss 
Traill, the daughter of the former proprietor. It is built upon a 
rising ground near the banks of the river Eden, which stream forms 
the southern boundary of that beautiful estate for about one mile 
and a half. This must have been a place of some consequence in 
early times, for we learn, that, in the minority of David II., 1335, 
the then Regents of Scotland, Stewart and Moray, held a Parlia- 
ment in the Castle of Dairsie, probably selected as a place of 
strength and retirement in these troublesome times.f 

The estate of Dairsie, like most others in the country, has 
had many owners. On 28th December 1520, it was conveyed 
by feu-charter by Andrew Archbishop of St Andrews and his 
chapter, to David Learmonth of Clatta and his son James. Con- 
tmumg m the possession of the family of the Learmonths till 
1616, It became the property of the Spottiswoods, the unfor- 

thl Sh.""'''''' gentleman connecled with one of the principal estates in

tunate family who suffered so much by opposingf the Covenant- 
ers. Dr John Spottiswood of Dairsie was Archbishop of St 
Andrews and Chancellor of Scotland about 1590. His son, Sir 
Robert, recovered many records and documents about the Scot- 
tish Church from abroad, which had been carried away by the 
monks at the time of the Reformation. He was beheaded at St 
Andrews, 1646, by decree of Parliament assembled there. 
Captain John Spottiswood, younger of Dairsie, was put to death 
in Edinburgh, 1650, at the same time as was the gallant and re- 
nowned James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, and many others. 
In 1646, Sir John Spottiswood conveyed Dairsie to Sir G. Mor- 
rison, Knight, and it was adjudged by his creditors, and purchased 
by Thomas Earl of Kincardine for L.73,630, 3s. 4d. Scots. In 
1772, it was again sold by the Earl then of Elgm and Kmcar- 
dine, to General Scott of Balcomy, and falling to h,s eldest 
dauo-hter Henrietta, who was married to the Duke of Portland, 
it was purchased by Mr Barnes of London, and afterwards became, 
disjoined, in consequence of speculating purchasers, until it re - 
mains with the heritors already enumerated. 

On the estate of Dairsie is a pleasant small residence, called 
Dairsie Cottage, of modern date, and surrounded with wood. It 
stands to the west of the castle, overlooking the Eden. A num- 
ber of years since, it was occupied for some time by that unfortu- 
nate nobleman, Lord William Russell, who was so inhumanly 
murdered in London lately by his French valet Courvois.er. 
During his residence there, his Lordship was much admired for 
his unpretending mode of life and kind behaviour, although he 
lived strictly private, and was held in high esteem m the ne.gh- 

°Near the old castle, the grounds of which the present proprie- 
tor keeps in great order, is the parish church bu.lt by the Arch- 
bishop Spottiswood about 1615. In the life of Spottiswood pre- 
fixed to his History of the Church, it is said, " He, the Arch- 
bishop, built upon his own charges the church of Dairsie after the 
decent English form, which, if the boisterous hand of a mad re- 
formation had not disordered, is at this tune 1678 one of the 
beautifuUest little pieces of church work that is now left to that 

now unhappy country." 

The above is far from an overstretched account of this ed.tice, 
which originally had a flat roof with lead, and most grotesque

shaped windows in the Gothic style, and a belfry tower near it. 
Now it is modernized by a roof of the modern shape, and the 
steeple pointed as others. 

In the records of the synod of Fife, lately published for the 
Abbotsford Club, we find that, in 1641, a report anent the church 
of Dairsie was presented, when it appeared that the brethren and 
ruling elders had been appointed to visit the church of Dairsie, 
" anent superstitious monuments and kirk burial," who found 
that, " at the entrie of sindrie desks upon the platform, and above 
the great west door, there are crosiar staffes, being a sign of the de- 
gree of the last prebend and bishops, as not hierarchical according 
to the manner and form used among the Roman hierarchs, and 
further found superstitious " a glorious partition wall, with a 
degree ascending thereto." All these were denounced by the 
provincial assembly, and the minister, and elders, and heritors 
were ordained " to take order of the same," and this order was 
several times renewed in after meetings. In 1645, in an assem- 
bly held at Dunfermline, an order was made about " the levelling 
of the queer in Dairsie Church." 

Within these few years, a vault was discovered in the east end 
of the church, near the pulpit, and found to contain coffins and 
bones, being used as a place of interment. It is understood that 
this practice of burying in the inside of churches is in future to 
be done away with, as prejudicial to the health of the sitters.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Filiates.— The villages in this parish are those of Middlefoodie 
and Osnaburgh, or Dairsie Moor. The former consists of a 
few straggling houses and some small feus. The houses are 
principally oflittle value, most of them being occupied by the la- 
bourers on Todhall, to the proprietor of which Mr Cheape's Trus- 
tees most of them belong. The village of Osnaburgh is be- 
coming more populous, and is a thriving village about a quarter 
of a mile from the church to the northward, and is intersected by 
the great posting road from Edinburgh by Cupar to Newport. 
The turnpike road is well kept, and several coaches pass daily 
through this village.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. GEORGE MIDDLETON, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, Name. — This parish is bounded on the north by 
Abernethy and Arngask; on the west, by Orwelland Portmoak'; 
on the south, by Falkland and Portmoak ; and on the east, by 
Auchtermuchty. The name is obviously derived from the Miglo, 
a small stream which flows eastward through the strath, and is 
aftervyards designated the Eden. In form, the parish resembles a 
very irregular oblong, extending in length seven miles, and varying 
from two to four miles in breadth. 

Topographical Appearances.— The greater part of the surface 
consists of two gentle acclivities rising on either side of the 
stream which divides the parish. On the south, and forming a 
striking natural limit to the parish, rises the West Lomond hill, 
whose elevation above the level of the sea has been computed at 
1700 feet, and which, diversified by bold mural cliffs, thriving 
woods, and rich sward, constitutes a very picturesque object. On 
the north, it terminates in a succession of inconsiderable eminences, 
which may be regarded as a continuation of the Ochil range. 

 See Appendix to Records oi Synod of Fife, printed for Abbotsford Club.

Soil. — The soil on the south is light, and rests on red sandstone ; 
it is not remarkable for fertility, though in some farms good bar- 
ley is raised. On the north of the Miglo, the soil rests on a whin- 
stone bed, and consists of a rich friable loam, which yields abun- 
dant crops. There is thus no want of good materials, both free- 
stone and whin, adapted for building and enclosures. From the 
side of the Lomond hill, white freestone has also been quarried, 
which is said to be durable and susceptible of a fine polish. It is 
surprising that the latter has been so little used instead of the 
dingy brick-red, which offends the eye in most of the mansions in 
the neighbourhood. 

II. — Civil, History. 
At a remote period, the lands of Strathmiglo appear to have 
belonged to the Crown, whence they passed into the hands of the 
Scotts of Balwearie, an ancient and powerful family. In the be- 
ginning of the sixteenth century, a royal charter was granted, con- 
stituting these lands into a barony, with power to form the feuars 
into a burgh of barony, and vesting the nomination of its magis- 
trates in the superior. The superiority afterwards was obtained by 
the family of Balfour of Burleigh, noted in Scottish history, whose 
arms are carved on the front of the town-house. After the Re- 
bellion in 1745 was quelled, hereditary jurisdictions, the barbaric 
remnant of feudalism, were annulled ; and Strathmiglo was, in con- 
sequence, deprived of the usual baronial privileges. The feuars, 
however, still retain the management of some property pertaining 
to the original burgh, and use it in a very creditable and beneficial 
manner. 

The ecclesiastical history of this parish is not destitute of inte- 
rest. The church was originally collegiate, and connected with 
the bishopric of Dunkeld. When the Papal hierarchy was assail- 
ed and overturned, this, in common with many other districts in 
Fife, took a lively interest in the Reformed religion, and steadily 
adhered to the Presbyterian worship and government through its 
checquered and eventful history. A sequestered spot, called Glen- 
vale, is still pointed out as a place of resort in troubled limes. 
In point of romantic scenery, it may bear comparison with the 
wild recess in Cartland Crags, where the Covenanters of the 
west met for the same purpose. When the secession took 
place early in last century, we find a notarial protest taken 
by the kirk-session of this parish against the Seceders ordain- 
ina elders here, charging them with " intrusion," and threaten-

ing prosecution. This singular paper may be found p. 194 
in Swan's Views arid History of Fife. The following is a list of 
the ministers of this parish from an early period : — 

1. Mr George Leslie, .1360 ; admitted vicar of Auchtermuchty, 
1575. 2. Mr William Braidfut, 1360. 3. Mr John Balfour, 
reader, with L.20 Scots of stipend. 4. Mr Alexander Muir, mi- 
nister, 1574, with L.106, 13s. 4d. Scots of stipend. 5. Robert 
Scott, reader. 6. Mr James Balcanquel, 1389. 7. John Mon- 
criefF, 1633. 8. John Murray, conformed to Presbytery in 1638. 
9. John Rigg, admitted 1655, and afterwards conformed to Epis- 
copacy. 10. David Barclay, outed in 1689. 11. Alexander 
Auchmoutie, 1690. 12. Thomas Black, 1695. 13. Mr George 
Gillespie, 1699, grandson of the famous George Gillespie, mem- 
ber of the Westminster Assembly. 14. George Lyon, 1754, 
grandson of the above Mr Gillespie. 15. Mr John Martin. 16. 
George Bennet. 17. George Middleton, 1836. 

Antiquities. — Within a recent period, the west portion of this 
parish is said to have contained numerous cairns, imagined to be 
relics of Druidical superstition. On and around the West Lo- 
mond, may be found abundance of rocky fragments of fantas- 
tic shape and position ; but whether so moulded and piled by 
nature or by the " Druid hoary," we pretend not to determine. 
"Within the memory of the present generation, there also existed 
several barrows and tumuli, with human bones, ashes, and warlike 
instruments. The consequence has been, that Strathmiglo has now 
lodged its claim among the parishes which compete for the honour 
of containing the site of the celebrated battle of Mons Grampius, 
described by Tacitus, in which the warlike but undisciplined Cale- 
donians under Galgacus were defeated by the legions of Agricola.

The lands of this parish are divided among twenty-three pro- 
prietors, of whom eighteen possess property of the yearly value of 
L. 50 and upwards. Eight of the heritors are non-resident. Six 
individuals in the parish are fatuous; one is blind from the effects 
of an accident ; and one is deaf and dumb. There is no peculia- 
rity in the general customs or character of the people deserving 
of special notice. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — This parish gives employment to 186 males as far- 
mers and farm-servants. Its surface may amount to about oOOO acres; 
of which nearly 600 are entirely adapted for pasturage, and 350 are 
planted. The remainder is under regular cultivation. Upon minute 
inquiry, the gross rental of the parish at present is fully L.9000. 
According to the diversity of soil and situation, the annual rent 
per acre varies from 15s. to L.4. The most extensive land-owner 
is P. G. Skene, Esq. of Hallyards and Pitlour. The leases ex- 
tend, with some trifling exceptions, to nineteen years, the rent 
being generally payable, partly in money and partly in grain, ac- 
cordfng to the fiars prices. The tenantry may justly be charac- 
terized as an intelligent and enterprizing body of men, under whom 
husbandry has reached a very advanced stage of improvement. 
In the more fertile farms, a rotation of four years is adopted, its 
tendency to exhaust the soil being counteracted by the liberal ap- 
plication of manure, partly produced on the farm and partly pro- 
cured, at a considerable expense, from the adjacent villages. In 
the less fertile soils, the fields are usually allowed to remain three 
years in grass, making a rotation of six years. Nearly the whole 
parish is divided by substantial enclosures. In several of the 
thrashing-machines, water-power is employed; and the farm- 
steadings are in general commodious and in good repair. There 
is one flour-mill, recently improved and enlarged, and four for 
other descriptions of grain. 

Manufactures.— T\ie staple employment of the great body of 
the parishioners of both sexes in the village is the manufacture of 
linens. These are wrought up in great variety, such as diapers, 
damask, dowlas, linen checks, and table-linens. In this depart- 
ment of industry, from 500 to 600 persons are engaged. For- 
merly, the hand-loom weavers were employed by the extensive 
manufacturers of Dunfermline, Dundee, and Kirkcaldy, by means 



« 



STKATHMIGLO. 779 

of intermediate agents ; but of late, almost the whole trade has 
been carried on by resident manufacturers, transacting business on 
their own account. There are also in the parish a bleachfield and 
a spinning-mill, both of which are upon a small scale. Those 
employed in weaving are of course paid by the piece, and work 
from ten to fourteen hours per day. From the fluctuations in 
trade, the rate of remuneration is necessarily very variable. A 
few vears ago, it was double and even treble its present amount. 
But although this, in common with other manufacturing districts, 
has severely felt the late depression of trade, very few have here 
been destitute of employment for any great length of time ; and, 
small as the wages have been, and still are, it has not been found 
necessary, as in many other localities under similar circumstances, 
to have recourse to extraordinary measures, to meet the pressing 
wants of the population. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — There is no market in this parish; but in the 
adjacent towns of Auchtermuchty, Milnathort, Newburgh, and 
Cupar, at distances varying from two to eleven miles, regular 
weekly markets are held. Auchtermuchty is the nearest. In 
Newburgh, at the distance of eight miles, a ready market is af- 
forded for potatoes, cattle, swine, &amp;c., which are shipped thence 
for the London market. The population in the village of Strath- 
miglo and its outskirts amounts to nearly 1400. The only other 
village is Edenshead or Gateside. 

Means of Communication. — These are in general good. The 
parish may contain eight miles of turnpike, and five of statute la- 
bour roads, all kept in excellent order. Here, as throughout the 
country at large, improvement is in nothing so evident as in the 
highways. The post-office here is an appendage to that of Kin- 
ross. No public carriages pass at present through Strathmiglo. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated near the 
east extremity of the parish ; but, being in the centre of the vil- 
lage, containing the mass of the population, no fault can be found 
with its site. It was built about fifty-eight years ago, and is in 
tolerable repair ; but it is a paltry structure, and ill seated within. 
It is also rather small, containing accommodation for 750 persons. 
There are no free sittings, the whole area being divided among 
the heritors. The price charged for a sitting, however, is small, 
being from Is. to 2s. 6d. annually. The manse is sixty years 
old, and from its situation was rather damp and confined. About 



780 



FIFESHIRE. 



five years ago, it underwent a thorough repair, and was much 
enlarged, and made altogether commodious and comfortable. 
The glebe extends to four acres. Its annual value may be L.l 2. 
By a recent decision of the Court of Teinds, the stipend was 
fixed at 17 chalders, half meal and half barley, with L.IO for 
communion elements. There is another place of worship in 
Strathmiglo, connected with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, 
stated to have a congregation of about 200 from this and other 
parishes. The number of communicants may be 140, of whom 
90 belone to Strathmiglo. At Edenshead, there is another place 
of worship, belonging to the United Associate Synod, the con- 
gregation of which has been computed at 300, of whom 200 may 
be communicants. Divine service is well attended at all these 
places of worship. Of the entire parishioners, upwards of 1400 
may be in connection with the Established Church, and the ave- 
rage number of communicants is 430. A Tract Society is in 
operation, which distributes monthly a religious tract gratuitously 
to every family in the parish. It is supported by occasional col- 
lections and contributions. 

Education,— There are five seminaries, viz. the parochial school, 
a female school, built by Mr Skene of Pitlour, who allows a small 
salary to the teacher, and three subscription schools. These are 
all conveniently situated. The parochial school was greatly en- 
larged by the heritors a few years ago, and may comfortably con- 
tain 150 pupils. A convenient play-ground was recently pur- 
chased by subscription. The teacher's dwelhng is also commo- 
dious. He has the maximum salary. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of poor on the re- 
gular roll is 18 at present, who receive altogether L.l, 12s. per 
week, the lowest allowance being Is. and the highest 4s. There 
are also two lunatics maintained in Perth Asylum, and one bhnd 
person partly supported in the Asylum for the Blind. The ex- 
pense of the three amounts to about L.50 per annum. For the 
relief of the poor, upwards of L.20 is annually obtained from the 
stated weekly offerings at the church doors. There is land of 
the yearly value of L.l 9 devoted to the same object, and a sum 
of money yielding L.IO of interest. The parochial minister has 
also the management of a small property worth L.9 annually, for 
behoof of indigent persons in the parish. The balance is made 
up by occasional voluntary assessments among the heritors. It 
may be proper to state that a Friendly Society exists here. It was 



AUCHTERMUCHTY. 



781 



formed In 1806, and at present numbers 213 members. The 
annual payment is 5s. During illness, a member of it becomes 
entitled to 3s. 6d. per week for the first nine months, after which 
the allowance is reduced to 2s. When any member is superan- 
nuated, he has a permanent weekly allowance of 1 s. It is proper to 
state, that, while in this as in every district containing a considerable 
population, there are some individuals hackneyed in mendicity, there 
is in this parish a prevailing disposition among the poor to refrain 
from seeking parochial relief. An honourable, though laborious 
independence, is in general preferred to the resources of charity.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. ROBERT JOHN JOHNSTONE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Boundaries, Sfc. — This parish is bounded on the east by the pa- 
rish of Collessie ; on the south by Falkland ; on the west by 
Strathmiglo ; and on the north by the parishes of Abernethy, 
Newburgh, and Abdie. It extends in length from north-west to 
south-west, 4 miles, and in breadth from east to west, nearly 2 
miles ; but at the north and south extremities, it does not exceed 
1 mile in breadth. The burgh and town of Auchtermuchty, which 
contains a population of 2550 persons, is situated about a mile from 
the southern boundary of the parish, which is washed by the river 
Eden, and is distant from Kirkcaldy fifteen miles, Cupar nine miles, 
Kinross ten miles, Newburgh five miles, and from Perth fifteen 
miles. The line of road from Stirling to St Andrews, perhaps 
one of the straightest and most direct in Scotland, passes through 
the southern extremity of the town ; from the former of which 
places it is thirty-three, and from the latter twenty miles. The 
eastern line of communication between Perth and Edinburgh, via 
Newburgh and Kirkcaldy, passes also through the town, and a coach 
has now been established on the road for several years.

The county of Perth extends to within less than a mile of the- 
town of Auchtermuchtyon thenorth;and theline which separatesthe 
parish, on the north-west, from that of Abernethy, forms also the 
boundary for nearly two miles, between the counties of Perth and 
Fifeshire. Almost the whole rising ground in the parish has a 
southern exposure, with an inclination towards the east, while the 
south-east part forms a section of an extensive plain of deep, rich, 
alluvial soil, which was mostly flooded with stagnant water during 
the winter season, within the remembrance of many of the mha. 
bitants, but is now thoroughly dried, and comprehends some of 
the most valuable land in Scotland, renting from L. 4, lOs. to 
L. 5 the imperial acre. 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers.- Tiie oldest record of this parish is a re- 
gister containing the minutes of kirk-session, commencing in the 
year 1650, and also a separate register of births and marriages 
from the same period. How far the latter contains a complete 
record of all the births and marriages which took place within the 
parish at this period, it is impossible to say ; but it is probable 
that these were much more accurately recorded at this early pe- 
riod, than they are now, when the parish was less a prey to reli- 
gious divisions and animosities. No particular register appears 
to have been kept of the deaths at the time, and the number is 
only to be ascertained from the notices given of the funds arising 
from the use of the mortcloth. There is, however, a blank in the 
records of this parish not easily accounted for, from 1658 and 
1667, till the beginning of the eighteenth century, when they ap- 
pear again to have been kept with considerable regularity. At 
present the records of this parish, and, perhaps, of most parishes 
in Scotland, are far from being complete. The register of mar- 
riages, amount of collections at the church doors, and minutes of 
the kirk-session, are kept with great accuracy ; but the record ot 
births and deaths is most deficient. Of the former 25, and of tlie 
latter only 8 were recorded for the year 1840, while 50 aeaths, 
and from 70 to 80 births are known to have taken place in the pa- 
rish within that period. This strange anomaly may be accounted 
for thus • Over the registration of the former, the kirk-session have 
a complete control, over the latter, as the law now stands, they have 
little or none; and, consequently, by far the most important 
records are incomplete. Few or none of the Dissenters m 
the parish register their children's names, and in a pansU 



AUCHTERMUCHTY. 



7S3 



where, at least, between thirty and forty children must be born 
of Dissenting parents yearly, there are not as many of them re- 
corded in the parochial registers for the last twenty years. With 
regard to the register of deaths, it may be observed that, for many 
years, a very faithful record was kept, while the kirk-session's 
mortcloth was used, but since it has become fashionable to use 
those of private societies, or, what is now much more common, none 
at all, no authentic record of the mortaUty which takes place with- 
in the parish is kept. 

iMnd-owners. — The principal heritors in the parish, of which 
there are 65, are, Mr Bruce of Falkland; P. G. Skene of Hall- 
yards ; and Andrew Murray, Esq. sheriff-depute of Aberdeenshire. 
The valued rent of the parish is L. 5783, 9s. lOd. Scots ; the real 
rent is L.5900 Sterling. The following are the qualified heritors 
of the parish, with their respective valuations : 

O. T. Bruce, Esq. . L. 2429 18 7 

P. G. Skene, Esq. . J 1 12 0 0

Charles Moyes, Esq. . 189 0 7 

John Bonthron, Esq. . 194 13 10 

Mansion Houses. — Myres Castle is the only mansion of any con- 
sideration in the parish. It was long the residence of the Mon- 
crieffs of Reedie, the ancestors of P. G. Skene, Esq. who sold 
the estate of Myres, together with the patronage of Auchter- 
muchty, to the late Mr Bruce, the King's printer for Scotland, 
about twenty years ago. Although a large addition was made to 
the castle about fifteen years ago, and the house is capable of ac- 
commodating a large family, the present proprietor has never taken 
up his residence here. The pleasure-grounds are not very exten- 
sive, including only a park of about thirty acres, while the lands on 
every side are perhaps too valuable for agricultural purposes ever 
to extend it beyond the present boundary. Bellevue, the property 
of Mr Marshall Gardiner, and Southfield, the property of Messrs 
Moncrieff, are very pleasing places of residence.

the south-east on the road to Falkland and the New Inn, 601 ; 
and the landward part of the parish, 293. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish is in a high state of cultivation, and the number of 
imperial acres cultivated or in tillage is 2600 nearly. The total 
extent of the parish is 2900 imperial acres, and not 3000 Scots 
acres, as stated in the Old Account. 

It does not appear that any waste lands could be added to those 
under tillage. There is an undivided common in the parish of 
about 90 acres. The number of acres under wood is about 220, 
and most of them have been planted within the last fifty years. 

Eent.— The average rent of land in this parish is very high, and 
the competition for it, when out of lease, is extremely great ; but 
the following statement, mflde from minute investigation and au- 
thentic sources, will best exhibit a comparative view of its value : 

There are WO acres, averaging L. 4 per acre, I. 1200 

600 . 3 . 1800 

1200 • 2 . 2400 

390 . I • 500 

2600 L. 5900 

The real rental of the parish is L. 5900. In this the value of 
plantations and undivided common is not included. 

Manufactures.— In the year 1817 a blight came over the ma- 
nufacturing interest in this parish, which it has never recovered. 
Since that time, trade, instead of being carried on by resident 
manufacturers, has been transacted chiefly through the medium 
of agents who give out yarns to the weavers to work from manufac- 
turers at Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, &amp;c. The manufactures 
consist of cotton and linen goods, or checks, and drills, as they 
are called, and green linens. It is generally supposed that there 
are about 700 weavers in the parish, of which one-third are females, 
whose earnings average about 5s. 6d. per week. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State.— The number of families in the parish is 
nearly 750, of which Dissenters form, as near as can be ascertain- 
ed, the one-half. . , n r i 
The stipend of the Established clergyman is 136 bolls of meal 
of 140 lb. per boll, and 99 quarters of barley, or 17 chalders in 
ofo, and L.10 in money. . t npr 
The glebe measures 8 acres imperial, and is worth L.SO per 
annum The manse was built in 1793, and is a substantial fabric. 
An addition was made to it about seven years ago, and it is now 



AUCHTERMUCHTV. 785 



one of the best and most comfortable manses in the presbytery. 
The church was built in 1780, but in 18S8 the patron made an ad- 
dition at his own individual expense upwards of L.500 by which 
nearly 400 additional sittings were added. The church now accom- 
modates 900 sitters. It is well attended ; the number of commu- 
nicants is nearly 600. There are three meeting-houses in the pa- 
rish besides, viz. two in connection with the United Secession 
Church, and one belonging to the Relief. They may accommo- 
date 1200 sitters, and are all well attended. 

Education.--Theve are six schools in the parish, of which five are 
m thetownof Auchtermuchty and one at Dunshelt, Threeof them, 
besides the parochial school, are partially endowed bv public subl 
scription or private munificence. The parochial schoolmaster's sa- 
lary is the maximum; the school fees on an average do not ex- 
ceed L.20 per annum, and his other emoluments as session-clerk 
and kirk treasurer are about L.12. 

Savings Bank.— There is a savings bank in the parish. It was 
estabhshed upwards of twenty years ago, and has been eminently 
successful. There are 490 depositors, and the sum lying at in- 
terest on the 31st of December 1840, was L. 3028, 9s. The 
benefit of the bank is not confined to persons residing in the pa- 
rish, but IS extended to the surrounding district ; and, accordingly 
a majority of the depositors are from the parishes of Strathmiglo, 
Falkland, Collessie, and the surrounding country. During the 
year 1840 nearly L.300 was added to the stock. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.~The number of persons at present 
upon the poor's roll is 62, exclusive of occasional poor, as also 
those on the list of the female society. The expenditure for the 
year ending at the 1st of April 1841 was L. 293, 15s. 6d The 
average aid given to each is about 6s. per month, but in some 
cases much more-and few or none have below 4s. per month In 
most cases, a house rent of L. 1, 5s. is also allowed, and in few 
parishes are the wants of the poor better attended to than here 
The contributions for the support of the poor in this parish have 
hitherto been made up of a voluntary assessment upon the land- 
ward heritors, and the collections at the church doors, which 
amount to about L. 30 yearly , but since the burden of support- 
ing he poor has become so heavy of late years upon the lalided 
heritors, several o whom have refused to pay their share of the 
assessment a legal assessment was imposed in September last upon 
all heritable property in the parish.

partially successful. The crops are still scanty and uncertain, and 
sonaetimes hardly defray the expense of cultivation. When em- 
ployed in draining the loch, the labourers found many large oak. 
trees deeply imbedded in the soil, and in a good state of preserva- 
tion, and some are still discovered when they are ploughing the 
ground, and digging for marl. Many deers' heads, with splen- 
did branching horns, in a petrified state, were also dug out of the 
moss, and were eagerly sought after by the lovers of natural his- 
tory, to adorn their museums. Under the moss, about two or three 
feet from the surface, there lies a bed of excellent shell-marl. It 
varies in thickness in different places from one to three feet. It 
has been employed with great success in fertilizing the soil of the 
adjacent country. Great quantities have been raised at diffei'ent 
periods, and employed with advantage, as an ingredient in com- 
post dunghills, and as a top-dressing for pasture ground, and in 
some cases it has been applied to a naked fallow like lime. 

Geology — The parish of Moonzie comprehends the summits 
and slope of three connected elevations, shutting up the west end 
of a valley extending east about two miles, by about a mile and a- 
half broad. On the west these elevations are connected by a neck 
of high land with the declivity of Norman Law, and consequenllv 
form an offset from the line of high lands formed by the Ocliil and 
Campsie hills. Observations in the neighbourhood of Cupar, near 
the line and level of the Eden's bed, as well as those made near the 
Tay in the opposite direction, give every reason to believe that 
the trap rocks, of which alone the surface of the parish is formed, 
rest upon that series tt which the name of red sandstone or old 
red sandstone is given, forming the floor of all the Fife, and I be- 
lieve, of all Scottish coal fields. 

"Whether these rocks are to be considered as contemporaneous 
with the red sandstone and subordinate to it, as some theorists con- 
tend, or as having been forced up and overflowing these rocks at 
a subsequent period by the action of internal fire, it is impossible, 
from any appearances discovering themselves here, to conjecture. 
The hills are generally rounded, and covered with soil to the sum- 
mits, and the trap of the vicinity only shows a tendency to the co- 
lumnarformin the rock of Craigfoodie hill, which affords a pictu- 
resque termination to the distant view down the valley to the east- 
ward. Beds of trap tufa and boulders, crumbling down in layers

from the surfece, contribute much to enrich the soil, which, in 
many places, might at first seem sterile from its proximity to the 

rock. • , • • . 11 f 

At some places, amygdaloid is to be found contammg balls ol 

agate or Scotch pebble in concentric layers. 

The only exception to the rocky material constituting the sur- 
face of the parish is from the presence of those masses, often many 
tons in weight, rounded and water-worn, of which I noticed one 
lately on the side of the road near CoUuthie. The parent rock 
of all these, which is numerous on many other moors in Fifeshire, 
I need hardly observe, is far to the north-west. 

II. — Civil History. 
Sibbald, in his History of Fife, seems to be of opinion that 
Moonzie was early visited with the light of the Gospel. He re- 
lates that St Regulus, in the fourth century, havmg landed at St 
Andrews, and formed a Christian establishment there, travelled 
through the country, and built several wooden churches in differ- 
ent places,-one of them at Monechata or Monichi, which he 
thinks was the parish called Moonzie. Jameson, in his History ot 
the Culdees, asserts that Sibbald is mistaken in this opinion, and, 
from the similarity of the names, concludes that Monechata or 
Monichi must be understood to be Monikie in Angus But when 
we reflect on the great changes which the names of places under- 
go in the course of time, we see no reason in this case to consider 
Sibbald's interpretation either incorrect or JP..J"  
• given by Sibbald of the churches and chapels in Fife in the 
reian of William the Lion, " Moonzey" is included. 

lancl.o.ners.-T\.e greater part of the P/-.'/-';;;  
farms of Moonzie, Lordscairnie, Torr, and Br.dgend belongs to 
he Earl of Glasgow, who succeeded to this property ately on the 
Lfo Lady M. L Craufurd. The estate of CoUuth.e is the 
Snfp pe ty of Messrs John and Henry Inglis. The estate of 
CL or Lordscairnie came into the possession of the Craufurd 
Sv at a very early period. Sir David Lindsay, the seventh of 
r amny afte theif settlement in Scotland, and who was one of 
Se M g ates Scoti. who signed the celebrated etter to Pope

acquired this estate in the reign of James IV. in consequence of 
Alexander Lindsay, sixth Earl of Craufurd, marrying Dumbar, 
heiress of Moonzie. But for this statement he produces no autho- 
rity, and it is disproved by existing records. " Sir David Lindsay 
gave, on the 19th of November 1355, a donation of six pounds of 
wax yearly out of his lands of Cairnie, to the abbot and convent 
of Lindores, for finding a burning taper every day that mass is ce- 
lebrated in the choir of their church, at his sepulchre, which was 
confirmed by charter granted by David IL on 3d August 1364." 
Eminent Men — In the Craufurd family there were many indi- 
viduals who were distinguished for their talents, their bravery, and 
for the high situations which they occupied in the government of 
the country. Alexander the third Earl of Craufurd, who lived in 
the reign of James II. was a man of singular character and habits. 
From the fierceness and cruelty of his temper and his undaunted 
courage, he was surnamed the " Tiger," and, from his long black 
bushy beard, he received the appellation of Earl Beardie. Though 
a great part of his property and his principal residence were in 
Angus, it is generally understood that he resided occasionally in 
Fife. He is said to have built the castle of Lordscairnie, in the 
parish of Moonzie, and this account is confirmed by its being call- 
ed Earl Beardie's castle to this day. It is a large and lofty build- 
ing, being 54 feet in length, and 40 in breadth over walls, and 
four stories high. The walls are nearly 6 feet thick, are com- 
posed of every kind of stones, and bound together by the strong- 
est cement. The ground floor, it is likely, was occupied with 
kitchen and cellars, and the second with the great baronial hall. 
It is now in a very dilapidated state. The outward walls or shell 
of the castle still remains, but the roof and floors are entirely gone, 
and even the ribats of the windows and the corner-stones' of the 
building have disappeared. The tenants of the estate, who were 
formerly in the habit of making a quarry of the castle to obtain 
stones for buildmg houses or dikes, are now very properly pro- 
hibited by their leases from making any farther encroachment 
upon It. There was formerly a wall of considerable height and 
thickness round the castle, called the - rampart wall," includinn- 
several acres of ground, and having towers on it at some distanc 
from each other. A part of this wall on the north existed till 
vvithin these few years, and one of the towers still remains. From 
the construction of this tower, it had evidently been a place of de- 

• Wood's Peerage.

fence, and is supposed to have been near the gate which formed 
the principal entrance to the castle. Within the memory of some 
individuals in the parish, there was another tower to the north of 
the castle, which contained an oven, and had heen devoted to cu- 
linary purposes. 

The castle is situated ou a gently rising ground, and in ancient 
times, before Lordscairnie Myre was drained, in the midst of 
which it is placed, must have been surrounded with water, and 
nearly inaccessible. 

This celebrated member of the Craufurd family was strongly 
imbued with the factious and turbulent spirit of the age in which 
he lived. He was engaged. in frequent bloody disputes with the 
nobility and gentry of his neighbourhood, and on all occasions he 
displayed great ferocity and courage. Near Arbroath, he de- 
feated the Ogilvies, a powerful family in Angus, in a pitched 
battle ; and after having slaughtered them in great numbers, 
plundered their houses, wasted their lands, and made captives 
their wives and children. Like many of the feudal barons of 
those days, he not only quarrelled with his neighbours and equals, 
but rebelled against the authority of his sovereign. ' He entered 
into a league with the Earl of Douglas and the Lord of the Isles, 
two of the most powerful nobles of the kingdom, to dethrone 
James H. and subvert his government. Lord Huntly, a nobleman 
of great talent and bravery, was employed by his sovereign to 
pulldown this unjust and unnatural rebellion. Having collected 
a respectable army, he attacked Craufurd, who was posted with 
his forces in a moor near Brechin, and, after an obstinate struggle, 
totally defeated him. Not long after this humiliating defeat, 
Craufurd, through the influence of Huntly, made his peace with 
the King. While James was travelling through Angus, receivmg 
the homage of his subjects, Craufurd suddenly presented himself 
before the King, clothed in mean apparel, with his head and feet 
bare, and attended by a few miserable-looking ragged servants, 
and throwing himself on his knees, he humbly confessed his guilt 
and implored forgiveness. The King, moved by his penitence 
and professions of attachment, and persuaded by the entreaties of 
his barons, mercifully pardoned his treasons, and generously re- 
stored him the lands and titles which he had justly forfeited by 
his rebellious conduct. Craufurd appears to have been deeply 
affected by the kindness and lenity of his sovereigrt. He accom- 
panied James in his tour through the country, entertained hun

most splendidly in his castle at Finbaven, and was ever afterwards 
a faithful and obedient subject. He did not long survive his 
reconciliation with the King. In about six months after, he 
was seized with a fever, which carried him off in a few days. 
He died in 1454, and was buried in the Gray friars' Church of 
Dundee. 

Another distinguished individual belonging to the parish was 
Sir William Ramsay of CoUuthie. He lived in the reign of David 
H., King of Scotland, and was renowned both for his wisdom and 
bravery. He was present at the fatal battle of Durham in 1346, 
in which the Scottish army was totally routed, and, along with many 
of the nobility and gentry, was unfortunately taken prisoner. 
After his liberation from captivity, he, with a great number of his 
countrymen, entered into the service of the King of France, and 
fought against the English, who were then threatening the subju- 
gation of that country. At the celebrated battle of Poictiers in 
1356, where the Scottish auxiliaries behaved with the utmost bra- 
very, and suffered most severely, he had again the misfortune to be 
taken prisoner. On the evening after the battle, he displayed great 
address and sagacity in accomplishing the deliverance of Archibald 
Douglas, a man of high rank, and an eminent Scottish warrior, who 
had fallen into the hands of the English. When the prisoners were 
assembled, Douglas was found arrayed in armour of the most splen- 
did description, and it was concluded by his conquerors that he 
was a man of noble birth, and a most valuable prize. Ramsay, wlio 
was present, declared in the most positive terms that Douglas, in- 
stead of being a nobleman, was a mean fellow ; some servant who 
had either stolen the armour of his master, or taken it from his 
body. He abused him in the grossest terms ; commanded him to 
pull off his boots, and beat him with one of them most unmerci- 
fully. To all this injurious treatment, Douglas, who saw his de- 
sign, submitted without murmur or reply. Ramsay having thus 
lulled the suspicions of the English asleep, paid forty shillings for 
his ransom, and thus enabled him to escape from captivity, and 
perhaps from death. Sir William Ramsay was connected with 
some of the first families in Scotland. In consequence of marry- 
ing Isabel Countess of Fife, daughter of Duncan, last Earl of 
Fife, he was invested with the Earldom by King David II. It has 
been asserted, that he had a right to this title by blood ; but this 
account is not established by satisfactory evidence. He received 



792 



FIFESHIRB. 



the title as a mark of favour from his sovereign, and, dying with- 
out issue, it returned to the Crown. The old house of Colluthie 
is said to have been built by Sir William. But this is bestowing 
an antiquity on it to which it has no just claim, and which is only 
supported by the most vague tradition. The house is a small plain 
building, remarkable only for the thickness of its walls and some 
arched doors and windows. It was long much neglected, and 
nearly uninhabitable, but it has been lately repaired by its present 
proprietor, Mr J. Inglis, at considerable expense, and may now 
accommodate a respectable family. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are not of ancient 
date. The first entry in the minute-book is on November 6th 
1693. Baptisms were first recorded in 1713, and marriages in 
1769. Since 1821, births and baptisms, as well as marriages and 
deaths, have been regularly recorded. 

Antiquities. — When the church was repaired in 1821, there was 
found in the east end of it a coffin containing some human bones 
in a mouldering state, and a thigh-bone in good preservation. The 
side stones of the coffin consisted of two long sandstones, and the 
bottom of Dutch square bricks. The upper stone, or cover, on 
which there is often an inscription, had, it is likely, been removed 
at some early period, but on one of the side-stones there was cut 
out the figure of a sword, indicating that the person who had been 
entombed there had been a soldier or warrior. It is probable that 
he belonged to the Craufurd family, who had large property in 
the parish, and were generally military men. 

Several years ago, when some labourers were casting a ditch on 
the west side of the firm of Moonzie, they discovered several stone 
coffins near the surface of the ground. From the rude materials 
of which they were composed, and the exposed situation in which 
they were placed, they do not appear to have contained the ashes 
of the illustrious dead, but to have been the repositories of some 
ignoble individuals. Some coins have been found in different 
places of the parish, but none of any importance either from their 
antiquity or intrinsic value.

The population of the parish was formerly tnuch greater than 
•it is at present 

Different causes appear to have operated in producing this de- 
crease. About fifty or sixty years ago, the farms in this country 
were generally of small extent, and much more numerous than at 
present. Ample employment and maintenance were thus afforded 
to many families, and the population of the country parishes con- 
sequently great. But the farms are now generally of large ex- 
tent and few in number, and though laboured much more skilfully 
and perfectly than formerly, the number of cultivators is much di- 
minished. It was also the practice of the farmers in these times 
to lease out to each of their cottars, and to those who had houses 
on the farm, two or three acres of land at a moderate rent, and to 
give it the requisite cultivation. They also allowed them to keep 
cows, and provided them with grass in the summer and straw in 
the winter, for their maintenance. These privileges were highly 
valued by the people, and contributed much to their comfort and 
advantage. From the produce of their land and dairy, they had 
abundance of plain food for the maintenance of themselves and 
families ; and in seasons of sickness, when unable for their daily 
labour, they could subsist for a time on their own means without 
being forced to apply for public aid. But this practice has been 
discontinued, and none even of the farm-servants enjoy the advan- 
tage of a cow except the Foreman. In consequence of this change, 
the people of the country who were tradesmen, seeing that they 
enjoyed none of the comforts of the country, left the habitations of 
their fathers, and established themselves in the towns from which 
their employment was principally derived. This desertion has 
produced in many parishes a paucity of labourers for field work, 
particularly for the green crop husbandry, which has been rapidly 
increasing for some time past, and is now carried on to a great 
extent.

IV. — Industry. 
The great majority of the people of this parish are engaged in 
agriculture, either as farmers and ploughmen, or as day-labourers. 
The number of tradesmen is small, four masons, three carpenters, 
and seven weavers. There are about 1000 Scots or 1261 impe- 
rial acres in the parish. The whole is arable and in a high state 
of cultivation, except a few acres on the top of Colluthie hill, 
which is steep and rocky, and incapable of being ploughed, and 
which has been planted with wood, principally Scots firs. The 
soil in general is excellent, being chiefly a black loam, restmg up- 
on trap or rotten-rock. In some places it is a strong coarse clay 
with a wet bottom ; and there are about thirty-six acres of moss- 
land belonging to the farm of Lordscairnie. Withm the recol- 
lection of the present incumbent, improvements of the most valu- 
able and substantial nature have been accomplished. Upwards 
of sixty acres of land, which were formerly covered with whms 
and broom, have been trenched, and manured and converted into 
productive soil. The land has been subdivided and inclosed, 
drained in the most effectual manner, and cropped so judiciously 
as both to keep it as clean as a garden, and also to make it most 

productive. , t o c

Z.z«e-SfccA.-Great attention has been paid in the parish to 
the breeding of domestic animals. Several of the farmers rear a 
number of young horses every year, and occasionally purchase some 
brood mares from adjoining counties to improve their own stock. 
Smill active horses are in general preferred to large and heavy 
one as they are better fitted than the others for labouring the hd- 
W t ound of the north side of Fife. The Fife breed of oxen 
whil is generally of a black colour and horned, is the favour te 
b tht quarter. Not long ago, it had rather fallen into disrepute ; 
bnt the tide is now turned, and from the attention directed to its 
i:piove:ent, it bids fair to rival the best breeds .n the kingdom. 



MOONZIE.

The Teeswater or short-horned breed from England was intro- 
duced here some years ago, and is still highly esteemed by some 
agriculturists. The principal advantage of this breed consists in 
their capability of being made fat when only two years of age. But, 
notwithstanding this recommendation, it is now beginning to be less 
esteemed, and to give way either to the Fife or dodded cattle of 
Angus. 

There is only one tenant in the parish who keeps a breeding 
stock of sheep on his farm. They are a mixture of the Leicester 
and Cheviot. He has lately got some ewes of the Dorsetshire 
breed, which are of large size and horned, and produce lambs 
twice a-year. A six years' rotation is the mode of cropping gene- 
rally adopted. 1. Fallow or green crop; 2. wheat; 3. pease or 
beans ; 4. barley with grass seeds ; 5. grass cut or pastured ; 6. 
oats. 

The tenants in this parish enjoy particular advantages in regard 
to their leases. These extend in general to twenty-five years, and 
include no restrictions of an oppressive nature. 

The farm steadings of the principal tenants are of a superior 
kind, built upon the most approved plans, and affording every ne- 
cessary accommodation. As a proof of the spirit of enterprize and 
improvement which exists amongst us, it may be mentioned that, 
though there are only four thrashing-mills in the parish, two of 
these are driven by steam. 

The soil is every year changing its appearance and becoming 
more productive. A laudable spirit of rivalry prevails amongst the 
farmers, and leads them to adopt every improvement which may 
benefit the land as well as promote their own interest.

Mar/te-rowH.— Cupar, which is about three miles distant, is 
the nearest market-town. Every article of country produce finds 
there a ready sale and a good price. There are several small col- 
lections of houses in the parish which hardly deserve the names of 
villages. They are the residences of the "agricultural labourers 
belongmg to the different farms, and of a few tradesmen. There 
has been no mn in the parish for many years.

. Means of Communication.-— The nearest post-office is Cupar, 
The turnpike road leading from Cupar to Newburgh, and extend- 
ing to one mile and 1400 yards, lies along the south boundary of 
the parish. A statute labour road of one mile and 500 yards 
connects the Newburgh road on the south with the great Dun- 
dee road on the north. There is, beside, a private farm road which 
goes through the middle of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Moonzie is situated on a 
rising ground in the south-west part of the parish, and is easily 
accessible to all the population. It is a small plain building, with- 
out spire or other ornament. From its elevated position, it forms 
a conspicuous object from the Newburgh road, and enjoys the 
name of the Visible Kirk, from being a landmark to mariners en- 
tering the Tay. It has all the marks of an old building, but the 
time of its erection is unknown. It was lately repaired and new 
seated ; and though not possessed of any external beauty, is now 
a comfortable place of worship. It has accommodation for 171 
sitters. All the sittings are free. 

The church and teinds of the parish of Moonzie belonged at 
one time to a religious fraternity at Scotland Well, in Kinross- 
shire, called the Ministers of the Fratres Sanctaj Trinitatis de 
Redemptione Captivorum. William Malvoisin, Bishop of St An- 
drews, who died in 1238, was the founder of this institution, and 
set apart the teinds of the parish of Moonzie for its support. Its 
design was to show hospitality to religious pilgrims, and collect 
money for the redemption of Christians who had been taken cap- 
tives by the Turks. The brethren of the ministry performed the 
spiritual duties of the parish, and continued to act in that capacity 
till the Reformation. In 1564, the parish of Moonzie was united 
to that of Cupar; but, in 1625, it was disjoined and again made

The manse was built about thirty-six years ago, and, though in 
tolerable repair, is small and inconvenient, and far inferior in 
point of accommodation to the manses in the neighbourhood. 
The glebe consists of fifteen acres, and may be worth L.30 per 
annum. The stipend is L.177, 18s. 8|d. in money, and 7 bolls, 
3 firlots, 1 peck, 3| lippiesmeal, and 3 bolls, 3 firlots. Specks, 3| 
lippies barley. 

Forty-one families attend the Established Church ; two families 
are Dissenters. 140 persons at an average attend public worship 
in the parish church each Lord's day." There are eight Dissenters 
who go to different churches in Cupar. The average number of 
communicants for the last seven years, is 110. The average amount 
of church collections yearly for religious and charitable objects is 
L.3, 10s. 

Education. — There is only one school, the parochial. It is 
situated in the centre of the parish, and is attended by about 60 
scholars. The present teacher has officiated in that capacity for 
upwards of forty years with great credit to himself, and much to 
the advantage of the youth in the neighbourhood. His legal sa- 
lary is only L.30 per annum ; but the heritors lately, sensible of 
his merit, raised it to the maximum during his life. No perqui- 
sites of any kind are allowed. The fees in all do not exceed 
L. 14 per annum. The school-room is of sufficient size, but the 
ceiling is low, which makes it uncomfortable for the young people 
during the heat of summer. The teacher's house is small, and 
would require both repair and enlargement. 

Poo7' and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 4. Some receive 2s., others Is. 6d. or 
Is. per week, according to their circumstances. The annual 
amount of collections at the church doors for relief of the poor is 
L. 2, 14s. ; rent of land, L, 35 ; seat rent in Cupar church, 
16s.; total, L. 38, 10s. 7d. It will be seen from this state- 
ment, that the principal fund for the support of the poor is 
derived from land. Six acres of land were purchased by the 
session of Moonzie in the parish of Cupar, about the middle 
of last century, at a low price. They were enabled to do this, 
in consequence of a legacy left them by the last Episcopal 
curate of the parish, and from the savings of their collections. 
From the rent stated, there falls to be deducted various bur-

dens, which considerably lessen its amount, such as minister's 
stipend in Cupar, repairs of church and manse, bridge, and rogue 
money, bishop's rents, as well as beadle, precentor's, and session- 
clerk's salary. The funds, however, have proved sufficieqt for the 
maintenance of the poor, and no application has been made to the 
heritors for any assistance. The poor evince a laudable spirit of 
independence, and the funds have generally been employed for 
the support of the aged andinfirm. 

Fuel— The fuel commonly used is coal, either English coal 
brought from Newburgh or Balmerino, or Scots coal from Balbir- 
nie or Dysart. The price varies according to the demand, and 
has been higher for these two last years than formerly. A single 
horse cart-load at Dysart, where they are cheapest, and which 
contains 12 cwt., costs 3s. 3d. To this there is to be added, tolls 
and carriage, which will amount at least to as much more. Eng- 
lish coal are sold at Newburgh at from 4s. 6d. to 5s. the boll of 
6 cwt.

PRESBYTERY OF KIRKALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. FERGUS JARDINE, A. M., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

ISfame. — The name Kinghorn is evidently formed of two old 
British or Celtic words, cz/n kin J. and quern or gem, which 
signify the " head of the spouty land, or land of springs," — 
this being descriptive of the position and locality of the town, 
which is built upon the bend and acclivity of the ground form- 
ed by the Bay of Kinghorn. Behind the rising ground upon 
which the town stands, there is a loch of considerable extent, 
which sends forth a stream that intersects the town; and there are 
various myres or marshes, two of which are called the Easter and 
Wester Myres, which contribute their respective rivulets to mark 
the boundary of the old burgh. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish extends over a little more 
than 8 square miles. Its greatest length is 4| miles, and its 
greatest breadth is about 3 miles. It is bounded on the east and 
north by Abbotshall ; on the north and west, by Auchtertool and 
Aberdour ; on the west, by Burntisland ; and on the south and 
.tiouth-east, it is washed by the Frith of Forth. It has somewhat 
the shape of an awkwardly formed eight figure, from portions of 
Abbotshall and Burntisland running into it on the east and west. 
It is beautifully diversified both in its marine and interior outline. 
The ground rises in some places abruptly, and in others gradually 
from the shore, and the alternations of hill and valley, of finely 



KINGHORN.

cultivated fields und narrow straths, watered by some small rivulets, 
continue to ascend till the whole is surmounted by the Hill of Glass- 
mount, about two-and-a-half miles from the shore. This hill is the 
highest ground in the parish, being 601 feet above the level of the 
sea. Northwards from it, there is a greater equality of surface, 
although in some places the rich arable fields are varied by beau- 
tiful knolls and gentle swellings of the ground, with occasional 
patches of table-land. This stretch of the parish is bounded and 
embellished by the finely wooded hill on which the mansion-house 
of Raith is built, the property of Colonel Fergusson. 

Nor is the coast less diversified. From its junction with Burnt- 
island parish on the west, to its termination on the east with Abbots- 
hall, where the Tiel Burn empties itself into the sea, the extent 
along the shore cannot be less than four miles. Along this, there is 
much to attract the geologist, and gratify the lover of the pictu- 
resque. Near the Burntisland boundary, there is a lofty overhang- 
ing cliff, marked at one spot with the melancholy name of the 
" King's wud end," in reference to the event to be afterwards 
noticed. Onwards to the harbour of Pettycur, the shore is of 
a fine level sand. The coast then becomes bold and rugged. 
The trap rock has here assumed a columnar form, and its immense 
fragments, as they have become separated from the columnar 
masses, lie in endless confusion on the shore. They form the 
headland called Kinghorn Ness, where, towards the east, the bay 
of Kinghorn opens. From this point, the bay is formed by a curve 
of about a quarter of a mile in extent, till, on the east, it termi- 
nates in the Kirk-craig,— a bold projection of rock which runs 
from the churchyard a considerable distance into the sea, and 
forms a natural break-water or shelter to the old harbour of King- 
horn, which was built on that side of the bay. Beyond this, the 
shore is beautifully diversified, and the action of the tide has, in 
many places, laid bare the stratified rocks which are found per 
vading this part of Fife. About a mile to the east of Kinghorn, 
a cave of considerable size presents itself, with its dark mouth 
looking out upon the sea, and guarded on each side by two bold 
projecting rocks. This is the only natural cavern along this shore. 
There is, at a small distance from it, a curious excavation of earth, 
formed by an attempt to work the limestone which is found here.

Climote.— The town and parish of Kinghorn are remarkably 
healthv. The town is situated on a dry bed on the side of the brae, 
with an abundance of rivulets rushing down the declivities to carry 
away at once, into the sea, everything that might otherwise lie to 
oppress the atmosphere with unhealthy vapours. Old age fands 
here a healthy resting-place. Several persons in it at present are 
upwards of ninety years of age. . 

Hydrography.— There are various springs of excellent quahty in 
and around Kinghorn. One of these, about half a mile to the west- 
ward on the shore, has long been known for its medicinal quahties. 
The celebrated Dr Anderson, of pill notoriety, and physician to 
Charles I., wrote a treatise on this water in 1618, and recommended 
its use for allaying inflammations, external and internal, and tor re- 
moving difficulty in breathing and other maladies. It is impregnat- 
ed, he°says, with crystal, gypsum, and nitre, and acts as a powerful 
diuretic, while it produces the most invigorating effects upon debili- 
tated constitutions. This he was enabled to state from observa- 
tion, as he attended patients while using it, and gave directions in 
what manner the most salutary effects might be obtained from it. 
It is to be lamented, that the efficacy of this formerly noted spa 
has not been sufficiently appreciated of late years. 

Kincrhorn Loch lies a little to the north-west of the town. 
It covers a surface of twenty acres, is thirty feet deep, and is em- 
bosomed amid finely undulating hills. The inhabitants have an 
abundant supply of water from it, by pipes laid through the streets.

Three spinning-mills have been built on the margin of the stream

Geology. — The parish is situated among the coal measures. 
Where the rocks are stratified, they consist of alternations of lime- 
stone, sandstone, shale, and coal. The beds of limestone have 
been wrought in several places, and have been found of excellent 
quality. They are of salt-water formation, and the petrifactions, 
which they contain in abundance, are those common to the coal- 
fields, being chiefly encrinites, terebratulites, and madrepores. 
The substance of the limestone of one of the strata, as Invertiel 
quarry, is almost wholly fragments of encrinites, and, when cut 
and polished, serves as a beautiful material for mantel-pieces and 
other interior works. It is probable, that some small patches of fresh- 
water limestone may also be found in the parish, as a rock of this 
kind appears near the eastern boundary of the neighbouring pa- 
rish of Burntisland, Some of the sandstone beds produce build- 
ing materials of good quality ; but there seems to be none of great 
thickness, or of the sort called liver-rock. There is nothing re- 
markable in the shales, further than that there is said to be a good 
fire-clay situated near the coal-bed. The single bed of coal is 
about five feet thick ; but if oral report may be credited, it was 
wrought out, in former times, to a depth of 100 feet, but there 
are no authentic accounts extant regarding it. The wastes are full 
of water. The bearing of the stratified rocks, where they are least 
disarranged, is northerly, and the coal-bed seems to be the lower- 
most one of the extensive coal-fields stretching from this parish 
eastward to Largo. 

These stratified rocks occupy only a small extent in the north, 
eastern part of the parish ; the remaining part is composed mostly 
of a large outburst of trap rock, which extends to a considerable dis- 
tance through the neighbouring parishes to the west, but which con- 
tainshere and there patchesofstratified rocks. The unstratified rock 
IS chiefly greenstone, or, as it is more commonly termed here, whin- 
stone. Its basaltic appearance at Kinghorn ness, and along the 
shore to Petty cur harbour, has already been alluded to. It has 
there a rudely crystallized form. The greenstone rock is of vari- 
ous qualities, some of it being quite friable, while at other places 
It IS very hard and tough, and forms excellent road materials. The 
boundary of the trap rock is exceedingly irregular, and has never 
yet been exactly traced out. It is probable that large parts of it 
are overlaymg the stratified rocks. 



804 



FIFESHIRE. 



Where the rocks are laid bare by the action of the tide on the 
beach, many features interesting to the geologist may be seen. 
There is a fine specimen of a trap dike separating the strata, and 
lifting one side three or four feet, which may be seen at low wa- 
ter near an old limekiln, about half a mile to the eastward of King- 
horn, and there is a sandstone rock situated opposite Abden House, 
a little to the east of the churchyard, which, within a space of 
150 or 200 feet, changes gradually from sandstone to quartz rock. 
There are also specimens, in different parts of the parish, of por- 
tions of coal, and shaley strata, being included among the unstra- 
tified rocks, and in their burnt or changed appearance present- 
ing plain marks of the action of heat. 

The soil along the shore, and to a considerable extent north- 
wards, is formed from the trap rock, of a dark deep loam, and is 
. equal to the richest strath land in any part of Scotland.

II. — Civil History. 
The town of Kinghorn was of such importance as early as Da- 
vid I., that that monarch conferred upon it the privileges of a 
royal burgh. This grant was confirmed by Alexander III. It 
was long distinguished by a royal residence; Glammis Castle or 
Tower, which stood upon the rising ground that overlooks the 
town. While royalty had its residence here, it is natural to sup- 
pose that it attracted many distinguished individuals to live at 
Kinghorn ; and hence we find, in the charters granted by Wil- 
liam'the Lion 1171, the names of William de Mortimer, Gal- 
fred de MalleviUef and others « ap. Kingorn ;" as witnesses to 
the deeds, along with the Bishop of Dunkeld and the Chancellor 

. Tt,;c r,lnnt has hitherto only been found in one spot in Ireland, on rocks in the

of Scotland. This ancient residence passed from the Kings of 
Scotland, in the reign of Robert 11., into the hands of Sir John 
Lyon, as a dowery to his wife, Janet Stuart, daughter of Queen 
Ada Mure and of that monarch, who disponed the property to 
that knight " cum domino de Kinghorn in liberum maritagium." 
The successors of that knight enjoyed first from James VI. the 
title of Earl of Kinghorn, 10th July 1606; but, it is said, that, 
from an awkward abbreviation of Kinghorn, f which the people 
were too ready to discover and apply,— the better sounding title of 
Strathmore, where much of his property lay, was bestowed on the 
family by Charles II. 

The historical events connected with this parish are brief, 
but important. In the reign of Duncan I., whose fate is well 
known to every reader of the immortal Shakspeare, Canutus, 
King of Norway, sent a large fleet commanded by his bro- 
ther, with 9000 men, who landed at Kinghorn, and plundered 
the adjacent country, till they were attacked and defeated with 
great slaughter by Macbeth, Thane of Fife. But the event 
of greatest importance to Scotland, connected with this parish, 
was the death of Alexander III. The greatness of that monarch's 
character— the importance of his life to Scotland at that period— 
the suddenness of his death— and the long and cruel wars in which 
Scotland was engaged with England, as well as the internal dis- 
tractions of the kingdom, which his .death occasioned, must ever 
render the spot where he met his death an object of deepest in- 
terest, and excite in the mind a host of bitter reflections. About 
a mile to the west of Kinghorn, the road from Inverkeithing at 
that time wound along a high clifl" which rises abruptly, and al- 
most perpendicularly from the level sand below to the height of 
about 150 feet. About forty feet up the side of this precipitous 
bank, there abuts a rock in the form of a wedge, now almost 
wholly covered with ivy, which marks the spot here the King 
was found. It received him in his sheer descent over the cliff 
above, where he was thrown from his horse, and prevented him 
from falling to the level shore below. This is the King's u;ud 
d, not wood end, as it has been sometimes erroneously called. 
Tradition is not the only testimony for the identity of this melan- 
choly spot. A cross was soon after the event erected upon it to 
point out the place where the King was found. « Out upon

time," for it has long since defaced this interesting object ; but it 
is to be hoped that it will be replaced by a monument becoming 
the event, and worthy of the taste and wealth of the present ex- 
cellent proprietor of the property.  

Letters, &amp;c. There is a curious letter in the possession of John 

Boswell, ksq., the proprietor of Balmuto, from James VI. to the 
laird of Balmuto, which throws some light on the occasional wants 
and character of that singular monarch, f 

David Boswell, who lent the King the sum referred to m the 
document, was a talented and pious man. There is a 6ne por- 
trait of him in Balmuto, in the attitude of study mg the J 2th 
Psalm, with his favourite adage, " it is ane guid sport to do weel." 
His son. Sir George Boswell, " chirurgeon to the King's grace" 
and to Anne of Denmark, of whom it is stated in the receipt of 
the comptroller, that he was the bearer of the 1000 merks from 
his father to the King, was as much distinguished for his humility 
of mind and urbanity of manners, as for his professional skill. 
There is a good picture of him in Balmuto, in the quaint attitude 
of pointing to a skeleton, and on the back of the portrait verses 
are inscribed.

Eminent Characters. — Besides those already mentioned, the fa- 
mily of Kirkcaldy of Grange — a property now in the possession of 
Colonel Fergusson of Raith, about a mile to the north-east of 
Kino-horn, demands honourable mention. It was not the extent 
of their property, but the great force of their character and splen- 
dour of their talents, which gave them such a prominent place in 
the history of James V. and during the regency of the ill-fated 
Mary. Sir James Kirkcaldy, who was Lord High Treasurer of 
Scotland during a part of the reign of James V., was considered 
one of the wisest and worthiest of the nation ; and few achieve- 
ments in war are more brilliant than those performed by Sir Wil- 
liam Kirkcaldy, both at Stirling and Edinburgh, when, after the 
battle of Langside, he espoused the side of the incarcerated Queen. 
For his holding the castle of Edinburgh of whi'.th he was gover- 
nor so long against the regent and the force sent by Elizabeth 
to reduce it, he, on surrendering, suffered death with his brother 
at the market-cross of Edinburgh, August 3, 1570. 

Mr John Scrymgeour, a man remarkable for his piety and learn- 
ing, was minister of Kinghorn, and was selected as chaplain to the 
King in 1590, when his Majesty sent to Denmark to bring home 
his Queen. He is enrolled among the Scottish Worthies on account 
of his refusal to subscribe the articles of Perth, and join the modi- 
fied Episcopacy, which at that time was attempted to be introdu- 
ced into the Scottish nation, and for which he was deprived of his 
living at Kinghorn, and obliged to retire to a small house he had 
in Auchterderran, where it is supposed he spent the remainder of 
his days. 

In one of the old records of this parish, the signing of the na- 
tional Covenant in 1590 is inserted, and the first name to the deed 
is that of Thomas Biggar, minister of the parish, and is followed in 
beautiful penmanship by Johne Boswall of Balmouto, and Johne 
Kirkcaldy of Grange. On an old stone, still entire in the churchyard, 
which had been erected by the Sailors' Community to the memo- 
ry of Mr Thomas Biggar, we find that he died in 1601, about ele- 
ven years after the signing of the covenant. This is mentioned 
also in the session records of that period. He was succeeded by 
Mr John Moncriefe, a man also of considerable eminence during 
those stormy periods of our ecclesiastical history. The accom- 
plished scholar and gentleman, the late Professor Bruce, who held 
long the patent with Sir James Hunter Blair for printing the Bible

in Scotland, and was His Majesty's Secretary for Latin Records, 
had his patrimonial estate in this parish. 

Land-owners. — The principal heritors of this parish are, the 
Earl of Rosslyn for the lands of Invertiel, Tyrie, South Piteadie, 
and South Glassmount ; Colonel Fergusson of Raith for Easter 
and Wester Bal barton, Easter and Wester Boglilly, Cauldhame, 
Seafield, Vicars- Grange, Grange, Baidland, and other lands; 
John Boswell, Esq. of Balmuto for the estate of Balmuto ; Mrs 
O. T. Bruce for Grangehill and other lands ; John Drysdale, Esq. 
for Kilrie and North Piteadie ; the Trustees of the late Robert 
Philp, Esq. of Edenshead for Banchory, Drinkbetween, Justine 
lands, and other acres ; the Trustees of the late Burridge Purvis, 
Esq. for North Glassmount ; Robert Stocks, Esq. for Abden ; 
the Duke of Buccleuch for Inchkeith ; Mr George Greig for 
Easter Balbeardie ; the Trustees of the late Mr Greenhill for com- 
mon of Kinghorn ; Mr Shanks of Castlerigg for acres near King- 
horn, Glammis Tower, &amp;c. ; the burgh of Kinghorn for the Ross 
lands ; and a few others whose property is very limited. 

Parochial Registers.— The earliest register is of baptisms, com- 
mencing in 1577. The session records commence with some re- 
gularity in September 1607, yet there are earlier notices of the 
proceedings of the session. We find in one of the volumes, not 
only the parish signatures to the national covenant already noticed 
but also a number of special reasons recorded for a general fast to 
be held as early as October 1593. The records of baptisms and 
marriages, and the proceedings of the kirk-session, are kept with 
much regularity and fulness from the close of the seventeenth cen- 
tury to the present time. 

Antiquities.—The rage for modern improvements here has al- 
most swept away every vestige of those ancient buildings m the 
t.own of Kinghorn which formerly distinguished it in its ecclesias- 
tical and civil importance. St Leonard's Tower was the last re- 
maining edifice of this nature, which, subsequent to the Reforma- 
tion, was converted into a town-house and jail. It was a few years 
aao entirely removed for the erection of a handsome modern build- 
ing as a town-house apd prison. History, and not stone walls, 
must tell us what Kinghorn formerly was.— The very seals, {Scot- 
tice, seiches, along the shore, now enjoy an absolute respite from 
the conditions of the charter granted by David L to the Abbacy of 

. Patic Birnie. tbc far-famod fuldlcr, ought not to be forgotten among the eu.i- 
ent characters belongin; lo Kinghorn.

Dunfermline, that every seventh one caught at Kinghorn should be 
sent to the ecclesiastics of that place. — Except a few human bones 
dug up in forming ihe foundation for the extension of St Leonard's 
spinning mill, nothing has of late years given any indication that that 
place was formerly consecrated ground. — Instead of the deep-ton- 
ed vespers sounding for prayers from St Leonard's Tower, there 
is now heard the sharp and enlivening bell summoning the healthy 
light-hearted young people to the spinning manufactory. — The 
ploughshare passes uninterruptedly over the spot where stood the 
grim stately walls of Glammis Tower. 

After Robert II. had given away this royal residence to Sir John 
Lyon and his successors, the Kings of Scotland still possessed a 
domicile in Kinghorn, to which they had recourse in crossing to 
Fife from Edinburgh. In the old orchard of Abden, there were 
not long ago removed the remains of a building, which tradition 
declared belonged to the King, and the road to which, from the 
shore or landing-place, was called the King's gate. This is coun- 
tenanced by the fact, that the property of Abden belonged to the 
Crown ; and in the ancient charter of this property, granted by 
Cardinal Beaton to Sir John Melville, there is a distinct reserva- 
tion that the King, in crossing to Kinghorn, should enjoy free lodg- 
ings, and the hospitahty of Abden at any time he should require 
it. And the crown charter confirming the same to the son, the 
fother having been executed for high treason and his lands confis- 
cated, shows that it continued Crown property, so that the Scot- 
tish monarchs had always a residence of one kind or other in 
Kinghorn. The present proprietor, Mr Stocks, possesses both 
charters,— the one by Cardinal Beaton has attached to it the seal 
of that ecclesiastical dignitary, as well as that of St Andrews ; and 
he holds it under the same reservation which the Cardinal him- 
self, and his immediate successors did. It is thus evident that 
royalty has still a right to this ancient privilege, a fact probably al- 
together unknown to the present interesting and beloved posses- 
sor of the throne of these realms.f There are several objects yet 

• The present incumbents of Dunfermline would fare but ill if they depended on 
anyportion of this grant. Not a phoca is now sought after, for any purpose wliat- 

t The words of the charter referring to the above reservation are, " reservatis no-

remaining in the parish of considerable interest to the antiquarian. 
Seafield tower presents a striking feature on the margin of the 
shore, resting on one side on a solid mass of red sandstone, and 
guarded on the other by the visible remains of a fosse and draw- 
bridge. This was the seat of an ancient family of the name of 
Moutrie. In the middle of a field belonging to the farm of Tyrie, 
there stands an old ruin, the gable of a building of no great ex- 
tent, but which, from its name and human bones found around it, 
was most likely a chapel or place of public worship. The people 
call it Egsmalee, an evident corruption of Eglise Marie. Farther 
northwards, on the side of the hill of Piteadie, the old castle of 
that name is very entire in its ruins. This place was inhabited 
not more than an hundred years ago. It belongs to the Earl of 
Rosslyn, and has been in the family of the St Clairs for a long 
period. There are two obelisks of rough stones standing in a field 
to the west of North Glassmouni House ; this place is called by 
Sibbald Boisvill-Glasmond, supposed to have been erected im- 
mediately after the last battle which was fought between the Scots 
and Danes, to mark the spot where some of the Scottish com- 
manders had fallen. A chapel had formerly been in existence in 
connection with this land. A field to the east of the house still 
bears the name of the Chapel-field, and it is not long since some 
of the ruins of the building were to be seen. 

Modern Buildings.— Ye places have undergone such a trans- 
formation during the last thirty years as Kinghorn. Its streets 
were then almost impassable, they are now levelled and vvell pav- 
ed. Its public buildings were mean,-they are now good. lUe 
former town-house was an ancient ecclesiastical building, the pre- 
sent town house and jail is of Gothic architecture, which cost the 
■ burah L. 2500. Notwithstanding, however, its beauty, strengtli, 
andost, its jail can only now be used as a lock-up house, and it 
does not prevent the inhabitants of the burgh from being assessed for 
the erecUon of prisons in other parts of the county. Tl.e schoo - 
house was formerly a plain unpretending building ; the school- 
h use now, and the grounds adjoining would do honour to the ac- 
ropolis. The spinning-mill adjoining the town 1-"--  
.one of late great improvements, and has been much enlarged. 
This improvement has'taken place since it came mto the posses- 
sTon of the present public spirited proprietors, the Messrs Swano

building, which remains in much the same state as it has done since 
1774, when it was rebuilt. 

Mansion-Houses. — Besides the house of Abden, a plain old grey 
building, situated on the east side of Kinghorn, and commanding 
a beautiful and extensive view of the Forth, the mansion-house of 
Balmuto is almost the only other building in the parish worthy of 
the name. Its square tower is of great antiquity, but the chief 
accommodation is of modern architecture. It is well sheltered by 
the finely wooded grounds immediately surrounding, and by the 
hills to the north and south. The flower garden and conserva- 
tory mark the taste of the proprietor.

There are no resident heritors in this parish. Out of 675 fa- 
milies in the parish, about 610 belong to the labouring classes, 
leaving only 65, consisting of farmers, shopkeepers, and proprietors 
of houses, who cannot be classed among those who depend solely 
on their manual labour for subsistence. 

The chief cause for the increase of the population since 182], 
is the extension of the flax spinning mills, which has brought a 
considerable number of strangers to the place for employment. 
Females are chiefly employed in spinning, which accounts for the 
greater proportion of females above males in this place. 

There are three or four fatuous persons in this parish, but none 
insane. There is one deaf and dumb.

Scots acres. 

800, oats, from 10 to 11 bolls per acre. 
400, barley, from 7 to 9 do. 
400, wheat, from 7 to 9 do.

863, pasture, L.3, lOs. per acre. 
40 occasionally cultivated. 

3660 

Jlent. — The rent of land in this parish varies from L.J, 10s. to 
L.6 per acre. The average is about L 3, 10s. per acre. 

Stock. — There are few cattle reared in this parish. Those that 
are reared are of the Fife and short-horned breed, with crosses 
between them. Although there are few reared, yet a great num- 
ber, brought from other counties, are fattened in this parish, and 
from the attention paid to their condition and appearance, fre- 
quently bring high prices, L.25 and L.30 being no uncommon 
price for them per head. 

Much attention has of late been given to sheep feeding. A 
considerable number are now kept, chiefly half-bred Cheviot, and 
black-faced. These, like the cattle, are generally imported from 
other places. 

Few parishes have undergone more improvements than this in 
draining and trenching, or can exhibit such an activity and atten- 
tion in the application of all recent discoveries to bring the land to 
the highest state of cultivation and productiveness. The farm- 
buildings and inclosures are in general very good, and show both 
the good taste of the tenant, and the encouragement of the land- 
lord. The duration of leases is nineteen years. 

Manufactures.— only manufacture carried on in Kinghorn 
is the spinning of flax. The raw material is imported, and it un- 
dergoes here all the processes from the dressing of the flax, up to 
the final preparation of the yarn and thread, for the loom and 

other purposes. , .  

There is an extensive bleaching field at Nether Tyne, about 

beyond the boundary line of the burgh, including feu-duties, is L. 10,684, 3s. 94d. 
The rental within the burgh boundary is about L.2000.

one and a-half mile to the eastward, belonging to the proprietors 
of St Leonard's mill, which enables them to prepare the thread 
and yarn in a purely white state for the market. These gentle- 
men employ daily at their mill 200 females, 64 males, flax-dres- 
sers, 21 mechanics, or machine-makers, and 12 males who 
superintend and have other duties in the mill. About 70 are em- 
ployed in the bleaching of yarn. There are two other mills in 
Kinghorn, at both of which are employed about 130 females, and 
50 males, including 36 flax-dressers. There are thus connected 
with the spinning mills, 330 females ; 1 37 males ; 70 of both sexes 
in the bleaching department; total, 537. 

Girls above fourteen years of age, vho are spinners, earn from 
4s. to 6s. per week. Mechanics have from 12s. to L. I per week. 

Flax-dressers are paid by the hundred-weight of dressed flax ; 
they get a fair price for their work, and can make a good livelihood 
fully employed. 

Navigation. — Except the steamers which ply on the ferry, be- 
tween Pettycur and Newhaven, and a few half-tide boats of forty 
tons burden, which carry goods and cattle to and from Leith, there 
is only one — a coaster of about seventy tons burden, which now 
belongs to Kinghorn. Occasionally vessels of considerable bur- 
den land their flax cargoes from the Baltic, and other places at 
Pettycur harbour, and a few cargoes of potatoes are shipped an- 
nually there for the London market. There are a few small boats 
belonging to individuals in the town, which, during the summer 
months, are employed in fishing. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is no town in the parish except the burgh of Kinghorn. 
The population, as has been already stated, is 1555. Its trade has 
been diversified and fluctuating. While basking under the smiles 
of royalty, it had an ample business in supplying the necessary ar- 
ticles for the Court, and gentry, with their retainers. But when 
Glammis Castle began to decay, and the old nobility and gentry 
died out, or ceased to live upon their properties in the parish, a 
great change came over the aff"airs of Kinghorn. Still it pos- 
sessed a constant and advantageous traffic from the proximity of 
Pettycur, which was the principal ferry between Fife and Mid- Lo- 
thian. In the absence of steamers and stage-coaches, the town 
was usually crowded with passengers, waiting for fair weather to 
allow the boats to set sail. The whole town on these occasions 



814 



FIFEKSHIRE. 



was wont to be an inn ; every house that could well accommodate, 
strangers was in requisition ; and the demand for saddle-horses was 
so great, that, in the recollection of some old men, not less than 
sixty belonged to Kinghorn. All this passed naturally away by 
the introduction of steamers on the ferry, and the establishment 
of stage-coaches, with all their expedition of conveyance and accu- 
racy of hours. This deficiency of bustle and traffic in the town 
has been more than compensated by the erection'of the spinning- 
mills, upon which the inhabitants now principally depend for em- 
ploymenfand subsistence. 

From the period when the privileges of a royal burgh were con- 
ferred upon Kinghorn by David I., it had been managed by a 
town-council and magistrates, up to Michaelmas 1841, when, upon 
the day on which, by the set of the burgh, or terms of its charter, 
the magistrates ought to have been chosen, a quorum could not 
be mustered, and in consequence of this it was. disfranchised. 
Certain parties applied to the Court of Session for managers, and 
the court appointed three respectable gentlemen, resident in King- 
horn, to preside over its affairs, without being invested, however, 
with judicial authority. The absence of this authority has been 
felt to be no great evil. The residence of one of the county po- 
lice has been found quite sufficient to check any disorderly con- 
duct, and to maintain a surveillance over the public-houses and 
spirit-shops within the burgh. And the change in the manage- 
ment has had this material advantage, that the feelings of partisan- 
ship and partiality which naturally gathered around a system of 
some hundred years' growth, and which became every day less 
agreeable to the wants and wishes of the community, have now, 
and we trust for ever, passed away 

Means of Communication.— The long establishment of a post- 
office in the burgh, the constant and regular communication to 
Edinburgh by means of the Ferry, and the daily coaches which 
pass through the town on their route to and from the metropolis, 
present the greatest facilities for intercourse with all parts of the 
kingdom. 

In whatever article of supply Kinghorn may be deficient tor 
its inhabitants, there is an abundance to be found in Kirkcaldy, 

• The burrh of Kinshom, with a few others in Scotland, was excluded from the 
onerat ion of the Municipal Reform Bill, which gave a new and more popular law 
for the choTce of magistrates and councillors. Up to the t.me of Us.disfranch.se- 
ment, it remained in the old close burgh system. 



KINGHOUN.

only three miles distant, which opens a most extensive market 
for both home and foreign productions. 

Harbours. — The old harbour of Kinghorn is of little use, save 
for the accommodation of fishing-boats. The harbour at Petty- 
cur is in good condition, and affords a convenient landing place for 
passengers, goods, and cattle, when the vessels, by the state of the 
tide, are able to get along-side of the quay. The harbour and 
shore dues, with anchorages, have hitherto yielded not less than 
L.140 annually to the burgh funds. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church and burial-ground are close 
upon the sea shore, near to the old harbour. The situation is very 
inconvenient, even for the town's-people ; the street that leads 
down to it from the main or high street is long, narrow, and 
steep. It is, besides, very frequently wet and dirty. For the in- 
habitants of the landward parish the site is as bad as could be 
chosen. It is nearly seventy years since the church was rebuilt. 
The walls are still tolerably good, but the seats are old and rickety, 
and from the church-yard standing above the level of the floor, 
in some places nearly five feet, the pavement and walls are 
damp, and the atmosphere is often close and heavy. This latter 
evil has been greatly removed by the erection of two stoves. It 
can accommodate about 700. One-half of the sittings are ap- 
propriated to the landward parishioners, and the other half to the 
town's people. There have been very few seat rents drawn by the 
burgh, and none by the landward heritors. A number of old seats, 
under the sailors' gallery this aisle is of a more ancient date than 
the rest of the church were for a long period set apart for the 
school children, and have been latterly occupied by the scholars 
enjoying the benefit of Mr Philp's charity. 

The manse is hard by the church, and is in good repair, having 
been built in 1817. The glebe is below the legal measurement, 
but it was an excambion for the old glebe near Vicarsgrange, and 
was considered at the time an advantageous exchange for the in- 
cumbent. Its value is about L. 18 yearly. The stipend is 17 
chalders, half meal, half barley, paid according to the Fife fiars. 
There is a poor grass glebe along the shore, which is rented at 
L.l, 10s. annually. 

There is a quoad sacra church built on the eastern boundary 
of this parish, in the village of Invertiel, or Westbridge. It is 
seated for 800. A portion of this parish, containing a population 
of 760, and a part of the adjoining parish of Abbotshall, were al- 



816 



FIFESHIRE. 



located by the Presbytery of Kirkcaldy to this new church. The 
minister is paid from the seat rents, and the collections made 
at the church doors. 

A Burgher Dissenting chapel has existed in the town for up- 
wards of sixty years. The minister is paid on the voluntary prin- 
ciple, and of course his stipend varies. 

There are also a few Anabaptists, who meet together for wor- 
ship. 

There are about 700 communicants in the parish belonging to 
the Established Church of Scotland. About 500 of these belong 
tp the parish church, and the remaining 200 attend at Inver- 
tiel new church, and at Auchtertool and Abbotshall churches, — 
these being more contiguous to some portions of the landward pa- 
rish than the church at Kinghorn. 

There are 165 communicants in the parish belonging to the 
Burgher meeting-house, and nearly 100 more in communion with 
other Dissenting congregations in Kirkcaldy and Burntisland. 

The attendance on the ordinances of religion at the parish 
church is full and regular. 

A Female Bible and Missionary Society collects annually at an 
average, L.6, 10s. And the collections at the parish church, 
with parochial contributions for religious and charitable purposes, 
average L.20 per annum. Since December, four months ago, 
there have been L.16 collected for coals to the poor; for the four 
schemes of the church, L.IO, 16s., besides L.6 from an indivi- 
dual for church extension, to aid the supplementary fund. This 
was in addition to L.14 formerly given for the same object. 

Education.— The burgh and parochial school of Kinghorn is 
an object which attracts attention, on account of its equipments 
and accommodation as a seminary for youth. It is a handsome 
building at the west end of Kinghorn, standing within an enclosure 
tastefully laid out with shrubs and plants. There is also a bowl- 
ing-green, besides the play ground, with gymnastic poles for the 
children. 

In addition to the large room allotted to the parochial teacher, 
there are two smaller ones, well fitted up,— one for an infant 
school, and the other for drawing classes. This apartment is fre- 
quently used by the parochial teacher for monitors' classes. In 
the centre of the building, there is a museum well furnished with 
good specimens of mineralogy, geology, zoology, conchology, and 
anatomy. There are also a few good casts from the busts of emi- 



KINGHORN. 



817 



hent men, such as Sir Isaac Newon, FrankUn, Watt, Sir W. 
Scott, and others ; and several stucco casts from the frieze of the 
Parthenon, taken from the Elgin marbles in the British Museum. 
The school is taught on the most approved principles. The at- 
tendance of pupils averages about 120. A wide range of instruc- 
tion is afforded them. Besides the usual branches of English and 
grammar, writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping, mathematics, 
pure and practical, French, Latin, and Greek, the children are 
taught the uses of the various specimens which the museum pre- 
sents to their youthful inquiry, and thus they receive an initiatory 
knowledge of geology, mineralogy, &amp;c. 

The salary is L.25. The school fees for each scholar average 
18s. per annum, and amount to L.100 annually. The teacher 
has neither house nor garden, the arrangement made for the re- 
tirement of the former teacher having considerably crippled the 
means of the burgh for providing suitable accommodation for his 
successor. , 

There is another school in the town, attended on an average 
by 50 children, who are taught the elementary branches of reading, 
writing, and arithmetic. It is not endowed, and the teacher has 
no remuneration except the school fees. 

There is also a female and infant school ; the average number 
attending both is about 80. A sewing-school for the girls is now 
in full operation. 

There is an efficient school in the village of Invertiel, where 
the usual elementary branches are taught, and also practical ma- ' 
thematics. It is attended by 70. A school-house is provided 
for the teacher, but no salary beyond his school fees. The chil- 
dren in the northern parts of the parish are obliged, on account 
of the distance from Kinghorn, to attend the schools in Auchter- 
tool. 

Sabbath school teaching has long been vigorously carried on 
here for mstructing the youth in the principles of religion, and 
traming them to its practice. The parochial teacher has one 
under his charge, attended by 125 ; and the minister has had 
mi adult class for several years, which he has lately taught on the 
Ihursday evenmgs, attended on an average by 60. This class

is exclusively for females, and those especially who are employed 
in the mills. 

The Dissenting minister, the Rev. James Hardie, has also been 
most industrious in this department. He has long had a Sabbath 
evening class, which has been well attended. 

Library. — There is a library kept in the museum by the paro- 
chial teacher, and another subscription one in the town. The 
minister obtained, a few years ago, a good selection of books from 
the Tract Society in London, which have been well read by the 
young people attending his class, and others who chose to enjoy 
the privilege. 

Charitable Institutions. — The late Robert Philp, Esq. of Edens- 
head, left his property for the endowment of schools ; one-eighth 
part of which was appropriated for the instruction and clothing of 
50 children in Kinghorn, and the residue of the fund to be given 
to the children in such proportions as the managers of the charity 
shall direct, " the better to enable the children on leaving the 
school to begin the world." The children enjoying the charity 
attend the parochial school, and are taught all the branches which 
the other children receive in the course of instruction. 

Henry Bursary. — The late Rev. James Henry, minister of this 
parish, left L.yOO to found a bursary, to support a young man 
during four years of his philosophical studies at the United Col- 
lege of St Salvador and St Leonard, in the University of St An- 
drews, the interest of which, at five per cent., yields to the bursar 
L.15 a-year. The right of electing the bursar is vested in the 
kirk-session of Kinghorn, the presbytery of Kirkcaldy, and the 
town-council now the managers of this burgh. These bodies 
are appointed by the trust-deed to send their respective delegates 
to meet together, by previous appointment of the minister of 
Kinghorn, in the session-house there, and then to make choice, 
by plurality of voices, of a young man to enjoy the bursary for the 
time being. 

Savinys' Bank. — There is no saving bank in the parish, but 
there is one in Kirkcaldy, which is of great advantage to the dis- 
trict, and in it deposits to a considerable amount are lodged by 
the sober and working classes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor, who 
receive regular aliment from the parochial funds, for the last se- 
ven years, is 39, and the weekly sum granted to each varies from 
8d. to 2s. 6d. There are occasional poor besides these, who ro 



KINGHORN.

ceive half-yearly distributions at the winter and summer sacra- 
ments. The average amount for their relief is L.12I, 19s. The 
church door collections have averaged, for the last ten years, L.30. 
Voluntary contributions, supplied by the heritors, have averaged 
L.70 per annum, and the interest on L.550 at four per cent., left 
to the kirk-session for the poor by the late Rev. James Henry, 
including L.lOO left by the Rev. Mr Shanks of Castlerigg for the 
same object, after deducting stamp-receipt, amounts to L.21, 19s. 
making in all the above sum of L.121, 19s. annually. 

There is no disposition on the part of the poor to abstain from 
seeking parochial relief. There is an opinion gaining ground, 
that the heritors of the parish are obliged to supply the wants of 
the poor, which is affecting considerably both the church door 
collections, and the independent feeling which at one time had 
such a strong hold of our Scottish peasantry. 

Prisons. — There is a strong and secure prison in the town- 
house, but there is not a prisoner in it, and it will not be of much 
use now, except for a lock-up-house, as the prison for punishment 
for this district is in Kirkcaldy. 

Fairs.— There is a fair marked in the Almanack for Kinghorn, 
but there has not of late been a sweety stall erected on the street, 
on the day on which it is said to be held. 

Ale-houses. — There is one good inn at Pettycur, and there are 
in the burgh nine spirit-shops and ale-houses. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly consumed here is coal, which costs 
about 9s. a ton, and is driven in carts from Lochgelly, Cluny, and 
other collieries, at an average distance of eight miles. 

Inchkeith — This striking island, lying in mid-channel between 
Kinghorn and Leith, was, soon after the Reformation in Scotland, 
annexed ecclesiastically to the parish of Kinghorn.  It is up- 
wards of half a mile in length, and it varies in breadth, being nar- 
row towards the south, but widening and increasing also in height 
as It approaches towards the north. At its highest elevation,°on 
which the light-house is built, it is 180 feet above the level of the 
sea. 

It has several springs of the purest water, and is rich both in 
Its botanical and geological productions. The soil is excellent, 
where, from the nature of the surface, it can be cultivated, and 
the pasture has long been esteemed peculiarly nutritious for cattle.

There are many rabbits on the island, and its shores are well 
known to the Bshermen as abounding with fish and oysters, and 
other kinds of shell-fish. 

The island was conferred by Malcolm II., in 1010, upon the 
first of the Noble family of Keith, as a reward for his valour at 
the battle of Barry. From this family it received its name. It 
subsequently fell to the Crown, as it was included in the grant of 
Glammis Tower and the lands of Kinghorn to Lord Glammis, 
The Strathmore family retained it till 1649, when it was sold to 
Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit, for the purpose, it would appear, of 
establishing a fishery upon it. After passing into the hands of 
various proprietors, it ultimately became the property of the Buc- 
eleuch family. His Grace, the present representative of that 
distinguished family, is, in virtue of this property, an heritor of 
the parish of Kinghorn. 

The purposes to which this beautiful island has been appro- 
priated are varied and important. It became a military station of 
great consequence to the contending parties during the stoiy 
periods of Mary of Guise and her unfortunate daughter, and ot 
Charles I. A part of the wall, showing the strength and nature 
of its fortifications, is still to be seen. James IV. is said to have 
made it the scene of an experiment to discover the original lan- 
o-uacre of mankind, by sending thither two infants under the care 
of a deaf and dumb nurse ; but the result of the trial has never 
been recorded. At an earlier period 1497, the island was, by 
order of the King, made an asylum for the reception of persons m 
Edinburgh who were seized with a contagious disorder " calht the 

grandgore." , , • , • 

Very difi-erent is now the purpose to which Inchkeith is appro- 
nriated. In 1803, it was selected for the establishment of a light- 
house, on account of its great importance to the navigation of the 
Forth ; and the first beacon-light appeared from it on the evening 
of the 1st September 1804. Since that time it has undergone 
various improvements. In 1815, it was changed from being a 
stationary light to a revolving one, to distinguish it from the fixed 
light erected on the Isle of May. But the greatest improvement 
upon the apparatus was made in 1834, when, instead of seven re- 
flectors revolving, each with its own lamp in the cavity or centre 
of the reflector, there is now one fixed burner, around which there 
vevolves a heptagon, having on each side a perpendicular lens ol 
lar.re size and great power, which concentrates the light at the 



DUNFERMLINE. 



821 



focus of each to a dazzling brilliancy. This heptagon performs, 
by a beautifully constructed machine, an entire revolution around 
the burner, or fixed light, in the course of seven minutes, which 
causes the lapse of one minute between the concentrated light 
passing through the centre of one lens till it again passes through 
the centre of another. Hence the alternations of brilliancy and 
dimness in the light, appearing to every eye around the whole 
horizon. 

There are two families who constantly reside on the island, — 
the principal keeper of the light-house and his assistant, who are 
very comfortably lodged within the building which has been erected 
for the light. Everything connected with this establishment is in 
the most complete order, being under the skilful superintendence 
of Mr Robert Stevenson, Civil-Engineer.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNFERMLINE, SYNOD OF FIEE. 

THE REV. PETER CHALMERS, A. M., MINISTER OP 
FIRST CHARGE. 

Second charge at present vacant. 



• — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation and Height.— Tn town of Dunfermline is situated in 
latitude 56° 5' 4" north ; longitude 3° 27' 18" west from Green.- 
wich station. Abbey Church ; sixteen miles north-west of Edin- 
burgh ; 43 north-east of Glasgow ; 21 east-south-east of Stirling; 
29 south of Perth ; 1 1 south-west of Kinross ; 30 south-west of 
Cupar, the county town; and 12 west south-west of Kirkcaldy. 
It is 2 miles 7 furlongs north of the Frith, at Limekilns, in the 
parish ; 3 miles 3 furlongs ditto at Rosyth Castle ; and 5 miles 
north-west of North Queensferry. 

Aame— The word Dunfermline, locally pronounced Dumfer- 
line, or vulgarly Dumfarline, is of Celtic origin. Dun signifies a 
heap, hill, tower, castle ;/«e denotes a watch or guard; and linne, 
a pool,a pond, and also a waterfall or cataract; or loin, a little stream 



822 



I'IFESHIRE. 



or rivulet. Hence Dun-fair linne or loin will mean, The Fort, or 
Castle, which commands the pool or stream, — or shortly. The 
Watch-tower of or upon the stream. This is thought the most 
simple derivation, and most agreeable to the Gaelic idiom, and 
therefore is preferable to another, the more common, and also 
quite correct one, which makes Dun and linne or loin as above, 
andar, crooked or winding, so that Dun-Jiar-linne or /oiw, will 
signify. The Castle upon the crooked or curved pool or winding 
stream. Both these etymologies are suitable to the locality from 
which it is most probable the name was taken, the tower or resi- 
dence of King Malcolm III. being situated upon a mount in Pit- 
tencrieff Glen, on the west side of the church, around which a little 
stream winds. 

The word, Dunfermline, was anciently written Dunfermelyn, 
Dunfermelyne, Dunfermling, Dunfermlyng, Dwnfermling, Dom- 
fermeling, Dounfranelin, and Dunfermlis ; and in Latin, Dunum 
Fermilinum, Dunum Fermelini, Fermelinodunum, Fermalinodu- 
num, Fermilodunensis, and Fermilodunum. This last mode of 
writing the name, appears on the present common seal of the 
burgh, the armorial bearing of which is a tower or fort, supported 
by two lions. Around the device is a circle, on which are inscrib- 
ed the words sigillvm civitatis termilodvni. In the ancient 
seal of the burgh, which has been long lost, but some impressions 
of which remain, there were around the same arms two circles, m 
the exterior of which were engraved the words just quoted, with 
the name of the town, spelled fermeloduni, and the interior, 
the words esto rupes inaccessa. On the reverse side was the 
figure of a lady, holding a sceptre, and on each side an inverted 
sword, handle downwards, surrounded by the words margareta 
regina scotorum. All these legends are in Roman capitals. 

The arms of the burgh evidently refer to the origin of the 
town, and show what has been the prevailing opinion as to the 
derivation of its name. For there is a peninsulated eminence in 
Pittencrieff Glen, as already noticed, close by the town, of about 
seventy feet in height, and very steep, rugged, and rocky on the 
north side, on which stood a tower commonly called Kinff Mal- 
colm Canmore's Tower, or his residence at Dunfermline, and pro- 
bably built by him. The name of his Queen was Margaret, 
afterwards canonized, and named St Margaret. A small coarse 
fratrment of two walls of this tower, strongly cemented with 
lime mixed evidently with sea sand, from the quantity of shell

imbedded in it, still remains, very properly preserved by the pre- 
sent proprietor, James Hunt, Esq., and which must be now nearly 
800 years old. Around the base of this little hill, there winds a 
rivulet, named the Back-burn or Tour Tower bwn ; and from 
the sides and summit of the hill, as well as through the adjacent 
deep and narrow glen, there rises some very stately and aged trees. 
The hill or mount is named from the building erected on it, T/ie 
Tower-hill, and about a hundred yards south-east of it in the glen, 
are the ruins of the ancient Palace of Dunfermline, of which no- 
tice will afterwards be taken. The whole scenery is exceedingly 
picturesque and romantic, the admiration of all strangers. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The territorial extent of the parish is 
very great, and its figure irregular. Its utmost length from north 
to south is about nine miles, and its utmost breadth from east to 
west, about six miles. It contains about 19,296 acres imperial, 
or 15,300 Scots, exclusive of the space occupied by the town, 
villages and great roads. Calculating the average length at eight, 
and the average breadth at four and a-half miles, the number of 
square miles in the parish will be 36, and of square imperial acres, 
23,040. 

Dunfermline is bounded by the parishes of Cleish and Saline 
on the north, of Carnock and Torryburn on the west, and of 
Beath, Aberdour, Dalgety, and Inverkeithing, on the east. It 
has Inverkeithing, also, on the south-east ; and the Frith of Forth 
on the south-west. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface presents a great va- 
riety of appearances. 

The southern division is fertile and well clothed, and in many 
places very beautiful, from the undulating nature of the ground, 
and the intermixture of clumps and belts of good plantations ; 
while the northern is, with some exceptions, naked and bleak in 
aspect. The land has a general ascent from south to north, 
which is easy, and not much interrupted by declivities between 
the Frith of Forth, at the village of Limekilns and the town ; but 
is more rapid and irregular afterwards. The undulations of the 
rising ground, on the approach to the town, from the North 
Queensferry, are very considerable, causing alternately great 
heights and hollows in the road leading to it. 

The northern section of the parish is considerably diversified 
by high and low-lying grounds, the swelling ridges becoming 
more numerous and elevated, as they spread towards the Cleish 



824 



FIFESHIRE. 



hills, with occasional valleys intervening, and generally extending 
from east to west. The Roscobie ridge is very pronninent. 

The principal hills are, the hill of Beath, on the north-east, 
which is partly in this, and partly in Beath parish ; and Craig- 
luscar hill, on the north-west. The former has the greater ele- 
vation of the two, is clothed with verdure to the summit, and com- 
mands a beautiful prospect. 

The coast along the Frith of Forth stretches about a mile 
and a half, and is partly high, and partly flat. It is chiefly rocky 
in its nature, and the portion of it immediately in front of Broom- 
hall house, which is steep, is covered with fine wood. At the 
western extremity are the harbour, village, and lime-works of 
Charleston ; in the centre, the bay, harbour, and village of Lime- 
kilns ; and close by, on the east, in the parish of Inverkeithing, 
the harbour of Brucehaven, and about a quarter of a mile onward 
the ruins of the old church, and the churchyard of Rosyth, where 
the ground projects a little into the Frith. 

Meteorology, — The atmosphere is generally dry, clear, bracing, 
and salubrious; but there is a considerable diversity in the parish 
as to climate. In the southern division, where the land has a 
gentle slope towards the Frith, and is comparatively well shelter- 
ed, the temperature is much milder and more genial than in the 
northern, where the gromid has a gradual ascent, and is more 
hilly and less protected. From this circumstance, as well as the 
greater wetness and inferiority of the soil in the northern district, 
the harvest there is commonly two or three weeks later than in the 
southern. Even in the upper and lower ends of the town, there 
is a perceptible difference in the temperature, as indeed may be 
supposed from the fact, that there are 200 feet of difference be- 
tween their respective elevations above the level of the sea. 

A meteorological table, showing the state of the barometer and 
thermometer at nine o'clock in the morning for ten years, 1825- 
1834, both inclusive, was kept by the late Rev. Henry Fergus, 
minister of the Relief Church, Dunfermline, well known in this 
quarter for the ardour and ability with which he prosecuted scien- 
tific studies, as well as the amiableness and modesty of his cha- 
racter. From this table, with which I have been fivvoured, the 
following facts and calculations have been deduced as to atmo- 
spheric pressure and temperature :—

mean height of the barometer for each of the months of the ten

years specified, viz. from the beginning of 1825 to the end of 
1834, derived from observations made daily at nine o'clock in the

excess or defect of the means for each month from the mean 
height of the barometer, during the whole period of observation.

Average Mean 

Thus it appears that the average mean pressure, taken from 
the means of the months, is 29.44 ; that the means in excess are 
one more than in defect ; that the former obtain in five conse- 
cutive months, from May to September, both inclusive ; and that 
in the month of October there was an equality. 

The mean height of the barometer during the twelve months, 
and the highest and lowest state of it in the course of each year

The average of the thermometer was accordingly 46.8, while 
that of the barometer, as formerly ascertained, was 29.4.4'. It ap- 
pears, too, that January was the coldest and July the hottest 
months during the ten years in question. 

Main and Wind, — The prevailing and strongest winds in the 
parish are from the west and south-west, as indicated by the in- 
clination in an opposite direction of single and exposed trees ; and 
it is these winds which most frequently bring rain, while the cold- 
est are from the north and east. A north-westerly wind is gene- 
rally dry. 

In 1828, the following observations were made as to rain and 
wind. From 1st January to .3 1st December of that year, there 
were 157 rainy days, in 51 of which the rain was incessant. The

Hydrography. — The Frith of Forth, as already mentioned, 
bounds the lower part of the parish, on the south-west, and the 
quoad civilia part of it, at North Queensferry, on the south-east. 
It presents here nothing remarkable as to tides, except a slight 
peculiarity occasionally at Charleston, the south-western extre- 
mity of the parish. Indeed, there is no great peculiarity in this 
respect on the whole Frith till near Alloa, where there is a very 
striking one, called Lakies, of which a short account is given in 
Sibbald's History of Fife pp. 87-8, and a very full one in the 
new Statistical Account of that parish. 

A bank runs from Long Craig Island at North Queensferry, all 
along the north shore, as far up as Long Annat Point, above Blair 
house, west of the burgh of Culro.ss, which is nearly dry in all 
places, in low spring tides. 

Some of the soundings, at a little distance from this bank, at 
low water of spring tides, are as follows :-7-

Heavy gales of wind from the west often raise the tides 1 feet 
above the usual calculation. 

The average depth of water in the centre of the Frith, between 
a point opposite Rosyth castle, and a point opposite Borrowstoun- 
ness, is about 55 feet. The greatest depth in this range is on the 
south side of the small Bimar Island, where it is 192 feet. Be- 
tween that island and Long Craig Island, it is 16'2 feet. The 
depth between North Battery Pier and the north-west of Inch- 
garvie Island, is 210 feet, nearer to that point it is 222 feet, — the 
greatest depth of water in the whole Frith, and even in many parts 
of the North Sea. 

A stone-beacon was lately erected by the commissioners for the 
northern light-houses on Bimar Island, 27 feet in height, and 13 
in diameter, as a protection to vessels at high water, when the 
island is covered 

Long Craig Island, Du- Craig, and Bimar, are all rocky and of 
small extent. Their sizes are in the order now named. 

South of the east end of Long Craigs, and midway between it 
and a parallel line from Bimar, is Fair-way sunk rock, flattish, 
stretching south-west and north-east, about the size of the deck 
of a vessel of 200 tons. It is covered at lowest stream ebb by 5 
or 6 feet water. A sloop drawing 8 feet water grounded on it 
on the 2d November 1826, and remained till the tide had flowed 
an hour. Since that period, vessels with any draught of water 
always take the south side of Bimar rock. 

The smallest breadth of the Frith, viz. from the extremity of 
the Signal- House Pier to that of the South Queensferry Pier, at 
lowest water of spring tides, is H miles, and to Newhalls Pier, 
about 50 yards more. The greatest breadth, viz. from Limekilns 
to the opposite shore, west of Blackness Castle, is from two to 
three miles. 

Springs. — There is a. small mineral spring near the iron mill, 
in the vicinity of Charleston. 

The springs from which the town of Dunfermline is supplied 
with water are situated at Cairncubie, in the town-moor, about a 
mile and half north-east of the town. The water was first brought 
from them into the town about 1797, and is conveyed in pipes 
partly wooden and partly cast- iron, and also, during a portion of 
its progress, in conduits built of stone and lime. 

Lakes or Lochs. — There are several of these in the northern

part of the parish ;— the Town Loch, Lochend, Lochfitty, Loch 
Gloe, and Black Loch. 

Rivulets. — The chief brook deserving notice is the Lyne, or as 
it is often called the Spital Hospital burn, from passing in its 
course near the site of the ancient hospital of St Leonards, at the 
lower end of the town. There are also the Tower or Tour-burn, 
which winds round the Tower-hill in PittencriefF Glen, whence it 
derives its name, and the Baldridge burn. 

Mineralogy, Geology, Soil. — The fields of coal in this district 
are very extensive, and appear to have been among the most an- 
cient in Scotland. I am aware of only two notices of coal, one 
in England, the other in Scotland, prior to that in Dunfermline, 
the former being variously dated, 1234, 1239, and 1245 ; the lat- 
ter 1284-5.t 

In 1291, William de Oberwill, proprietor of PittencriefF estate, 
adjoining to the town, granted a charter to the abbot and convent 
of Dunfermline, bestowing on them the privilege of working one 
coal-pit, wherever they chose, on any part of his property, except 
the land which was arable ; and when one was exhausted, of open- 
ing another at their pleasure, as often as they considered it expe- 
dient, but for their own exclusive use, and with an express prohi- 
bition to sell coals to others. He also, in the same charter, gave 
them a right to quarry and hew as many stones as they pleased, 
on the same conditions, with the liberty of making " free use of 
all the roads and footpaths through his lands of PetyncrefF and of 
Galurigs, which they at any time had employed, or been in the 
practice of employing." To this charter were affixed not only 
his own seal, but, at his instance, those of the Lord Bishop of St 
Andrews, and of Robert de Malevilla Melville, and it is dated 
at Dunfermline on the Tuesday immediately before the feast of 
St Ambrose, bishop and confessor, 1291.| 

But at the early period of 1291, there was little coal wrought 
in the parish. It was then a luxury enjoyed chiefly by the inmates 
of the Abbey, and persons of distinction in the country. 

In progress of time coal came to be generally used as fuel in 

 Vide the author's Prize Essay on the Dunfermline coal-field, which appeared first 
in the Quarterly Journal of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, for June 
1840, and with the necessary alterations brought down to October 1842, and some ad- 
ditions, in his Historical and Statistical Account of Dunfermline, pp. 600, illustrated 
with 17 engravings, published by Blackwood and Sons, May 1844.

Dunfermline, as in other places; and when trade was prosperous, 
even to be exported to foreign parts. Although it continued to 
be wrought by crop-levels long after 1291, there was little expor- 
tation till the middle of last century. Even so late as 1763, the 
writer of the last Statistical Account of the parish, states that the 
annual value of exported coal was only L.200, and in 1771, that 
it did not exceed L.500 Sterling. The coal-mines became after 
1771, and have continued to be, very lucrative to many of the pro- 
prietors. " From a remote period," the same writer records, 
' the family of Pitferrane obtained from Government the privilege 
of exporting these coals to foreign parts, free of all duty whatever. 
The original privilege was renewed by Queen Anne, on Decem- 
ber 21, 1706, and ratified in Parliament on March 21, 1707. The 
family continued to enjoy the privilege till 1788, when it was pur- 
chased by Government for L.40,000 Sterling, when the property 
that could injure the revenue was nearly exhausted." 

Although the coal in the parish has thus been dug for upwards 
of five centuries, it is still most abundant. Nearly 3000 acres are 
calculated as still to work, a portion of that quantity having been 
ascertained by general boring, and the rest conjectured on good 
grounds to be of the coal-formation, with such interruptions, more 
or less slight, as commonly occur in coal-fields. 

The coal-strata extend from Culalo Hills on the east to the 
Saline Hills on the west, and pervade in that line of bearing the 
whole of the parish of Dunfermline. In some parts there have 
been discovered 10 or 12 seams to the dip, the aggregate thick- 
ness of which amounts to upwards of 40 feet, contained in beds 
varying from a few inches to seven or eight feet in thickness. 
These are different in quality as well as in thickness, but in gene- 
ral improve towards the west. By being divested of part of their 
bitumen, they partake of more heat and durability, and, from a 
hard splint, they become a rich caking cubical coal, until they 
approach the trap hills, when they lose their bituminous quality 
altogether, and are changed into a blind anthracite, or glance-coal. 

Elgin Colliery.— The largest proprietor is the Earl of Elgin, 
who possesses a coal-field, the whole area of which, wrought and 
unwrought, may be stated at from 2600 to 2700 acres. 

The coal-seams are of various quality, and some of them, es- 
pecially the deepest, are extremely valuable. Almost all the coal

partakes more or less of the caking quality and soft texture of the 
Newcastle coal. It is easily ignited, possesses great heat and du- 
rability, and produces very few ashes of a brown colour, which 
renders it cleanly and economical for all purposes. 

A new pit was completed at the end of the year 1839, 105 fa- 
thoms deep, named the " Wallsend Pit," which has entirely su- 
perseded the use of the Baldridge pit in the vicinity. It is the 
deepest coal shaft in Scotland, and probably one of the most va- 
luable. It is very productive, yielding at present as much coal as 
all the other pits together previously did at any one time. 

Subjoined is a section of the different strata in this pit, showing 
the order of their superposition and succession, as well as the 
thickness of each. As the shaft is sunk in the bottom of an el- 
liptical basin, the general dip of the strata is towards the shaft, as 
to a common centre from all directions, except the north, where 
the segment of the basin is cut off by a. dike. The general angle 
of the dip will be from 16° to 20°.f 

• The common name Wallsend means the end of the wall of Severus, on the north- 
ern bank of the Tyne, a few miles below Newcastle, where the best coal is got.

years since greatly increased in value, both to the proprietor and 
lessee, by the erection of a powerful steam-engine for drawing the 
water, whereby an excellent seam of splint-coal was reached, much 
admired for its clearness and purity. The coal from this work is 
extensively used in the town of Dunfermline and neighbourhood, 
and a large quantity of it is also exported to the ports on the Bal- 
tic and Mediterranean Seas, France, &amp;c. chiefly for navigation 
purposes, for which it is well adapted. The steam-toats plying 
between Paris and Rouen are almost entirely supplied with it» 
There have been at times 2000 tons sent down by the Elgin rail- 
way in one fortnight. 

The coal-field, including East Baldridge and Venturefair, not 
at present wrought, may embrace '200 acres, of which 30 or 40 
are still to work. 

The average quantity of coals raised in 1836-1841 was 39,535 
tons per annum. 

Townhill and Appin Collieries. — To the east of this colliery, 
and about a mile and a quarter from the town, are the Townhill 
and Appin Collieries, the former belonging to the burgh of Dun- 
fermline, and the latter to Mr Downie of Appin. Previous to 
Candlemas 1838, the burgh had its coal in its own hands, and 
worked only that which was at a moderate depth, and of inferior 
quality, which was all sold in the town and neighbourhood at a 
lower rate than other coal. At the period mentioned, however, 
an enterprising and wealthy company took a lease of it for nine- 
teen years, commencing at that date, and by sinking new pits, so 
as to reach the splint coal, a greater amount and superior quality 
of coal are raised, so that hopes are entertained that not only the 
lessees, but the creditors of the burgh, will be much benefited, 
even that the debt of the burgh will, at no distant period, be en- 
tirely paid off". The consumption formerly was chiefly in the town 
and vicinity, but now there is a considerable exportation to France, 
Denmark, and the Baltic. The coal for exportation is now ship- 
ped at Inverkeithing, whither it is conveyed by a branch railway 
recently formed through the lands of Messrs Downie, Wellwood, 
and Main, and joining the Halbeath one at Guttergates, near 
where it crosses the Crossgates road. 

The whole coal-field leased by the company is understood to 
cover above 900 acres, of which about 700 still remain unworked. 
All the lower seams to the north of the great dike are untouched.

the burgh used to be between 6000 and 7000 tons per annum. 
That of the company averages at present 15,000 tons. 

Halbeath Colliery. — The next large and very old colliery, still 
farther to the east, and two and a half miles from the town of 
Dunfermline, is that of Halbeath, belonging to John Clarkson, 
Esq. The coal-field here is very extensive, comprehending, with 
all the portions leased from the neighbouring proprietors, seve- 
ral hundred acres, of which there is a large portion still to work, 
but the precise extent of this cannot well be ascertained, in conse- 
quence of the want of the old plans of the workings. It may be 
estimated, however, at above 200 acres. A valuable bed of can- 
nel or parrot coal has been wrought in it, with much advantage of 
late, in supplying the Dunfermline and other gas-works. 

There are other two small collieries, the Cuttlehill and South 
Lethan, but at present there is little coal wrought at them. 

Fossil Organic Remains.— These are found in great abundance 
in almost all these coal-fields, and they chiefly belong to the ve- 
getable kingdom. They occur in the sandstone, coals, and fire- 
clay, but principally in the shales. Some excellent specimens 
were found in the New Wallsend pit, at the Elgin Colliery, in 
the stratum No. 91 of the section previously given, which is 15 
feet 7 inches of sandstone, at the depth of from 76 to 78 fathoms 
from the surface. The largest of these have been transferred to 
the lawn south-east of Broomhall House.

zontally, or at least at a less angle than 45°. The reedy appear- 
ance on both is quite distinct. The Stigmaria also has been found. 

Toion Hill Colliery. — At the Town Hill Colliery there have 
been found some very fine specimens of the Lepidodendron in clay- 
ironstone and in shale, and of the Calamites. 

Halbeath Colliery. — The tooth of a sauroid fish, named by M. 
Agassiz, McgalycMis, was found a few years since in a bed of can- 
nel coal at Halbeath, of which Leonard Horner, Esq. gave an 
account in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal for April 
1836, contending, in opposition to the opinion of Dr Hibbert, that 
it, as well as the same fish found in the limestone of Burdiehouse, 
belongs to a marine, not a fresh water formation. 

This district abounds not only in coal, but in limestone, whin- 
stone, sandstone, and a portion of ironstone. 

Limestone. — Limestone is found in the lands of Broomhall, Ros- 
cobie, Lathalmond, DundufF, Dunnygask, Craigluscar, Cowdens, 
Brucefield, Southfod, and Sunnybank ; but is wrought for sale at 
present only on the first four mentioned properties. 

There are altogether about 400,000 bushels of shells, and 
15,000 tons of raw stone sold annually at Charleston. The burnt 
lime is sold by the imperial standard measure, and the present 
prices are, — 

For lime shells, per bushel, . . L.O 0 4 

Slacked lime, per chalder of 36 bushels, . 0 4 0

Lime-shell, by land-carriage, per bushel, . 0 0 6 

There are nearly 60,000 bushels of shells sold annually at 
Roscobie at 5d. per bushel. 

The limestone in the parish belongs to the mountain limestone 
formation, and is of marine orierin. 

The Charleston limestone has several varieties, the principal of 
which are of a grey colour, with foliated structure, greyish brown 
with splintery fracture, and compact ash-grey. These have been 
found by careful analysis to contain carbonic acid from 40.25 to 
42.3; hme from 47.05 to 51.6; magnesia from 0.92 to 2.59; 
alumina from 0.95 to 1.8 ; silica from 2.76 to 7.9 ; iron from 0.28 
to 0.56 ; with a very small proportion of manganese, carbon, sul- 
phur, and naphtha. The limestone which contains the greatest 
portion of naphtha, carbon, and sulphur, is also that which is low- 
est in the stratification.

Fosil Remains.— There is a great abundance of fossil remains 
in the Charleston limestone. One large block of the stone, con- 
taining a very rich specimen of these, has been transferred to the 
lawn on the south-east corner of Broomhall House. 

Here there are, \st. The Turbinolia fwigites, vulgarly named 
Sheephorn, from its resemblance to that object, or turbinated ma- 
drepore. 

Id, The Tubipora, in great abundance. 

Sd, The Encrinite. Whole masses of the rock at Charleston 
are covered with this fossil, on account of the profusion of which, 
the limestone might be called, as it sometimes is, " Encrinal." 

4th, The Producta is very plentiful in this quarry, and there are 
some specimens of that species of it which have been denominated 
the Producta Martini. There are also the Producta fimbriato, 
pustulosa and many others. There are observable on some of the 
Producta long minute lines, like silver wires, proceeding from both 
valves, commonly named needles, but now ascertained to be the 
spines of the Producta. Some portions of limestone also contain 
these spines without the Producta, 

There are here, too, several species of Spirifers and Terebra- 
tulce, and a few rare instances of the Orthoceratite. 

On the shore, west of the harbour, was found a specimen of ap- 
parently a coralline. 

Between Broomhall House and the quarry, there is on the ris- 
ing ground a huge piece of lime-rock, preserved as a memorial of 
the height which the rock once possessed, and full of the organic 
remains now noticed, some of which are in thick regular layers. 
This piece of rock is seen from a great distance, and has upon it 
a flag-staff. 

Roscobie Limestone. — This is about three and a half miles north 
from the town of Dunfermline, and is also of the mountain de- 
posit. It has several varieties, the two principal of which are, — 
compact, grey, fracture earthy, with many particles of calcareous 
spar ; and compact, grey, fracture earthy, with very few of these 
shining particles. Two specimens of these were carefully analys- 
ed for the writer in January and February 1839, by Rev. A. Ro- 
bertson, Junior, well known for his chemical attainments, and were 
found to contain as follows. The tirst, —

This limestone abounds in the same kinds of fossils as have been 
mentioned to occur in that of Charleston. The encrinite is ex- 
ceedingly abundant, and very large at Roscobie. One piece has 
been found, containing not only a great mass, in apparent confu- 
sion, as if arising from some violent disturbance of the stems and 
tentacula, but also what are very rare, at least in Scotland, two 
heads of this fossil. The rarity of these is supposed to be owing 
to their having been more tender parts of the animal, and of course 
more easily destroyed than the others. 

There are met with here also pieces of calcareous shale, in 
which there are parts of the encrinite covered with iron-pyrites, 
and beautiful crystals of the same. Some pieces of shale, too, 
have the spines of the Producta distinctly marked on them ; and 
one has spines of perhaps a large Producta, with portions of en- 
crinites and Retepora. Also Turbinolia is found. 

At the neighbouring lime-quarry of Lathalmond there are some 
large specimens of the Producta. 

Sunnybank Limestone. — The limestone at the small quarry of 
Sunnybank, in the south-eastern part of the parish, is not the main 
bed of the mountain deposit, but one of the interpolated beds of 
the same formation. There is a thin bed of coal immediately be- 
low the limestone, and beneath the coal is a deep bed of fire-clay, 
of which are manufactured the very excellent fire-brick and gas 
retorts made at Inverkeithing. 

Orthoceratites and various shells abound in a bed of slate-clay 
immediately above the limestone; as also at Duloch, in the im- 
mediate neighbourhood, in Inverkeithing parish. 

Craigluscar Lime.Qimrrtj.—Thh quarry, which is in the north- 
western part of the parish, and near the summit of a hill of the 
same name, presents one of the exceptions to the general nature 



840 



FIFESHIRE. 



of the limestone rock, inasmuch as it contains a bed of trap, inter- 
stratified with two beds of limestone. The trap, however, is not 
pure, but has a mixture of lime in it, in consequence of which it 
is commonly named Bastard Whin. It is soft and of no durability, 
and hence is of little value. It is used in kiln buildings, and as 
metal on country roads, but soon needs to be replaced. It was 
probably thrown up over the lower bed of limestone, and at some 
subsequent period the upper bed was deposited upon it. 

No metallic deposites, which are so abundant in the correspond- 
ing limestones of England, have been discovered in the limestones 
of this parish. 

Trap Rocks. — There are several quarries of these in the parish. 
The principal one is at Woodhill, on Knockhouse farm, belonging 
to Captain Sir John Halket, Bart., Pitferrane. This rock appears 
to have been produced after the deposition of the coal formation. 
It is rather an exception to the general appearance of such rocks. 
It cannot be said to be exactly stratified, but there are regular 
overflows, or beds of trap, as in volcanic mountains ; and different 
from one another in compactness or degrees of hardness. The co- 
lumnar structure is not very distinct, but seems to be separated oc- 
casionally by fissures containing quartz and carbonate of lime. 
There is one of these of considerable length and width. They 
may not have been original cracks, but occasioned by subsequent 
convulsions, and filled by siliceous and calcareous materials. The 
rock presents in different places, when newly broken, beautiful 
veins of quartz, and of jasper, approaching to cornelian. There 
are strewed around the quarry various balls or masses of decom- 
posed greenstone, of a roundish form, with concentrate coatings or 
layers, which, it is well known, form an excellent soil. The rock 
is within a few inches of the surface, in which respect it differs 
greatly from the sandstone quarries in the immediate neighbour- 
hood, which have an alluvial covering of from 10 to 20 feet thick. 

There is another of these trap-rock quarries at Redcraigs toll, 
three miles north from the town of Dunfermline, and another a 
mile and a half still farther north, near the Outh farm-house, both 
on the Crieff road, and seen from it. This last quarry has a very 
curious and interesting appearance, resembling the general aspect 
of the basaltic pillars at the Giant's Causeway in the north of Ire- 
land. It is not large, is of a semicircular form, and has rather a 
narrow entrance. At the north-west corner the stones are colum- 
nar, and of a pentagonal figure. They lie in a horizontal posi-

tion, the one heaped above the other, and closely and regularly 
compacted, with the outer ends pointing southward. On the north 
side the pillars are vertical, on the east arched downwards, on the 
south inclining or dipping in a bending form to the north, and on 
the south-west corner dipping to the north-east. Some parts of 
the greenstone are amygdaloidal, having the cavities filled with 
carbonate of lime, and some of the fissures are coated with calca- 
reous spar. 

There is a great deal of trap-rock, also, on the range of hills 
lying between the Redcraigs toll and the Roscobie lime-works. 

Freestone or Sandstone Quarries. — There are several of these 
in the parish. The chief ones are at Berrylaw and North Ur- 
quhart, a mile north-west ; at Millhills, a quarter of a mile south- 
east ; and at Sunnybank, three miles south-east from the town ; 
and at Pittencrieff within it, between Pittencrieff and Golf-Drum 
Streets. The stone at all these, except the last, is of good qua- 
lity, and much used in building. 

Fossil Remains in the Sandstone Qiiarries. — There have been 
found at the Berrylaw and North Urquhart quarries many large 
fossils of the three kinds already named as occurring in the coal- 
formation, the Lepidodendron, the Stigmaria Ficoides, and the 
Sigillaria. The writer lately obtained a very excellent specimen 
of the first of these, about 3 feet in length, and one in diameter; 
and two of the third, one having three branches, the stem and one 
branch of which are 2 feet, and the other, having two branches, 
the stem and one branch of which are foot long, and both 
about 8 inches in diameter. The bark, which is turned into coal, 
still retains in all of these in some places the black coally struc- 
ture and substance. On the east side of the Berrylaw rock, and 
completely imbedded in it, is a large root of the Sigillaria, about 
4 feet high, nearly upright, apparently standing where it grew, 
b\it probably, according to the more prevalent opinion of geolo- 
gists, transported from its native site by the inundation of some 
river, and meeting with an obstacle, deposited in its present posi- 
tion, the sedimentary matter of the agitated waters accumulating 
around it, as well as replacing its own inner substance, which, it is 
well known, in all fossil trees decayed first, and now forming the 
sandstone. 

In the adjoining North Urquhart rock there was lately seen 
closely imbedded in it the stem or branch of a fossil tree, 6 or 8

feet long-, and 7 or 8 inches in diameter, lying horizontally, and 
about 40 feet from the surface. 

Quarrymen are not fond of meeting with these fossil remains, 
smce, wherever they occur, there are generally cracks, technically 
called dries, which prevent long blocks being taken out. 

It is the remark of an old observant quarryman that he has al- 
ways found the Lepidodendron lowest in the rock, then the Stig- 
maria, and the Sigillaria highest, and that near the last, the rock 
IS m an unsolid loose state ; and farther, that he has never seen a 
root penetrating a layer of earthy matter lying between two beds 
of stone, while he has noticed it passing through two contiguous 
beds not so separated. 

Petrifactions have been found also in the Pittencrieff quarry, 
and particularly a species of Stigmaria, which is thought to be 
undescribed. 

At Millhills quarry, too, there have been got impressions of 
Spirifers and Pecten papyraceus, Producta on bituminous shale, 
Corbula sulcata in clay-ironstone, and Spirifera bisulcata. 

The principal specimens of these fossil remains which have 
been noticed are to be seen in the New Museum of the Highland 
and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Edinburgh. 

Composition of Hills and Plains.— The hills are generally com- 
posed of greenstone, as is the case in those of Craigluscar and 
Roscobie. The Hill of Beath, adjoining to the Halbeath Col- 
liery, some of the minerals under which belong to the Marquis of 
Tweeddale, and are leased by the Halbeath Company, is com- 
posed of greenstone, and must have been projected after the coal- 
strata. For, when the workings were carried under the hill, the 
strata were observed to rise towards the centre, or rent, through 
which the greenstone must have been projected. 

In the high grounds and plains, at least so far as the coal-for- 
mation extends, there are alternate beds of sandstone and blaes or 
slate-clay, with balls of ironstone in it. Bituminous shale and 
indurated or fire-clay frequently intervene, but the first two com- 
pose the greatest part of the strata above the coal, and are found 
in beds, varying from 1 foot to 20 feet in thickness, and to the 
depth of from 20 to 100 fathoms before reaching the lowest seam 
of coal, under which sandstone of different colours and textures 
more generally prevails, to the depth of 50 or 60 fathoms, until 
it reach the limestone.

tent, pervades the whole coal-field of the Earl of Elgin, in thin 
bands and balls, and was once wrought to the extent of 4000 to 
5000 tone per annum. But the working of it was discontinued 
about eight or nine years ago, as a remunerating price could not 
be obtained for it, on account of the low price of pig-iron, and 
has not since been resumed. Copper-pyrites, in small quantities, 
is found imbedded in the clay-ironstone with carbonate of lime 
at the Elgin Colliery, - There is a thin seam of argillaceous iron- 
stone in the Wellwood, Town Hill, and Halbeath Coal-fields, 
but in all of these it is of an inferior quality, and not sufficiently 
abundant to render it workable to a profit. It occurs both in veins 
and nodules at the Townhill Colliery. It is also found in blaes 
while tirring for lime at the Charleston and Northern Limestone 
Quarries. 

Iron-pyrites is likewise sometimes met with in the roof of the 
parrot- coal at Halbeath Colliery. Neither the extracting nor 
purifying of ores is practised in the parish. Some beds of sand- 
stone at the Elgin Collieries contain strong impregnations of alum. 
Quartz and calcareous spar are found imbedded, and in veins, in 
the trap-rock at the Town Hill Colliery. Garnets occur in the 
boulders of mica-slate scattered in that neighbourhood. 

Alluvial Deposites. — At the Elgin Colliery the' alluvial cover 
above the sandstone is composed of clay, mixed with sand and 
small rounded stones, and frequently of fragments of the different 
strata under it. In the working coal-field it varies in thickness 
from 6 to 18 feet. It is impervious to water, and never produces 
water of itself. Peat in some instances forms part of the alluvial 
cover. 

At the Wellwood Colliery the alluvial cover is from 6 to 90 
feet in thickness, consisting of clay, sand, and large blocks of 
quartz, greenstone, and other materials. As none of these rocks 
are in the immediate neighbourhood, the blocks must have been 
transported from some of the hills by water. 

At the Townhill Colliery the alluvial cover, in the higher parts 
of the ground, consists of a stiff tenacious clay, intermixed with 
rounded water-worn stones ; and in the lower and hollow parts, of 
a rich vegetable mould, approaching in some places to the nature 
of peat, under which the clay is again found, resting upon the rock, 
but much thinner. The covering varies from 3 to 9 feet in thick- 
ness. 

At Halbeath Colliery the alluvial cover is from 4 to 40 feet

in thickness : and at the Netherbeath Colliery it is about 18 feet 
where it is chiefly of a clayey nature, ' 
No remains of plants or animals are known to have been met 
with in any of these alluvial deposites. 

Soil and BouIders.~The land towards the north of the town 
where the collieries are situated, is generally of inferior quality', 
but some portions of it are good, and others, from being much im- 
proved by draining, yield a fair produce. The soil in that quarter 
vanes from a few inches to 2 or 3 feet in thickness, and chiefly 
rests on till, but some of it, especially near Lathalmond, where 
the lime-quarry is, reposes on trap, sandstone, or limestone. 

The land towards the south of the town, in which are some of 
the sandstone quarries that have been mentioned, and the Charles- 
ton lime-work, is of excellent quality, in high cultivation, and 
capable of bearing all sorts of crops. The soil there consists 
chiefly of a brown loam, resting on rotten trap ; but a portion of it 
is of a light nature, on strong clay, not far from the surface.

There are no forests. The plantations cover about 900 Scotch 
acres, and are chiefly on the Pitferrane and town properties ; the 
former to the west, and the latter to the north-east, of the burgh. 
The soil appears to be congenial to almost all sorts of timber, but 
not all equally so. The wood grown consists chiefly of larch and 
Scotch, fir, with a proportion of oak, beech, elm, plane, ash, and 
willow. 

II. — Civil History. 
Ancient and Modern Accounts, Maps, Plans, and Swveys, Sfc, 
of the Parish, — The most ancient and valuable document con- 
nected with the parish, in reference particularly to the Monastery 
which once flourished in it, is " The Auld Register," or the " Li- 
ber MonasteriidetDunfermlin," commonly called the Phartu- 
lary of Dunfermline. It is a large folio MS.volume, consisting of 169 
leaves of vellum, and has long been preserved in the Advocates 
Library at Edinburgh. It is known to have been there at the end 
of the seventeenth century ; but when the first Earl of Hadding- 
ton a celebrated antiquary, more than two centuries ago, used 
it, making a table of its contents, and taking numerous extracts 
from it, illustrative of the ancient tenures and forms of convey- 
ancing of Scotland, he does not state where the_ Register was then 
deposited. 

At the close of the last year 1842, this Chartulary was 
printed by the Bannatyne Club, as the joint contribution of seven 
of its members, under the editorial care of Cosmo Innes, Esq., 
advocate, extending, with appendices and tables of contents, to 
561 pages quarto. 

A table of the contents of two MS. registers is printed along 
with the Chartulary of Dunfermline, by the Bannatyne Club, 
from inventories in Lord Haddington's Collections, preserved in 
the Advocates' Library, and collated with the original volumes. 

A History of the Town and Parish of Dunfermline was pub- 
lished by the late Rev. John Fernie, one of the parochial minis- 
ters m 1815, in 8vo, which contains some useful statistical infor- 
mation, collected with much care and accuracy, applicable to that 
period. It is now out of print. 

Another History of Dunfermline from the earliest records down 
to 1828, the date of its publication, 12mo, was written by the late 

• Duke of Buckingham, Eurl Spencer, late Earl of Rosslyn, the Right Honour- 
able Thomas Grenville, late R. Fergusson of Raith, Esq., James Loch. Esq., and 
John Richardson, Esq. London. ' i ' i , u .vi

Mr A. Mercer, author of « Dunfermline Abbey," a poem, witli 
historical illustrations, published in 1819, of a collection of verses 
In 1838, and of some fugitive pieces which appeared in the « North 
British Magazine" in 1804, of which he was for the short period 
of fourteen months editor, and in other periodicals, and who died 
m Dunfermhne only last July 1842; a man whose abilities, edu- 
cation, and literary taste, had they been steadily directed to one 
definite object of pursuit in life, might, with his inoffensiveness of 
disposition, have secured for him a higher estimation, and better 
fortune than unhappily distinguished his latter days. 

There was published also in his name, a large, « Historical and 
Chronological Table of the ancient town of Dunfermline, from 
1064 to 1834," on a large sheet, which is an abridgement of an 
elaborate, valuable, and beautifully written MS. quarto volume, 
pp. 422, entitled, « Annals of Dunfermline from the earliest Re- 
cords to 1833," and which was kindly prepared for his benefit by 
the author, E. Henderson, LL.D., F. R. A. S. 

In the Advocates' Library are preserved twelve vols. 4to, 
bound, of the MS. collections of the late Lieutenant General 
Henry Hutton of the Royal Artillery, who for many years was en- 
gaged in obtaining materials for a Monasticon Scotice, an account 
of all the monastic institutions in this country, but who died June 
1827 before executing his purpose. 

The earliest map of the parish, of which I am aware, is con- 
tained in a map of the sheriffdome of FyfTe, by Mr James Gordon, 
parson of Rothiemay, published in 1645. This was prepared from' 
the papers of the famous geographer, Mr Timothy Pont, who 
took the bearings of the county, and executed draughts not only 
of it, but of most of the parts of North Britain and its isles. The 
papers, after his death, came into the possession of Mr Gordon's 
father, the learned Sir Robert Gordon of Sfcraloch, through Sir 
John Scot of Scotstarvet, who not only recovered them, when 
nearly lost or destroyed through carelessness, but supplied their 
defects. The map is part of « Bleau's Atlas of Scotland." 

A Plan of the town of Dunfermline was published in 1823, 
from an actual survey by J. Wood, Edinburgh ; and a map of the 
parish included, in a very large and excellent one of the counties 
of Fife and Kinross, was published in 1828, by Messrs Sharp, 
Greenwood, and Fouler, London, which was republished with 
improvements in 1841 by Mr Frazr, Cupar Fife.

Parochial Registers.— These consist of 19 folio volumes, the 
first 6 of which contain registers of baptisms and marriages jointly, 
and of the remaining 13, there are 9 of baptisms and 4 of mar- 
riages, separately. With the exception of a blank in the mar- 
riages from 1745 to 1730, they are continuous from 16th July 
1561, the date of the first entry, to the present period. Where 
the baptisms and marriages are recorded together, the latter are 
on the margin. Some of the old volumes are beautifully written, 
and the ink is black and still retains its shining quality. 

There is a register of deaths from 1617 to 1657, small quarto, 
very distinctly and beautifully written. It was recovered by me 
very lately from a person into whose hands it had shortly before 
accidentally come. It had evidently been at one time in the pos- 
session of one of my predecessors, but it had afterwards passed 
from him to others not officially connected with the parish, and 
seems to have been altogether lost sight of. 

A very accurate register of burials has been kept in a folio vo- 
lume since 1833. The superintendent of the churchyard takes 
charge of it. 

The kirk-session records consist of 11 folio volumes. The first 
regular entry on them is dated the last day of June 1640. The 
minutes for the first 45 years are very neatly and distinctly writ- 
ten, apparently, too, in the same hand, but abound in contractions. 
With the exception of a blank between 1689 and 1701, the vo- 
lumes are continuous to the present period. 

All these registers and records are well bound, lettered, and 
dated on the back, and in good preservation. 

Antiquities — King Malcolm Canmore's Tower. — All that now 
remains of this ancient edifice is a connected angle, or fragment 
of the south and west walls : the length of the former of which is 
31, and of the latter, 44 feet. The south wall, in 1790, was 49

feet. Their present height is about 8 feet. They have been of 
great thickness, but all the hewn stones are removed from them. 
Apparently the lower part of the ancient tower, when entire, was 
about 50 feet broad, from north to south, and 60 from east to west, 
so that the building must have been nearly square. It is about 70 
feet above the level of the rivulet below. 

The date of this building is uncertain, but it is supposed to be as 
ancient as the middle of the eleventh century, probably between 
1056 and 1070. 

From the nature of the ground, the tower or castellated palace 
of Malcolm III. could not have been a very spacious edifice, and 
if an idea of its structure can be formed from the coarse fragment 
which remains, it must have been of a very simple kind. Still, 
here were married, and lived in conjugal affection, this famous 
monarch and his excellent queen, Margaret. 

Palace. — A little to the south-east of King Malcolm Canmore's 
Tower, and east side of the rivulet close to the verge of the glen, 
in a very romantic situation, are the ruins of a palace, once the re- 
sidence of the sovereigns of Scotland. Only the south-west wall, 
and a small portion of the eastern end of the edifice remain. The 
wall which overlooks the glen is 205 feet in length, and 60 in 
height outside, supported by 8 buttresses. The depth from the 
sole of the window in the recess on the first floor is 31 feet. At 
the western end tradition still points out a high window, now com- 
pletely covered with ivy, and the chimney, nearly entire, of the 
room in which that ill-advised and unfortunate monarch, Charles 
the First, was born, which event occurred on the 19th November 
1600. This, too, was the birth-place of his sister Elizabeth, on 
the 19th August 1596, afterwards Queen of Bohemia, from whom 
her present Majesty is descended. 

Near the south-eastern extremity of this massive wall, there is 
m the ceiling of a high and projecting oriel window, the third from 
the end, a large antique piece of sculpture, quite visible from be- 
low, which was discovered in 1812, when some repairs were made 
on the palace ; and of which an excellent cast was taken about 
three years ago, now in my possession. It contains in bas-relief a 
well executed carving in stone of the passage in the first chap- 
ter of St Luke's gospel, usually termed the Annunciation. There 
is a representation of the angel Gabriel with outspread wings, 
and of the Virgin Mary in a devotional attitude, facing each other. 

The angel holds in his right hand, which is very unusual, a scourge

or lash, the emblem probably of discipline, and in his left a scroll 
proceeding towards the Virgin, on which is inscribed part of the 
salutation to her in large old Roman capitals, " Ave gratia plena 
Dns. Tec." {Dominus Tecum, " Hail full with favour, the Lord 
be with you." Before the Virgin is a table with an open book on 
it, containing her answer, also in Latin, and with some abbrevia- 
tions. The words are not very legible on the cast, but having 
seen them as taken in 1812 by a zealous antiquary of that day, I 
can partly trace them, and am satisfied that they are all there, al- 
though the space is but small. They are in small Roman capi- 
tals, as exhibited in the engraving, and are as follows : Ecce ancilla 
di  domini.J Fiat michi  mihij S. V. T.  secundum verbum tu- 
um, " Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it unto me ac- 
cording to thy word." At the top is a human head and face with 
a crown of glory, the emblem of God the Father, and tq the left, 
a dove, the symbol of the Spirit, descending amid rays of light, 
proceeding from him upon the head of the Virgin. In front of 
the table before the Virgin is a pot with a lily in it, the emblem 
of purity, and the usual accompaniment of the Virgin, and in front 
of it again, at the lower centre of the stone, is a coat armorial, 
consisting of a shield bearing a cheveron between three crescents. 
The arms are those of the Dury family, ancient possessors of the 
lands of Dury in F'ife, in the reign of Alexander II., and of whom 
George Dury, a descendant, was the last abbot and perpetual com- 
mendator of the abbey of Dunfermline, and arch-dean of St An- 
drews at the Reformation, and for about twenty years previous. 

At the bottom of the whole device is the date 1100, in Arabic 
numerals, the cyphers being of the form of diamonds, and before 
it is some contracted word not easily legible on the cast, which has 
hitherto been given as CHI. the abbreviation for Christi ; but the 
probability is that it is XPI. the Greek letters, which are the 
usual contraction for the name of our Lord. 

The date 1100 has given great trouble to antiquaries. The 
question is, whether this date was engraven at the time specified, 
and whether it be meant to indicate the period when the palace was 
built. From various considerations, my own opinion is, thatthestone 
in its present state could not have been sculptured at that period. 
As to the time of its execution, my conjecture is, that it was at 
the close of the reign of James V. and the commencement of the 
abbotship of George Dury, probably between 1539 and 1541, and 
perhaps contemporaneous with the execution of the coat of arms, 



DUNFERMLINE. 851 

just noticed, of that monarch and his second queen soon after their 
marriage. The date 1100, too, may have been put upon it, as 
the then reputed age of the older part of the palace, which in that 
case would be built by King Edgar, son of Malcolm III., whose 
reign was rather peaceful. 

This opinion of the antiquity of this part of the edifice, as well 
as of the addition made to it by James IV., was expressed also by 
the heritors of the parish, and magistrates and council of the 
town, in a memorial presented in 1836 to the Commissioners of 
Woods and Forests. 

But as no ancient and authoritative historical or other document 
is known to exist, fixing the age of the palace, it must still, it is 
to be feared, remain iu some obscurity. 

Subterraneous Passoffe.—Neav the north-west corner in the 
north wall there is an aperture, which was originally about 4 feet 
high by 2i wide, but from the accumulation of the earth on the 
floor of the cellar, the height is now only 2 feet. This is the 
entrance to a long dark subterraneous passage, with various off- 
shoots, and having a total length of about 100 feet. Not satisfied 
with some of the accounts and conjectures current concerning it, 
I resolved to make a personal exploration, which, with the aid of 
competent persons, was done early in January 1843. 

Ueen's IIouse.-Tbk building was adjacent to the palace, on 
the north-east, and communicated with it by a gallery. It stood 
in the centre of the street to the north of the present arched or 
pended gateway, and reached near to the great west door of the 
churcn. It was so named as having been erected, or at least re- 
stored by Queen Anne of Denmark, and having been her perso- 
nal property during life, and not a mere jointure house to which 
she had a title on the demise of her husband. 

Immediately to the north of the Queen's House stood the Con- 
stabulary House, or residence of the Constable of the Royal Edi-

Pended Tower is a massive oblong building, connecting the 
Monastery with the Palace, and elegantly arched or pended be- 
neath, forming a gateway across the street, from which circum- 
stance it is commonly called the Pends from pendeo, to hang, 
What remains of it is 47 feet in height, 35 in length from north 
to south, 16 in breadth at the northern, and I85 at the southern 
arch. There had been a gate at the former one. The archway 
is groined with central ornamented keystones, and strong ribbed 
arches, and the windows present a fine specimen of the pointed 
and rounded style of architecture. 

Abbey Old Church. — This is all that remains of the ancient and 
large ecclesiastical edifice of this place, spared from the ravages 
committed first by the English in the fourteenth century, and 
afterwards by the Reformers in their zeal against Popery. 

This part of the building formed the nave of the Abbey Church 
when completed, or the vestibule or passage to the principal por- 
tion of it, where the choir was, as it now does to the new place of 
worship. 

Ancient Eastern Church. — The length of the choir or ancient 
eastern church within walls to supposed Lady Aisle, was 100 feet, 
and to supposed great altar 90 feet ; its breadth, clear of the co- 
lumns, 20 feet, and with these and side aisles, 55 feet. The length 
of the transepts was 115, and their breadth 73 feet. The ex- 
treme length of the whole ancient ecclesiastical edifice outside 
was 275 feet, and its extreme breadth 130. 

Till 1818, there were standing four very tall and beautiful Go- 
thic windows, which formed part of the north wall of the north 
transept of the Abbey, but which were removed at the commence- 
ment of the building of the New Church in that year. 

Royal Tombs. — It is well known that the celebrated lona or 
Icolmkill, in the Western Isles, was originally, and, for many cen- 
turies, the place of royal sepulture. But if the testimony of Boece 
can be credited on this point, as it has generally been, Malcolm 
III. changed it to Dunfermline, appointing the church which he 
had built there to be thenceforth the common cemetery of the 
kinos of Scotland. It is certain, too, from other and older au- 
tliorities, as the Chronicon de Mailros, Chronicon de Lanercost, 
Fordun, and Winton, that Dunfermline church was so used from 
the time of Malcolm III., during many succeeding reigns. At 



DUNFERMLINE. 853 

present, all that remains, perceptible by the eye, of this ancient 
and once splendid royal burying-place, is the tombstone of Queen 
or St Margaret, already noticed, which is a large horizontal slab 
of coarse blue marble or limestone, in two tiers, about three feet 
above the surface, at the east end of the new church, outside, co- 
vering the spot in which, it is understood, were once deposited not 
only her remains, but those of her husband, Malcolm III. There 
are to be seen on it six indentures, which, tradition says, are the 
prints of candlesticks, in which candles were kept burning; and, 
it is added, that a proprietor in Fife, at Pitilloch, in Falkland pa- 
rish, once paid an impost for lighting them. 

Besides Malcolm III., his Queen Margaret, and their eldest 
son, Prince Edward, named by Winton Edward I., there were, 
according to different authors, interred at Dunfermline, the fol- 
lowing royal and distinguished personages : — Edward, eldest son 
of Malcolm III.; King Edgar; Alexander I. ; David I.; Mal- 
colm IV.; Malcolm, Earl of Athole and his Countess, in the 
reign of William the Lion ; Alexander III., and Margaret, his 
first Queen ; David and Alexander, his sons ; Robert I., and Eli- 
zabeth his Queen ; Mathildis, their daughter ; Annabella Drum- 
mond, Queen of Robert III., and mother of James 1. ; Constan- 
tine and William Ramsay, Earls of Fife; Thomas Randolph, 
Earl of Murray, nephew of Robert I., Regent of Scotland during 
the minority of David II. ; Robert, Duke of Albany, and Earl of 
Fife and Menteith, Governor of Scotland. 

It may be proper to answer a very natural inquiry which is often 
put. What evidence is there for believing that King Robert Bruce 
was interred here  It is gratifying to think, that the evidence for 
this fact is clear, varied, and strong. 

In the first place, the King himself selected Dunfermline as the- 
place of his sepulture. For it appears from the Chartulary of 
Dunfermline that he gave the church of Kinross and chapel of 
Urwell to the monastery of Dunfermline, not only in honour of 
his predecessors buried in it, but on account of his own sepulture, 
which, it is said, " I have specially chosen among them ;" and 
again, " he chose his own interment to be among the kings of 
Scotland, in the honourable monastery of Dunfermline."t Then 
Barbour and Fordun, two of our earliest chroniclers, record that 
he had been buried here, and in what may be presumed, the very

spot now discovered, Barbour gives the following account of the 
funeral : — 

 " I hop that nane that is on lyvc 

The lamentacioun suld discryve-f- 
That that folk for thair lard maid.J 
And quheti thai lang thus sorrowit had. 
Thai haifFhad him to Dimferlyne 
And him solemply erdyt§ syne 
In a fayr tumb, intill the quer.

Was done as thai couth best dewiss : 
And syne, on the tothyr day, 
Sary and wa ar went thair way, 
And he debowaillyt was clcnly, 
And bawmyt syne richly."" 

Fordnn, too, who wrote after Barbour, and who acknowledges 
the excellence of his work, says, that " the King was interred at 
the monastery of Dunfermline, in the middle of the choir, with 
due honour.''tt And farther, as quoted by Morton, in his Monas- 
tic Annals of Teviotdale, p. 232, " magnificently interred under 
the grand altar of the church of Dunfermline Abbey."J| Both 
these early writers mention the choir, and the latter, the middle 
of it, as the situation of his grave, and the spot found precisely 
corresponds with this, as far as the form of the ancient building can 
be ascertained, for it is in a line with the exact centre of the Ab- 
bey Church. 

Farther, it is well known that Bruce, in the view of his approach- 
ing dissolution, which took place at Cardross, near Dumbarton, 
on the 7th June 1329, from a severe disease, then termed leprosy, 
at the age of fifty-five, in the twenty-fourth year of his arduous 
and glorious reign, reckoning from his coronation at Scone, took 
a pledge from his faithful friend Sir James Douglas to carry his 
heart, on his decease, to Jerusalem, and humbly to deposit it in 
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre there, as the only mode which 
he then had of fulfilling a vow, which he had made as soon as he 
restored the peace and freedom of his kingdom, to undertake an 
expedition to the Holy Land against the enemies of the Christian 
faith. This pledge, the gallant knight, on the demise of his be-

II Assoilzeit. As King Robert was excommunicated by the Pope, for the murder 
of Cuming in DumJries, on account of treachery, so far back as 1305, his body could 
not receive the accustomed rites and ceremonies of what was then deemed " Christian 
burial" in consecrated ground, till this sentence was removed by ecclesiastical authority. 
This may explain what if here referred to by the poet. Some authors, however, stale

loved master, immediately went to redeem, along with a numerous 
retinue, bearing the heart of the monarch enclosed in a silver 
casket, suspended from his neck by a silver chain. But, in pass- 
ing through Spain, in his progress to Jerusalem, he assisted Al- 
phonso, the young King of Leon and Castile, against the Sara- 
cens, and after exhibiting feats of valour, he fell in battle, when 
bis body, with the casket and its precious contents, were conveyed 
to Scotland, under the charge of Sir William Keith, one of his 
surviving companions. His remains were interred in the Church 
of Douglas, the sepulchre of his forefathers, and the heart of Bruce 
was entombed in Melrose Abbey, by the Earl of Moray, then 
Regent of Scotland, 

Now, in order to carry into execution this object, it behoved 
the body of Bruce to be embalmed, and accordingly it exhibited 
full evidence of having been so, as the metrical account also of the 
funeral by Barbour, just quoted, states that it was. 

The sternum or breast-bone was found sawed asunder longitu- 
dinally from top to bottom, according to the awkward mode adopt- 
ed by the anatomists of those days, for reaching the heart, with 
the view of complying with the sovereign's dying command, and a 
.small box was discovered in the vicinity, supposed by some to con- 
tain the entrails. 

The whole appearances, too, of the tomb and body, as described, in- 
dicate them to have been those of a person of high consideration, while, 
in the immediate neighbourhood, were found numerous fragments 
of fine white and black marble well polished, carved and gilt, in 
all probability the remains of a monument which had been erected 
over the grave inside the church, and which had been demolished 
at the destruction of the Abbey. Some of these exhibit small 
ornamental columns, and one of them an animal in a reclining 
posture. Along with a few of these in the Antiquarian Museum, 
Edinburgh, found long prior to the discovery of Bruce's tomb, 
and erroneously labelled as having belonged to the tomb of Mal- 
com Canmore, there is a small head, cut in soft bluish stone, 
seemingly calm stone, the same as what many of the other orna- 
ments are made of, with a crown on it. The face is unfortunately 
destroyed, but there are large curls at each ear, of the form and 
style seen in the coins of Robert the Bruce, so that there is every 
probability that this was meant to represent his head. From the 
Chamberlain Rolls, too, it appears that the king himself had or- 
dered, during his long and tedious illness, such a monument to be

erected ; tliat it was of a very splendid nature, and that, proba- 
bly from its being beyond the skill of the artists of this country at 
that period, it had been been executed in Paris, and conveyed 
hitherto by the way of Bruges. 

What would have completed this body of evidence to us would 
have been a plate with an actual inscription, signifying that this 
was the tomb of Bruce ; but the probability is, that such a plate 
made of brass, as was then common, with an inscription round the 
edge, had been upon the monument, and carried oflF at the plun- 
der of the abbey, or destroyed. 

Fordun has preserved Bruce's epitaph, which it is likely was 
inscribed upon the tomb, and which I have not seen before quoted. 

It is this — 

" hic jacet invictus robertus, rex benedictus, 
Qui sua gesta legit, repetit quot bella peregit. 
Ad libertatem perduxit, per probitatem, 

ReGNUM ScOTORUM ; nunc VIVAT in ARCE POLORUM."t 

King Robert Bruce's Sword and Helmet. — These interesting 
relics are at Broomhall House, about three miles south from the 
town. In the Scots Magazine for 1781, there is an engraving of 
them, along with the following description : — " They are of steel, 
and they have acquired a clear blackish colour from age. The 
sword is a two-handed one, and the handle is covered with black 
leather. Both the sword and the helmet were presented by King 
Robert's son, King David Bruce, to his cousin Sir Robert Bruce 
of Clackmannan, and they have been preserved in Clackmannan 
Castle by the descendants of this Sir Robert, with the greatest 
veneration, till the present time. Though there be no written 
documents to instruct the sword and helmet having been presented 
to Sir Robert Bruce, yet the above account has the sanction of 
the universal tradition of the family and of the country around." 

They are now in the possession of the Earl of Elgin and Kin- 
cardine, having along with the genealogical family tree, dated 
1686, which contains a lengthened history of the descent of the 

 A well-executed and appropriate plate, bearing the appearances of antiquity, was 
found at the grave, after the re-interment of Bruce, but it was satisfactorily ascertained 
not to be ancient. It was the doing of a few individuals, as a jca d'csprii, which would 
have been harmless enough, had it been acknowledged shortly after producing its in- 
tended effect.

family, but from its worm-eaten condition now scarcely legible 
been bequeathed to the late Earl at the end of the last century, 
by Katharine Bruce, widow of Henry Bruce, Esq., last proprietor 
of Clackmannan, and direct representative of that very ancient 
and distinguished house. There is also the nuptial bed of Queen 
Anne of Denmark, at Broomhall House, and her amry at Logie 
House. 

Mr PatorCs Collection of Antiquities. — This collection is most 
interesting and valuable, and, perhaps of the kind, unequalled by 
any in Scotland, in the hands of a private collector. It consists 
of several curious and ancient pieces of furniture, believed to have 
belonged fo Dunfermline Palace, along with others from Holy- 
rood, Linlithgow, Stirling, and Falkland Palaces, Lochleven Cas- 
tle, &amp;c., collected by Mr Joseph N, Paton, and contained in his 
cottage in Wooer's Alley, situated at the head of a deep ravine 
towards the north-west of the town. Some articles from this pa- 
lace, which once belonged to the collection, were procured from 
him some years ago, for his late Majesty George IV. 

Monastery, — The monastery of Dunfermline is generally be- 
lieved to have been founded by King Malcolm III., towards the 
end of the eleventh century. The authority for this rests on King 
David's confirmations of his father's grants, recorded in the Char- 
tulary, as well as on the fact, of which evidence has been produced 
of Malcolm having built a church here, which itself is sometimes 
styled the Monastery. 

The monastery was dedicated to the Holy Trinity ; and Queen 
Margaret, who died in 1093, was afterwards raised to the rank of 
tutelar saint.

In 1593 the Abbacy was perpetually annexed to the Crown. 

The Abbey long enjoyed a high celebrity, partly on account of 
its preserving the relics of St Margaret, the tutelar saint, and of 
its being the place of royal sepulture, and partly from the magni- 
tude and splendour of its buildings, and its great wealth. It 
seems to have attained its highest repute about the middle and 
close of the 13th century, during the long and prosperous reign 
of Alexander III., when it had become one of the most mag- 
nificent and opulent monastic establishments in Scotland. In- 
deed, Matthew of Westminster, an English historian of that 
period, says, in regard to its extent, that its limits were so ample 
as to contain within its precincts three carucates of land, or as 
much arable ground as could be tilled with three ploughs in a 
year, and so many princely edifices, that three distinguished

sovereigns, with their retinue, miofht be accommodated with 
lodgings at the same time, without inconvenience to one an- 
other. 

Of its wealth we may form an idea, when it is mentioned, that 
almost the whole of the lands in the western, and part of those 
in . the southern and eastern districts of Fife, various lands in 
other counties, and at one time the barony of Musselburgh then 
denominated Musselburghshire, in Mid- Lothian, belonged to it. 
This last place, however, was afterwards separated from it, and 
converted into a distinct lordship, in favour of the Lord Chan- 
cellor Thirlestane. The following are some of the remote places 
from which its ample revenues were derived, conferred either by 
Scottish sovereigns or opulent subjects, clerical or lay, at various 
periods, from motives of gratitude or piety : — Kildun, near Ding-

The cells or priories of Urquhart and Pluscardine, in Moray- 
shire, and of Coldingham in Berwickshire, anciently belonged to 
the monastery of Dunfermline. 

_ Privilege of Regalihj.—T\\e abbey possessed the very important 
right or privilege of a free regality, that is, had an exclusive civil 
and criminal jurisdiction over the occupiers of lands belonging to 
it. 

The civil jurisdiction of the regality was equivalent to that of 
a sheriff, but its criminal was royal, having power of life and death. 
The abbot, as the Lord of regality, did not usually preside in the 
court himself, but he appointed a bailie to officiate for him, who 
could try capital offences. And such was the power of tiie ab- 
bot's court, that if any accused per'son, residing within the terri- 
tory of the regality, were taken to another court, the abbot could, by 



DUNFERMLINE. 



861 



himself or procurator, appear before that other court, however high, 
even of the King's justiciar, and repledge, as it was called, or ju- 
dicially demand back the delinquent to be tried before the tribunal 
of his own district. As early as the reign of Da.vid L, offenders, 
within the territories of the abbey are declared to be amenable 
only to the court of the Holy Trinity and the abbot of Dunferm- 
line. James II., at the instance of abbot Richard Bothwell, 
exempted the abbey from the obligation of appearing before 
his courts in Fife and Clackmannan, by reason of the lands of 
Luscreviot and Dollar, which belonged to it, and he granted a 
letter, empowering the abbey to repledge any inhabitants of these 
lands, detained by his courts to the court, of regality, in 1449. 
This baneful privilege, it would appear, had been extended to a 
particular family of the name of Makaroun or Kynmacaroun ; 
but, in consequence of the murmurs of the country, and for brid- 
ling the multitude of transgressors pretending to be of the same 
race, the King found it expedient to abolish this power possessed 
by the monastery in their case. However he removed the restric- 
tion in 1459. 

At the Reformation, in 1560, the peculiar power of Regality, 
possessed by the monastery, did not cease. It only passed into 
other hands, those of influential noblemen, who also received much 
of the temporal property of the extruded monks. 

The jurisdiction in question, along with the lands of the mona- 
stery, first devolved on Robert Pitcairn, archdean of St Andrews, 
who held them in commendam, or trust, and who afterwards be- 
came Secretary of State to James VI. 

In 1580, four years before the decease of this person, when he 
had reached an advanced age, he and the convent of Dunfermline 
created the office of Heritable Bailie of the Regality, and by char- 
ter, dated 15th November of that year, conferred it on David 
Durie of Durie, the nephew, it is supposed, of George, the for- 
mer abbot, and who had previously exercised the office of regality 
bailie under the abbot, but without any written title to it, and his 
heirs-male in fee, and in inheritance for ever. 

In 1596, David Durie, the original bailie, with consent of his 
eldest son and heir-apparent, resigned his office and its emolu- 
ments into the hands of Queen Anne, as lady of Dunfermline, in 
favour of, and for new infeftment of the same, to be made and- 
granted to Alexander Seton, President of the Court of Session, 
by the title of Lord Urquhart, afterwards Earl of Dunfermline.

civil and criminal jurisdiction.

Memorable Historical Events.— Only a few of these can be 
briefly noticed. 

The Chartulary records one important fact respecting the ho- 
mage formerly claimed by England from the Scottish Kmgs. It 
is a deed " concerning the homage which Alexander III., Kmg 
of Scots, paid to Edward I., King of England, for his lands which 
he held in the kingdom of England." This was in 1278. 

Edward 1. visited Dunfermline in 1291, 1296, 1303, and 1304. 
In 1303, he took up his winter quarters here, where he was 
joined by his Queen and a part of his nobility, and employed 
himself in receiving the submission of those Scottish barons 
and great men who had not made their peace during his pro- 
gress througli-the kingdom in 1296. It was at this period, also, 
previous to his departure, which, according to some, took place in 
February, and others in March following, that his soldiers, doubt- 
less by his orders or with his approbation, shewed their gratitude 
for the ample and magnificent accommodation which they had so 
long enjoyed here, by setting fire to the Abbey, whereby it was 
reduced to a shadow of what it formerly was. 

On the 4th March 1323, Robert Bruce had a son born to him 
in Dunfermline, when the palace must have been in some degree 
repaired, who, after a long minority, ascended the throne under 
the title of David II. 

In 1385, a large body of Frenchmen were lodged in Dunferm- 
line, as there were in some other inland towns, as Queensferry, 
Kelso, Dunbar, and Dalkeith, Edinburgh not being able to accom- 
modate them all, on the occasion of John de Vienne, the famous 
admiral of France, having come over to this country in the reign 
of Robert II., in consequence of an application from the Scots to 
the regency of the French King, Charles VI., with a great number 
of knights and others, the flower of the French army, and of private 
soldiers, to assist the Scots in the invasion of England. 

On this occasion, too, Froissart mentions that Richard II. of 
England having burned Edinburgh, " he and his Lords went to 
Dunfermline, a tolerably handsome town, where is a large and 
fair abbey of black monks, in which the Kings of Scotland have 
been accustomed to be buried. The King was lodged in the ab- 
bey, but after his departure, the army seized it and burnt both 
that and the town." Hume says, generally, that the King ' treat-

ed in the same manner Perth, Dundee, and other places in the 
low countries." 

On the 28th January 1581, the Second Coi fession of Faith, 
sometimes called Craig's Confession of Faith, because drawn up 
by John Craig, or the King's Confession, because signed by him, 
or the First National Covenant of Scotland, and which is em- 
bodied in all the subsequent National Covenants entered into by 
the Scottish Church and people, was subscribed by James VI. 
and all his household, at Dunfermline. 

Between 1.582 and 1585, three Danish ambassadors of noble 
birth, and splendidly attended, arrived in Scotland, and were in- 
troduced to King James VI., at Dunfermline, where they con- 
gratulated his Majesty, in the King their master's name, with a 
long discourse of the old amity bond, and mutual friendship, be- 
tween the two kings, and their kingdoms. They also presented 
their claim, respecting the restoration of Orkney and Shetland to 
the Danish crown. 

In 1596, a Convention of the " Estates" was held here, for the 
purpose of recalling the Popish Lords, who had been banished for 
a conspiracy ; and the Princess Elizabeth was born at the palace, 
on the 1 9th August, first daughter of his Majesty, afterwards 
Queen of Bohemia, whose baptism the Convention appointed to 
take place at Holyroodhouse, on the 28th of November follow- 
ing. 

On 19th November 1600, King Charles I. was born here. 

In 1624, a great fire took place, which nearly consumed the 
town ; the houses, at that period, being almost entirely composed 
of wood, at least from the second story. Its ravages were chiefly 
on the north side of the ancient pillory, at the prison, to the east 
port. The town was reduced to such poverty by this calamity, 
that it was obliged to supplicate assistance from the community 
of Scotland at large. 

In 1638, during the months of March and April, m the reign 
of Charles I., the Covenant, as drawn up by Alexander Hender- 
son and Johnston of Warriston, was subscribed at Dunfermline, 
by the nobility, gentlemen, burgesses, and commons in the parish. 
The document containing it is still extant here, and is written on 
a very lare sheet of vellum parchment. Among the signatures 
are Dunfermlyne Charles Seton, Earl of Dunfermline ; Sir 
Robt. Halkett, Pitferrane ; James Durie, Cra.gluscar ; Robert 
Ged; R. Ged younger; Henry Wardlaw of Pitreavie ; Wilham

Wardlaw of Balmule; Johne Stanehouse, and Mr Samuel Row, 
then assistant minister at Dunfermline. 

In 1643, the Solemn League and Covenant, a mutual bond of 
union which had that year been entered into between England and 
Scotland, for the better protection of the Protestant religion, pre- 
vention of the spread and ascendency of Popery and Prelacy, and 
the preservation of the liberties of the kingdom in peace and unity, — 
a document which has been characterized by our latest church his- 
torian as " the noblest, in its essential nature and principles, of all 
that are recorded among the national transactions of the world," — 
was sworn and subscribed at Dunfermline, on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 
and 12th days of November of that year. This Covenant contains 
most of the signatures already mentioned as attached to the for- 
mer Covenant, with several new ones, among which are those of 
Mr Robert Kay, then minister at Dumbarton, and two years after- 
wards at Dunfermline, Robert Anderson, reader of God's word, 
and a great many more, many of them written in the same hand, 
probably for those who were unable to write. It is printed, and 
contained in a quarto bound book, having on one of the boards, 
" For the Kirk of Dunfermling." 

In 1645, the plague raged in the parish, and carried off num- 
bers, of which there are several notices in the kirk-session records. 

In 1650, Charles II., soon after his accession to the throne, on 
the decapitation of his father in January 1649, subscribed at Dun- 
fermline, with apparent, but only feigned, sincerity, a most re- 
markable declaration, confirmatory of his form6r oath to adhere 
to both covenants. This has been styled " The Dunfermline 
Declaration," and is dated 16th August 1650. 

In February 1651, there was a great dearth in Dunfermhne. 

In July 1651, a battle was fought near Pitreavie House in this 
parish, between the army of Cromwell and that of Charles II., 
when the former crossed the Frith at Queensferry, on their march 
northward to Perth, in order to cut off the royal resources from 
the King, then at Torwood, in the vicinity of Stirling, an engage- 
ment which in its consequences proved very disastrous to the Scots. 
It has been called " the Battle of Fife," and sometimes also, 
" the Battle of Inverkeithing," and " Battle of Pitreavie ;"— the 
first action having been fought near Inverkeithing, and then con- 
tinued up to Pitreavie, where the chief slaughter took place. 

The English soldiers, after their victory, indulged in many acts 
of annoying petty plunder.

1670. In the middle of June of this year, a conventicle or 
field-meeting was held at Beath-hill, partly in this parish, which 
produced a great sensation. It was kept by Mr John Blackadder, 
the ejected minister of Troqueer, and Mr John Dickson, the 
ejected minister of Rutherglen. 

On the 24th October 1715, about a month before the battle 
of Sheriffmuir, fought in the attempt of the old Pretender, James 
VIIL, to ascend the throne, there was a surprisal of a Jacobite 
detachment at Dunfermline. 

Eminent Persons. — Alexander Seton, first Earl of Dunfermline, a 
branch of the noble family of Seton, Earls of Winton. He was the 
fourth son of George, sixth Lord Seton, and was born about the 
year 1555. Queen Mary, who was his god-mother, presented to 
him, " ane god-bairne gift, the lands of Pluscarty in Moray." 

From the royal favour which he enjoyed on his own and his fa- 
ther's account, he was appointed on 27th January 1585, an Extra- 
ordinary Lord, by the style of Prior of Pluscardine, and on 16th 
February 1587, being then Baron of Urquhart, he was promoted 
to the place of an ordinary senator of the College of Justice, un- 
der the style of Lord Urquhart. He was created Earl of Dun- 
fermline in 1605, and admitted a member of the English Privy 
Council in 1609. He represented the Royal Person in the Par- 
liament held on 24th October 1612, wherein the obnoxious pre- 
latic acts of the General Assembly, held at Glasgow in June 1610, 
were ratified, and the act of Parliament 1592, establishing pres- 
byteries, is asserted to have been rescinded. In 1613 he built 
Pinkie House, near Musselburgh, or rather converted the old one, 
which was a country mansion belonging to the abbots of Dunferm- 
line, who were at an early period superiors of Musselburgh, into 
its present shape, on the front of which is the following inscription, 
now hid by a portico, as translated into English, and which seems 
to savour a little of vanity :— " Lord Alexander Seton built this 
house, not after the fashion of his mind, but after that of his for- 
tunes and estates, 1613." Here he died on the 16th June 1622, 
in the sixty-seventh year of his age, and was interred on the 19th 
July following, with all funeral solemnity, in his burial-place in a 
vault of the old parish church of Dalgety, now in ruins, on one of 
the small galleries of which were emblazoned the family arms. 

The Right Honourable James Abercromby, born 1776, Speaker 
of the House of Commons 1835-39, and third son of the gallant 
Sir Ralph Abercromby, who was killed at Aboukir in 1801, was 



DUNFERMI-INE. 



867 



created in 1839 a British Baron, by the title of " Lord Dunferm- 
line." 

Broomhall Family. — This family trace their origin to Robert 
de Brus, a kinght of Normandy, who came over to England with 
William the Conqueror, and claim to be the representatives of the 
male line of the illustrious house of Bruce, although the exact 
connection with the monarchy has been lost. The lands of Broom- 
hall, formerly Wester Gellet, about three miles south from the 
town of Dunfermline, appear to have been possessed, at the be- 
ginning of the seventeenth century, by Sir George Bruce of Car- 
nock, who gave them to his son Robert. Sir George, from whom 
the Elgin family is descended, in a direct male line, was the 
youngest of three sons of Edward Bruce of Blairhall, Esq., who 
lived in the reigns of James V. and Queen Mary. The eldest 
succeeded to Blairhall, which line ended in an heiress, Mary, who 
married one of the family of Stuarts of Bute, and died in 1759. 
Edward, the second son, was an eminent lawyer, and built the 
house now called the Abbey of Culross, so named from its being si- 
tuated near the old abbey or monastery. He was an ambassador to 
Queen Elizabeth in 1594, and was of much service to James VI., on 
his accession to the English throne. Having followed his royal 
master to England, he was made by him Master of the Rolls, and 
created Baron Bruce of Kinloss in 1603. His eldest son was 
killed in the duel with Sir Edward Sackville, and the son's heart 
is buried at Culross. 

The late Earl, Thomas Bruce, succeeded his brother Willia'm 
Robert, who enjoyed the title only two months, and died in the 
eighth year of his age, on the 15th July 1771. Earl Thomas 
was long one of the representative Peers of Scotland ; a lieutenant- 
general in the army ; a general of the Royal Archers of Scotland ; 
a family trustee of the British Museum"; and a member of the 
Privy Council. He was ambassador at Constantinople in 1799- 
1801, when, in his zeal for the 6ne arts, he rescued the marbles 
of the Parthenon at Athens from the destruction which awaited 
them, and secured them as an invaluable possession for Great 
Bntam Having been purchased from him by Government for 
about L.30,000-a sum, however, which it is understood was 
only about half of what they cost him-they have been perma- 
nently deposited in the British Museum, and bear the name of 
" The Elgm Marbles." His Lordship was a liberal patron, not 
only of the fine arts, but of science, literature, and antiquarian

researches. He established excellent schools at his lime and 
coal works, and was first president of the Mechanics' Institution 
in Dunfermline, as well as personally assisted at its formation. 
He was public spirited and enterprising, carrying, his local im- 
provements on his estate and works to an extent which embar- 
rassed his private fortune. He was liberal and free from selfishness 
in his charities ; and, in his private manners, happily blended the 
suavity of the private gentleman with the dignity of the nobleman. 
He died at Paris, on the I4th November 1841, in his 76th year, 
much regretted by his tenantry and work-people, by whom he 
was greatly esteemed. He is succeeded by his eldest son, by the 
second marriage, James, 8th Earl of Elgin, and 12th Earl of 
Kincardine, born 1811, a nobleman of very promising talents and 
character, at present Governor of Jamaica. 

Pitjirrane Famihj. — This is the most ancient ftimily resident 
in the parish, and has had many members eminent for their pub- 
lic services and private worth. The first mentioned of the family 
was David de Halket, proprietor of the lands of Lumphennans 
and Ballingall in Fife, who lived in the time of King David 
Bruce, whose son Philip, designed " Dominus de Ballingall et 
Lunfinnans," flourished in the reign of Robert H. and HI., and 
acquired the third part of the lands of Pitfirrane from his cousin, 
William de Scott de Balweary, in 1399. To the deed of con- 
veyance John de Torry, abbot of Dunfermline, and son of Philip, 
was a witness. The first of the family found to be designed by 
the title of Pitfirrane was David de Halket, grandson of Philip, 
and son of Robert, who was sheriff of Kinross in 1372. He is 
mentioned as early as 3d June 1404. 

The first members of the family that were knighted were two 
sons of George Halket, who lived in the reigns of Queen IVTary 
and King James VI. His eldest son, Robert, received the honour 
from King James VI., and was served heir to his father, in the 
lands of Pitfirrane, in 1595. A younger son, John, was knighted 
by the same prince ; and attaching himself to a military life, he 
entered the service of the States of Holland, rose to the rank of 
a colonel, and had the command of a Scots regiment in the 
Dutch service. He was likewise President of the Grand Court 
Marishall, in Holland. 

Anne, daughter of Mr Thomas Murray, Provost of Eton, and 
preceptor to Charles I., and second wife of Sir James Halket, 
knirhted at Dalkeith, I4th June 1633, was a lady of great

natural gifts, which she had diligently cultivated, and of decided 
religious and moral character. She was born in 1622, and, 
through her father's connection with royalty, was soon known at 
Court, where she was held in high esteem for her talents, pru- 
dence, amiableness, and benevolence, as well as strongr attachment 
to the royal family, to whom she made herself very serviceable. 
She was appointed, by King Charles I. and his Queen, first sub- 
governess, and afterwards, on the death of the Countess of Rox- 
burgh, governess to the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess 
Elizabeth. Immediately after the death of Charles I., she found 
it prudent to retire for a while from court to Scotland, and resided 
for some time in this town with the Earl and Countess of Dun- 
fermline, who always paid her great attention. Her scriptural 
knowledge and piety, as well as uncommon activity of mind, were 
her prominent excellencies, of which she has left substantial 
evidence in some writings still extant, particularly, « Meditations 
on the 25th Psalm ; Meditations and Prayers upon the First 
Week, with Observations on each day of the Creation, and In- 
structions for Youth." Edinburgh, Bvo, 1778 ; with a Memoir, 
containing many interesting and pleasing incidents of her life. 
She wrote 5 books in folio, 15 in quarto, and one in octavo, all 
of a religious and spiritual nature. Some of her MSS. are still 
at Pitfirrane. 

Elizabeth, second daughter of Sir Charles Halket, who was 
born in 1639, was married to Sir Plenry Wardlaw of Pitreavie, 
Baronet, in 1696, and died in 1726 or 1727. She was a lady of 
great accomplishments, and has acquired celebrity, as being con- 
sidered by many the authoress of an admired poem or ballad, 
entitled " Hardyknute." ' 

The present proprietor. Sir John Halket, is the seventh Baronet 
of Pitfirrane— a commander in the Royal Navy. His lady, 
Amelia Hood, daughter of Colonel Conway, descends from a 
branch of the Conways of Ragley, who were elevated to the 
peerage, as Barons, Viscounts, and Earls of Conway. 

Wardlaw Famihj.—The Wardlaws claim a very high onVin, 
havmg first come from Saxony to England about the year 500; 
and they derive their name from an office which they held in the 
law department under the Anglo-Saxon monarchs. ' There were 
three leading branches of this family— the Torrie, the Luscar, 
and the Balmule and Pitreavie, in this vicinity, besides those of

Riccarton and Warrieston elsewhere. It is the third named with 
which Dunfermline parish is more immediately connected. 

Sir Henry Wardlaw, the eldest son of Sir Cuthbert of Balmule, 
was the first designated of Pitreavie 2 miles south-east from 
Dunfermline, and was also of Balmule. He was in high favour at 
court, and in 1603 was appointed chamberlain to Anne of Den- 
mark, Queen of James VI. 

The present representative of the family is Sir William Ward- 
law of Pitreavie, the thirteenth Baronet, born 1794, residing in 
Edinburgh. 

Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell, K.B., was the son of Charles 
Mitchell of Pitteadie, afterwards of Baldridge, near Dunfermline, 
and descended from the ancient family of Bandeth, Westshore, 
commonly called Mitchell of that ilk, and whose ancestors were 
barons of Scotland. He was born in this parish in 1757, and 
distinguished himself in the naval service during the last war. 
He died at Bermuda in February 1806. 

Arnald Blair, a monk of Dunfermline, was Chaplain to Sir 
William Wallace, and author of two Latin works, entitled " Re- 
lationes quaedam Arnaldi Blair, monachi de Dunfermling, et ca- 
pellani D. Willielmi Wallas, Militis, A. D. 1327," which begins 
with Sir William Wallace being chosen governor of Scotland in 
1 298, and ends with his being betrayed and put to death, in 
1305 ; and " Diarium Arnaldi de Blair, capellani Willielmi 
Vallcij, Militis, Gubernatoris Regni Scotiae, monachi de Dum- 
fermling, 1327," beginning at 1297, and ending 7th September 
1305, and occupying four and a half folio pages. 

Mr John Durie, a monk of Dunfermline in 1 563, embraced 
the Protestant faith, and became an eminent preacher of it. 
He was successively minister of Leith, Edinburgh, and Mon- 
trose. 

Mr David Ferguson was the first Protestant minister of this 
parish, a man of great celebrity in his day, and held in much 
confidence and esteem by his brethren. He died on 23d August 
1598, aged 65, and is thus briefly but pithily characterized by 
Spottiswood. " A good preacher, wise, and of a jocund and 
pleasant disposition, which made him well regarded both in court 
and country." Besides his famous sermon preached at Leith, he 
was the author of a compilation of the Scottish Proverbs, set in 
alphabetical order, the same year in which he died, and prmted

in his Lives of Knox and Melville. 

Mr John Davidson, another eminent reformer, was a native of 
this parish. He was first minister at Liberton, and afterwards at 
Prestonpans, in the reign of James VI. 

Mr Robert Henry son was an eminent person in this parish, as 
a teacher and poet, at the end of the fifteenth century. The 
exact period and place of his birth, as well as the time of his 
death, are involved in equal obscurity. He must have been 
born, however, in the reign of James H. or HI., and it is certain 
that he died in this burgh. The main fact regarding his personal 
history, well ascertained, is, that he was " Scolmaister of Dun- 
fermling," or, as he has been styled, " Chief Schoolmaster of 
Dunfermline ;'' and it has been conjectured, that he officiated as 
preceptor of youth in the Abbey. 

Mr Adam Blackwood was born in Dunfermline in 1539. 
Being a Roman Catholic, he settled in France, and became a 
Senator in the Parliament of Poitiers. He died in 162.3, aged 
74. He published various works, a corrected edition of which, 
Latin and French, appeared twenty-one years after his death, at 
Paris, 1644, 4to. He had two brothers, also natives of Dun- 
fermline ; Henry, who became eminent as a doctor of medicine 
at Paris, and George, who became a professor of philosophy 
there, and afterwards a clergyman of celebrity. 

Mr James Bayne, schoolmaster of Dunfermline, published, in 
1714, a short introduction to the Latin Grammar. 

Mr James Moir was a teacher and author in Dunfermline in 
1756, and afterwards in Edinburgh, where he died in 1806, aged 
93. 

Mr Andrew Donaldson, brother-in-law to Mr John Mackie, 
a respectable gentleman in the carpet manufactory trade in Dun- 
fermline, who died in 1793, was a teacher in this town, a man of 
good education and character, but of singular habits. 

Provost Low was long and deservedly eminent for his success 
in the reduction of dislocations, and for the disinterested manner 
in which he acted in the exercise of his peculiar talent. He died 
in September 1817. 

Rev. Henry Fergus, late minister in the Relief Church, was an 
ardent student of physical science, on some branches of which he 
lectured in the Mechanics' Institution in 1825-6, and was the 
author of several publications.

Ehenezer Henderson, D.D., Theological Tutor, Highbury Col-

Modern and other Buildings. — The most recent school build- 
ings are the Burgh, Commercial, and Maclean Schools. 

Churches. — The following may be noticed -.—Queen Anne 
Street Dissenting Church, a huge building, " rearing its enormous 
rectilinear ridge over all the other buildings in Dunfermline, the 
Abbey Church itself not excepted." 

Within the last sixteen years have been erected St Margaret's 
Church, of the United Associate connexion, 1827 ; behind it, 
the Baptist Church, 1 834 ; St Andrew's Church, North Chapel 
Street, 1833; North Church, Golfdrum, 1840, which last two 
are both quoad sacra churches, built in connexion with the Esta- 
blishment; i\\e Independent or Congregational Church, Canmore 
Street, 1841, and the Episcopal Trinity Chapel, Queen Anne 
Place, 1842, all additions to the ornamental structures of the 
town, and affording comfortable accommodation to the congrega- 
tions worshipping in them. A Free Church also, built of stone 
and slated, has been erected in Canmore Street, in the end of 

1843. . . 

But the largest, most splendid, and interesting ecclesiastical 
edifice of modern date, is the Abbey Church. It was begun m 
March 1818, and completed in September 1821. It mime- 
diately adjoins the Old Church on the east, the latter bemg now 
a porch or vestibule to it. It is of light ornate Gothic architec- 
ture, with tall handsome windows, and having a fine square tower, 
near the east end, 100 feet high. On the summit of this tower, 
instead of a balustrade of the same architecture as the rest of the 
building, there are the four words, King Robert The Bruce, 
on the four sides respectively, in capital letters of open hewn 
work, four feet in height, which can be easily read at a consider- 
able distance. These are surmounted by royal crowns, and each 
corner is ornamented with a lofty pinnacle. This decoration is 
intended to designate the place of sepulture of our great patriot 
King, whose ashes repose immediately beneath ; but the taste 
and architectural effect of it are questioned by many. The in- 
terior of the church is much and universally admired, for the 
simplicity, chasteness, and elegance of its form and ornaments 

A Poor's House and Prison have been recently erected m the 
Town Green, east from the Burgh.

 As it appears, from an extract from these Records, that there were 287 fami- 
lies in Dunfermline in 1 624, by allowing nearly five to a family, the population is about 
1400. 

f Dr Webster's undertaking was begun in 1743, but not completed tiU 1755, 
which accounts for this last year being given as that of the Report. 

X I have here excluded North Queensferry, which is in the parish quoad civilia, 
and was estimated in 1841 for the first time, in order to shew the proportional in- 
crease of the population with previous years. Inclutling North Queensferry, it is 
20,239.

Births— It is impossible to state accurately the yearly average 
of births, for the last seven years, since very few of the Dissenters, 
during that period, have recorded the births of their children in 
the Parish Register, and some of the parents belonging to the 
Establishment have also neglected to do so. The following is 
the average number of the registrations of births and baptisms 
for ten years, at four different periods, compared with the popu- 
lation, shewing a rapid decrease in the descent, which is to be 
ascribed to the cause just mentioned— a cause which began to 
operate during the third period, and became still stronger after- 
wards.

The averatje for 1817-1826 is 55 less than that of the imme- 
diately preceding period, while the population was upwards of 
3000 more, shewing that the neglect of registrations was then 
rapidly on the increase, and this disproportion is still more ap- 
parent in the two succeeding periods. Of the births which oc- 
curred in 1841, when the population was 19,778, only 105 wer6 
recorded in the Parish Register; in 1842, only 89 ; and in 1843, 
up to 15th December, only 43. These results point out the im- 
perative necessity of some new legislative enactment, for enforcing 
registrations of births for genei'al purposes, as well as for the 
benefit of individuals. The period between 1803-1812 affords 
the safest data for the calculations of a political economist, espe- 
cially when I state that the registrations for each year of that 
period were pretty uniform. 

Mortality. — A very correct register of burials in the Abbey 
churchyard having been kept since 1833, the following is an 
abstract of them for ten years. A few of the funerals came from 
neighbouring parishes, but probably as many went out of Dun- 
fermline to these parishes ; so that the number of interments 
may be taken as very nearly that of deaths in the parish.

Taking the average number of interments in the churchyard 
of Rosyth, which borders on the parish at Limekilns, to be 35 for 
the same period, the total average will be 407 ; and estimating 
the average population between 1833 and 1842 at 18,500, the 
average of deaths will be about 1 in 45 45.45, or 2J per cent.

There was an unusual mortality in 1837, owing to the great 
prevalence of typhus fever, measles, and what are usually named 
hives. Influenza, also, was very prevalent and fatal at the com- 
mencement of that year, chiefly among the aged and infirm ; and 
it was remarked, that although many persons died of other dis- 
eases at that period, almost all these diseases assumed more or 
less the type of this epidemic, as an accompaniment. The num- 
ber of deaths was nearly as great as that arising from cholera and 
other diseases in 1832 ; the former being 493, and the latter 500, 
of which last number there were 180 deaths by cholera alone. 
This alarming disease prevailed in the parish from 3d September 
to 1st November 1832, and partially in the March preceding. 
There were nearly 500 cases, although only 180 deaths. 

Marriages. — As the accuracy of the Register of Proclamation

In 1801, the year of the great dearth, the number of marriages 
was 62, which was the same as in the year immediately preceding, 
while it rose in 1802 to 81, and in 1803 to 101. In the three 
following years it fell, being 77, 87, and 93 respectively. In 1827, 
after a great depression in trade, the number of marriages was only 
106 while in the year immediately preceding and following, it was 
I25I and in 1830 'it rose to 171. The Malthusians will consider 
these facts, as corroborative of their theory of population.

There is one earl Elgin and Kincardine and one baronet 
Capt. Sir John Halket, who generally reside in the parish. 
The Marquis of Tweeddale has land, and feu-duties or fees aris- 
ing from his heritable offices of Bailie of the Regality and Con- 
stabulary of the Lordship of Dunfermline, but no mansion-house 
in it. There are many individuals and families of independent 
fortune residing both in the town and country. 

There are 38 proprietors of land, exclusive of the burgh and 
guildry corporations, of the yearly value of L.50 and upwards. 

The average number in each family is rather more than four 
and a half 4.5771, or about 4i,.

Some of these eleven are in the Poor's House. There are 
three or four blind, and five deaf and dumb persons, belonging to 
the parish. One of the latter is at present receiving education at 
the Glasgow Deaf and Dumb Institution ; and another was also 
taught there, both at the expense of the Rev. A. M'Lean's trus- 
tees. A third was educated at the Edinburgh Institution, by vo- 
luntary contributions from the parish. 

The people are not remarkable for any corporeal or other per- 
sonal quahties. The language of the working classes is distin- 
guished by some peculiar pronunciations and phrases, such as toll 
for tell ; buddies for bodies children ; lean yehv sit you downov 
rest yourselves ; a false for a falsehood ; belonging me for to me ; 
fell used in a good as well as a bad sense, as a/e// or large meet- 
ing, a/eZZ or fine boy, &amp; fell or clever person, or very angry; 
a.frem person, one not related by blood. 

Habits of the People, c, — The habits of the people as a class 
are industrious and active, and, with the exception of the lowest 
and most dissipated among them, are cleanly and orderly. Very 
many of the working population have a fair proportion of the com- 
forts of life, and advantages of society. They have good and well 



878 



FIFESHIRE. 



furnished houses, dress respectably, educate their children, and 
can afford to have the same wholesome and nourishing diet, as is 
usual in a similar class in other parts of Scotland. 

Many of the weavers and operatives of all descriptions, are very 
intelligent and skilful at their employments, and have information 
far superior to their rank in life. 

The inhabitants generally are a church-going people, as indi- 
cated by the attendance on the places of worship, and the crowds 
of persons who are seen going to and from these on the Sabbath. 
Many of the respectable middling classes are well informed on re- 
ligious subjects; and although there is a great diversity of sects, 
and an occasional keenness in the discussion of controversial to- 
pics, there are considerable freedom and harmony of private in- 
tercourse. 

It is to be acknowledged and lamented, however, that, as in all 
populous and manufacturing places, there are many exceptions to 
this favourable statement, both in respect of prosperity and cha- 
racter. A young weaver, from being soon able to earn a journey- 
man's wages, often contracts too early a marriage, which, espe- 
cially if followed by irregular employment, and reduction of wages 
in consequence of depression of trade, as has of late years too 
frequently occurred, and much more by his own improvidence or 
dissipation, necessarily entails poverty and wretchedness. Accord- 
ingly, there are not a few journeymen weavers and their families, 
from one or more of these causes, living in great straits and dis- 
comfort, which they have little prospect of overcoming. As a na- 
tural result of this, there is discontent among a certain portion of 
the weaving class, as also other mechanics, accompanied by a keen 
interference in civil and ecclesiastical politics, and an anxious at- 
tempt to find remedies for their wants in the removal of real or 
imagined public evils, rather than in the amendment of their own 
habits as individuals and members of society. The cases of ex- 
treme indigence and misery arising mainly from intemperance, 
with its concomitant evils, idleness, profligacy, carelessness of per- 
sons and dwellings, neglect of education of children and of divine 
ordinances, are often very ap]alling and heart-rending. 

As to the collier population, it is well known that anciently the 
coal-hewers were serfs to their employers, or " adscriptae glebae," 
the law repealing which practice having been passed only in 1771, 
and made effectual by another only in 1 799. 

In consequence of disputes at some of the collieries in this quar- 

G 



DUNFERMLINE. 879 

ter, arising out of the union-laws, the collier population has of late 
been very fluctuating and unsettled. But in regard to the old re- 
sident part of the workmen, especially in the vicinity of the town 
of Dunfermline, who did not take any prominent part in these dis- 
putes, I would say, that, generally speaking, their intellectual, re- 
ligious, and moral character, is decidedly superior to that of the 
same class of persons in many other places. 

The old practice of confining their marriages to their own class 
is beginning to break down, from which an improvement may be 
expected in many respects. But the chief feature of improvement 
of late years has been in education. This was generally at one 
time very much neglected, and hence the adult population was of- 
ten ignorant and uncultivated. The cause of this deficiency was 
certainly in no small degree, the facility of finding easy employ- 
ment with a little pecuniary gain for young boys and girls under 
ground, in keeping doors for ventilation, &amp;c. a benefit which care- 
less or dissipated parents took advantage of, to the prejudice of 
the education of their offspring. But, recently, at all the collieries, 
the payments for education are made universal and compulsory, an 
arrangement which has caused a much more regular attendance. 

I am not aware of any distinguishing peculiarities in the charac- 
ter of the agricultural population of this parish. The Bothy sys- 
tem exists here as in other places, with its share of attendant evils. 
From many of the farm-servants shifting their situations frequent- 
ly, they are not so well known to their ministers, as other classes 
of the working population. Still, numbers of them are regular in 
their attendance on divine ordinances, and conduct themselves 
with Christian propriety. 

Poaching is considerably on the decrease, chiefly, it is supposed, 
on account of the vigilance of the rural police. In 1841, the 
number of persons prosecuted for offences against the game laws, 
in the western district of Fife, in the Justice of Peace Court, was 
17; in 1842, 9; and in 1843, 6. There were, however, other 
cases, in which the evidence was deficient, and which were not 
brought to trial. 

Pawn broking has been on the increase of late. There are at 
present December 1843 eleven shops, besides many private 
places, where the trade is understood to be carried on. None of 
the dealers in it are licensed, as they profess to purchase the arti- 
cles deposited with them. They are styled " General Merchants 
or Brokers."

IV. — Industuy. 
Agriculture.— The following tabular view of the agriculture of 
the parish was drawn up chiefly in consequence of hearing certain 
remarks made by Earl Fitzwilliam on the Statistical Reports of 
Agriculture, including those of the new work of the Church of 
Scotland, at the meeting of the British Association held in Edin- 
burgh in 1834. These are now recorded in the printed transac- 
tions for that year, p. 693, and are, in substance, as follows :— 
" The expediency of furnishing more minute details with respect 
to the agricultural part of statistical reports, was suggested in these 
remarks. The statements ought to show not only the total amount 
of land in cultivation, but also the quantities allotted at the time 
of the inquiry to the various kinds of produce, the number and 
value of agricultural implements, the number of draught and other 
cattle, and similar details. Lord Fitzwilliam stated, that he had 
succeeded in obtaining such returns for some parishes in his own 
neighbourhood, and observed, that accurate and minutely detailed 
information for only a small number of places would furnish more 
safe grounds for correct inferences than could be obtamed from a 
more widely extended, but less precise inquiry." 

The information contained in the first four tables may be de- 
pended on, as possessing all attainable accuracy, having been pro- 
cured from written returns, made by the several proprietors or te- 
nants of land, in answer to queries submitted to them in schedules, 
containing a variety of columns for the purpose. The informaUon 
in the other tables was also obtained from the best sources. Ex- 
cept when otherwise noted, they all refer to the year 1838, soon 
after which, the author expected his History of Dunfermhne to be 
completed, but in this, from other duties, he was disappointed. 
This he regrets, as some slight changes may have taken place since 
that period, especially as to the number of farming implements.

early oats, there are also sown the Dunn, Angus, and Strathmiglo.

There is no ground in a state of undivided common. The ge- 
neral kind of trees planted, or indigenous, has been noticed under 
the article Botany, p. 845. The management of them, with re- 
gard to yearly thinning and pruning, is understood to be good.

The rent of arable land in the southern district of the pari.sh, 
including all to the south of the Crossgates and Torryburn roads 
and town of Dunfermline, is from about L.l, 5s. to L.3, 3s. But 
the general rent is about L.2, 5s. per Scots acre, or L.l, 15s. 8d. 
imperial. In the northern district, the rent of arable land is from 
about 16s. to L.2; and the general rent about L.1, 3s. Scots, or 
18s. '2d. imperial. 

Pasture-land will rent, to the south of the town, at the same 
rate as arable; and to the north of it, from 5s. to L.l, 10s. impe- 
rial acre. 

The rents upon new leases are frequently paid partly in money 



884

and partly in grain, convertible at the fiars' prices either Mid- Lo- 
thian or Fife, but now chiefly the latter. 

In the immediate vicinity, and on the south side of the town, 
the rent of grazing for a milk-cow is about L.5, and sometimes as 
high as L.5, 10s. ; and of an ox, about L.3, lOs. To the north of 
the town, the rent for a milk-cow is about L.3; and for an ox 
about L,2; for a ewe and lamb, from 12s. to L.l ; and for a full- 
grown sheep, from 10s. to 15s. 

Rate of Warjes. — The wages of ploughmen, when young lads, 
are from L.9 to L. 12; when grown or married men, fit for all 
kinds of farm-work, from L.3 to L. 16 ; and when they have 
charge of the farm, are sometimes even L.20 per annum, with an 
allowance for provisions. The young lads generally receive 6|- 
bolls of oatmeal, and either milk or Is. per week instead of it, with 
occasionally 1 boll of potatoes. Grown or married men, and per- 
sons in charge, have the same quantity of meal and 6 bolls of po- 
tatoes. Sometimes, too, they receive a certain quantity of sweet- 
milk per day from the dairy, or have the use of a cow, and, in the 
upland districts, even of two or three cows, in which case, if they 
have at the same time meal and potatoes, their wages are propor- 
tionally less. Married men have a free house and garden, with 
coals driven for them ; and unmarried men generally live in bo- 
thies, with fire and bedding provided by their masters. 

Female house-servants in the country have from L. 4 to L. 7, 
generally L.6 per annum. 

Male labourers have Is. 6d. per day in winter, and Is. 8d. in 
summer. 

Female labourei-s have at the rate of a penny per hour, both 
summer and winter, or, on an average, 8d. per day. 

Country masons and wrights have 2s. per day in winter, and 
2s. 6d. in summer. 

The wages of harvest labourers, who are for the most part fe- 
males, are, of course, variable, generally from Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. per 
day, with dinner. They work, according to the practice of this 
part of the country, from nine in the morning till six in the even- 
ing, with an interval for dinner. The men who are employed as 
bandsters receive from Is. 8d. to Is. lOd., with dinner. 

Manure. — House and ash dung sells at 2s. 6d., and stable or 
bvve dung at from 4s. to 5s. per double-cart ; slacked lime at 
5d. or 6d. per bushel ; bone-dust at 2s. lOd. per bushel ; and 
rape-dust at L.5, 5s, per ton. Lime is now by some not so much 



. DUNFERMLINE. 885 

approved of as it once was, except for top-dressing on pasture. 
Bone-dust is occasionally used for turnips, and is reckoned suita- 
ble for free soils, and rape-dust for fallow ground and retentive 
soils. One former has employed rape-dust with great effect, hav- 
ing had fow full successive crops after its application. Guano is 
also coming into use. 

Live-Stuck. — Few or no sheep are bred in the parish. Tees- 
water and Fife breed of cattle are most approved of at present; 
but a difference of opinion exists as to which is best for the ge- 
neral breed of the parish or county. Teeswater cattle, or short- 
horns, as they are called, are said to come sooner to maturity, with 
more weight, but require better keeping than the native breed, 
and are not so well adapted as the other for the high lands. 

Husbandry. — A general spirit of improvement at present pre- 
vails over the parish in the reclaiming of waste lands, and espe- 
cially in draining, both by stones and tiles, which is the founda- 
tion of all good husbandry, and when properly executed, is a per- 
manent advantage. Perhaps more has been done in this way for 
the success of agriculture during the last ten years, than during 
the preceding generation. 

There are two high-pressure steam engines in the southern sec- 
tion of the parish, for driving thrashing-machines, both of recent 
introduction. 

Rotation of Crops. — This varies very much in the southern dis- 
trict. That which is roost practised and approved of in strong 
clays, is, \st, summer-fallow ; 21, wheat ; 3c/, beans ; 4,th, bar- 
ley ; bth, hay; 6, oats. On loams, \st, potatoes; Q,d, wheat; 
Qd, barley; Ath, hay; bth, oats; or, \st, turnip; Id, barley sown 
with grass-seeds ; Qd, grass, and pastured two or three years, 
where the land is fenced ; and then oats. The proportion of land 
employed in raising turnips is much increased of late years. While 
at the period of the last Statistical Account it was 200 acres, and 
in 1814 is reported to have been very inconsiderable, it was, in 
1833, as appears from the table, 308 acres. 

Sowing and Planting. — The period of this is generally, for 

\st. Wheat, from Jst October till the middle of December; 

'2d, Barley, from 1st April till 26lh May ; 

32, Oats, from 20th March till 20th April ; 

Ath, Beans, from 1st March till the middle of April ; 

5th, Turnips, Swedish, from 1st May till 1st June; 

Globe, from 26th May till 10th July ; 

Yellow, from 26lh May till 15th J une. 

Potatoes are planted from the first till the middle of May ; but 
not generally with success after the 15th.

Harvest. — Hay-cutting commences in ordinary seasons about 
the 20th June, and continues throughout July. The other crops 
are usually reaped in the lower section of the parish between the 
middle or end of August, and the beginning of October ; in the 
upper section a fortnight or three weeks later. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is nineteen years, which 
is reckoned favourable, but no boon, to the occupier. As rents 
are now generally covenanted for partly in money and partly in 
grain, in as nearly equal proportions as possible, regulated by the 
fiars of the county, on an average of three years, it is of less im- 
portance to a landlord how long a lease may last. 

Farm-Buildings and Enclosures. — Farm-buildings are much 
improved, and, for the most part, executed in a substantial man- 
ner. The lands are almost all enclosed, partly with free, or some- 
times whinstone dikes, and these often dry, and partly with ditches 
and hedges. 

Manufactures. — The staple trade of Dunfermline is the manufac- 
ture of Table-linens. In no other part of Scotland does the traffic 
in this article exist, although in one or two places a few looms are 
to be found. The trade of the town began more than a century ago, 
with the making of ticks and checks, which continued to be made 
in winter after the table-linen was introduced, which was then wo- 
ven in summer. Like most other arts, it has attained its present 
high excellence by slow and successive improvements. 

The following three tables were prepared by a committee of 
manufacturers in July 1836, for Joseph Hume, Esq., M. P., and 
may therefore be depended on as having all the accuracy which 
is attainable in such cases.

These worsted warps, and especially linen full harness looms, 
are now 1843 greatly increased. Of the 351 7 looms, 570 were 
out of the parish ; for the trade supports looms in the adjoining 
parishes of Torryburn, Carnock, Culross, and Inverkeilhing, and 
even as far as at Kinross, Auchtermuchty, Leslie, and Strathmi- 
glo. 

The following is a table of the number of looms, in and out of 
the parish of Dunfermline, and of the value of goods manufactur- 
ed, at various periods, as nearly as can be ascertained, which I 
have compiled from different sources, showing at one view the 
gradual progress of the trade.

The following tables are extracted from a written paper deli- 
vered by the weavers to the Hand- Loom Commissioners in July 
1838.

Those who have gone to other trades are not here included in 
the amount of family. 

Of the 44 apprentices bound, 20 were at a factory in town. 
The reason of so few being bound, is said to be the high stamp- 
duty of the indenture, viz, one guinea, and the expense of writing 
it.

Tables of wages have been made at different periods, first in 
1807 and next in 1816, during which time the rate of payment 
continued the same. In 1816, and again in 1822, the prices 
were reduced, at which last period there was a strike for about 
nine months. The manufacturers, however, prevailed, and from 
that time till 1828, when the Jacquard machines came into use, 
the prices varied slightly. In that year, and again in 1834, 1837, 
and in 22d May 1844, tables were also made.

Wages were wont to be paid per yard till within these 12 or 15 
years, when they came to be paid per spindle of work, which is 
thought an improvement, as being more simple. The gross ave- 
rage amount of weekly wages, as stated by the operatives, is about 
■ 10s. 6d., but with deductions for light, tear and wear, loom-rent, 
and dressing, the average of net weekly wages is about 8s. 6d. per 
week, for each loom. Journeymen receive nearly three-fourths of 
the income, or 7s. 6d. per week, with the deduction of a small 
proportion for light and twisting, amounting to about 12s. per an- 
num, the remainder being the master's remuneration for the cost 
of the loom-rent, &amp;c., and the trouble of providing and superin- 
tending the work. Taking the fine and the broad coarse goods 
separately, which the journeymen chiefly weave, the average of 
their wages will be somewhat higher than 7s. 6d. In some of the 
warehouses, where the finest work is wrought, the earnings are 
much higher than now stated. 

Although the weaver has certainly lower wages now than he 
had twenty years ago, for working fine damask, he has much less 
idle time in ordinary circumstances, in consequence of the use of 
the Jacquard machines, and the yarn being better, not hand-spun 
as before, but mill-spun, which is to a certain extent a compensa- 
tion. Loss of time, on a change of pattern, may be reckoned as 
occurring, upon an average, only once in eighteen months, but 
sometimes only once in two or three, or even many years, accord- 
mg to the pleasure of the manufacturer. 

Pirn fillers can earn, if they have nothing else to do, lOd. per 
day being paid at the rate of 2id. per spindle of weft. Bobbiners 
could earn the same amount, but do not receive usually from one 
warehouse more than from 4d. to 6d. per day, being at the rate 
of Id. to lad. per spindle of warp, according to the weight.

The weavers have twelve hours of actual labour, upon an ave 
rage. 

Spinning- Mills, Src — The first spinning-mill in the parish was 
erected at Brucefield, about half a mile south-west from the town, 
in 1792, which got the second patent for spinning yarn by ma- 
chinery. It span yarn from flax, hemp, tow, and wool, but has 
not been in operation for several years past. 

In July 1836 there were seven spinning-mills in operation in 
the parish : at present there are only five. 

The following is a table of particulars regarding these mills, 
prepared along with the one respecting the table-linen manufac- 
ture, in July 1836, for Joseph Hume, Esq., M.P.

These mills spin chiefly linen yarn, but one of them manufac- 
tures also a great quantity of linen thread, in a state prepared 
for the market, and for the quality of which it has long been in 
great repute. The others likewise twist for thread, and some of 
them make a good deal of shoe thread. 

There are three Iron Founderies in the parish, — two on the 
north side of the town, and one at the iron mill, near Charleston, 
— in all of which considerable work is done, and some brass is 
cast. 

There are five Breweries of beer, ale, and porter, — three in the 
town, one at Crossford, and another at Brucehaven. 

There is one Soap-work in which candles also are made, and 
a Candle-work separately. 

There are two Manufactories of Tobacco, being one less than 
in 1841, and two less than in 1837. There are no snufF-mills ; 
as there were anciently, near the ruins of the monastery. 

There are, on the north side of the town, two Tanning and 
Currying-tvorhs. There are, in or near the town, three Rope- 
works ; and in the vicinity of Charleston and Townhill, two Tile 
and Brick-works. 

There are, in diflerent parts of the parish, four Coi'n or Meal

Mills ; and connected with the one at the iron-mill, near Charles- 
ton, is a Saw-mill, both of which are driven by the same wheel. 
There are in the town four Dye-works. 

There is only one Flour Mill, which is in Monastery Street, 
named the Heugh Mill. It was erected in 1784 or 1787, and 
was driven by water till 1819, when the present proprietor appli- 
ed to it a steam-engine, that it might continue regularly in opera- 
tion, during summer as well as winter. Since that period, the 
mill has manufactured, on an average, 7194 bolls of wheat an- 
nually.

Banks. — There are four branches of banking houses in Dun- 
fermline ; one of the Bank of Scotland, established in September 
1781 ; a second, of the British Linen Company, which was first 
established in August 1804, and after having been given up for 
many years, was re-opened in July 1831-; a third, of the Com- 
mercial Bank, begun in 1812, but afterwards withdrawn, and again 
permanently established in June 1823; and a fourth, of the Edin- 
burgh and Leith Bank, begun on 22d May 1840. The National 
Bank has had a bill-collector here since April 1825. 

National Security Savings Bank.— A savings bank was established 
inDunfermhne m 1815, and connected with the National Security 
Savings Bank in 1838. Its business is greatly increased in conse- 
quence of this connection, the amount of the sums deposited for 
ten years previous to 1838, reckoned on the 30th of April of that 
year, varying from L.52467 to L.4439 ; while from the 20th No-

were held by 730 depositors, of not more than L,20 each, out of 
990 ; clearly evincing that the Bank is what it professes to be,— 
the working-man's bank, and that the operative classes generally 
continue to repose in it their wonted confidence. 

A marked improvement has taken place since November 1842 
'—so much so, that the number of depositors on 2d November 
1843 was 1021, while the total funds of the Bank, on 20th No- 
vember, were L.18,232, 15s. 4d.; and on 12th December of the 
same year, L.18,915, 17s. lid. 

Guildry.~-T\\e fraternity is of very great antiquity in this town, 
having been incorporated, there is reason to believe, by a charter 
from the monastery, as early as the close of the fourteenth cen- 
tury. Its funds are applied to the relief of its decayed members, 
and widows of members deceased, and to educational purposes 
It distributes about L.50 annually in charity. 

Incorporated Trades.—These are eight in number, and stand 
m order of precedency, to which they attach some importance, 
thus :— Smiths or hammermen, weavers, wrights, tailors, shoe- 
makers, baxters bakers, masons, and fleshers. They have each 
a separate charter, named a gift, or seal of cause, granted bv the 
magtrates and town-council, by authority, it is understood, of 
the Crown. 

There are several Horticultural Societies, and one Ornitho- 
logical, in the parish. 

Western District of Fife Agricultural Society. -The meetings 
o th.s Society are held in Dunfermline annually, in the monfh 
of July. Its yearly subscriptions average from L.40 to L.50, 
and are expended at each show of cattle and horses. In addition 
to the ordmary annual premiums, occasional extraordinary pre-

FIFES HI RE. 



miums are awarded at the exhibitions, offered by the Society, 
through the liberality of some of the landed gentlemen of the 
district. Since 1824, there has been given away in premiums 
considerably upwards of L.IOOO. 

Gas Com-pany. — This was instituted 11th November 1828, and 
its extensive work, situated towards the lower end of the town, 
commenced lighting on the 28th October 1829. The cost of 
the works, up to May 1843, was L.1 1,277, 13s. 6d., being 
L.9200, the capital stock at the same period on 860 shares, and 
L.2077, 13s. 6d., the old sinking fund, and premiums on shares 
expended on works. The original price of the shares was L.IO, 
and the present selling price is L.21. The new sinking fund, at 
May last, was L.99'2, 7s. Id. A dividend upon the origipal 
stock of L.IO per cent, has been paid almost every year, and for 
the last four years of L.12, 10s., notwithstanding the price of the 
gas being understood to be as modei'ate as that of any other com- 
pany, if not more so. It is furnished at present, by meter, at 7s. 
6d. per 1000 cubic feet, and has always been considered of 
superior quality. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Dunfermline is a market town and royal burgh. A corn mar- 
ket is held at it every Tuesday for the sale of grain by sample, 
and is well attended by the agriculturists of the district. There 
is a weekly market also every Friday for butter, cheese, eggs, &amp;c. 

The burgh is governed by a provost, two bailies, a treasurer, a 
guild magistrate, a chamberlain, and sixteen councillors, with the 
assistance of a town-clerk, who acts also as legal assessor. Their 
election is regulated by the general amended municipal act of 
Parliament, dated 24th August 1833. The provost and. magis- 
trates have the usual jurisdiction, civil and criminal, belonging to 
magistrates of royal burghs. They hold regular courts, with the 
town clerk as their assessor, once every week, on Wednesday, for 
the disposal of police cases, and on the same day, besides the 
ordinary court, what is denominated " The Nine Merk Court," 
for the recovery of small debts not exceeding ten shillings. Upon 
the decreet of this last court, summary diligence can be executed. 
They also hold a court twice a-year for granting certificates to 
publicans. The provost is ex officio a justice of the peace, and 
sits in the courts held by the justices. 

The annual revenue of the burgh is about L.IOOO, derived 
from the rents of five small farms still belonging to it, &amp;c. The 



DUNFERMLINE. 



895 



burgh pays to Government yearly the sum of L.78 of land-tax, 
or town-cess, besides a sum of L.8 or L.IO, in support of the 
convention of royal burghs, all levied from the property of the in- 
habitants within burgh. 

Guild Court. — Formerly the Dean of the fraternity of Guildry 
was a member of Council, and presided in this court. Now, the 
Guild Magistrate is chosen by the Council themselves, and he 
and four councillors form the court. Their duty is to decide 
upon questions relative to ruinous tenements, and disputed 
marches within burgh, and to attend to the correctness of weights 
and measures. 

Police.— Id 1811, a police bill was obtained from Parliament, 
not only for the purpose of regulating the police of the town, but 
of granting powers for paving, lighting, and cleansing the streets 
—for removing nuisances and obstructions therefrom, and for 
opening new and widening the present streets ; and likewise for 
increasing the supply of water for the use of the burgh. 

This act has done much good, in promoting the accommoda- 
tion, health, security, and comfort of the community ; and, by 
continued vigorous management, it may be expected to preserve 
and increase these important civil advantages. 

A county police having been lately established, Dunfermline 
has been made the head quarters for the western district of the 
county, where an inspector and two constables are stationed. 

There are a sherifif, a small debt, and a justice of peace court. 

Dunfermline unites with the burghs of Stirling, Inverkeithing, 
Culross, and South Queensferry, in sending a Member to the 
British House of Commons. Stirling is the returning burgh, and 
Lord Dalmeny the present member. 

Internal Communication, -c— Dunfermline is a post-town. 

The length of the turnpike roads in the parish is about thirty- 
one miles. 

Two coaches daily leave Dunfermline for Edinburgh, and two 
return. A coach goes every morning to Falkirk, for the Ediu- 
burgh and Glasgow Railway, and returns in the evenino- 

The bridges and fences in the parish are in goodcoidition. 
i here bemg no rivers, the bridges are small. 

There are several railroads, chiefly for the conveyance of coal • 
one from the Elgin and Wellwood collieries to Charleston har- 
hour, and another from the Halbeath and Townhill collieries to 
the port at Lnverkeithing, 



89G FIFESHIRE. 

There are three harbours in, or close to the parish, belong- 
ing to the Earl of Elgin, viz. Charleston, Limekilns, and Bruce- 
haven. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The Abbey Parish Church is situated in 
the town of Dunfermline, about two miles from the nearest, and 
six from the furthest boundary of the parish. Of course it is not 
convenient for the distant part of the population, for there are 
1000 inhabited dwelling-houses more than two miles, one-half of 
which are nearly four, about 15 are further than four, and two or 
three are about six miles distant from the church. There is a 
dissenting church in two of the extreme positions — Crossgates 
and Limekilns. 

The New Abbey Church was built in 1821, and opened for 
divine service on the 30th September of that year. It needed 
repair so early as 1834-5 from dry-rot, but is at present in ex- 
cellent condition. It affords nominal accommodation for 2051 
persons, but there are 552 sittings in a measure useless, from in- 
convenient position, 402 of these being behind either pillars or 
the pulpit, so that the minister cannot be seen from them ; and 
in the rest he can scarcely be heard, on account of the echo or 
distance from the speaker. Indeed, the accommodation which 
can be considered available is only about 1400, and much of this 
requires and could receive improvement. Suggestions for this 
purpose have often been made, and some of them tried, with 
more or less success, but none of them have yet been adopted. 
There are 110 free siuings allocated to the poor, but from being 
considerably behind the pulpit, are quite useless, and never occu- 
pied. A few temporary forms have been placed for their use near 
the pulpit, which are generally well filled. This want of due ac- 
commodation for the poor has always been considered a great 
evil. A few of the heritors and tenants take rents for then- sit- 
tings, which they do not themselves occupy. The burgh having 
paid a fifth of the expense of erecting the church, obtained a fifth 
of the area in return, and have accordingly sold several of their 
pews to private individuals. 

From time immemorial, there had been neither manse nor pas- 
ture-ground belonging to the ministers of Dunfermline ; but there 
were paid to the senior minister, in lieu of the former, L.3, 6s. 8d., 
and of the latter L.l, 13s. 4d. One of the ministers, during last 
century, sued for a manse, without success ; but the late Rev. 
Allan M'Lean, minister of the first charge, having discovered that

anciently there had been a manse, renewed the action in 1803, 
both for the manse and pasture-ground, and succeeded, first in 
the Court of Session, and afterwards in the House of Peers, on 
an appeal by the heritors, after a litigation of ten years. He ob- 
tained possession of the present manse in September 1816, and 
remuneration for the want of it from Martinmas 1804; and for 
that of the grass glebe from Martinmas 1803. The deficiency in 
the arable glebe, caused by the manse being built on part of it, 
was ordered to be made up, along with the ground to be allocated 
for the grass glebe. An allocation took place by the Sheriff of the 
county on 11th July 1814, but, from various reasons, the desig- 
nation of it was never completed, and the minister has not yet 
obtained possession. The heritors, however, paid L.24 per an- 
num, in lieu of the pasture and deficiency of the arable glebe, till 
1840, when, by mutual agreement between them and the present 
minister, it was reduced to L.20, and to continue at that rate till 
a glebe be provided. The arable glebe is at present nearly 3 
acres, and yields a rental of L.15 per annum. The manse under- 
went a considerable enlargement and repair, partly at the expense 
of the heritors, and partly of the present minister, when he en- 
tered it in 1836, on his translation from the second to the first 
charge. There is neither manse nor glebe attached to the second 
charge. The stipends of the two collegiate ministers are the 
same, viz. 19 chalders of victual, one half meal and the other bar- 
ley, at the rate of the Fife fiars, with L.IO for communion ele- 
ments each. The number of persons that communicated at the 
last dispensation of the sacrament, in December 1843, was nearly 
500, only about 200 less than the average for these some years 
past, in winter, notwithstanding that the Episcopal, North Exten- 
sion, and Free Churches have been opened since 1840. The 
number of communicants on the roll is, of course, considerably 
greater. The present minister of the first charge is the Rev. 
Peter Chalmers, A.M. The second charge is vacant. 

Qjioad Sacra Churches.— Theve are two quoad sacra churches 
m Dunfermline. 

1. St Andrew's, which was once a Chapel of Ease. The sit- 
tings of the church are 797. There are also a house and garden.

after being opened, L.259 ; so that it is free from debt. No 
manse or garden. Present minister, Rev. Charles Marshall, ad- 
mitted June 1841, — who has subsequently joined the Frfee Church. 

From 1839 till the summer of 1843 there was another quoad 
sacra church, named the Canmore Street Church, in connection 
with the Establishment, and formerly in connection with the Ori- 
ginal Burgher Synod, established in 1799. Its last minister. 
Rev. William Dalziel, admitted to it in 1815, was inducted, in 
September last, minister of the church and parish of Thurso, and 
the consrewation have connected themselves with other churches. 

Free Churches. — There are at present January J 844 three 
Free Church congregations : 1. St Andrew's ; 2. North Church; 
3. The Ahheij, or as at first called, Abbey and Canmore Street 
congregations, from most of the elders and many of the people of 
the latter having joined the former. 

Dissenting Churches.— It is well known that Dunfermline has 
always been a principal seat of dissent, ever since the Secession 
from the Establishment of the Rev. Ralph Erskine, who was one 
of the parochial ministers here, and his deposition by the Gene- 
ral Assembly in 1740, when he became one of the chief support- 
ers of the Associate Synod, and had a large congregation in thi 
place ; as also, since the deposition of the Rev. Thomas Gilles- 
pie, minister of Carnock in 1752, which gave rise to the forma- 
tion of the first Relief congregation in Scotland, in this town. 
The following are the churches in connection with one or other 
of the different branches of dissent. 

There are six churches belonging to the United Associate Synod. 

1. Qiieeu Anne Street congregation, founded in 1743, under 
Rev. Ralph Erskine. Sittings, 1642. Stipend L.200, with L.IO 
for communion elements, and house and garden. Present minis- 
ter, Rev. James Young, admitted June 1831. 

2. St Margaret's, East Port, founded 1825, in consequence of 
a separation from Queen Anne Street Congregation, caused by a 
dispute about the appointment of a minister. Sittings, 979. Sti- 
pend L.175, with L.10 for sacramental expenses, and L.15 in aid 
of house rent. The minister's life is insured by the congregation, 
for the benefit of his family, for L.500. Rev. John Law, admit- 
ted 1828.  , ' r A .• 

3. Chalmers' Street, founded in 1788, formerly of the Anti- 



DUNFERMLINE.

burgher Synod. Sittings, 430. Stipend, L. 120, with L. 8 for 
sacramental expenses. No house or garden, or other provision. 

4. Maygate, founded in September 1832, by a separation from 
the Chalmers' Street Congregation, along with their minister, Mr 
Barks. Sittings, 410. Stipend, L.lOO to L.120. No house or 
garden. Rev. James Gibson, admitted 1841. 

5. Limekilns, founded in 1784. Sittings of New Church built 
in 1825, 1056. Stipend, L.150, with L.IO for sacramental ex- 
penses, and a house, rebuilt 1841. Rev. William Johnston, ad- 
mitted 1823. 

6. Crossgates, founded in May 1803. Sittings, 530. Stipend, 
L.lOO, with L.8 for sacramental expenses, and house and garden. 
Rev. Thomas Wilson, admitted 26th November 1811. 

There is one Belief Congregation, the first in Scotland, as 
stated in the preceding page, founded in 1752. Sittings of the 
church. North Chapel Street, 520. Stipend L.150, with a house 
and garden. Rev. Niel M'Michael, admitted 1835, and appointed 
Professor of Systematic Theology and Chui'ch History 1841. 

Scottish Baptist Church, founded about 1805. Sittings of 
church, James' Street, 310. Pastors, Mr David Dewar, since 
1815, and Messrs A. Kirk and J. Inglis. Services gratuitous. 

From this church there were, in 1841, two separations. The 
one was under Mr Blair, as their pastor, formerly home mission- 
ary, and still acting as such. The principles of this body are 
those of the English Baptists. They meet in the Music Hall, 
North Inglis Street. The other was of persons who take the de- 
signation of " Christians" from Acts xi. 26, who have no creed, 
oral or written, but the Bible. They are usually styled Camp- 
bellites, after a Mr Campbell in America, to whose opinions re- 
garding the influence of the Spirit, and instrumentality of the 
Word, in conversion, they are understood to be favourable. They 
have as yet no pastor, and meet in the Old Mason Lodge, Maygate. 

Congregational or Independent Church, founded in 1841. Place of 
worship opened in Canmore Street, 2d Jan. 1 82. Sittings about 
700. Stipend, L.1 00. Present minister, Rev. "George Thomson. 

Holy Catholic Apostolic Congregation, commonly called Bowite 
orlrvingite, from the general conformity of their opinions and go- 
vernment to those of the religious community so named, founded 
m 183a. Their pastor is the Rev. William Cannan, who at pre- 
sent resides in Dundee, and occasionally visits them. In his ab-

sence two elders conduct, public worship, and dispense the sacra- 
ments. They meet at present in a room in Horsemarket Street. 
The pastor has no fixed salary, but provision is made for him, 
partly from funds contributed by the united body, in aid of weak 
congregations. 

Boman Catholic Congregation, founded in 1823. Having no re- 
sident priest, they meet in the dwelling-houses of two of their 
members, who conduct the usual services, but of course do not 
perform mass. 

Scottish Episcopal {Trinity Chapel. — Founded in 1840. Sit- 
tings, 342 in the low area, and, if fitted up with galleries, about 
500. Present stipend, L.IOO. Rev. T. B. Field, admitted De- 
cember 1 841. 

There are also a few Swedenborgians, Unitarians, Methodists, 
and Friends ; but the last three have no separate meetings for 
worship. 

The stipends of the Dissenting ministers are dependent upon 
the promise, affection, or liberality of their people, although gene- 
rally paid according to the amount which has been specified. 

The population of the parish, as taken in March 1836, and re- 
ported' to the Religious Instruction Commissioners, without chal- 
lenge, in 1838, was as follows : — 

1. Belonging to the Established Church, . _ • • 7006 

2. Known to belong to other religious denominations, . . y7/D 

3. Mot known to belong to any religious denomination, . niii 

Total, . 17,286 

Since that period, great changes have taken place; but, from 
an ecclesiastical census taken by me in 1841, according to the 
Government census of that year, and from information recently 
obtained, I think the following may be regarded as at least an 
approximation to the present number of persons, of all ages, be- 
longing to the different religious denominations :—

Divine service, it is believed, has been generally well attended 
in the different churches, according to the number acknowledged 
to belong to them, till within these last two years, when, chiefly 
from the poverty caused by the long depression of trade, it has 
in most of them considerably fallen off. 

A missionary Mr Joseph Hay has been employed during 
these last two or three years in visiting the town of Dunfermline. 
His services meet with much acceptance. He receives from L.40 
to L.50 of salary, paid by the inhabitants generally, without regard 
to religious denomination. He belongs to the United Secession. 

Religious Societies. — There are a Bible and a Sabbath School 
Society in the parish. Sums are likewise raised privately and by 
collections for the support of native missionaries and of Female 
Education in India. 

The Dissenting congregations collect annually for missionary 
purposes. 

The Abbey parish church collects regularly for each of the five 
Schemes of the General Assembly, as well as occasionally for 
other religious and charitable purposes ; the average annual 
amount of which for seven years, viz. 1836-42 inclusive, has been 
nearly L.50. It besides collected, previous to the commence- 
ment of the legal assessment in 1839, about L.120 annuallyj for 
the ordinary parochial and extraordinary poor ; but since that pe- 
riod, such collections have been reduced to about a third of that sum. 

The St Andrew's and North Churches have also made collec- 
tions for several of the Assembly's Schemes, and other religious 
and useful purposes. 

Education. — The total number of schools, in 1814, in the ori- 
ginal or quoad civilia parish, exclusive of North Queensferry, was 
82. There is no parochial, but there is one burgh school. Of 
the others, there are 15 partly endowed, and 6 unendowed. One 
school in town is supported, in part, by a society of ladies. The 
endowment in general consists either of a salary or a free school- 
room, or one or both of these, and a free dwelling-house. The 
unendowed schools are entirely on the teachers' own adventure. 
The total number of teachers at all these schools was 37, and of 
scholars, exclusive of those attending evening schools, 2622, or 



902 



FlFESHIllE. 



about 1 in 7i of the population, a considerable improvement since 
March 1842, when it was only about 1 in 8. 

There are two infant and five female schools in the parish. 
There is connected with the large female school in High Street 
Dunfermline, a deposit fund, for aiding Ihe poor, in procuring 
clothes, one-third more being added to the amount of their own 
contributions, and repaid in clothing. 

At the RoUand, or Priori/ Lane School, there are between 180 
or 190 children taught, almost all of the working and poorer clas- 
ses, the fee for English reading being only 2s. per quarter. It is 
under the direction of the magistrates and council, who, by a late 
arrangement with the burgh creditors, hold it as trustees for the in- 
stitution, unaffectable now for burgh debts. 

At the MacLean School, Golfdrum, opened in 1842, the fees are 
on a low and graduated scale, to suit the working and poorer classes. 

There are from 30 to 40 children taught gratuitously at this 
school, on a legacy of the late Rev. Allan M'Lean, minister of 
the parish, out of whose funds, with some aid from Government, 
this educational establishment was erected. The legacy consists 
of a dwelling-house and some ground, both adjacent to the school; 
the rent and feus of which go to the purpose specified. It is un- 
der the management of the kirk-session of the Abbey Church. 

The children taught gratis receive the same branches of edu- 
cation with those who pay. ' The total number attending the 
schools is about 200. 

At all the collieries there are excellent schools, and as the pay- 
ments are now made universal and compulsory, there is a much 
more regular attendance than formerly. 

A few years ago, four or five deaf and dumb children, belonging 
to the parish, were taught in Rolland School for two years and a 
half, by a deaf and dumb young woman, also a native of it, who 
bad previously received a good education in the Edinburgh In- 
stitution. The experiment, which was undertaken by the writer, 
from inability to procure funds for sending so many of these help- 
less children to a public institution, and persevered in by him amid 
many discouragements, succeeded far beyond his expectations, and 
evinced the entire practicability of the deaf and dumb teaching 
others, in the same unhappy condition. The want of a sufficient 
supply of suitable books and other materials prevented the expe- 
riment being carried to its full extent ; but funds coming to be at 
his disposal, from a bequest of his late colleague, some of he chil-

dren were sent to the deaf and dumb institution in Glasgow, who 
made very rapid progress in their farther education, and in reh- 
gious knowledge and character. 

Literature. — The Dunfermline Library was instituted on the 
26th of February 1789, and contains nearly 3000 volumes, the 
property of the shareholders, and embracing standard works ni 
till the departments of general knowledge. 

There is also a Tradesmen's and Mechanics' Library, being a 
union of two libraries, one of the Tradesmen's, instituted in 1808, 
and the other belonging to the Mechanics' Institution, which was 
joined to it in 1832. The united library contains about 2000 
volumes, well selected in all the departments of science and art, 
moral and political philosophy, history, theology, &amp;c. 

There is also a Circulating Library kept at Bridge Street, by 
Mr Miller, bookseller. 

The Abbey, St Andrew's, and some other congregations in 
town, have good libraries of religious books connected with them. 

A Scientific Association was formed in 1834, which has always 
been popular, and the admission ticket being low, the attendance 
has been numerous. Useful, and at times interesting and attrac- 
tive, courses of lectures have been delivered each winter, in one 
of the Dissenting churches, since its commencements 

Dunfermline has one public reading-room in the Town-Hall, 
three printing-offices, and four booksellers. There are two 
monthly advertising papers, containing also some general informa- 
tion, published alternately, once a-fortnight, the one named the 
" Dunfermline Advertiser," and the other the " Dunfermline 
Journal," each having a circulation of about 3000. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — A Poor's House has been 
erected by the Poor's Board in the upper part of the Town Green, 
east from the burgh. It is supported by the ordinary legal as- 
sessment, and the revenue arising from Reid's Mortification, a 
property bequeathed by John Reid, shopkeeper in Dunfermline, 
in a deed dated 17th April 1776, for the relief of poor house- 
holders and other persons, who had once been in good worldly 
circumstances, but which was, by an express provision in said 
deed, to be applied to a poor's-house or orphan-house, when built 
in the parish. The rental of this property exceeds L.100 an- 
nually. The poor's-house accommodates about 130 inmates of 
various classes.

FIFESUIUE. 



Scots L.33, 6s. 8d. sterling, the money found in the poor's box 
at the death of Mr Grame, the last Episcopal clergyman of Dun- 
fermline, was, by the Justices of the Peace, Heritors, and Town- 
Council, mortified in the hands of the Town-Council, for the use 
of the poor. The town, at the same time, came under an obli- 
gation to pay the interest yearly — one half to the poor of the 
burgh, and the other half to the poor in the landward part of the 
parish. On 19th April 1757, the town paid L,50 Scots, as in- 
terest for five years, to a meeting of heritors and session, which 
was forthwith ordered to be paid to the poor in the landward part 
of the parish. Whether, or how it has been subsequently applied, 
I have not been able to ascertain. 

Jermin's Mortification. — The donor and original amount of 
this bequest seem at present equally unknown, but it is also in 
the hands ofthe Town Council, and small payments have at dif- 
ferent periods been made from it to the poor, as in 1829 of L.5, 
in 1830 and 1832 of L.l, l4s., and in 1832 of 17s. id. No 
payments have been made since the trust commenced in 1835. 

St Leonardos Hospital. — This is the most ancient charitable 
institution now in the parish, but the exact date of it has not been 
ascertained. The object of it was the maintenance of eight 
widows, each of whom was entitled to four bolls of meal, four bolls 
of malt, eight loads of coal now converted into 4d. per load, 
eight lippies of fine wheat, eight lippies of groats dressed oats, 
and, according to one account, also fourteen loads of turf yearly, 
with a chamber in the Hospital, and a, small garden. Some of 
them had also at one time 2s. silver yearly to buy pins. The pro- 
vision for them is payable from the produce of sixty-four acres of 
land, in the immediate vicinity of the place where the Hospital 
once stood. The average annual amount received by each of them, 
for the last five years, has been L.8, 9s. 3d., with a small deduc- 
tion for collecting and public assessments, and Id. for pin money. 

Pitreavie's Hospital. — In the year 1675, Sir Henry Wardlaw 
of Pitreavie, Baronet, " for implement and fulfilling of several 
vows, promises, and engagements, made by him before God, after 
great mercies received, and for certain other good causes, motives, 
and considerations," instituted an hospital at the village of Mas- 
terton, in the south-eastern part of the parish, a house of four 
rooms, still remaining, in favour of four widows, " women of 
honest fame, relicts of honest husbands, who live on the ground 
of Pitreavie, or other ground belonging to him and iiis succes- 



DUNFEUMLINE.

sors," and failing widows of this description such other honest 
women as the patron shall please to prefer. Each of the widows 
was to have a chamber in the hospital, and six bolls of meal 
yearly, or one half oats, the other bear, at the option of the 
patron. The eighth auchtand part of the lands of Masterton 
was burdened with the provision of these twenty-four bolls victual. 

Friendly Societies. — In 1815 there were twelve Friendly So- 
cieties in the parish, and the number increased afterwards ; but a 
few years ago most of them were found to have been formed upon 
a very insecure basis, and they are now almost all extinct. 

Those which remain are the following: — \ 

\st, " The ancient Society of Gardeners, in and about Dun- 
fermline." This is understood to be the most ancient Gardeners' 
Society existing. The exact date of its institution is unknown, 
but it existed, as appears from its records, as early at least as the 
16th October 1716. 

'2d, Dunfermline Philanthropic Society. — This Society was 
constituted 17th March 1815, and its articles were confirmed at 
Cupar on the 4th March 1817, and revised 1st November 1835. 
With the exception of the Society of Gardeners, this is the only 
one in town which has survived the fall of the numerous similar 
societies which previously existed, in regard at least to the sick- 
ness scheme. 

3. Dunfermline Equitable Friendly Institution.— -lKis was be- 
gun 9th February 1827, and confirmed at Cupar on the 28th 
March 1831. 

th. There are many other strictly funeral societies, one of 
which, entitled " The Woodhead Street Benevolent Funeral So- 
ciety," was instituted 26th January 1821, and confirmed 21st May 
1833. 

bth, There are also " Yearly Societies " in the town of Dun- 
fermhne, both for sick and funeral purposes, the constitution of 
which is peculiar. Each member pays not less than Is. weekly, 
the whole of which he is entitled to receive back at the end of 
the year, if not previously paid. These societies are safe, and 
have been found very beneficial to the working classes. 

6th, There are also societies called " Menages," on the same 
principle as the yearly societies, but without the provision for sick 
and funeral expenses. 

llh, Malcolm Canmore Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd 
Fellotvs was instituted here on the 19th April 1842, .in connec-

tion with the Manchester Unity. It has assumed " Malcolm 
Canmore " into its title, in memory of the Scottish monarch, who 
was so closely connected with this place. 

8th, Rechabites. — A Tent of the independent new order of this 
race of persons, named the " Robert the Bruce " Tent, was 
formed in Dunfermline 1841. The principal feature of their 
character is, that they will drink neither wine nor strong drink ; 
and, in a spirit of brotherly kindness, they are associated for the 
purpose of granting assistance during sickness and at bereavements 
by death. 

9th, Charleston Friendly Relief Society, instituted 1784. 
IQth, Charleston Sick Fund, instituted about 1841. 
Wth, Limekilns Merchant Seamen s Fund, Sl national one, in- 
stituted by act of Parliament, in August 1834. 

\th, Limekilns United Seamen's Society, instituted about 
three years ago. 

\Qth, At Charleston and Limekilns, there are also Funeral 
Societies — the one at the former village consisting of about 200, 
and at the latter of 300 members. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Till 1815, there was a voluntary 
assessment laid annually upon the heritors resident and non-resi- 
dent, in proportion to their respective valued rents, and made 
over to the kirk-session, to be distributed to the poor on their 
list, among whom were a few Dissenters. The average amount 
of this assessment for ten years, extending from January 1807 to 
January 1817, was nearly L.300, and the average annual amount 
of collections in the parish church and chapel of ease, during the 
same period, was L.71, from which, and the money obtained from 
burying ground, along with the rents of a little property in the 
hands of the kirk-session, about 100 paupers were supported. 
The Dissenters at that time generally maintained their own poor. 
In 1815, a Voluntary Association for support of the poor was 
formed, managed by a committee of heritors, ministers, and in- 
habitants of all religious denominations ; the funds of which were 
raised by subscriptions from the heritors and householders, from 
annual collections in the chapel of ease and dissenting churches, 
and from one general annual collection, at a sermon preached for 
the purpose, in one of the largest churches. The kirk-session 
did not enter into this Association, but retained their own collec- 
tions and property, the proceeds of which they distributed among 
as many poor of the Establishment as these funds would allow of.

• 3i months, viz. from 2d February to 15th May 1841, are omitted in the calcu- 
lation, the Board having found it expedient to change, at that period, the time of 
reckoning the commencement of the year, making it from Whitsunday instead of 
Candlemas. 

f Of these eight, three are at Dundee and two at Edinburgh Asylums, while three 
are in the poor's house, having been brought to it from Dundee this last summer. 
Another was added to the poor's house in December 1843; in all at present, 9. 

Previous to the legal assessracnt in 1839, the whole ordinary collections for the

S This assessment included a sum of L.500 per annum, applicable towards the 
erection of a Poor's house. This was continued till May 1843. A revenue, some- 



what exceeding L. 100 annually, derived from Reid's mortification, now becomes 
available for the Poor's house, since its erection in 184.3.

A new and more commodious prison, the want of which has 
been long felt, is nearly finished, at the north-west corner of the 
town-green. It consists of three floors, each having six cells for 
criminal prisoners, well ventilated, and heated by flues. One on 
each flat has a fire-place. There are two commodious cells, with 
fire-places, for civil prisoners, and three apartments for the gaoler 
and matron, besides kitchen, bath-room, &amp;c., for the prison. 
There are three corridors, or long passages, for exercise. The 
means for a complete classification and separation of prisoners are 
afforded, and the system, it is intended, will be put in force. 
The site contains two imperial acres, all of which will be enclos- 
ed, and part of it will be appropriated to an airing court. The 
new prison has been erected, and, like the old since 1840, will be

there are perhaps few trees remaining of the ancient Forest of 
Dunfermline, in which Sir William Wallace found a safe retreat 
when pursued by his enemies.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. ANSTRUTHER TAYLOR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Etymology, -c— The parish of Carnbee seems to have 
borne the same name in Roman Catholic times as at present, for 
mention is made of it at a very early date in the chartulary of the 
Abbey of Dunfermline, and it remained attached to that reli- 
gious house till the abolition of Popery. A portion of the teinds 
is still paid to the lordship of Dunfermline, to which, on its 
erection, all the revenues of the abbey were conveyed by a grant 
from the Crown. It also appears, from « the Bulk of the Uni- 
versal Kirk," that a Mr David Wemyss sat as member of As- 
sembly for the kirk of Carnbee in the first General Assembly after 
the Reformation, held in 1563. The etymology of the name is 
given in the former Statistical Account as being derived from two 
Gaelic words, earn and bee, the first signifying birch, and the se- 
cond hill ; and the appearance of the locality, as well as certain 
names yet existing, accord with this etymology. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The parish of Carnbee is bounded on 
the north by Cameron, Denino, and part of Crail; on the west, by 
Kilconquhar ; on the south, by Abercrombie and St Monans, Pit- 
tenweem, West Anstruther, and Kilrenny; andon the east, by Kil- 
renny and Crail. Its form is nearly a parallelogram, measuring 
about five miles in length, by four in breadth. The southern part 
of the parish is intersected from west to east by the turnpike-road 
leading from Colinsburgh by Kellie toll, towards Crail, which enters 
the parish at Pitcorthie, and passes out of it at the crossing of the 
Anstruther and St Andrews turnpike-road, at Pitkeerie wood, be- 
ing a distance of nearly five miles; while the northern part of it is 
intersected m the same direction by the turnpike-road leading from 
Cupar to Crail, which enters the parish at Lathockar bridge, and, 
passing by Lingo and Lochty, leaves it about half a mile west-

FIFESHIUE. 



ward of the point where this road crosses the Anstruther and St 
Andrews turnpike, at Drumrack. There is also a road which 
stretches from Balcarres Den, the western boundary of the pa- 
rish, eastward through the middle of it, to the before- named 
turnpike at Burnside. These, with the cross roads which run 
from south to north intersecting them, extend to about 21 miles; 
making about 9 miles of turnpike, 6 miles of statute labour, and 
6 miles of roads not upon the turnpike or statute labour lists. 

Topographical Appearances. — There is a very marked difference 
between the south and north sides of the parish, which is inter- 
sected for almost its whole length, from east to west, by a ridge 
of high land, dividing it into two nearly equal parts. This ridge 
at several places, such as Carnbee Law, Kellie Law, Baldutho 
Craig, and Gunner Law, rises into hills, varying from 500 to 800 
feet above the level of the sea, and commands a most extensive 
and beautiful view of the whole Firth of Forth, the Lothians, and 
greater part of the coast of Fife. Kellie Law is the highest point 
of this ridge, being about 810 feet above the level of the sea, and 
three miles distant from it. From its summit the view extends 
northward, comprehending St Andrews Bay, the Firth of Tay, 
vind the greater part of the county of Angus, with the Grampians 
in the distance. It was one of the stations chosen by Captain 
Colby, when making the Trigonometrical Survey of Scotland ; and 
he and his party of Engineers were encamped upon it for the six 
or eight weeks spent in taking their observations. 

Soil and Climate. — The southern division of the parish, stretch- 
ing from east to west, through its whole length, consists chiefly of 
a stiff clay soil upon a closely retentive subsoil, with an excellent 
exposure, and in a very high state of cultivation. The northern 
division is inferior as to soil, and still more so as to chmate, — the 
elevation of a considerable part of it being nearly the same with 
the ridge already spoken of. At certain places, indeed, such as 
parts of Cassingray, Lingo, and Craigloon, the soil is excellent ; 
but the elevation being considerable, the whole range is better 
adapted for pasturage than corn, and is in general so laid out. 

Hydrography. — The parish is well supplied with springs of ex- 
cellent water, and it is intersected by several small streams; those 
on the south side of the ridge finding their way by different courses 
into the Dreil, which runs into the sea at West Anstruther, while 
those on the north side join the Kenly, which runs eastward by 
Denino, and falls into St Andrews Bay.

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geological construction of the 
parish and the character of the minerals correspond with the di- 
vision above referred to, — sandstone prevailing in the south, and 
whinstone in the north. Coal is found at several places, and at 
present there are two collieries, — one at Kellie, and another at 
Cassingray. The Kellie consists of two main seams of cherry 
coal, distinguished among the workmen as the back and the fore, 
—the one being 7 feet thick, and the other 5 feet. The metals 
cut through in the engine pit are, 3 feet of clay, 9 feet of faiks, 
12 feet of till mixed with faiks, 12 feet of gray faiks, 6 feet of 
white blaise or till, 12 feet of freestone pavement, 2 feet of hard 
white sandstone, 6 feet of till with gray faiks, 6 feet of freestone, 
5 feet of soft till or blaise, 1 feet of hard stone mixed with lime, 
5 feet of gray faiks, 6i feet of pelt, 2 feet of hard sandstone 
mixed with whinstone, 18 feet of freestone pavement, 6 feet of 
gray faiks, 3 feet of soft blue till, 2 feet of limestone roof above 
the coal, 5 feet of cherry coal. The price of this coal at the pit 
is Is. per load of four cwt. It is found at 21 fathoms, with a dip 
of 5 to 1 west by north. From 15 to 20 men are employed at the 
works. 

The Cassingray coal consists of 6 regular seams, and 1 seam 
found occasionally 2 to 3 feet thick when it holds, and of excel- 
lent quality. The first regular seam is the marl coal, dipping to 
the south, 3 feet thick, and very near the surface. The second 
is a splint coal, about 14 inches thick, and found at from 7 to 8 
fathoms. The third is also a splint coal, 3 feet 10 inches thick, 
of excellent quality, and found at 38 fathoms. The fourth is si- 
milar in quality, and 3 feet thick. The fifth is what is called 
the scarrot loft, and almost close to the black coal. The sixth, 
agam, is a spHnt coal, 4 fathoms below the scarrot loft, 18 inches 
thick, and of the best quality. The dip of all these seams is as 
1 in 6, but m different directions,— the coal on the north side of 
Cassingray dipping to the north-west, and that on the south dip- 
pmg due south, while it is to be observed that the crops of both 
approach very near to each other, not far from the place where 
the pigeon house now stands. The metals cut throuo-h in the 
engine pit are 2 fathoms of clay, 15 fathoms of sandstone, 5 fa- 
thoms 2 feet of till or shale, 22 inches of limestone, 11 fathoms 
of sandstone, 4 feet of till, 15 inches of a black stone called pelt, 
and 7 inches of coarse parrot above the coal. The price of this 
coal at the pit is Is. 2d. per load of four cwt. There are 38 col-

Hers, 3 labourers, and 2 engine-men employed at the work, which 
has recently been let to an enterprising tenant. 

Limestone of good quality is found in various places, and has 
been successfully wrought at Over Kellie, Baldutho, and Gibliston. 

There are several excellent freestone quarries, one of them yield- 
ing good pavement. All these freestone quarries lie in the southern 
section of the parish, — :the ridge formerly spoken of as running 
through the heart of the parish, consisting almost entirely of whin- 
stone, and, with some few exceptions, such as at Cassingray, the 
whole northern section may be referred to the same formation. 

II. — Civil History. 

Carnbee originally belonged to the Abbey of Dunfermline, and, 
when it was formed into a temporal lordship, the patronage went 
along with the teinds and other church property. The name of 
Melville, Laird of Carnbee, appears in public documents as early 
as 1466, — the property having been acquired by that family in the 
reign of Robert the Bruce, and remaining in it till it was sold by 
Sir James Melville in 1 598. One of them was killed at the 
battle of Flodden field, and honourable mention is made of them 
both before and after the Reformation. Subsequently Sir James 
Galloway, created Lord Dunkeld by Charles II., held the lands 
and the patronage. Carnbee Place as the old mansion-house 
was called, and which was only taken down in 1813, was long the 
residence of the family of Lord Dunkeld, whose names are often 
mentioned in the parish records. The third and last Lord Dun- 
keld joined Viscount Dundee at the battle of Killiecrankie, after 
which he was attainted, and ied in the French service. The pa- 
tronage has since passed into the family of Kellie, and is now, 
along with the lands, vested in that of Balcaskie. 

Eminent Men. — The following is a list of distinguished persons 
connected with the parish : Sir Thomas Erskine, first Earl of 
Kellie, who bore a conspicuous part in suppressing the Gowrie 
conspiracy ; Dr George Sibbald of Gibliston, uncle of Sir Robert 
Sibbald, the historian of Fife, and a very celebrated physician ; 
Sir William Bruce, the celebrated architect ; Thomas the sixth, 
or more generally known as the musical Earl of Kellie ; the eccen- 
tric Hugo Arnot of Balcormo, the author of " State Trials," an 
«' Essay upon Nothing," and other works ; Archibald Constable, 
the celebrated bookseller ; and if talent and success in mercantile 
affairs, joined to personal worth and a long series of benefits con- 
ferred upon the parish, should place any one in the list of distin- 
guished persons who have been connected with it, may be men-

III. — Population. 

The population of Carnbee has decreased considerably. In 
1752 it was 1290. At the date of the last Statistical Account it 
was 1041 ; in 1811, 1098; in 1821, 1048; in 1831, 1079; and 
in 1841, 1043. The decrease since 1752 is to be ascribed to the 
change in the system of farming. 

The average number of communicants is 375 ; of baptisms, 28 ; 
of marriages, 5 ; and of deaths, 13. 

IV. — Industry. 
The parish is strictly agricultural. It is at present divided into 
32 farms, the largest of which is 390 Scots acres, and the smallest 
about 40, the average being about 150. The system of manage- 
ment is that generally pursued on the stiff clay lands of this part 
of Fife, as already described in the reports of parishes similarly 
situated, and it is therefore unnecessary to give a detailed account 
of it. The same remark will apply to the produce, rates of wages, 
and the general e.xpense of farm operations. The rent ranges 
from L. 1, 8s. to L. 3, 2s. per Scotch acre. Furrow-draining is 
going on vigorously, and cannot fail to effect a most decided im- 
provement on a soil such as that of which the parish chiefly con- 
sists. Almost the whole of it has been limed.

V. — Parochial Economv. 

The east end of the parish is within two miles of Anstruther, a 
sea-port, corn-market, and post-town. Pittenweem, also a sea- 
port and post-town, is within two and a-half miles of the church ; 
and Colinsburgh, a corn-market and post-town, is within a mile of 
the west side of the parish. The church and manse are about 
eight miles distant from St Andrews. The produce is shipped 
chiefly at Anstruther, but also at Pittenweem and Elie. There 
are two corn mills and one lint mill in the parish. 

The church is not centrical, being near the eastern extremity 
of the parish. It was built in 1793, and is large and commodious, 
containing accommodation for about 500. The chapel at Largo 
Ward affords accommodation to the inhabitants of the north-west 
part of the parish. 

The manse and offices were built in 1820, and are in all re- 
spects substantial and commodious. The glebe is about 15 Scots 
acres. It is valued at L. 30 per annum. The stipend is 16 chal- 
ders, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The teinds of 
the parish amount to 37 chalders. 

There has not hitherto been any dissenting meeting-house in 
the parish, the few Dissenters who reside within the bounds at- 
tending the Relief chapel at Pittenweem, or the Burgher chapel 
at Largo Ward. A Free Church meeting-house is at present 
erecting at Arncroach, but it would be premature to pass any opi- 
nion as to the support which it will receive from the parishioners. 

It has already been stated, that Mr David Wemyss represented 
the kirk of Carnbee in the first General Assembly. In the same 
Assembly he is also mentioned among such as were thought best 
qualified for the preaching of the word, and ministering of the 
sacraments at St Andrews, and he was afterwards settled there.

• The above list I received from the Rev. H. Scott of West Anstruther, who with 
great labour has made up similar lists for most of the parishes in Scotland. His col-

attention of some of our book societies.

Education. — There is one parochial, one private, and one fe- 
male school. The salary of the parochial teacher is the maxi- 
mum, with house and garden, and, in addition to this, he has a 
portion of land at Over Kellie, yielding a rent of L.20. The 
number of scholars may be stated at 70. The teacher of the fe- 
male school has a salary of L.IO, and a free house and school 
room, together with the school fees. The number of scholars, 
35. The teacher of the private school depends altogether upon

also a Sabbath school. 

Registers. — The earhest of the registers extant is of date 1650. 
They have been well kept. - 

Poor's Funds. — The only property vested in the kirk-session 
for the relief of the poor is L.320, L.lOO of which was bequeathed 
to them by the Rev. Mr Thomson. A legacy of 1000 dollars 
has, within the last few months, been left to them by the late 
Joseph Pitcairn, Esq. of New York, for the same purpose. The 
interest of the above sum, the collections at the church doors, 
parish dues, and a voluntary contribution from the heritors, has 
hitherto been sufficient to relieve the wants of the ordinary and 
occasional poor, as will be seen by the following statement :

produce of all kinds of corn must be at least four times greater, 
while the number of cattle reared and fattened is so much greater 
as scarcely to admit of a comparison. A great change has also 
taken place in the houses of all classes within the bounds of the 
parish, and perhaps a still greater in the farrn-steadings. These 
are all of the best description, two of them having thrashing-mills 
driven by steam, six by water, and twenty-three by horses.

PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. A. WILSON, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The present parish of Falkland embraces what was 
formerly Kilgour and Falkland. The former name, like many 
in the neighbourhood, is of Celtic origin : Ceil-gor, " the Plea- 
sant Church ;" the Lomond, or Lois-monadh, " the Hill Fort- 
ress." The name Falkland, however, or Faukland, as it often 
occurs in old charters, is considered of Gothic or Teutonic ori- 
gin, from Falk, " a species of hawk," referring to the once fa- 
vourite amusement of hawking. As a royal residence, indeed, 
Falkland sefems to have been chiefly chosen with a view to the 
pleasures of the chase. Even after the union of the Crown of 
Scotland with that of England, both King James I. and Charles I. 
enjoyed that pastime in the wood or park of Falkland. This name, 
at first successively given to the manor, castle, and palace is now 
extended to the town and parish. 

Boundaries and Extent. — The parish of Falkland is bounded 
on the north by Auchtermuchty ; on the east, by Kettle and 
Markinch ; on the south, by Leslie ; and on the west, by Port- 

 The Lomond, according to Jamieson, is derived from the Welsh dialect of the 
Celtic, from Llo, " what is raised or ejected," and mient, " a mound or mount." 
Falkland, as it stands in the charter of Malcolm IV., is Falcclden which might also 
be referred to the Celtic, as if Fal-aighc-lcana, " the Chieftain or King's Hind- 
m.eadow."

moak and Stratbmiglo. The greatest length of the parish is 
about 6 miles, and the greatest breadth 4. 

Geologij. — This forms an extremely interesting portion of the 
statistics of the parish. The structure of the Lomonds exhibits, 
in a condensed outline, the geognosy of the entire district ; while 
their isolated and elevated position renders the various strata a 
subject of comparatively easy investigation. The builder, and 
agriculturist, and miner have been long acquainted with their rich 
mineral stores ; nor did the cupidity of the miner, in a former age, 
want materials on which to exert itself. A very brief sketch can 
only here be given. 

The old red sandstone skirts the northern boundary of the pa- 
rish, and constitutes the lowest of the sedimentary deposits. The 
best sections of this rock are seen near to Strathmiglo, where it is 
of great thickness, and is much prized for building material. 
Some of the beds are extremely fine and close-grained ; others 
assume a brecciated or conglomerated character. It abounds in 
organic remains, chiefly belonging to the genus Holoptychius. 
There are also innumerable spherical spots, of a whitish colour, 
diffused throughout the mass. This rock dips generally to the 
south-east, at an angle of 10°, — the outcrop of the beds rising to- 
wards the Ochils. 

Resting upon the old red, beds of yelloiu sandstone next occur, 
which are likewise of great thickness, and contain organic remains 
similar to the former. The two deposits are conformable in their 
dip and inclination. On the farm of Lappa, their junction is ex- 
posed in a rivulet which issues from Glenvale, — a deep ravine in- 
tersecting the Lomond ridge towards the western extremity of the 
parish. The lower beds are of various colours, — red, brown, blue, 
white, and yellow alternating with each other ; and the whole in- 
termixed with thin bands of clay, containing nodules of limestone. 
The yellow sandstone, as well as the old red on which it rests, 
traverses the valley of Stratheden, passes through the shires of 
Kinross and Clackmannan, and has lately become the subject of 
much geological interest and speculation. Next to Dura Den, 
towards the eastern extremity of the county, the parish of Falk- 
land contains some of its finest sections. 

The two rocks now described constitute the base of the Lomond 
ridge. The superincumbent materials all belong to the under 
coal formation, and consist of the usual beds of sandstone, shale, 
ironstone, coal, and limestone. The lower beds of sandstone are 



922 



FIFESHIRE. 



of a whitish colour, of a fine hard texture, and are from 500 to 
600 feet thick. There are three thin beds of coal, which are 
little sought after, of inferior quality, and do not pay the expense 
of working. They vary from a few inches to about a foot and a 
half in thickness. The limestone consists of"two main beds about 
ten feet thick, is highly crystalline in its structure, and of various 
shades of grayish-white. The blue, as it is termed by the work- 
men, is very hard, is blasted with gunpowder, and abounds, as well 
as the lime, in corals, madrepores, encrinites, and shells. The 
limestone has a slight inclination to the south-east, and dips under 
the western peak, which rises above it to the height of 500 feet. 
The peak consists of amygdaloidal greenstone, passing towards 
the summit into a grayish-black basalt ; and underneath the lime- 
stone there is a dark crystalline greenstone, probably 100 feet 
thick, which splits up into tabular masses, and presents a bold 
mural clilf towards the northern face of the hill. The table-land 
which stretches to the East Lomond exhibits, in various places, the 
protrusion of the ignigenous rock through the sedimentary strata, 
which are, in consequence, a good deal altered and disturbed. 
The limestone passes round the cone of the hill at an elevation 
above the level of the sea of nearly 1200 feet. This is the high- 
est point where fossil organic remains appear in Fifeshire; there 
is no soil or covering upon the limestone in many places ; and yet 
on the upper surface of a bed of blae, of a few inches thick, shells 
are found of forms the most perfect and beautiful, uninjured, and 
almost uninfluenced by their long exposure to atmospheric agen- 
cies. The limestone trains round the south-eastern acclivity, and, 
after several shifts, crops out near Leslie ; whence we lose all 
trace of it, until it again emerges near the bottom of the valley at 
Fothar. 

Boulders of greenstone, granite, and gneiss, and other primi- 
tive rocks, are strewed over the high mainland, as well as sloping 
sides of the Lomond ridge. Some of them are of great dimen- 
sions, and upwards of twenty tons weight. The greenstone boul- 
ders are not much rounded, and have obviously not been trans- 
ported far from their parent mass. 

A vein of galena occurs on the south side of the Easter Lomond. 
It was discovered and wrought about the year 1783, and is de- 
scribed in the notices of the period as rich in silver ore. But it 
has little claim, we believe, to be regarded as argentifcrovs. Its 
line of bearing is nearly north-east by south-west. It intersects 

3

the limestone noticed above, and penetrates the hill at the farm- 
house of Hanging Myre. The mine seems to have been carried 
' to a considerable extent ; but no records appear to have been kept 
or can now be found of the results of the operations. Two similar 
veins occur in the county, in the parishes of Kembach and Inver- 
keithing, situated among the same series of rocks, and having the 
same general line of bearing. The ore in all of them is partly 
massive, and partly in very regular hexahedral crystals. 

Zoology and Botany. — The wood of Falkland, which was once 
the resort of the fallow deer [Cervus dama and the hunting-place 
of kings, has long ago had no other existence than in the archives 
of the past. This wood, vphich chiefly consisted of oak, was, even 
during the regency of the Queen- Mother of the unfortunate Mary, 
in a state of decay ; and, about a century after, Cromwell cut 
down of it what suited his purpose for erecting a citadel at Perth. 
The fallow deer, as well as the ancient wood and forest, have dis- 
appeared; and the Lomondsare now only ranged by that elegant 
native species, the roebuck {Cervus capriolus. Five of this species 
were killed this season on the Lomond hills. 

Towards the summit of the East Lomond, which rises 1466 
feet above the level of the sea, the Vaccinmm Vitis Idcea red 
whortleberry grows plentifully, and bears ripe scarlet fruit abun- 
dantly. On the ruins of the palace, situated at the northern base 
of this hill, the Cheiranthus ckeh-i wall-flower grows as in a na- 
tive climate ; and the abundance with which it covers the rocky 
shores near Burntisland, may give it the undisputed claim of being 
here completely naturalized, if not native. 

IL — Civil History. 
Falkland has obtained great celebrity, from having been in 
former times one of the favourite residences of the Scottish mo- 
narchs. The first mention made of it in history, is in the book 
of the Priory of St Andrews. Sibbald, quoting from this book 
states, that in the fifth year of the reign of David I., Contantine, 
Earl of Fife, and Macbeth, Thane of Falkland, gathered toge- 
ther an army to prevent Robert de Burgoner from forcing the 
Culdees of St Andrews and Lochleven to give him the half of the 
lands of Kirkness, in which they succeeded. 

 In an act of Scott. Pari. a. d. 1553, the following finding occurs : " It was fundia 

bo ane assysc, that the said uiod of Falkland, for the maist jmlri t/inirof, mas anld, 
failzeil, and dccnijit, and meil to he cultit da-vne for the comoun Weill of the realmc,, 
and to be parkit, hanit, and keepit of new for policie thairof."

Falkland afterwards became the property of the Crown ; but, 
in the time of Malcolm IV., it fell into the possession of Duncan, 
the sixth Earl of Fife. Duncan married Ada, Malcolm's niece, 
and Falkland formed a part of her marriage dowry. It remained 
in the possession of this powerful family until the year J 371, when 
it passed into the hands of Robert Stewart, Earl of Monteith, af- 
terwards Duke of Albany and Regent of Scotland. The Castle 
or Tower of Falkland is mentioned in an indenture between Iso- 
bel, Countess of Fife, and this celebrated statesman, whom she 
acknowledg:es as her heir. The said Earl, it is said, «« shall have 
in his keeping the Castle of Falkland, with the forest of it, and a 
constable shall be placed there by him as he pleaseth, and the 
said Countess may stay within the tower when she pleaseth, and 
the whole village of Falkland, over against the said tower, shall 
be set in tack." 

" Falkland," says Dr Jamieson, " had formerly a designation 
which, as far as I have observed, occurs in no other instance. 
Speaking of the forfeiture of the Earl of Fife, Sibbald says, ' It 
was before that called the Castle or Mar of Falkland, and was 
one of the seats of the Macduffs.' 1 have met with no word that 
seems to have any probable affinity, unless we should view it as 
softened in pronunciation from "'elsh, magwyr, ' what is raised 
up, a structure, a wall, a building, a house.' "  

Falkland first became the residence of the Court during the 
regency of Albany. Robert III., a feeble monarch, entrusted 
him with the entire administration of the kingdom, and hence 
manerium nostrum de Fatvklancl, as he termed it, became virtually 
the seat of Government.f But when the estates of Murdoch, 
the second Duke, were forfeited in 1424, Falkland reverted fo 
the Crown. 

While the old Castle or Mar of Falkland belonged to Albany, 
it became the scene of one of the most painful tragedies J in the 
history of Scotland. David, Duke of Rothesay, eldest son of 
Robert III., and heir apparent to the Throne, was thrown into 
one of its dungeons by his uncle, the Duke of Albany, where he 
was starved to death in 1402. The circumstances connected 
with this event, so characteristic of the cruel and barbarous man- 

 Brown's Views of the Royal Palaces of Scotland, page 30. 

f Ten different charters yet remain, which are dated Manerium tiostri dc Faiilk- 
laiidy or simply Falkland, by Albany while Gubcnidlor or Regent. 

t In the Fair Maid of Terth, Sir Walter Scott has lent to this historical event aU 
the embellishments of poetry and romance.

ners of the times, are differently related by the Scottish historians, 
and have led to much discussion ; but the result of recent inves- 
tigations has confirmed the popular account. The Regent was 
jealous of the talents of the young Prince. He beheld in him a 
dangerous rival, whose capacity for affairs and energetic character 
might prove fatal to his own power. These fears appear to have 
been well founded, for Rothesay, while yet a very young man, 
supfilanted his uncle in the regency. The ambitious mind of 
Albany could not submit patiently to this humiliation, and the 
dissolute conduct of the unfortunate Prince soon allowed him an 
opportunity of gratifying his revenge. Rothesay was of a volup- 
tuous disposition ; he seems also to have been inconstant in his 
attachments, so that he gave just cause of offence to several fa- 
milies of rank, and created formidable enemies to himself among 
the nobility. These individuals supported Albany in his machi- 
nations against the Prince. The weak monarch, Robert III., 
was made to believe that the vicious excesses of his son were ex- 
citing popular discontent, and that it was expedient that he should 
be placed under temporary restraint. Rothesay was indignant at 
this insulting proposal, and attempted to make himself master of 
the Castle of St Andrews, and in that citadel defy his enemies. 
But in passing through Fife he was arrested by Lindsay of Rossy 
and a traitor of the name of Ramorgny, friends of Albany, by 
whom he was carried first to St Andrews and afterwards to Falk- 
land. Here he was exposed to the most barbarous treatment. 
He was thrown into a miserable dungeon, under the charge of 
two ruffians, by whom he was starved to death. His life, how- 
ever, was preserved for a few days by means so affecting and ro- 
mantic, as to remind us of some of the incidents of Roman story. 
According to Boece, Buchanan, and others, his life was for some 
days feebly sustained by means of thin cakes pushed through a 
small crevice in the wall of his dungeon by a young woman, the 
daughter of the governor, whose heart was moved by the situation 
of the unhappy Prince. But being at last found out, she was put 
to death by her father, who regarded her noble conduct as an act 
of treason towards himself. Her cruel fate did not prevent an- 
other woman, employed in the family as a wet nurse, from supply- 
ing him with milk conveyed through a long reed from her own 

 Lord.Hailes has published an original paper, throwing some light on the mys- 
terious death of this Prince, which was communicated to him hy Mr Astle, a gen- 
tleman to whom Scotland is indebted for many valuable illusirutions of her history.

breasts. She also fell a victim to her generous compassion, and 
the Prmce perished miserably. Albany gave out that he died of 
a dysentery, but the people were convinced that he had been 
foully murdered. A public inquiry was made into the matter, 
but a jury, composed of the creatures of Albany, were sure to re- 
turn a verdict of acquittal. Their report is a partial and con- 
strained testimony to Albany's innocence, and after it was re- 
turned, any further rumours unfavourable to him or to his friends 
were forbidden by a public proclamation,— a circumstance which 
fully accounts for the silence of Winton and others upon the 
subject. The Prince was buried at the Abbey of Lindores, 
where the curious may still see the stone coffin in which, it is said, 
his remains were enclosed. 

It is difficult to ascertain exactly the site of the Castle of Falk- 
land. We are disposed to believe that it stood on the mound a little 
to the north of the present edifice. The palace was begun pro- 
bably by James II., and completed by James V.f " The part now 
remaining consists of two distinct portions of building in different 
styles of architecture. The eastmost portion is two stories in 
height, and in the monastic style. On each floor there are six 
windows, square topped, and divided by mullions into two lights. 
Between the windows the front is supported by buttresses enriched 
with niches, in which statues representing the Stewart family 
were placed, the mutilated remains of which are still to be seen, 
and terminating in ornamental pinnacles, which rise considerably 
above the top of the wall. The western part of this front of the 
palace is in the castellated style, and of greater height than the 
other. It is ornamented with two round towers, between which is 
a lofty archway, which forms the entrance to the court-yard be-

Wynton does not mention the circumstances under which the Prince died, pro- 
bably for the reason mentioned in the text. 

t It is universally admitted that James V. made splendid additions to the palace, 
for his initials and the date 1 537 appear upon the walls ; but we cannot ascertain 
which of his predecessors began the structure. It appears, from a statement made 
by Beatoun of Creich, who had "the keeping of the palice of Falkland," to the Scot- 
tish Parliament in 1325, that it had then fallen into disrepair, — being " riven, and 
the thak yrof brokin." This circumstance shows that the palace, even at that period, 
was an old building. We suspect it was begun by James II., by whom a charter was 
granted at Falkland in the year 1446. Pinkerton says, Vol. ii. p. 424, James IV. 
improved or enlarged the Castle of Falkland, but he mentions no authority.

hind, and which in former times was secured by strong doors, and 
could be defended by the towers which flank it. James V. made great 
additions to the palace, and appears to have erected two ranges of 
buildings equal in size to that described on the east and north sides 
of the court-yard. As completed, therefore, by him, the palace oc- 
cupied three sides of a square court, the fourth or western side being 
enclosed by a lofty wall. The range of building on the north side 
of the court has now entirely disappeared, and of that on the east 
the bare walls alone remain, these two portions of the palace hav- 
ing been accidentally destroyed by fire in the reign of Charles II." 
On the east wing the " facade between the windows is ornament- 
ed with finely proportioned Corinthian pillars, having rich capitals, 
and above the windows are medallions presenting a series of heads 
carved in high relief, some of which are beautifully executed, and 
■would lead us to believe that more than native talent had been 
employed upon the work. On the top of the basement which 
supports the pillars, the initials of the King and of his Queen, 
Mary of Guise, are carved alternately." 

Little is said of Falkland as a royal residence before the time 
of James V. That gay but unfortunate prince was kept in re- 
straint at Falkland when a minor, by the Earl of Angus and the 
Douglasses. Angus left him there to enjoy the pleasures of the 
chase, and proceeded himself to the Lothians ; while Sir Archibald 
Douglas went to Dundee, and Sir George to St Andrews, en- 
trusting the young monarch to the charge of Douglas of Park- 
head. James embraced the opportunity to escape out of their 
hands and assert his independence. That his purpose might not 
be suspected, he ordered preparations for a splendid hunt on the 
following day. The chase was to commence at seven in the morn- 
ing, which James made the excuse for retiring early to bed, and 
Douglas, after setting the watch, followed his example. As soon 
as all was quiet in the palace, the prince, disguised as a groom, 
contrived to elude the vigilance of his guards ; went to the stables 
and saddled a fleet horse, and then, accompanied by two trusty 
followers, galloped at full speed to Stirling Castle, which he reach- 
ed by dawn of day. James, who was fond of hunting and hawk- 
ing, often returned to Falkland afterwards, that he might enjoy 
his favourite amusements. In the following passage, taken from 
an old humorous ballad which the learned ascribe to the pen of

royal retreat.

James V. died at Falkland, in December 1542, shortly after the 
disastrous affair of Solway Moss. It is alleged that he died of a 
broken heart. After this battle, says Drummond of Hawthorn- 
den, he passed in a retired manner to Fife, and from Hallyards to 
Falkland, " where he gave himself over to sorrow. No man had 
access unto him, no, not his own domestics. Now are his 
thoughts busy with revenge, now with rage against his scornful 
nobility ; long watchings, continual cares and passions, abstinence 
from food and recreation, had so extenuated his body, that, 
pierced with grief, anguish, impatience, and despair, he remained 
fixed to his bed, where he breathed his last, in the 33d year of his 
age and 32d of his reign." 

Mary of Guise, the widow of James, resided occasionally at 
Falkland during her regency, surrounded by her French soldiers. 
It was here, in the year 1 559, that she cited the Earl of Argyle, 
and James, prior of St Andrews, afterwards the celebrated Re- 
gent, to appear before her. Her daughter, the unhappy Mary, 
seems also to have been attached to this residence. She retir- 
ed to it, on several occasions, to escape from the anxiety and tur- 
moil of her distracted court, and enjoy, like her royal father, the 
pleasures of hunting and hawking. She was at Falkland in the 
month of September 1561, when Both well and the Hamiltons 
laid a plot to take away the life of her natural brother, the Earl 
of Murray, that the Queen might be completely in their power. 
Bothwell urged that the thing could easily be accomplished and the 
Queen surprised, because she was in the habit of resorting daily 
to a wood in the vicinity of Falkland, where stags were kept, and 
where she could be seized without any difficulty. 

Falkland was also honoured frequently with a visit from that 
sage monarch James VI., who took great pleasure in buck hunt- 
ing — a taste which could be amply indulged in the noble park 

 Pinkerton thinks Falkland on the Greene the title of an ancient ballad, written 
in the style of Chryst-kiik.

that lay around the palace. While he was enjoying this pastime, 
in the month of June 1592, a desperate attempt was made by the 
unprincipled Francis Earl of Bothwell and his associates to obtain 
possession of his person. " Bothwell understanding the King to be 
at quyetness in Falkland, be the secret advertisement of certayne 
courtiers, rade from the water of Esk to Falkland, accompanied by 
the Master of Gray and a goodly number of horsemen. But when 
they came to the palice, they found not sik reddeness as was sup- 
posit, bot be the contrare certayne people provydit to resist, sa 
that Bothwell was repulsit, and he, to his perpetual ignominie, 
fled away with shaymeful dreader ; and before thay departit, thay 
spulyeit the King's stable, and reft many horses bayth out of the 
town of Falkland as also furth of the park." 

A few years later 1600, James was exposed to another assault 
in the same place, for at Falkland the first scene was laid of that 
dark tragedy, known in Scottish history as the Gowrie conspi- 
racy. An account of this painful aflair was published at the time 
by royal authority. " His Majesty, having his residence at Falk- 
land, and being daily at the buck hunting, as his use is in that 
season, upon the 5th day of August 1600, raide out to the parke, 
between six and seven of the clocke in the morning, the weather 
being wonderfuU pleasant and seasonable. But before his Majes- 
tie could leape on horseback, Maister Alexander Ruthven, second 
brother to the late Earle of Gowrie, being then lighted in the 
town of Falkland, hasted him faste down to overtake his Majestie 
before his onleaping, as he did," &amp;c. He enticed James to Perth, 
and the result is well known. 

After James succeeded to the crown of England, Falkland 
ceased to be a royal residence. Charles I. slept in the palace 
once or twice, and Charles 11. also visited it; but after the de- 
parture of James, it ceased to become the scene of important 
events, and hastened to decay. Fairney of . Fairney acquired 
the heritable offices of Forester of the Woods and Muirs of 
Falkland, the lands of Nuthill, &amp;c. In 1604 Fairney sold these 
offices to Sir David Murray of Gospetrie, Lord Scone, for 4000 
merks, and about the same time James VI. gave a grant to his 
Lordship of the offices of Constable of the Castle, Forester of 
the Forest, and Ranger of the Lomonds of Falkland, on account 
of his services at Perth, 5th August 1 600. The estate then passed

iiandale, and was sold in 1658 by James Lord Annandale to John 
Earl of Athole. His successor, the Duke of Athole, sold it 
to Skene of Hallyards, from whose family it passed to the late 
Mr Bruce. Mr Bruce, immediately after he acquired the pro- 
perty, began to repair the palace. He converted part of it into an 
elegant and commodious dwelling-house for the factor, and laid 
out the adjoining grounds as an ornamental garden, greatly to the 
embellishment of the ancient edifice. The same taste and libe- 
rality are exhibited in the preservation of this interesting ruin by 
the present proprietors, O. Tyudall Bruce, Esq. and his lady. 

The only other building in the parish that deserves particular 
mention is the new House of Falkland. It is built after a desion 
by Mr Burn of Edinburgh in the Elizabethan style of architec- 
ture. It was begun in 1839 and completed in 1844, and is justly 
regarded as one of the most beautiful and princely edifices in 
Scotland. 

Antiquities. — Several coins have been found among the ruins of 
the palace. They are not very ancient, being principally coins of 
Charles 1. and II. 

There are several traces of ancient fortifications on the Lomond 
hills, which the late Colonel Miller, in a paper on the battleof Mons 
Grampius, has endeavoured to connect with the movements of the 
Roman and Caledonian armies. " The fortifications on the East 
Lomond hill," he says, " have been perfected with great labour 
and very considerable skill, although the works are irregular. On 
the summit there are two works 150 yards in circumference. 
There have been four defences on the north side, the lower ditch 
of which is carried through the rock in one place. On the west 
side there is a ravelin which would not disgrace a modern en- 
gineer ; and on the south side there is a ditch about 100 yards 
below the summit, and nearly 200 yards long, which has either 
been filled in at the east end or never finished. The remainder 
of it is about 6 feet deep, and the earth is thrown up in the in- 
side to form a rampart, which is still in excellent preservation. 
Between the East and West Lomonds, and about half-way below 
their summits, the ground presents the appearance of a plain 
sloping gently towards the east, although very much broken. 
This I conceive to have been the position of the Caledonians pre- 
vious to the battle." Whether this opinion be well founded or 



FALKLAND. 



931 



not, there can be no question that traces of ancient military works 
still remain upon these heights. 

" Some think," says Sibbald, ' that the station or camp of 
the ninth legion was where the tower of Falkland stands now." 
We are disposed to believe that this opinion is correct. On the 
estate of Nuthill, to the west of the town of Falkland, the remains 
of Roman entrenchments may still be traced. 

While treating of the antiquities of the parish we may mention, 
that in Slezer's Theatrum Scotice in folio, two large engravings 
of the palace are given, which represent it as it appeared about the 
year 1690. One of the views is taken from the north, and pre- 
sents the interior court. In the east wing all the statues are 
entire, and there are two on each buttress, — one in the niche, 
and the other above the capital of the pillar. 

The other view is an external one, taken from the east side of 
the town, where the Pleasance is now built. It represents the 
east wing of the palace as much more entire than it appears at 
present. The east port of the town or arched gateway is de- 
scribed as it then existed. It stood at the south-east ansle of the 
palace, having a porter's lodge upon the north side, where the gar- 
den wall now runs. In this engraving we are also favoured with a 
view of the old homely town house, with its diminutive spire. 

Eminent Men. — Among the eminent men connected with Falk- 
land must be classed David, first Viscount of Stormont, the an- 
cestor of the Earls of Mansfield. He built the present church, 
and his armorial bearings, as well as those of his lady, Elizabeth, 
daughter of David Beatoun of Creich, are beautifully carved in 
oak on the front of the gallery in the north aisle. The Beatouns 
of Creich were the original keepers of the palace, and therefore it 
is highly probable that Viscount Stormont's connection with that fa- 
mily might partly be the cause of his obtaining the office. His ori- 
ginal designation was David Murray of Gospetrie. He was knight- 
ed and appointed comptroller of the household in 1599. In the 
events connected with the Gowrie conspiracy the year following, 
he rendered the king important service, and James seems to have 
been grateful ; for Sir David received charters of the barony of 
Segy in Kinross, and of the castle stead of Falkland, with the 
office of Ranger of the Lomonds and Forester of the Woods in 
160J, and of Glendovich, Balinblae, and Nuthill in 1G02. Three 
years afterwards he was created Lord Scone, Murray was a great

favourite with his royal master. He was a man of a bold and re- 
solute character, and therefore an admirable hand, in that fierce 
and stormy age, for executing the purpose, which James so ardently 
cherished, of introducing Episcopacy. It was chiefly through his 
influence that the famous Articles of Perth were carried through 
the Parliament of Scotland. He hastened to Court with the 
pleasing intelligence, and James testified his gratitude for this ser-. 
vice by creating him 16th August 1621 Viscount Stormont. 
He died in 1631, and was buried at Scone, where a magnificent 
monument was erected to his memory. 

With the ancient history of this interesting parish the name of 
Sir David Lindsay of the Mount is associated. This distinguish- 
ed poet and courtier, whose works about a century ago were as 
much read by the people of Scotland as the Waverley novels are in 
our own age, seems to have spent some happy days in Falkland. 
In « the second epistle of the Papingo, directed to her brethren 
of Court," he apostrophizes Stirling, Linlithgow, and Falkland, 
in the following strain : — 

" Adieu fair Snuivdown, with thy towers hie. 

The chapel royal, park, and table round ; 

May, June, and July, would I dwell in thee, 

Were 1 a man might hear the birds sound. 

Which doth against the Royal rock resound. 

Adieu LUhgow, who, palace of pleasance, 
Might be a pattern in Portugal or France. 
Farewell Falkland, the fortress sure of Fife, 
Thy polite park under the Lowmond Law. 
Some time in thee I led a lusty life. 
Thy fallow-deer to see them raik on raw, 
Court- men to come to thee they stand great awe, 
Saying, thy burgh been of all boroughs bail, 
Because in thee they never got good ale.'" 

Falkland is the birth-place of Richard Cameron, the founder 
of the sect of the Cameronians, who distinguished himself by his 
resistance to the criminal attempt of Charles H. to introduce 
Episcopacy by violence into Scotland. In his youth, he was him- 
self an Episcopalian, and acted as parish schoolmaster and pre- 
centor to the curate. A radical change took place in his views, 
however, and he connected himself with the indulged Presbyte- 
rians. He subsequently joined the party who refused the mdul- 
gence He was undoubtedly a- man of extreme views, but this cir- 
cumstance should not induce us to forget the important services 
which he and his party have rendered to the cause of civil and re- 
ligious liberty. He was killed at Airs Moss in 1680, in a skirmish 
mih the King's troops. His head was carried in savage triumph

to Edinburgh on a pike, and his body interred in the place where 
he fell. 

Falkland affords a title to the English family of Carey. Sir 
Henry Carey of Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire, was created a peer 
of Scotland by the style and title of Viscount Falkland, 10th No- 
vember 1620. He was the individual who brought to James the 
earliest tidings of Elizabeth's death. 

The residence of James VI. in Falkland did not induce the 
people of the town to embrace his views on church government; 
for in 1673 Mr Robert Gillespie, a preacher among the Cove- 
nanters, was brought before the Council for having kept a con- 
venticle in the town of Falkland. Gillespie refused to mention 
the names of his audience, and for this offence he was carried 
to the Bass Rock then the chief state prison in Scotland, 
and subjected to a long confinement. About the same period 
Mr Donald Cargill, who "suffered" at Edinburgh in 1681, 
preached one Sunday on the Lomond Hills, and baptized a 
great many children. Both he and Gillespie, although their in- 
itials are only given, are mentioned in the " Memoirs of Emilia 
Geddie," a native of Falkland. The subject of this curious and 
scarce old tract was born about the year 1665. She was interred 
in the present burial ground, in the east wall of which a monu- 
ment was erected to her memory. 

Among the individuals connected in more recent times with the 
parish, who have risen to some degree of eminence, mention should 
be made of Dr Doig, so long the rector of the Grammar School 
of Stirling. He was at one time parish schoolmaster of Falkland. 
He was much esteemed by his contemporaries for his learning. 
He published several Latin and English poems, and left behind 
him in manuscript an immense variety of literary, historical, and 
philological treatises. 

The late Sergeant Spankie, a distinguished member of the 
English Bar, was a native of Falkland. His father was the minis- 
ter of the parish. 

Proprietors — There are sixteen proprietors of land of the yearly 
value of L.50 and upwards. The chief proprietors are, O. Tyn- 
dall Bruce, Esq. of Falkland ; William Johnston, Esq. of Lath- 

 Perhaps it will interest the poetical antiquary to know, that " Jenny Nettles" 
hanged herself upon a tree in the wood of Falkland. She was buried on the Nuthill 
estate under '' a cairn'' of stones, where her bones were recently discovered.

In no parish in Fife has agriculture made greater advances 
within the last twenty-five years, than in Falkland. The face of 
the country has entirely changed, and places comparatively waste 
have been converted into large and beautiful farms. The present 
valuable and extensive farm of Falklandwood was then a marsh. 
The proprietors of Falkland have been the chief authors of these 
improvements. Twenty-five years ago, the large estates in the pa- 
rish, of which Mr Tyndall Bruce is now the proprietor, had been 
long in the market, and therefore no attempt had been made to de- 
velope their resources by a great outlay of capital. When the late 
Mr Bruce, however, came into the possession of the estates, he 
granted improving leases of twenty-one years' duration ; built farm- 
steadings upon an extensive and liberal scale; constructed roads; 
and assisted the tenantry in liming, draining, and making enclo- 
sures. While these important changes were proceeding on the 
low lands, the Lomond Hills, a large commonty of 2000 acres, 
were divided amongst the towns-people and heritors. While undi- 
vided, no improvement could be made upon them, so that they 
remained from one generation to another without plantation or 
enclosures. But immediately upon the division taking place, the 
larae heritors, Mr Bruce of Falkland, Mr Johnstone of Lathnsk, 
•md Mr Balfour of Balbirnie, proceeded to subdivide their re- 
spective portions, which had the effect of greatly improving the 
appearance of the country and raising the value of the land. 1 o 
give some idea of the improvements made by Mr Bruce upon se- 



FALKLAND. 



935 



veral hundred acres, it is only necessary to mention, that, after 
tearing up the natural soil, taking one crop of oats off it, liming 
and draining it, the following year, taking another crop of oats off 
it, and then laying it down in gross, the annual value of the land 
rose from something merely nominal to a grass rental, in some in- 
stances, of L.2 per Scotch acre. The money expended upon 
these improvements has been highly beneficial to the labouring 
population. It may further be remarked, that the division of the 
commonty has been also advantageous so far as the moral charac- 
ter of the people is concerned. Formerly, many individuals, nick- 
named " scrapies," kept horses and cattle in the town, and, if 
fame may be believed, supported them by pilfering freely from 
their neighbours, but when questioned how they supported theircat- 
tle, the ready answer was, " O  by sending them to thehill." With 
the division of the commonty, however, that dishonest generation 
passed away, and no reproach of this nature can fairly be brought 
against the present quiet and industrious community. 

It has already been mentioned that extensive plantations have 
been formed in this parish during the last twenty-five years. Every 
kind of soft and hard wood has been planted, and the trees in ge- 
neral are in a very thriving condition. But the larches have 
suffered severely from that unaccountable disease which has at- 
tacked them in all parts of the coimtry. 

Husbandry. — Husbandry in all its branches is conducted upon 
the most scientific principles. The cultivation of turnips is pur- 
sued to a very great extent, in which guano and the other artifi- 
cial manures are largely employed. The turnips are consumed 
partly by cattle and partly by sheep, — which the farmers buy ex- 
tensively at Melrose and other south country fairs. The breed- 
ing of cattle is also much attended to, — a considerable number 
being reared on each farm. Until very lately, the fanners en- 
deavoured to keep by the Fife breed ; but pure specimens of this 
breed being now comparatively rare, a crossing with the short- 
horned breed has of late years become very general. 

Wages. — The rate of wages is for an able-bodied labourer 9s. 
a week in summer, and 8s. in winter. For women, 4s. a week. 
For Wrights, smiths, and masons, from 12s. to 15s., and for 
weavers from 7s. to 8s. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parish is L.5824 Scots. The 
annual value of real property, for which it was assessed in 1815, 
was L.8144 Sterling. From the agricultural improvements that 



936 



FIFESHIRE. 



have been made, during the last twenty-five years, the value of real 
property must have considerably increased. The average rent of 
arable land per acre is L.l, 12s. 6d., of pasture land, 7s. 6d. 

Manufactures. — A great part of the population of the parish 
are engaged in hand-loom weaving. There are no manufacturers 
carrying on business, on their own account, in the town of Falk- 
land 'f but one individual manufactures dowlas and sheeting in 
Newton of Falkland, and six manufacture window-blinds in the 
village of Freuchie. The weavers are principally employed by 
manufacturers in the neighbouring towns of Newburgh, Kettle 
and Kirkcaldy. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Seven markets for horses and cattle are held in Falkland dur- 
ing the year, four of which are mentioned in the charter of the 
burgh. The Lammas market was formerly one of the most ex- 
tensive in Scotland, but it has greatly declined. The other mar- 
kets have also fallen away, except the one held in November, im- 
mediately before Hallow Fair, which is steadily improving. These 
markets were held at one time upon the Lomond Hills, but of late 
years they have been held alternately in the streets of Falkland, 
and in a small commonty adjoining the town. We cannot but 
consider these markets as injurious to the morals of the people. 
They lead to much intemperance. There is no market for grain 
in the town ; it is sold either to the dealers in the surrounding 
villages, or at the market in Kirkcaldy, twelve miles distant. 

Villages, — Besides the ancient royal burgh of Falkland, there 
are two villages in the parish, Newton of Falkland and Freuchie. 
None of these villages are built upon any regular plan. Nar- 
row dirty streets cross each other in every direction, and the 
primitive, but most odious custom of making dunghills in front of 
the houses, is still maintained. Freuchie and Newton of Falkland 
are inhabited principally by feuars engaged in hand-loom weaving. 

Falkland was erected into a royal burgh by James H. in 1458. 
The preamble to the charter of creation states, as reasons for 
granting it, the frequent residence of the royal family at the manor 
of Falkland, and the damage and inconvenience sustained by the 
many prelates, peers, barons, nobles, and others of their sub- 
jects who came to their country-seat, for want of victuallers and 
innkeepers. This charter was renewed by James VI. in 1595. 
The corporation consists of three bailies, fifteen councillors, and 



FALKLAND. 



937 



a clerk — a number greatly disproportioned to the present size 
and importance of the burh. The corporation possessed at 
one time a very considerable extent of property, but by mismanage- 
ment and law-suits, it has dwindled down to very narrow dimen- 
sions. The revenue in 1844 amounted to L.56, 2s. 5d., the ex- 
penditure to L.79, 15s. 3d., the debt to L.323, 5s. 7d. 

Falkland still bears some faint traces of its former greatness, 
— among other things, in the names of its streets, one of which 
is called " Parliament Square," another " College Close," and a 
third, the " West Port." Some of the houses which belonged 
to officers of the household in the time of James VI. still remain. 

The town is exceedingly healthy. Its site at the foot of the 
East Lomonds is airy, and the people enjoy an inexhaustible sup- 
ply of the purest spring water, brought into the town in pipes from 
the neighbouring hill. This was effected by the town-council in 
176G, at an expense of L.400. The town, however, does not ap- 
pear to have been healthy in former times, for it is mentioned in 
an old record, that the followers of the Court, when residing in 
Falkland, sent their children to be educated in Cupar, on account 
of the greater salubrity of the place. The fertile plain to the east 
of Falkland was then marshy, so much so, that when James VI., 
in 1611, issued a mandate, enjoining the presbytery to hold their 
meetings at Falkland instead of Cupar, they refused to com- 
ply, on the ground that Falkland could not be approached in 
winter, nor after heavy rains in summer. But the marshes 
have been drained long ago, and the air, ever fresh from the Lo- 
mond Hills, is so healthy, that the inhabitants are somewhat re- 
markable for longevity. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church stood originally at Kilgour, 
in the western confines of the parish, and before the Reformation 
belonged to the Priory of St Andrews. The Earl of Fife made 
a grant of it to the priory in 1318. The deed of mortification, as 
well as another curious old charter, bearing date 1224, which 
throws light upon the ecclesiastical state of the parish at that early 
period, may be seen in the book of the Priory of St Andrews, 
lately published at the expense of Mr Bruce. 

It is difficult to ascertain when the church was removed to Falk- 

• It would appear that Falkland could formerly boast of a provost, for, says Pits- 
cotie, Hist. 1814, p. 535, " Patrick Learmonth, provost of Falkland, carne with 
ane gu.dlic companie of fyve liundereth horsemen to the congregation to meet the 
qucBn at Palklantl."

land. There is a stone in the present structure, bearing the date 
1620, but there is reason to believe that there was a more an- 
cient edifice upon the same site. The present church can boast of 
no architectural beauty. It was repaired about, the year 1772, but 
internally it is again in a state of great dilapidation. It has a damp 
earthen floor, and many of the seats are decayed : altogether it re- 
flects little credit upon the parish. It is seated for about 700 
or 800 people. The front of the gallery in the north aisle, be- 
longing to Mr Bruce, is beautifully carved in oak. It bears the 
arms of Viscount Stormont, captain of the guards in the time 
of James VI. by whom the church was erected. 

Manse. — There never was a manse at Falkland until 1807 ; for 
when the original manse at Kilgour fell into decay, the minister, 
by a private bargain between him and the titular of the teinds, ob- 
tained in lieu of a manse and glebe, one chalder of bear, amount- 
ing in value to L.80 Scotch, L.6, 13s. 4d. Sterling, and more re- 
cently he was accommodated with a few apartments in the ruins 
of the palace. This state of matters continued till 1806, when 
the above compact was declared illegal by the Court of Session. 
The heritors then bought half an acre of ground about a quarter 
of a mile to the east of the town, on the northern slope of the East 
Lomond Hill, for the site of a manse and a garden. The manse 
was erected here in 1807, in a neat substantial manner, though its 
interior plan might have been more conveniently arranged. The 
ground on which the manse is erected was anciently part of the 
property of the Order of the Knights Templars ; and a copious 
spring of excellent water at the manse is still named St John's 
Well, and the adjoining property to the west is styled St Mary's 
Chapel Yard ; and beside it is another strong spring of excel- 
lent water, called the ' Lady Well,' in honour of the Virgin 
Mary, which was conveyed in pipes to the town of Falkland, in the 
year 1766. 

Glebe. — The glebe is still where it originally was, near the site 
of the ancient parish kirk of Kilgour, about two miles west of the 

 That eminent antiquary, the Rev. Mr Rownnd, has mentioned two very weighty 
reasons for concluding that there was a church iu the town of Falkland, before thu 
erection of the present edifice by Viscount Stormont in 1620. In the first place, 
two buttresses, which have evidently belonged to a more ancient ecclesiastical building, 
are left standing to support the front wall of the present church. In the second place, 
it is mentioned in the life of Mr Patrick Simson, the Scots Worthies, edit. 1817. p. 
83 " that in 1608, when the bishops and some commissioners of the General As- 
seinbly convened in the palace of Falkland, the ministers assembled in the kirk of the 
town, and chose him for their moderator."

town. As there has been no excambion yet made it is very in- 
conveniently situated ; but an excambion will, in all likeliliood, 
take place in a few months, so that the glebe will lie immediately 
behind the manse. The present glebe consists of four acres of 
good land, for which the incumbent receives L. 14 of yearly rent. 
Formerly the minister of Falkland enjoyed a right of pasturage 
upon the Lomond hills for threescore of sheep, but when the 
commonty was divided, this right was lost, we know not upon what 
ground. 

Cemetery. — The ancient burial ground was at Kilgour. The 
church, which seems to have been a small building, 40 feet by 16, 
stood in the centre, having a quire at its east end. Not a single 
vestige of it is now visible, the foundations having been dug up 
about twenty years ago, and removed to fill up drains on the 
neighbouring farm. The farmer transported one of the ancient 
stone coffins into his stable-yard to form a water trough for his 
cattle, where it still remains, and then crowned this sacrilegious act 
by ploughing the churchyard  The present burial ground was 
probably first used for the purpose of interment about the year 
1670, as the earliest date upon the tombstones is 1674. But 
the old cemetery of Kilgour was also used, up to the beginning of 
the present century, if not later. 

There are three dissenting places of worship in the parish ; two 
in Falkland and one in Freuchie. The number of Dissenters, 
however, is not large, the two congregations in Falkland being 
very small. The great body of the people adhere to the Esta- 
blished Church. The stipend consists of 8 chalders of barley, 8 
of oats, and 1 of bear, valued by the Fife fiars. The sum of 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. is allowed for communion elements. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish is five ; of 
scholars attending them 350. The parochial teacher's salary is 
the maximum, and his fees may be about L. 50 per annum. He 
has an allowance of L. 10 a year for house and garden. There 
is an excellent subscription school in Freuchie, which confers an 
immense benefit upon the village. The means of education are 
put within the reach of every inhabitant of the parish, but still it 
is doubtful if the people are in general better educated than they 
were forty years ago. The children of both sexes are taken away 
from school at such an early age, to engage in hand-loom weav- 
ing, that sufficient time is not allowed to complete their educa- 
tion. They forget much of what they have learned in early youth, 



940

before they arrive at years of maturity. Unfortunately there is 
no public library in the parish, but steps are now taking to supply 
this grievous defect, and place a sound literature in the hands of the 
people. A Sunday school library, which is extensively used both 
by old and young, has been established during the last year, and 
it already contains many standard works upon practical divinity. 

Poor. — The average number of people receiving parochial aid 
is 34. Besides the regular paupers, 30 or 40 persons in straiten- 
ed circumstances sometimes receive a little aid from the kirk-ses- 
sion. The whole expenditure for the poor of the parish, which 
contains nearly 3000 people, is, for the last year, L. 143. The 
weekly allowances run from 6d. to 2s. 9d.: Is. is about the ave- 
rage. The bulk of the paupers are above sixty years of age. 
There cannot be a doubt that a reluctance to apply for parochial 
aid is disappearing, but, at the same time, it is feared that an ex- 
cessive desire to foster a spirit of self-dependence among the poor, 
has, in this as in other parishes, led to a stinted allowance in 
many cases of real distress. The first voluntary assessment for 
the aid of the poor was made in 1800, and the system has been 
continued up to the present time ; but as some of the heritors 
have refused to pay their proportion for the last year, the system 
of legal assessment will, in all probability, be immediately intro- 
duced. A yearly sum of L. 40 or L. 50 is derived from mortifi- 
cations, sessional dues, mortcloth, &amp;c., while the collections at 
the church doors may upon an average amount to L. 20 a year. 
It is proper to mention that liberal donations are made to the 
poor by Mr and Mrs Bruce of Falkland. 

Inns. In the parish there are fourteen licensed houses for the 

sale of ardent spirits. We are afraid that stringent police regu- 
lations are necessary to keep some of them in proper order. The 
practice of granting such licenses to so many houses in a parish 
of this size is highly censurable. 

Fuel. There is a great abundance of coal in the neighbour- 
hood. It is brought in carts from the adjoining parish of Mark- 
inch, and also in considerable quantities from Lochgelly. The

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

WILLIAM MERSON, A. M., MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In the former Statistical Account, the name of this 
parish is supposed to point out, in the Gaelic language, its situa- 
tion upon a small winding or bending of the shore. But, as in 
old times it was written Carrail or Carayle, afterwards contracted 
into Craill or Cryle, and in Latin it is called Oppidum or Burgum 
CaralcB or Caralice, it is not improbable that it is compounded of - 
caer, a town, and aj/e or ala, a wing or corner, which is quite de- 
scriptive of the place, the town being situated in the eastern cor- 
ner of the county commonly known by the name of the East 
Nook o' Fife. 

Extent, Boundaries, c. — The parish is of a very irregular 
shape, and of a very unequal breadth, while its boundaries are so 
ill defined that the precise number of acres which it contains 
has never been ascertained, on account of its intermixture with 
other parishes. However, it acknowledgedly extends from Fife 
Ness at the east, to King's Cairn at the west, a distance of about 
7 miles, and from the Frith of Forth on the south, to the Ger- 
man Ocean on the north, about S miles ; but within this area are 
included three farms in Kingsbarns, which were taken ofiF when 
that parish was disjoined in 1631. It is bounded on the south 
and east by the Frith of Forth and German Ocean, extending 
along the former about 3, and the latter about 2 miles ; on the 
north, it is bounded by the parishes of Kingsbarns, St Leonards, 
and Denino ; and, on the west, by Carnbee and Kilrenny. 

Topographical Appearances. — When viewed from the sea, the 
general appearance of the country is flat, and, owing to the want 
of wood, it looks naked. The coast is bold and rocky, with only 
a few creeks, where vessels of any size can be landed with safety

From the sea the ground rises abruptly to a considerable height, 
so that, at the distance of a hundred yards from high water nnark, 
there is scarcely a point where it does not reach the height of 60 
feet. Thence it gradually swells in a westerly direction, without 
hill or steep, towards Airdrie, {Ard-rhi, the King's Height, and 
Drumrack. In this direction, when the sun goes westerly, and 
the atmosphere is favourable, the view at some points is beautiful 
and extensive. From Airdrie or Drumrack, and especially from 
the ancient tower of the former, one may, with a very slight turn 
of his eye, survey the whole Lothian coast from Leith to St Abb's 
Head, along with the islands of the Forth, — Inchkeith, the Bass, 
the May, &amp;c., together with the multitude of vessels that float 
upon the Forth, and the number of towns and villages situated 
upon its banks on either sid«, till at last his attention is arrest- 
ed by the Bell Rock Lighthouse, erected to warn the mariner 
of danger, and at night to guide him onward in his pathless 
track. In ascending from the shore to the highest part of the 
parish, the agriculturist never fails to be struck with the variety 
of soil he has to pass over, proceeding from the richest black 
loam to thin wet clay ; the former, in the neighbourhood of the 
town, drawing a yearly rent of L.6 and L.7 the Scotch acre, — 
the latter let on improving leases for a mere trifle. 

Island and Rocks.— The Isle of May, which, in 1743, was 
claimed by the magistrates and minister of West Anstruther, as a 
portion of their parish, has de facto, if not dejure, been connected 
with Crail since the Keformation at least. It lies about six miles 
south-east from the harbour of Crail, and is about a mile in length 
by about three-quarters of a mile in breadth. Its shores are ge- 
nerally cliffy, and at the west end rise perpendicularly to the height 
of 150 feet or upwards. Yet there are two or three places at 
which vessels can touch according to wind and tide. Although 
situated in the mouth of the Frith of Forth at its junction with 
the German Ocean, and consequently exposed to heavy eastern 
storms, the island is very productive of its native plants, and seve- 
ral parks are cultivated and enclosed. It supports a few cows and 
a flock of sheep, which are said to improve in flesh and fleece. A 
peculiar kind of long-wooled rabbit is also found upon it ; and about 
June and July immense numbers of birds breed their young upon 
the ledges of its western precipices. It has also abundance of 
fresh water and a small lake. This island, once famous for the 
cure of barren women, belonged at one time to the monks of Read- 



CRAIL.

ing, for whom David I. founded a monastery, which was after- 
wards dedicated to St Adrian, whose body was buried there, and 
whose coffin, cut out of stone, is still exhibited in the ruins of the 
chapel. From the monks it was purchased by a bishop of St An- 
drews, and attached first to his own cathedral and afterwards to 
the priory of Pittenweem. In aftertimes it became the property 
of Cuningham of Barns, and all parochial burdens exigible from 
it are understood to be paid out of his barony in the parish of 
Crail. This proprietor in 1635 received power from Parliament 
tf erect a lighthouse upon the island, though one had existed 
there before, and to collect certain duties from the shipping for 
its maintenance. 

The lighthouse then erected consisted of a square tower, on the 
top of which a quantity of coals was kept burning every night. 
Rude as this mode of giving light to the navigators of the Forth 
may seem, it continued with little improvement till 1816, when 
the Commissioners of the Northern Lights having previously 
purchased the island with all the rights of the light-keeping, 
erected a beacon with a stationary oil light, 240 feet above the 
medium level of the sea, and capable of being seen at seven 
leagues distance. 

About the same time the attention of the Commissioners was 
directed to the Carr — a reef of rocks extending between one and 
two miles from Fifeness, on which, according to calculation, there 
had been at least two shipwrecks every year. And after years of 
labour and many disappointments, they at length succeeded in 
erecting a building at the extreme point, where there is water deep 
enough for vessels entering the Forth. This building consists of 
a base of solid masonry, from the top of which spring iron pillars 
terminating in a point, with a hollow ball raised 25 feet above 
the medium level of the sea. This erection was reckoned a 
mighty boon to the shipping interest; but still the Commission- 
ers were not satisfied. Guided, therefore, by Mr Stevenson, civil 
engineer, they, in 1843-44, built a second lighthouse upon the 
May, with a light so directed as to point out the position of the 
Carr, and show mariners how to enter the Frith in safety. This 
light was first exhibited in autumn 1844; yet, strange to say, on 
the 1st of October of the same year, the Windsor Castle steamer, 
on her return from Dundee with about 200 passengers, who had 
gone thither to witness the Queen's departure, struck upon the 
Carr rock beacon with such violence as to compel the commander 



914 



FIFESHIRB. 



to run her ashore among Kilminning rocks, where she went to 
pieces. Providentially no lives were lost. 

Beside the lighthouses, there are comfortable lodgings for the 
keepers and their families, and excellent accommodation for the 
Commissioners when they may visit the island. The only inha- 
bitants are the persons connected with the lighthouses ; but there- 
are generally also a number of pilots from various quarters look- 
ing out for ships, and the old light tower is fitted up for their ac- 
commodation. 

Hydrography. — There are no lakes or rivers in this parish, yet 
there is a plentiful supply of excellent water from the springs 
which are everywhere to be found, and from a few burns which 
meander here and there. At one time there was a loch of Sypsies, 
covering six or eight acres of ground ; but, since the beginning of 
the present century, it has been drained, and the soil is now under 
cultivation. 

Climate.— The nature of the soil, and the position of the country 
at the junction of the Forth with the ocean, combine to render 
the climate particularly pure and healthful The public roads, 
and the streets and walks of the town, are almost always dry, for 
no sooner does the rain fall, than it is absorbed and lost in the 
soil, or flows away into the sea. The spring is, no doubt, often 
rendered chill and unpleasant by a /war which sets in from the 
east during the months of April and May. The wind continuing 
in that quarter sometimes for weeks together, brings with it a 
dens'e vapour, which spreads over the country for several miles, 
thus rendering the east coast not so agreeable as the west at that 
period of the year ; yet, though such weather be unpleasant to 
the feelings, and sometimes leads delicate persons to remove to a 
more inland situation, it does not seem to retard vegetation, or to 
be very prejudicial to animal health. Every species of crop ad- 
vances to maturity as speedily as in almost any district of the 
country. The arbutus and similar trees often ripen their berries ; 
the jessamine flowers on houses along the streets ; and fuschias 
not only withstand the winter in open ground, but, on returning 
spring, may be found budding at a height of four and five feet 
from the ground. Indeed, unless upon extraordinary occasions, 
the labour of the husbandman has been, for a number of years, 
but little interrupted either by frost or snow. Bestial of all kinds 
thrive well and fatten rapidly. Among cattle, murrain prevailed 
pretty extensively last year, but with very few deaths ; and this

year there have been a few instances of a sort of influenza among 
horses, but they have in general recovered. Judging from history 
and experience, the chmate of this parish maybe considered as 
highly conducive to health ; and there can be no doubt that, from 
its proximity to the sea, it is less exposed to the extremes of heat 
and cold than more elevated situations. 

Epidemics, or contagious diseases, unless what are common 
to children, are scarcely known here. Within these few years, 
several people have died beyond ninety years of age, and there 
are still a number in wonderful health and activity, who are upon 
the borders of it. 

Geology and Botany. — The geological structure of this -parish, 
as seen along the shore, consists entirely of the coal formation, 
including sandstone, shale, clay, ironstone, and coal. The usual 
dip of the strata is towards the east ; but on the western part of 
the parish, where lime and coal are still wrought, the dip is to 
the west. On the west of the harbour, different seams of coal 
appear, and clay-ironstone in thin bands alternate with the shale. 
The action of the advancing tide is very remarkable on the east 
of the harbour, where the priory stood. The ruins, which were 
there about half a century ago, are now entirely swept away, and 
only the gateway from the land, with a small part of the founda- 
tion of a wall in the alluvial soil, remains to point out its site. 

At the very extremity of Fifeness, a pure white sandstone oc- 
curs particularly adapted for various economical purposes. As 
plants used in medicine, the Pareitaria officinalis and Conium ma- 
culatum may be mentioned. On the rocks under the castle the 
Chdranthus Clieiri occms ; and on the sea -cliffs to the west of the 
harbour, the Brassicn olej-acea maintains its place in a congenial lo- 
cality. In a small garden on the sea margin at Fifeness is the 
Lavatera arborea, which once had a habitat on the islands of the 
Frith. The Asphnium marinwn is met with among the rocks on 
the south shore. 

Of the less common algae may be mentioned the Alaria escu- 
hnta and the Himantlialia lorea, which grow abundantly about 
Fifeness. 

Woods.—The plantations in this parish are of very limited ex- 
tent, not exceeding seventy or eighty acres, chiefly fir; of which 
about fifty are on the lands of Airdrie and Redwells, ten or twelve 
on Kingsmuir, about eight on Sipsies, and four on Wormistone.

ash and elm, are of stately size. There are also a- few in and 
around the churchyard, of ash, sycamore, and elm, on which 
crows find a place to build. But in general the soil is considered 
too valuable for agricultural purposes, to tempt any one to plant 
trees, unless around his domicile. 

Quarries and Mines.— Freestone for ordinary purposes may be 
found in almost any quarter of the parish, so that few farmers re- 
quire to go for stones beyond their own lands. At Craighead, 
Newhall, and Kingsmuir, stones may be found suited to the finest 
operations of masonry. Ironstone is also abundant, and frequently 
' exported from the harbour of Crail. Lime has been wrought to a 
great extent upon the borough muir, as the remains of the work 
still testify. The only work of that description now in operation 
is at Troustrie, and occasionally at Newhall. 

There are many indications of coals having been dug here at 
an early period ; and only a few years ago Robert Inglis, Esq. 
had an extensive work upon his estate of Kirkmay, with a steam- 
engine for pumping out the water— but he gave it up. And at 
present, unless at times on Kingsmuir, coals are raised only for 
burning lime, though there is not the least doubt that many seams 

remain untouched. 

Fire and common clays are dug in great abundance on the es- 
tate of Kirkmay, where a brick and tile work has been earned on 
for a long time. Fire-clay bricks and chimney cans are manufac- 
tured here and exported to Arbroath, Dundee, and other towns 
to a considerable extent. 

n. Civil History. 
Seats and Brsidcnces.-A\most all the baronial abodes have 
been suffered to fall into decay or ruin, and some of them are now 
onlv known by name. At the southern extremity of this parish 
an 'old house with vaulted cellars, and rooms above, occupied by 
farm-servants, is the chief remain of the extensive mansion of the 
Cunninghams of Barns. Here, about 1620, the poet and h.slonan, 
Drummond of Hawthornden, is understood to have written his ce- 
lebrated Polemo-Middrnia, or Battle of the Dunghill-a humorous 
poem in doggerel Latin, giving a satirical description of a rea or 
'n imaoinan qi.arrel bewteen the Lady of Barns and one of her 
n ilhSo rs.- Here he tuned that lyre, which he afterwards a - 
d esed in melancholy strains, to tlie full enjoyment of a live y 
i..ngination and buoyant spirits. Here he may av 
enjoved the happiest period of his life. And here his feelings 



CRAIL.

ceived a shock which no human contrivance was able to remove. 
For it was at this spot, near Crellia Crofta, and in this very house, 
of which a remnant now is seen, that he captivated the affections 
of Miss Cunningham, the daughter of the principal heroine of the 
Polemo, and engaged her for his wife. The marriage day was 
fixed — the friends were invited — the feast was in preparation, and 
the parson engaged to do the solemn duty, when the beautiful and 
youthful bride was seized with fever and expired. Drummond's 
grief on this occasion he has expressed in poems which have 
gained him the name of the Scottish Petrarch. In the hope of 
relieving his burdened spirit, he forsook his patrimonial estate and 
country for foreign climes. Eight years he spent abroad. At 
length returning, he was united to Miss Logan, grand-daughter 
of Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig. 

In process of time the estate of Barns passed into another 
family, and is now the property of Robert Anstruther, Esq. of 
Caipley. 

A small summer-house on the rock projecting into the sea at 
Castlehaven points out the spot where Sir Neil Cunningham— an 
elder branch of the house of Barns— entertained his followers, and 
whence he defied the assaults of his deadly foes. The ruins of 
the castle were pulled down in 1839. 

Newhall tower is now completely gone, so that only some old 
persons can point to the spot where once it stood. 

Balcomie Castle, once reckoned amongst the finest buildings in 
Fife, and in which a late owner is reported to have said he could 
accommodate a troop of dragoons, and give every man a bed and 
every horse a stall, is now reduced to one wing, which, however, 
affords genteel and ample accommodation for the tenant. The 
ancient lofty tower still remains, though much mutilated, and, 
while it forms an excellent land-mark to mariners, shows what the 
buildmg must have been. Some of the houses which enclose the 
court -yard are evidently of far more recent date than the castle • 
for, over the arched gateway into the court, there are two stones, 
on one of which are the arms of Learmonth, as depicted on the 
seatmg in the parish church, with the initials J. L. at the bottom, 
and on the other the arms of Myrton, with the initials E. M. 
Between these stones there ia vacant space, as if a third had 
dropped out ; and fortunately, Mr Todd, the tenant, discovered 
It lately as one of the paving stones of his barn-floor. On this 
there are, at the top, hands joined as if by the ties of wedlock, and 



948

underneath, the arms of Learmonth and Myrton quartered, with 
the letters J. M. and date 1602 at the base. We must therefore 
conclude that the initials J. L. and E. M. mean Sir John Lear- 
month and Elizabeth Myrton, the proprietors of the estate at the 
time, and husband and wife when that portion of the building was 
erected. Now, Sibbald states that from Malcolm IV. to James 
11. the castle belonged to the Hays ; that since, the Leslies have 
had it ; and that afterwards it came to the Learmonths ; which 
would lead down to nearly the above date. Sir James Learmonth, 
eldest son of Sir John, became a Lord of Session in 1627, as Lord 
Balcomie. He was a member of several Parliamentary Commis- 
sions, and died in Edinburgh while presiding as Lord President of 
the Court, Lament says, in June 1657. Lord Balcomie had a 
son, John, who became a regent in the Old College of St An- 
drews, but he must have died young, as his Lordship was succeeded 
in the castle and estate by a daughter as heiress. This daughter 
married Sir William Gordon of Lismore, and the property con- 
tinued in the Gordon family till 1705, when it was purchased by 
Sir William Hope, son of Sir James Hope of Hopetown. Sir 
William was a soldier who had seen much foreign service, and 
gained the renown of being the most expert swordsman and the 
finest rider of his day. He published a work called " The Com- 
plete Fencing Master," in which he described the whole art, and 
gave directions how to act in single combat or on horseback. Ac- 
cording to a tradition in the country, the fame of Sir William and 
his book induced a foreign cavalier to take a far journey to try his 
skill. Having arrived at Crail with this intent, he challenged Sir 
William to meet him on horseback in the open field. The parties 
met within a mile of the Castle of Balcomie, at the spot where the 
standing stone of Sauchope still remains, and which the road from 
Crail to Balcomie then passed. The onset was dreadful— but at 
length Sir William's sword, with deadly force penetrated the body 
of his antagonist. The wounded cavalier fell, and with his dying 
breath declared his name and title, and requested his victorious 
antagonist to become the protector of his widowed lady. 

Sir William died in 1724, and was succeeded by his son Sir 
George, who enjoyed the property for a very few years. Sir Wil- 
liam, son of Sir George, was an officer in the East India Com- 
pany's service and was killed in India. Thereafter the property 
was sold to Mr Scott of Scotstarvit, and left by him to his se- 
cond son, General Scott, who rebuilt the part now occupied by 



CRAIL.

the tenant, and added a large house at the north end of it for a 
billiard room. The General seems to have had one son, who died 
young, and was interred in the choir of the church of Crail. His 
three daughters became respectively Duchess of Portland, Count- 
ess of Moray, and Lady Canning. By these noble persons the 
castle was sold to Thomas, Earl of Kellie, who pulled down the 
old building, and reduced it to what it now is. Sir Thomas 
Erskine, great-grandson of said Earl, is now the proprietor. 

In the Castle of Balcomie Mary of Guise was hospitably enter- 
tained by the then proprietor, in June 1538, having landed, after 
a stormy passage, at the adjoining creek of Fifeness, to be mar- 
ried to King James V. 

Airdrie House, which is situated in one of the most beautiful 
and commanding positions in the parish, is embosomed in wood 
in every direction, except the south, whence the finest view is to 
be had ; but, like the other ancient dwellings, it is no longer the 
habitation of a belted knight or noble peer. Yet the ancient 
tower and most of the walls of the original house remain entire, 
though the interior arrangements are made to correspond to mo- 
dern taste. Of this place, Sibbald says, " in King David H.'s 
reign 1 find that it belonged to Dundemore of that ilk. After- 
wards it came to the Lumsdens, who had it in 1466." The fa- 
mily of Lumsden possessed it till at least the end of the sixteenth 
century, as is proved by a fine monument erected in the church- 
yard, of date 1598. From the Lumsdens, says the same writer, 
it was purchased by Sir John Preston of Pennycuik, President of 
the Session in King James VL's time, though it would appear he 
inherited it through his lady. 

This baronet seems, along with many of the gentlemen in his 
neighbourhood, to have keenly espoused the cause of Charles L, 
and to have been subjected to pains and penalties in consequence. 
For, within a month after the death of that ill-fated monarch, we 
find in the record of the kirk-session, 16th February 1649, that 
Lord Balcomie, Sir John Preston of Airdrie, Lawrence Cunning- 
ham of Barns, John Lindesay of Wormistone, and a number of 
others, whose names are mentioned, had to appear before the con- 
gregation to acknowledge publicly their sinful engagement, and 
sign the covenant. During the seventeenth century Airdrie be- 
came the property of General Anstruther, who greatly enlarged 
the house by the addition of two wings, of which the one was a 
large and lofty hall, with figures in niches, pictures on the walls 



950 



FIFESHIUE. 



massy chandeliers for lights, and a splendid chimney-piece of 
white marble, which he brought workmen from Italy to execute. 
After the General's death the estate was purchased by Methven 
Erskine, Esq. afterwards Earl of Kellie, who" died there in 1830. 
Upon the Earl's death Sir David Erskine, Bart, succeeded as heir 
of entail. He took down the wings built by General Anstruther, 
and removed the fine chimney-piece to his own house at Cambo, 
where it now ornaments the drawing-room. 

Upon the same estate, but a little to the west of Airdrie, at 
Redwells, or Redwalls, stood an ancient and extensive building, 
the history of which we have not been able to find. It was a 
quadrangular building, having the ground apartments on every 
side arched over with hewn stone, and small apertures or loop- 
holes at regular distances from each other. Over these there was 
a second story of solid masonry, containing accommodation for a 
numerous family, and at one end a well-paved barn, with two in- 
clined planes up to the door, as if for cattle carrying up their bur- 
dens and again descending. The barn, the last remain of this 
singular erection, was taken down a few years ago, when the walls 
were found to be of amazing thickness, and of uncommon strength. 
A general impression is, that it had been a religious house ; but, as 
some of the old charters convey the property cum fortaliciis, others 
think it must have been a kind of fortress ; while from the name, 
Ard-rhi, or King's height., a third conjecture is, that it was a hunt- 
ing seat of royalty. 

Kingsmuir House, the residence of George Francis Hannay, 
Esq. is a respectable country mansion, which has been greatly 
enlarged, and now forms a genteel and comfortable dwelling. 

In former times, the extensive property on which this mansion 
stands, was an o]pen muir adjoining to the commonty of Crail, with 
limits so ill defined as to lead many to believe that the neighbour- 
ing proprietors helped themselves to portions of it, without leave 
asked or given. However, after it came into possession of the 
present family, buildings began to be erected, and progress towards 
improvement made, so that in 1724 the presbyteryof St Andrews 
took into consideration, " under whose ministerial inspection the 
dwellers thereon should be," and adjudged the inhabitants nd inte- 
rim to be under the jurisdiction of the minister of Denino. A 
similar appointment took place in 1743, when a new minister came 
to that parish. Thus it continued till it was found necessary to 
rebuild the church and manse of Denino, when Mr Hannay bemg

951 



called upon to pay his proportion of the expenses either as quoad 
sacra or quoad omnia in the parish, he refused all, and was ex- 
empted from payment, upon pleading that his property formed a 
portion of the King's muir of Crail. And in 18'28, when the seat- 
ing of the church of Crail was enlarged, Mr Hannay attended the 
meetings of heritors, and claimed his position as a proprietor in 
the parish, together with the right of himself and his tenants to 
be admitted to all the privileges of parishioners. His claim was 
admitted, seats in the church were allocated to him, and instruc- 
tions given to the kirk-session accordingly. Since that date, there- 
fore, Kingsmuir has been considered as an integral part of the 
parish of Crail, and its poor have been supported out of the com- 
mon funds. It may be here observed, that in no place in this 
quarter has the judicious management of a resident landlord been 
more remarkable than in the case of Kingsmuir. Within the last 
twenty five or thirty years, Mr Hannay and liis tenants have, by 
their skill and industry, brought hundreds of acres, which before 
were considered a barren waste, into very productive corn land ; 
and where, before that date, neither man nor beast could pass 
without the risk of sticking in the mire, luxuriant crops of wheat 
now grow. This alteration Mr Hannay has effected by paring, 
burning and liming where any heather grew, and by draining and 
enriching the boggy land. The estate is now nearly all under 
cultivation, and we hope and trust that the spirited proprietor will 
be spared to reap the reward of all his personal exertion, and his 
liberality towards his tenantry. 

Wormistone, the residence of David Aytone Lindesay, Esq., is 
a fine old house surrounded by hard-wood trees of considerable 
size, and the only place in the parish in which, for hundreds of 
years, the same family have had their abode. This property, 
Sibbald says, belonged of old to a family of the name of Spens, 
descended from Macduff, Earl of Fife ; but in the beginning of 
the 17th century it came into the possession of Patrick Lindesay, 
a descendant of Lord Lindesay of the Byres. John Lindesay, 
son of the first proprietor of this name, as shown in the account 
of Airdrie, was, like Lord Balcomie and the landholders in this 
quarter in general, a strenuous supporter of Charles the First and 
Second ; as his descendants afterwards were of King James and 
Prince Charles ; and much the family suffered in consequence 
of their attachment to that infatuated race. This gentleman 
had to submit to the degradation of appearing before the con-

gregation within the church of Crail, and there making a public 
disavowal of his adherence to the cause of Charles I.; and at the 
battle of Worcester, in 1651, one of his sons was slain and another 
taken prisoner while contending in the royal -army. Patrick the 
son taken prisoner either experienced the leniency or escaped 
the cruelty of Cromwell, and, after the Restoration, was appointed 
commissary of St Andrews, an office which was held by several of 
his descendants in succession. In the troubles of 1715, this fa- 
mily appears to have taken an active part in favour of King James, 
and to have suffered in sub&amp;tance, if not personally; and in 1746, 
Patrick Lindesay, son of the then proprietor, was executed at 
Carlisle for having joined Prince Charles, and fought at the battle 
of Culloden. The last proprietor, Patrick Lindesay, Esq., com- 
manded a ship for a number of years in the East Indies, and af- 
terwards purchased the patrimonial property from his elder bro- 
ther, who had succeeded to the estate of Kilconquhar. 

Kirkmay House is a handsome and spacious building, at a httle 
distance from the principal street of the burgh, with pleasure 
ground in front, and a fine garden and offices behind. It was 
built in 1817 by Robert Inglis, Esq. of Kirkmay, a descendant of 
the baronets of Cramond, and is the finest modern structure in 
the parish. 

• A letter, which the writer of this found in Wormistone bouse, together with the 
annexed extracts from the record of the kirk session, will help to show the state of 
the parish at the time. This letter is addressed " To the Laird of Wormistoun and 
Heritors of the parish of Crail," and is as follows: " Sir, — T am directed and order- 
ed hy the Earl of Marr. commander in chief of his Majesty's forces in this kingdom, 
to transmitt to one of the principal heritors of each parish the inclosed order, and it 
is required that the order so transmitted should be intimated to the several heritors 
and their tennents within your parish, to the intent that punctuall obedience to my 
Lord Marr's orders." may be given, we presume, has been omitted. "You 
have the inclosed warrand sent you to be published and intimatted accordingly. If 
payment of the money imposed is refused or delayed after three days, a party of

sion to your parish you may easily conceave, and that it may be prevented is heartily 
wished by — Sir, your most humble servant, Signed Ja. Smyth. Dated Cupar,

Valued rent of the parish, . L. 13,670 0 0 

This valuation is, with the exception of Kingsmuir, the same 
as the parish was rated at in the new valuation of Fifeshire 1695; 
and, though it be very high in comparison of many other places, 
it shows that the land in this quarter must have been early in a 
high state of cultivation. In 1815 the landward part of the pa- 
rish was valued at L. 7234 Sterling, for property-tax, and the 
burgh L. 1391 Sterling, making in all L. 8625; and it is consi- 
dered that the real rental of the parish, exclusive of the burgh 
and its pendicles, is now only about L. 10,000. 

Parochial Registers. — These commence, on the 15th April 
1648, with a minute in the beautiful handwriting of Mr James 
Sharp, who was then minister of the parish and afterwards Arch- 
bishop of St Andrews, and are carried on, with little interruption, 
to the present day. The greatest blanks are from the 4th Febru- 
ary 1729 to the 4th January 1782, which seems to have been oc- 
casioned by the clerk neglecting to copy from his scroll-book, as 
the leaves are paged but not filled up ; and from 1779 to 1790. 
They now occupy fourteen folio volumes, and are valuable records 



934 



FIFESHIRE. 



of the days of other years ; for they not only contain the minutes 
of session with an account of its discipHne; a register of births, 
baptisms, and marriages, along with the receipts and disburse- 
ments for the poor, and a list of deaths and burials ; but, by their 
direct or indirect reference to passing events, they tend to throw 
light upon the state of society and the history of the times. No 
doubt, in perusing them we are sometimes astonished at the 
powers which the office-bearers of a Protestant church seem to 
have exercised over the persons and properties of the people ; 
but, if we carry our minds back to the rude state of society which 
then existed, and reflect on the difficulty which the learned had to 
instil moral and religious feelings into the ignorant population, we 
must admit that the men acted in the manner that was perhaps 
best suited to the times. With these views we might perhaps be 
able to vindicate the conduct of the afterwards Archbishop from 
all reproach on account of his severest acts of discipline while mi- 
nister of Crail. Yet, even in those days, his proceedings did not 
escape the animadversion of his brethren ; for, at the termination 
of little more than the tirst two years of the record, we find the 
visitors appending the following not very ambiguous hint: " St 
Andrews, 21st August 1650 — The Presbyterie, after revising 
and considering this book, do commend and approve the proceed- 
ings of the session. Only they are appointed to refer to the civil 
magistrate the enjoining of corporal punishment and pecunial 
mulcts." One grand point against which Mr Sharp seems to 
have firmly and properly turned his face was the desecration of 
the Lord's day ; and there is no wonder that this was necessary, 
considering that the parents of the then generation were accus- 
tomed to regard it as the day of greatest relaxation and business ; 
for, be it remembered, it was only about sixty years before his time 
that an act of the Scottish Parliament was passed, abolishing the 
Sunday market in Crail. 

Though, then, the power assumed by Mr Sharp and his suc- 
cessors seems to us to have been occasionally unwarrantable, when 
we look back to the times, we will be brought to admit that the 
stretch of power was for the benefit of the people, and perhaps 
the only way in which the lower classes could be brought to sub- 
mit to Divine or human authority. 

Besides the registers above noticed, there are four volumes of 
records of burials, which commenced in 1754- and are still carrying 
on. These have been kept by the beadles, and point out the spot 



CRAIL. 



955 



where every body has been laid, by stating in yards and feet the 
distance and direction of the grave from certain fixed points about 
the church and churchyard. For some time, these records were 
considered as almost a sufficient register of deaths. But, as in 
1826, the inhabitants erected a vault in the churchyard, in which 
corpses were to be deposited in winter for three months and in 
summer about six weeks, and then buried ; the interval between 
death and burial was, in many cases, found too long for identifying 
a deceased individual ; and therefore the plan of keeping a se- 
parate register of deaths was renewed. 

Antiquities. — Some of these will be afterwards mentioned, such 
as the castle, the priory, and the college ; to which it may be add- 
ed that a nunnery is said to have existed near the Nethergate Port, 
of which only an entrance now remains; but, at this entrance, human 
bones were found, when the street was levelled a few years ago. In 
the church, there is an oblong Runic stone, a good deal mutilated, 
having cut upon it a Maltese cross, with figures like serpents over 
it. " Below the transept," as Leighton describes it, " on each 
side of the lower limb of the cross a variety of figures are sculp- 
tured, now much defaced and indistinct. On the right side is a 
portion of a horse,' a wild boar, the legs of a man, another horse, 
and a ram ; on the left, a figure seated in a chair something 
like a man, with the head of a bird, as seen on Egyptian antiqui- 
ties ; and, lower down, part of a horse and part of a dog." 
Other relics of similar antiquity are believed to have been in the 
church, before last repair ; but the workmen, not knowing the 
value put upon them by antiquaries, hewed them down into pav- 
ing stones. The stone mentioned in the former Statistical Ac- 
count as having a cross rudely sculptured on it, is no doubt of 
the same description. It is the one at which Sir William Hope 
is reported to have killed his challenger. Many urns containing 
calcined bones have been dug up in different parts of the parish. 
In 1843, at a place called Swinkie Hill, probably Suends Knoll 
no fewer than seven urns were discovered,; and, in April 1845, 
another was found at Toldrie. They seem to be all of the same 
kind of material, though differing a little in size. The general 
shape is tapering towards both ends, with various beltings, and 
some with zig-zag ornaments. All were found with their mouths 
downwards, imbedded in an artificial mound which seemed to have 
been erected over them. Some of these urns may now be seen 
in the Museum at St Andrews. When levelling the ground ad-

joining to Castle Haven several stone-coffins were found with 
bones nearly consumed ; but, about twenty years ago, about thirty 
were discovered lying in regular rows, with bones so entire that the 
farmer dug a hole and buried them. The Iftst were upon the 
estate of Wormistone, near the cave in which the Danes are said 
to have murdered King Constantino II. in the year 874, and may 
have contained the remains of persons killed iit that time. 

The only other antiquity in the parish which seems deserving 
of notice is the Danes Dijke a building of dry stones of about 
half a mile in length, said to have been raised by the Danes 
when they fled before Constantine II. after defeat at the water of 
Leven in 874. This dike, at one time, enclosed a considerable 
piece of ground of a triangular shape, having to the east the little 
harbour of Fifeness, whence, it is said, the Danes expected to es- 
cape in their boats, which were then hovering at the mouth of the 
Frith. A considerable portion of it is now removed, the farm- 
house of Craighead being built upon its site. From what remains 
now faced up on one side as a park fence, some have disputed the 
accuracy of the tradition, and maintained that it was a natural, 
not an artificial mound. This supposition, however, is disproved 
by the fact, that, in removing a portion of it, human bones were 
found, and none but broken and carried stones discovered. At 
the one end, which must have been within the dike, is a natural 
cave in the rocks, which the appearance of lime at its mouth in- 
dicates to have been extended by artificial means. This is the 
spot of the reputed murder of Constantine. At the other end, 
but without the dike, a place is pointed out called the Long man's 
grave where the ashes of a Danish hero may have been depo - 
sited. 

Ill, — Population. 
Partly owing to the enlargement of farms and doing away with 
cottars, and partly owing to fewer hands being employed in fish- 
ery, the population of the town and parish has been diminishing 
for a great number of years. 

In 1753 the population amounted to 2173

Statistics of the burgh in 1841.— Houses inhabited, '261; houses 
tiot inhabited, 23. Males, 520; females, 707; total, 1227. 

In the same year there were in the landward 342 males and 
337 females, of whom 66 males and 75 females were upon Kings- 
nauir. 

Marriages in 1844, 13; births, 52; deaths, 42; increase, 10. 

The food of the lower classes is chiefly farinaceous and vege- 
table. Yet butcher-meat is used to some extent in every family ; 
for- there are few householders who do not every year feed a pig 
or two for domestic use. 

The people on the whole enjoy in a tolerable degree the com- 
forts and advantages of society, and are industrious and content- 
ed. They are justly entitled to be denominated an enlightened, 
intelligent, and well- principled community. In their daily inter- 
course, they are kind and friendly, and in their general conduct 
obliging and civil. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — In agriculture almost every 
species of modern improvement has been tried, with the greatest 
activity and attention, so as to bring the land to the highest state 
of cultivation and productiveness, and in very few places have the 
effects of draining and trenching been more conspicuous than here. 
The places which old people recollect of, fifty or sixty years ago, 
as dangerous for man or beast to tread on from their boggy na- 
ture, are now bearing luxuriant crops of corn — the rough and stony 
bowks which intersected almost every field and yielded a scanty 
support to the cows, can no longer be distinguished from the sur- 
rounding soil. Nor are the improvements on the land more re- 
markable than the change in the implements of husbandry. At 
the period referred to, no farmer was reckoned respectable who had 
not two or four oxen with a couple of horses and two men to con- 
duct the slow motion of each cumbrous plough. Now 1 15 ploughs 
are at work in the parish, each drawn by a couple of horses guided 
by a single man ; — then wains, or large carts with a pole to which 
two oxen were yoked with two horses as leaders, formed the only 
mode of carrying manure to the field or produce to the market; 
now not a wain is to be seen nor an ox in harness ; — then the cattle 
fed upon the grass that grew from the roots of the quicken or 
couch grass upon the fauch or fallow land ; — now labourers may 
be seen picking up and carrying away in their baskets every por- 
tion of the roots that had escaped the harrow ; — then, too, the

FII''ESHIRE. 



ploughman had to start at cock-crowing to prepare the daily straw 
for his cattle ; now the sound of the flail is seldom heard, as every 
farmer has his thrashing-mill. The first two-horse plough in the 
parish was used upon Pittowie in 1783-4, and conducted by one 
who still lives and enjoys a good old age. The first thrashing- 
mill was erected in 1801. 

The greater number of farms have been furrow drained ; and 
with the exception of the quantity already mentioned as being 
under wood, and about sixty acres, chiefly sea braes and links used 
as pasture, the whole land in the parish is under tillage. 

Near the coast, sea- weed is much used as a manure which an- 
swers well, so that some pieces of ground which seldom get a 
change, produce as good crops as any lands adjoining. Lime and 
stable dung are of course universal ; bone-dust, guano, soda, &amp;c. 
are also more or less employed. 

The rotation of crops dilfer according to the soil and situation, 
but the generality follow the four or six rotation. In the former 
case, the crops are, 1st, potatoes or turnips ; Sd, wheat or barley; 
3d, beans or grass ; 4th, wheat or oats. In the latter, 1st, fallow ; 
2d, wheat; 3d, beans; 4th, barley; 5th, grass; 6th, oats; and 
then recommence with fallow, potatoes, or turnips. In conse- 
quence, it will be seen that very little land lies fallow, not above 
one acre out of twenty ; while potatoes and grass may be reckoned 
each one in six; turnips and beans each one in twelve; the re- 
mainder in wheat, barley and oats. Bere or bigg is very seldom 
grown. 

In a parish containing such a variety of soil, and one acre in 
one locality producing more than two in another, it is almost im- 
possible to ascertain the actual amount of produce; but the fol- 
lowing may be regarded as an average per Scotch acre. Potatoes, 
35 bolls; turnips, 20 tons; beans, 4 quarters; wheat, 4 quarters; 
barley, 6 quarters; oats, 6 quarters; grass, 175 stones. 

Stock. — There are not many cattle bred in this parish, but such 
as are, consist chiefly of the Fife and short-horned breed. A 
good many calves are purchased and brought from other places ; 
and a number of two and three year old beasts are bought at the 
public markets, partly for the purpose of eating the straw and tur- 
nips to make manure, and partly to fatten for the butcher; and 
from the great attention paid, they generally bring very high prices. 
Great attention is paid to the quality and keeping of horses, as 
well as to their harness, &amp;c. Only one or two farmers keep any 



CUAIL. 



959 



flocks of sheep, and these they generally bring from the High- 
lands to fatten for the market. 

IVat/es. — Young unmarried men living about the farm get from 
L.9 to L.1'2 a-year, according to their age and qualifications. 
Married farm-servants have from L.IO to L. 12, with a house and 
garden ; 10 pecks of potatoes planted, 6 bolls of meal, half a boll 
of pease or wheat, a pint of sweet or U of skimmed milk a-day, 
coals driven, and liberty to feed a pig with their own potatoes,— 
all of which are estimated at about L.25 a-year. Female servants 
living in their masters' houses get from L.5 to L.6 a-year. Other 
field labourers are, males, 9s. a- week ; females, 4s. a-week or 8d. 
a-day ; but in harvest the daily wages are higher. 

In very few places, are the farm-steadings so good and the ac- 
commodation for man and beast so ample, as they are in general 
in this parish, which proves the good taste of the tenants and the 
liberality of the landlords. Leases are in general for nineteen 
years. 

v. — Pakochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — Only one mail arrives here every 
day, bringing letters from every direction, which often occasions 
serious inconvenience, as letters from St Andrews and other towns 
only a few miles off are received here the day after they were 
written, and the answer fares the same. This might be remedied 
by the post-office re-establishing the runner between Crail and 
St Andrews, as it was to J829. By this means letters written in 
that city could be received here within two hours of the time when 
they were posted. There are turnpike roads crossing the parish 
in every direction, and the commutation roads are in good keeping. 

A light van or waggon has, for many years, run from this to St . 
Andrews every lawful day, carrying passengers and parcels. A 
parcel carrier goes to and returns from Anstruther in the same 
manner. A carrier goes twice a-week to Edinburgh. There are 
also conveyances to Dundee and Cupar for goods. By sea the 
conveyance of passengers and goods is still more complete, as the 
Aberdeen, Montrose, and Dundee steamers call off the harbour, 
thus giving always one, and often three opportunities a-day, of 
getting to Edinburgh, and, on their return, a conveyance to the 
respective ports to which they belong. 

Royal Burgh of CraiL — As a town, Crail is of great antiquity, 
"and mentioned by the Scottish historians as a place of some con- 
sequence so early as the beginning or middle of the ninth century. 



960 



FIFESHIRE. 



As in days of other years, it consists chiefly of two parallel streets ex- 
tending along the shore from east to west, intersected by others of 
inferior note. Many of the houses are large and of ancient appear- 
ance, giving evidence of the grandeur of forme days, when some of 
the neighbouring proprietors of land had either their house in town, 
or one to which the dowager might retire when the old laird died and 
the son came into possession of the estate. At one period the tho- 
roughfares seem to have been considerably interrupted by houses 
projecting upon them at right angles here and there ; but these 
have been mostly bought up by the corporation and removed ; so 
that there are very few towns of its size in which more spacious 
streets are to be found. These are now lighted with gas, and in ge- 
neral kept very clean. There was a royal residence within the town, 
upon an elevation overlooking the present harbour, of which some 
vestiges still remain ; but at what time it was erected, cannot now 
be ascertained, nor by how many crowned heads it was occupied. 
However, the historians of the day agree in admitting that David 
the First lived in it about the beginning of the twelfth century. 
Sibbald says he died here, but others maintain that he died at 
Carlisle, where he had a residence as Duke of Cumberland, and 
that the mistake arose in consequence of the similarity of names, 
Carayl and Carlisle. 

It is not unlikely that this monarch or some of his successors 
might have conferred some important privileges upon the town in 
which he occasionally dwelt, but of that we have only this pre- 
sumptive evidence, that when Robert the Bruce granted a charter 
to the burgh, which is dated at Stirling 12th June 1310, he con- 
firmed to the burgesses and community privileges which they had 
njoyed under former kings, and exempted them from all jurisdic- 
tion vicecomitis de Fife. This charter, with several new grants, 
was afterwards ratified by Robert II., Queen Mary, James VI. 
and Charles I. By these charters the privileges of the burgh, 
extended not only over the town and common muir, but also from 
the middle of the water of Leven to the water of Puttekin, now 
called Pitmilly burn, with a right to the fishings, tolls, anchorages, 
&amp;c. in all the harbours and creeks within these bounds, being an 
extent of coast of about twenty-five miles. Yet, though all these 
rights were confirmed by Charles I. in his deed executed at 
Whitehall on the 20th April 1635, there seem to have been some 
heartburnings excited, and a desire expressed by many to get free 
from the jurisdiction of Crail long before that date. For in 1387, 



CRAIL. 961 

when Anstruther was erected into a royal burgh, we find in the 
proceedings of Parliament that James Geddy, burgess of Carrail, 
appeared before the liing and three estates, and in name and be- 
half of the same burgh solemnly protested " that the erection, 
creation, and confirmation of the burgh of Anstruther in ane free 
burgh royal suld on nawys be hurtfull or prejudicial to the said 
burgh of Carrail anent the richtis, liberties, and privileges of the 
same." About the same year, the bailies and council of Crail are 
understood to have let in feu-farm the customs, anchorages, &amp;c. 
of Elie to Thomas Dischinton of Ardross, through whom they 
have been transmitted to the family of Anstruther; but the feu- 
duty has not been paid for many years. The towns of Pittenween 
and Anstruther appear also to have complained of the jurisdiction 
of Crail as a grievance, and threatened to resist payment ; but the 
dispute was settled by arbitration, and both towns continue to pay a 
trifling sum yearly in name of reddendo, in consequence of which a 
free trade is established. A similar contract seems to have been 
made with the late Thomas Earl of Kellie, about 1810, for the 
customs, anchorages, &amp;c. of Fifeness, Old Haiks and Kingsbarns, 
and thus the ancient jurisdiction of the burgh has been much 
curtailed. Still the town has a revenue of nearly three hundred 
pounds a-year, which answers all the purposes of the corporation. 
The ends of the streets leading out of the town still retain the name 
of ports, which would lead one to infer that at some period they 
had been actually shut up with gates ; and that they were so, is 
evident not only from the fact, that an act of Parliament was passed 
in 1503, wherein it is statute and ordained, that all towns and 
ports on the sea side, sik as Leith, Inverkeithing, Kinghorn, Dysart, 
Crale, and others, ware their common gudes on the walls of the 
town to the sea side, with ports of lime and stane but many 
people are alive who recollect of the ports being taken down. The  
burgh had also the liberty of holding a free market upon Sunday, 
which, by an act passed in Parliament in 1587, was changed from 
Sunday to Saturday, and all markets between the waters of Leven 
and Puttekin forbidden on" any other day. In proof of this we 
may mention that the following entry is in the session record of St 
Andrews :— "April 18, 1582. A great number of drapers, fleshers, 
and merchants, accused of keeping the market of Crail on the Sab- 
bath; prohibited from repeating the offence under pain of exclu- 
sion, and debarring of themselves, their wives, bairns and servants

from all benefit of the kirk in time coming, viz. baptism, the 
Lord's supper, and marriage." 

Before and up to the beginning of last century, Crail was a 
great station for the herring fishery. To this" many resorted from 
different parts of the country, particularly from Angus and Aber- 
deen shires, who were supplied with nets and other conveniences 
by the inhabitants for a stipulated premium. Over the multitude 
of boats that then assembled in the Frith, a person generally a 
lawyer from Edinburgh was appointed by the Lord High Admi- 
ral to preside, under the title of Admiral-depute for the east of 
Fife. This officer had power of trying all offences committed by 
persons engaged in the fishing, and of fining or otherwise punish- 
ing those found guilty. He had also a vessel called the admiral's 
boat, which was employed in regulating the fishery, and fired a 
gun for announcing the hours of beginning or ending the fishing, 
particularly on the Mondays and Saturday nights ; for which each 
boat had to pay a certain sum as admiral's dues. 

Since then, however, the fishing has gradually declined, and was 
nearly lost sight of upon the Fife coast ; and the office, as well as 
officer, is entirely unknown. But within the last few years, the 
fish have returned to their wonted haunts, and many who from 
their early years had been in the habit of joining the herring fish- 
ery at Wick or other places in the north, have staid at home and 
reaped the reward of their labour. Yet Crail has not resumed 
its place as a fishing station — for last year there were only twelve 
boats belonging to the harbour engaged in the trade. In former 
times Crail, Kilrenny, the two Anstruthers, and Pittenweem had 
the privilege of returning a member to Parliament; but, since the 
Reform Act was passed, St Andrews the returning burgh and 
Cupar have been associated with them ; and these, being larger 
towns, swallow up in a great measure all the consequence of the 
minor burghs at a disputed election. The government of the 
town is vested in three bailies and a treasurer, with seventeen other 
members of town-council. There are seven incorporated trades. 
In the centre of the town, there is a very neat town-hall and a lock- 
up-house, with two cells under charge of the police. The harbour 
is small, not very safe, and difficult of access to the small vessels 
that frequent it ; but Room or the old harbour, which is only about 
a quarter of a mile to the eastward of the present, might be easily 
converted into a haven capable of containing a large fleet, and 
would, it is said, have nearly thirty feet of water at spring tides. 



CRAIL.

It is sheltered from all winds but the south, and may be entered 
by vessels of small draught of water, from any point, at an hour 
and a quarter's flood. The corporation have voted a sum of money 
to defray the expense of having it surveyed with the view of bring- 
ing it under the notice of Government, as a harbour of refuge ; and 
should it be so constructed, it would prove a benefit not only to 
the traders on the Forth, but also to the whole east coast of Scot- 
land. 

Unless in importing coals, and exporting the produce of the 
land, the port is not much frequented by shipping. However, 
twelve vessels belong to it, with a register of 530 tons. In po- 
tatoes alone, several vessels have been employed for a portion of 
the year, carrying them to Newcastle, London, and elsewhere ; 
above 3000 tons having been exported in one season. This crop 
has fallen off considerably for some time, and, in consequence, 
last year's export was only 1800 tons. Fishing is not carried on 
to the same extent as in some of the neighbouring places, such as 
Cellardyke. Yet a number of respectable men contrive to make 
a living by it. The kinds of fish which they most commonly 
bring ashore are, cod, ling, halibut, haddock, rock or red cod, 
cole-fish, dog-fish, cat-fish, flounder, turbot, skate, and occasion- 
ally mackerel. Sand-eels and shrimps are gathered among the 
sarid as the tide recedes. The principal employment of the fish- 
ermen here is in catching shell-fish, such as lobsters and crabs, 
but in these the quantity seems to be rapidly diminishing; for, 
when Mr Bell wrote the former Statistical Account, he states the 
number of lobsters sent annually to the London market to be 
about 20,000 or 25,000, and that ten years before there was 
double the number ; whereas, though the same trade be still con- 
tinued, the number sent to London last year was only about 4000. 
During the same year, 1844, after supplying the home con- 
sumption, between 3000 and 4000 dozens of crabs were sent to 
the markets of Dundee and Edinburgh. Within the last few 
years, a new trade in shell-fish has been opened with London, 
viz. in periwinkles or wilks, of which no fewer than 50 tons were 
sent from Craii in 1844. The town-council has also let the sal- 
mon-fishing to the south of the town, and, a few days ago, the 
tacksman set his nets and was successful. He therefore antici- 
pates that the salmon-fishing will be advantageous to himself, and 
a new source of revenue to the town. 

in the burgh, no manufactures are carried on, nor any trade of

importance, except what is required for the neighbourhood ; but 
there are a post-office, with a daily arrival of the mail, a number 
of shops at which any of the necessaries of life can be purchased, 
a good butcher-market, and a brewery. Fourteen persons are 
licensed to sell spirits, and two gentlemen act as medical practi- 
tioners. The Parliamentary and municipal constituency is 51. 

The town is ten miles south-east by east from St Andrews, 
and thirty north north-east from Edinburgh. 

Ecclesiastical State. — It is generally believed that Crail was at 
one time the seat of a priory dedicated to St Rufus, and, when 
the last Statistical Account was written, a ruinous gable with 
Gothic windows was standing, and bore the name of the Prior 
Walls. That gable was thrown down by the sea about the year 
1801, and there now only remain some of the foundations of the 
outworks, to point out where it once stood. The adjoining ground, 
however, retains the name of the Prior's Croft, and a well near 
the old building is still called the Briery or Priory WelU As 
this is not mentioned among the religious houses suppressed at 
the Reformation, some have doubted the common tradition ; but 
Leighton, in his Fife Illustrated, states that, according to General 
Hutton, there is an old manuscript inventory among the Harleian 
manuscripts in the British Museum, in which the following char- 
ter is mentioned : — " To the prior of Crail, of the second teinds 
of the lands between the waters of Neithe and Nith." There 
was also a chapel within the Castle of Crail, dedicated to St Rufe, 
which had teinds belonging to it, both parsonage and vicarage, 
but its name is now only to be found in ancient charters. 

The present church is so old that many believe it to be the 
one in which David I. worshipped when he lived in Crail ; and, 
although its beauty has been much destroyed by the alterations it 
has undergone, it is still a fine specimen of pointed architecture. 
It consists of a central nave, with aisles divided by a row of pillars 
on each side, and, at the east end, a portion of what originally 
formed the choir, in which daily service was performed. The 
choir was for a number of years shut up; but, in 1828, it was 
re-opened, and seated for the sake of additional accommodation 
to the parishioners. In all, the church will now accommodate 
nearly 1 000 persons, being about the legal allowance for the po- 
pulation. This church, which, with the teinds, both parsonage 
and vicarage, anciently belonged to the priory of Haddington, 
was, in the year 1517, upon the petition and endowment of Sir 



CRAIL. 



965 



William Myreton, vicar of Lathrisk, and Janet, prioress of Had- 
dington, erected into a collegiate church, with a provost, sacrist, 
ten prebendaries, and a chorister. The provost had a right to 
the vicarage tithes, and six of the prebendaries had annuities, 
payable out of certain lands and tenements of houses lying in the 
town and neighbourhood, mortified for that purpose by Sir Wil- 
liam Myreton, who is called the founder of the College Kirk of 
Crail. At that time, besides the high altar, which was richly en- 
dowed, there were eight other altarages within the church dedi- 
cated to the Virgin Mary, to St Catharine, to St Michael, to St 
James, to St John the Baptist, to St Stephen, to St John the 
Evangelist, and to St Nicholas. 

For many years after the college was established, the church 
retained its connection with the priory of Haddington ; for though 
King James VI., in 15S6-7, made over to the town of Crail the 
place called the college, with the college kirk, and all emoluments 
belonging to the provost and prebends thereof, with the advoca- 
tion, donation, and right of patronage, it was not till 1594 that an 
act of Parliament was passed disjoining the church and parish 
from the priory, and establishing Crail as an independent rectory. 

By this act, one-third part of the fruits was assigned to the mi- 
nister serving the cure, another to the new college of St Andrews 
for the sustentation of students of theology, and the remaining 
third to the college of Edinburgh, for students of philosophy, — 
Lord Lindsay being declared patron of the parsonage and bursa- 
ries. 

" About the time of the Reformation," says Mr Bell, in the 
former Statistical Account, " Lord Lindsay seems to have obtain- 
ed from the prioress and convent of Haddington a tack of the 
teinds both parsonage and vicarage, for the yearly rent of two 
hundred and fifty-five merks. The patronage was vested in Sir 
William Murray of Balvaird, who presented Mr Murray to the 
benefice. He then resigned the patronage into the king's hands 
in favour of John Lord Lindsay, who, in 1609, obtained from Mr 
Murray a confirmation of the former tack of the teinds for three 
lives and three nineteen years." 

" The town of Crail," says the same writer, " having by several 
charters obtained a grant of the collegiate church and its revenues, 
with the right of patronage, &amp;c. disputes began to arise between

it and Lord Lindsay concerning their respective rights. To pre- 
vent law-suits, a compromise was entered into in 1630, by which 
the town's right to the collegiate church and place called the col- 
lege, with the right of patronage, was confirmed ; but its claim to 
emolument was expressly restricted to the tithe fish, and the rents, 
fees, and duties which had been the especial property of the pro- 
vost and prebendaries. The parsonage and vicarage tithes, ex- 
cepting the tithe fish, were declared to remain with his Lordship 
and his successors. In 1774-6, the question concerning the 
right of patronage to the parish church was tried. By an interlo- 
cutor of the Lord Ordinary, it was given against the town, and the 
Earl of Crawford, as successor to Lord Lindesay, considered as 
undoubted patron. The Earl of Glasgow is now patron, as repre- 
senting the Earl of Crawford. 

It is proper to mention that in this church John Knox preached 
and excited the people to begin the work of abolishing the monu- 
ments of idolatry in Fife. In reference to this, Grierson, the his- 
torian of St Andrews, says, " John Knox, on Sunday the 29th of 
May 1559, preached a sermon at the town of Crail, in which he 
represented the favourers of Popery as guilty of the heinous sin of 
idolatry, and their churches as containing the monuments of it, 
namely, pictures and images. The effect of his eloquence was 
such, that the populace immediately rose, and in a very short 
time demolished all the churches in Crail, Anstruther, and the 
other adjacent towns along the sea coast. They then proceeded 
to St Andrews, where the preacher delivered another sermon of 
the same sort on Sunday the 5th of June; and the effect of it was 
similar to that which had before taken place at Crail, for the m- 
furiated mob set instantly about demolishing the superb cathedral 
church, plundered both the monasteries of the Black and Grey friars, 
and razed these edifices to the ground." 

Spottiswood says, " John Knox preached a serman at Crail, and 
persuaded the expulsion of the French. The people were so 
moved by his exercitation, that they immediately set about pulling 
down altars, images, and every thing which had been abused to 
idolatry ; and did the same next day at Anstruther, and from 
thence came to St Andrews." 

Besides the religious houses already mentioned, there was, no 
doubt, a cell or chapel dedicated to St Minin or Monan at 
Kilminning farm ; the corn- yard of which is still full of graves, 
like a regular burying-ground. 



CRAIL.

Within the town there is a congregation of the Associate Sy- 
nod, who have a church and a oiinister's house enclosed in a gar- 
den. The members of the Free Protesting Church are aho build- 
ing a place of worship. 

Attendance at church is remarkably good, and the ordinary 
number of communicants about 800. 

The manse, which is within the burgh at the entry to the 
church, with a small garden attached to it, was purchased by the 
kirk-session in 1637 for 3300 merks, and mortified to the theti 
minister and his successors in office. The house, thus bought, 
remained entire till 1789, when the greater part of it was taken 
down and the present manse erected in its stead, having still a 
portion of the old building for bed-rooms and other convenien- 
ces ; but in 1829 the last remains of the old house were swept 
away, cellars, &amp;c. erected on its site, and a third storey added to 
what was then called the new manse. As it now stands, it is a 
good commodious dwelling, and has every convenience that a fa- 
mily may desire. The offices are very poor, consisting only of an 
old stable and a gig-house ; but the minister is allowed a sum of 
money to pay the rent of additional accommodation, till a proper 
situation can be found for building a suitable steading. 

The glebe was designed in 1658, out of lands which once be- 
longed to the priory of Haddington. It measures a little more 
than four Scotch acres. A small park, not quite an acre in ex- 
tent, called the vicar's garden, and believed to have belonged to 
that official, is also attached to the living; and in 1799 a field 
of nearly three acres was obtained as a grass glebe in exchange 
for seven and a half acres of the links of Sauchope, which were 
designed by the presbytery. For property-tax the manse and 
glebe are valued at L. 64 per annum. 

The stipend, as settled in 1834, is 152 bolls of meal, 110 quar- 
ters, 5 bushels, 1 peck, 1 gallon, 1 quart of barley, and L.8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements. 

Ministers of the Parish. — Upon the elevation of Mr Sharp to 
the archbishopric of St Andrews, Dr Alexander Edwards, mi- 
nister of Denino, was transported to the charge in 1662, and con- 
tinued to discharge the duties of it till his death, 10th May 1684. 
Dr Edwards was succeeded by Mr Alexander Lesly, minister of 
Ceres, who was deposed in 1689 for non-conformity. He was

the last Episcopal rector of the parish. After his ejection he 
got a chapel erected at the west end of the town, part of which 
still remains as a wright's shop, behind the gas work, in which he 
continued to officiate till his death in 1707, Mr William Har- 
die was then ordained minister of Crail by the presbyteries of St 
Andrews and Cupar — the session record says, "by preaching, 
prayer, and imposition of the hands of the presbyteries — by deli- 
vering to him the Bible, the bell tow, and the key of the kirk." 
Mr Hardie removed to St Andrews in 1701. Mr Robert Fair- 
weather, minister of Carnbee, was then elected by the people 
14th August 1701, was inducted by the presbytery, and continued 
till his death in 1738. But Mr Fairweather having become old 
and infirm, Mr Patrick Glas was ordained as his assistant and 
successor, 24th December 1734, and continued to be minister of 
the parish till 1787. After his death Mr Robert Glendinning 
succeeded, but lived only a short time. Mr Andrew Bell was or- 
dained 6th May 1790, and dying in 1828, was succeeded by the 
present incumbent. 

Education. — In 1542, a grammar school was established here 
by Mr David Bowman, one of the prebendaries of the college, 
who mortified a house and lands for the maintenance of the 
teacher, and left the patronage, after his death, to the town-coun- 
cil of the burgh, unless a qualified person of his own name should 
apply, who was to be preferred. How this provision came to 
be alienated from its purpose, we have been unable to discover j 
but, from time immemorial, the sum of L,12 a-year has been paid 
to the teacher out of the town's common good. In 1821, the 
heritors and council agreed to erect it into a parochial school, 
the former paying the maximum salary to the rector, the latter 
continuing their L.12 payment, under certain conditions, to an 

the cure and benefice of this parish by Thomas Moncrieff of that ilk, as undoubted 
patron of this kirk, and having a right thereto from the Earl of Crawford, there was 
ane edict granted by John Bishop of Edinburgh, vicar-general of the see of St An- 
drews, being in the vacancie of the see of St Andrew's, in his favour, which was 
served and read this day in face of the congregation by the said Dr John Wood, and 
is to be called at the Trinitie church of St Andrews upon Wednesday come eight 
days next, at ten o'clock," . 

 Sfe deed of endowment and mortification in the town's charter-chest. As con- 
nected with. the church, schools, and records, it may be mentioned here, that Mt 
John Preston of Drumrack, a branch of the Airdrie family of that name, presented 
to the church the handsome silver basin and ewer used at baptism ; that the Earl of 
Crawford, out of the vacant stipend of 1789, gave the session L.20 for education, 
which is niorlififd in the town's hand at five per cent. ; and that a lady, who wished 
her name to be concealed, gave, through the late Mr Bell, L.50 for the same iur- 
pose, which is now lying at bank interest.

usher. The rector, therefore, has the maximum salary, and the 
fees average about L.40 a-year. He is also kirk-trieasurer and 
session-clerk. At this school, all the ordinary branches of educa- 
tion are taught, and frequently the higher branches of mathe- 
matics, with Greek and Latin, French and Italian. The number 
attending is 93. 

There are other three schools in the parish, two of them being 
within the burgh, and one upon Kingsmuir, at all of which the 
ordinary branches are taught. One of the burgh teachers has a 
free school, and a small salary allowed him by the town ; the 
other is upon his own adventure. At the two, there are about 
190 scholars. The Kingsmuir school was erected by subscription 
in 1843, and is attended by about 50 children. 

In both the endowed schools the teachers are bound to edu- 
cate a certain number gratuitously, and thus there are none above 
six years of age who do not at least know the letters. 

Poor. — The kirk session funds arise from the rent of about 
six acres of land, rents of seats in the church given by some of the 
heritors, dues upon marriages when the bride is in the parish, col- 
lections at the church doors, and some small feu-duties. Last year 
the number of poor upon the roll was thirty-one, who each received 
from a shilling to two shillings and sixpence a-week according to 
their circumstances — some received assistance in paying their 
rents — every applicant received clothing, and in many cases per- 
sons not upon the roll received assistance in money. Two persons 
were also maintained in a lunatic asylum, and the deficiency in 
the session's funds was made up by a voluntary assessment among 
the heritors. Besides what was bestowed by the session, the in- 
terest arising from a share of the Bank of Scotland's stock, be- 
queathed by the late Mrs Coldstream, was divided among sixteen, 
in terms of her deed, and ninety persons received a cart load of 
coals each by voluntary subscription. 

The poor here are better provided for, on the whole, than they 
are in most places.

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. GEORGE DICKSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extenty Boundaries, 8fc. — The name of this parish, as found in 
old manuscripts, is variously spelt, as Cibnnnie, Kylrimiye, Kilriny, 
&amp;c. In the former Statistical Account it is spelt Kilrenney, 
while the general spelling at present is Kilrenny. It has been 
stated in Swan's Views of Fife that " the name is derived from St 
Ninian, and that as Ninian is still popularized into Ringan, so 
Kilringan could easily be corrupted into Kilrenny." The more 
probable derivation, however, is that given in the former Statisti- 
cal Account. " The name of this parish seems to be derived from the 
saint to whom the church was dedicated, viz. St Irenaeus, Bishop 
of Lyons, whose fame for piety was at that time great throughout 
Christendom. What serves to confirm this origin of the name is, 
that the fishermen, who have marked out the steeple of this 
church for a meath or mark to direct them at sea, call it St Irnie 
to this day ; and the estate which lies close by the church is call- 
ed Irniehill; but, by the transposition of the letter i, Rinnie-Hill. 
What adds to the probability of this interpretation, is a tradition 
still existing here, that the devotees at Anstruther, who could not 
see the church of Kilrenny till they travelled up the rising ground 
to what they called the Hill, then pulled off their bonnets, fell on 
their knees, crossed themselves, and prayed to St Irnie." 

The figure of the parish may be described rather as rectangu- 
lar than circular, and the extent of it is computed at about 3 
miles in length, and nearly 2 in breadth. It is bounded on the 
east by Crail ; on the south by the Frith of Forth ; on the west by 
East and West Anstruther and Carnbee ; and on the north, by 
Carnbee and Crail. Being bounded by the sea on the south, 
the o-round rises to the north, by a gentle acclivity, unbroken by 
any eminence deserving of notice ; and presenting to the eye a fer- 
tile and highly cultivated slope. It is divided by hedges and 
dikes into a variety of enclosures, all of which are under the

plough, with the exception of about 10 or 12 acres of common, 
belonging to the towns of Kilrenny and Cellardyke, and lying in 
a state of nature, being partly covered with furze, and partly soured 
with water. There are also a few acres along the shore con- 
stantly kept in pasture, as they cannot be brought under the ope- 
ration of the plough. There are likewise some acres under plan- 
tation, but not to any great extent. 

All along the coast the shore is covered with large masses of 
sandstone blocks. The stratum of sandstone projects over an- 
other of shale or indurated clay ; so that by the action of the wa- 
ter upon the clay, it has been gradually removed, and these masses 
of the superincumbent rock have thus been broken down. 

There are some remarkable caves or coves, as they are some- 
times called, situated in the eastern part of the parish and close 
by the shore. They are considerably above high water-mark, but 
the rocks, in their outward form, have every appearance of having 
been at one time under the action of water ; while within the caves 
there are still further indications of such having been the case, 
by the rocks being drilled in many places by the Pholas. They 
stand at present several feet above high water-mark, and rise 
to the height of 30 or 40 feet. There are likewise to be seen 
in the interior of the caves, artificial cuttings and chiselled 
crosses, which indicate that at some period they have been used 
as the abode of men. 

Some human bones were lately found, when removing a portion 
of earth from the interior of the caves ; and a friend on hearing 
of this circumstance, has suggested the idea that they may have 
been the resort of the leper, or the hermit, or the persecuted in 
evil times. 

It is highly probable that they would be resorted to by smugglers, 
at the period when smuggling was carried on to a very great ex- 
tent in the East Neuk of Fife. They were at a later period used 
as the outhouses of a small farm ; and they are still used as a place 
of shelter for cattle. There is no tradition regarding them, ex- 
cept that there is a communication below ground between them 
and the house of Barnsmuir, situated nearly half a mile from the 
shore, where it is said that a piper was heard playing beneath the 
hearth stone of the kitchen ; but these days of delusion have passed 
away. 

The temperature of the atmosphere along the coast is rather 
mild than otherwise, so that the snow in winter seldom remains-

long undissolved, and from the extent to which draining has of late 
been carried, the climate may be represented as dry and healthy. 

The diseases are such as are common to the district, and in 
the town of Cellardyke, where there is a great population closely 
crowded together, fever is often prevalent. 

Geology. — The strata laid open along the shore exhibit the 
common coal formation of sandstone, limestone, clay ironstone, 
shale, and coal, and contain many interesting fossil remains. 
The direction and dip of the strata vary much. The usual dip 
is from 20° to 25°. About the west end of the parish, the direc- 
tion in which the strata are found is towards the south, while, as 
you proceed eastward, it inclines towards the south-east. Along 
the shore are found clay ironstone balls with coprolites, and many 
specimens of the Variolaria Ficoides of Sternberg ; and toward the 
east end of the parish, considerably within high water mark, are 
found in the sandstone strata, a number of fossil trees, projecting 
upwards at an angle of 70° to the height of several feet, and 
placed at distances from each other, as if growing in a forest. 

In the limestone quarry at Cornceres, about half a mile inland, 
the dip of the stratum was found in the working to be almost per- 
pendicular, while at other times it inclined to the north-east. This 
limestone resembles that of Burdiehouse, in the neighbourhood 
of Edinburgh, with similar fossil remains, such as fresh-water fish, 
plants, &amp;c. In reference to this quarry, the Rev. Dr Anderson of 
Newburgh, who has long paid great attention to the subject of geo- 
logy, thus writes in his Geological Account of Fife, published along 
with Swan's Views of Fife : " While these pages have been passing 
through the press, I have been successful in finding the fresh wa- 
ter, or bituminous limestone, in the south-eastern extremity of 
the county. I first met with it in the parish of Kilrenny on the 
shore, and likewise to the eastward about a mile, in the parish of 
Crail. It is wrought inland in both parishes, at Cornceres and 
at Sypsies. Here it lies in small trough-shaped basins, and is 
much disturbed by underlying dikes, which traverse in every di- 
rection the whole of this district. Along the shore the deposit is 
about six feet thick, and dips to the south-east at an angle of 20°. 
It rests upon a thin bed of coal of about one foot and a half in 
thickness." 

" Scales, coprolites, and vegetable impressions are in the 
greatest profusion, and no doubt can be entertained, from its mi- 
neralogical characters, as well as its organic contents, of its being 



KILKENNY. 



973 



a portion of the interesting deposit which ranges westward from 
Pettycur." 

The soil in the parish varies considerably. Along the coast, al- 
though containing a strong mixture of clay, it is rich and produc- 
tive, while in the higher parts, as it rests on strong clayey subsoil, 
it is more retentive of moisture, and, in wet seasons, less produc- 
tive. 

It is astonishing, however, to observe the vast change and con- 
sequent improvement which have taken place within the last few 
years, from the skill and enterprise which the tenants have dis- 
played in draining their farms. 

Zoology. — There are not many of the rarer animals to be found 
in this locality. In winter a great many birds flock to the shore 
which are not to be found in summer. Among the feathered tribe 
frequenting this locality may be mentioned pheasants, the golden 
plover, starling, and the golden-crested wren, though but rarely 
seen ; while there is no lack of common birds. 

In the woods of Innergelly, some of the deer species,  Cervus 
capreolus, have been observed, but they are not numerous. The 
most interesting class of animals, both as to number and import- 
ance, in an economical point of view, is the 6sh found in the 
Frith of Forth. The following are found in abundance : Cod, 
ling, haddock, skate, flounders, and halibut : turbot very rarely. 
Besides these, which are of great importance, as affording a 
cheap and wholesome diet, there is the dog-fish, which is very 
abundant at times, and very destructive to the haddocks when 
caught upon the line, but which is usefid as aftbrding a certain 
portion of oil, and still more so to the farmer, as a rich manure 
when formed into a compost with earth. There is also the cat- 
fish, which certainly has not a very seemly appearance, but is 
highly relished by some when dressed as fish and sauce. The 
shell-fish which are caught along the shore are the lobster, the 
parten, or common crab, the wilk, and the limpet. Of late great 
quantities of wilks have been gathered from the rocks and sent 
to the London market. There are no oysters or mussels to be 
found along the shore. 

Botany. — As the parish does not rise to any great altitude above 
the level of the sea, the plants along the sea-side, and the JlgcBf 
or plants growing among the rocks from low to high water level, 
are those which chiefly deserve notice. Of these the following

There is but a small proportion of the land in the parish com- 
paratively speaking, occupied with plantation, and that small por- 
tion is gradually diminishing. This may be partly accounted for 
by the proximity of the parish to the sea, and still more satisfac- 
torily by the ground being so very valuable for the raising of grain 
crops. The only estates on which there is some extent of plan- 
tation, are Innergelly and Thirdpart, the latter of which consists 
chiefly of belts. 

II. — Civil History. 
From the local Reports of Commissioners of Municipal Corpo- 
rations in Scotland in 1833, the following report is taken : — " Kil- 
renny, which consists of Upper and Nether Kilrennies, is not, 
strictly speaking, a royal burgh ; it has no crown charter. In 
1672 the magistrates of Kilrenny presented a supplication to Par- 
liament, setting forth that it never was a royal burgh, and praying 
that it might no more be esteemed such, but continue a burgh of 
regality." This supplication was remitted to the Privy Council, 
and it appears from the minutes of Parliament that it was " or-

dered that the burgh of Kilrenny be expunged out of the rolls, 
the same being now no royal burgh by Act of Parliament."" 

" Kilrenny holds feu of a subject, Mr Bethune, one of whose 
predecessors represented the town in the meeting of Estates in 
1689. It continued afterwards to send a representative to Par- 
liament without being objected to, and was inadvertently classed 
by the Articles of the Union in a set of five burghs sending a 
representative to Parliament." 

The same report states " that Nether Kilrenny has a harbour for 
fishing boats — for the improvement of which L. 1200 were ad- 
vanced by the Board of Trustees for the improvement of fisheries, 
and L.500 were raised by the town — which have been expended 
in building new quays; but they have not been judiciously placed, 
and the harbour is said to have been rather injured than improved 
by their erection." 

" Kilrenny is in schedule F. of the Burgh Reform Act. By the 
old sett of the burgh the old council elected the new council. A 
change was, in 1819, made in the sett of the burgh. It was the 
practice formerly to elect the bailies from three leets, called first, 
second, and third magistrate's leets — one being chosen out of each 
leet ; but in that year the classification was abolished, and the 
three bailies were chosen out of a general leet of nine persons, 
which change occasioned the disfranchisement of the burgh in 
1828; and the town has ever since been under the management 
of managers appointed by the Court of Session, as is usual in such 
cases, till the constitution of the burgh is restored, or a new one 
granted. 

The harbour of Cellardyke is in all the charters designated 
Skin-fast haven. 

Eminent Men. — James Melville, nephew of the famous An- 
drew Melville, was appointed minister of the parish in 1586. Sir 
James Lumsdaine of Innergelly was a major-general under Gusta- 
vus Adolphus, King of Sweden. He afterwards served in the 
Scottish army, and was taken prisoner by Cromwell at the battle 
of Dunbar. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are Sir Windham Car- 
niichael Anstruther, of Anstruther and Carmichael, Bart. ; Ro- 
bert Anstruther, Esq. of Thirdpart ; the Rev. Edwin Sandys 
Lumsdaine of Innergelly ; Andrew Johnston, Esq. of Rennyhill ; 
Lord William R. K. Douglas of Denino ; Mrs Drinkwater Be- 
thune of Balfour, and Sir Thomas Erskine of Cambo, Bart. To

riFESHIRE. 



the great loss of the parish none of the land-owners are resident. 
The houses of Innergelly and Rennyhill are the only residences 
in the parish, but have not been occupied by their proprietors 
for two or three years. They are modern buildings, and afford 
good accommodation. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest parochial register is dated 
1586, and commences about the time when James Melville en- 
tered on the work of the ministry at Kilrenny. The registers 
appear to have been pretty correctly kept ; but some of them 
are so tarnished and chafed as to render dates often uncertain 
and the reading imperfect. About 1580, and several years af- 
terwards, one minister, William Clarke, and after him James 
Melville, had the superintendence of West Anstruther, Pitten- 
weem, Abercrombie, and Kilrenny, officiating at each in rotation, 
the parishes having their respective kirk-sessions ; and when, on 
any particular occasion, they met in a body, it was called the 
Assembly ; but their transactions were marked in the same book. 
Latterly, and for a considerable period, they have been kept with 
great accuracy. 

Antiquities. — On a slightly elevated portion of ground to the 
west of the village of Kilrenny, there is an upright stone with 
some rude engraving somewhat resembling the mariner's com- 
pass, called Skeith, or Skeigh, or Scathe stone; but there is 
no satisfactory tradition concerning it. It may possibly have been 
erected to commemorate some conflict which took place during 
the invasion of the East Neuk by the Danes. There is another 
upright stone on the farm of East Pitcorthie, about five or six 
feet above ground, but when or on what occasion erected is not 
known. It bears no date and no characters, and there is no tra- 
dition concerning it. 

There is another eminence to the eastward of the village, which 
is called Capelochy Castle, near to the shore. And it has been 
conjectured from the appearance of the low land on the north 
side, bearing marks of having been under water, that the emi- 
nence, at one time, had been surrounded by water, and hence its 
name, Capelochy Castle. 

There is a farm adjoining, which bears the name of Caiplie, 
which is probably a corruption of Capelochy. The ground which 
the castle occupied is now under the plough, and very lately an 
immense quantity of stones were dug up, and among them was 



KILKENNY.

found, not exactly a stone coffin, but stones set upon edge, within 
which some human bones were discovered. 

The old house of Thirdpart, now demolished, was long the fa- 
mily residence of the Scots of Scotstarvet ; and Newbarns or 
Westbarns, in the adjoining parish of Crail, was the seat of the 
Cunninghams ; in this locality is laid the scene of Drummond of 
Hawthornden's humorous poem, entitled Polemo-Middinia.

Agriculture.— The number of acres in the parish may be esti- 
mated at about 2400, the greater proportion, of which is under 
the plough, and in a high state of cultivation. There may be 
from twenty to thirty acres which do not seem at any time to have 
been cultivated, but remain partly in pasture and partly in a state 
of nature. For a very Considerable number of years, a regular 
system of rotation in farming has been followed, and varies upon 
different farms. A five, or six, or seven years' shift is the rota- 
tion generally adopted ; and the principal crops are, wheat, beans, 
barley, oats, hay or pasture, potatoes, and turnip. Along the 
coast the land is richer and more productive ; but, taking the 
whole parish, the average produce of an acre may be estimated 
at 8 bolls for wheat and beans, and for oats and barley, from 6 
to 7 bolls. There is comparatively little of the land in pasture, 
as the farmers think it more advantageous to take parks in the 
higher parts of the neighbouring parishes for rearing their young 
stock. A vast improvement has of late taken place, in conse- 
quence of the great extent to which draining has been carried. 
This is effected sometimes with stones and sometimes with tiles ; 
but, in both cases, the beneficial effects are speedily made mani- 
fest. The average rent per acre may be about L.2, 10s. 

Live-stock. — There are few sheep kept in the parish, and the 
prevailing breed of cattle is what is called the Fife breed. 

Leases. — Leases are generally granted for nineteen years, and 
the farmers being possessed both of capital and intelligence, are 
ever ready to adopt the most improved implements of husbandry, 
and any new suggestion with regard to the mode of culture. 
The great proportion of the steadings are ample and commodious, 
with excellent dwelling-houses for the tenants. 

Wages.— The wages of masons, carpenters, &amp;c. range about 
2s. 6d. per day, while the day-labourer earns from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. ; 
and the women, who are generally employed during the summer 
in hoeing, &amp;c., receive 8d. per day, and during harvest, they are 
allowed from L.l, 10s. to L.l, 15s., with dinner, which consists 
of beer and bread, with a lippy of meal for their supper. 

Limestone, with thin seams of coal, has for a long period 
been wrought upon the estates of Innergelly and Thirdpart; and 
ironstone has also been found along the shore within high water 
mark. The best freestone quarry for building purposes is to be

found on the farm of Blacklaws, belonging to Mrs Driiikvvater 
Bethune. 

Fisheries. — The fishery in Cellardyke is carried on to a very 
great extent. The fishermen are active, hardy, and enterprising, 
and prosecute their lawful employment oftentimes under circum- 
stances of great danger. There are about 100 large boats, vary- 
ing in tonnage from 13 to 18 tons, employed during the summer 
season in the herring fishery, each of these being manned with three 
or four regular fishermen and one or two halfdealsmen, as they 
are called, who have no nets, but merely assist in rowing, and haul- 
ing the nets; or if they have not the full complement of men, two 
or three strong boys are sometimes taken. It was the usual prac- 
tice for the whole of the fishermen to go to Peterhead and Wick 
to prosecute the fishing, without a single boat being left to try if 
herring could be got in the Frith of Forth ; but in 1837 or 1838 
some of the fishermen remained at home, and were very success- 
ful ; and since that period a great number of boats have been era- 
ployed at home with various success, and during some seasons, 
have been more successful than those which went to the north. 
At times the boats were brought into the harbour with from forty 
to eighty crans ; but when the lierrings are so abundant, the fish- 
ery continues only for a few days. When the fishermen get 200 
crans, they account such a fair fishing, but many do not attain to 
that number. During a successful fishing season lately, one or 
two boats got about 400 crans or barrels, and it is believed that 
one caught the extraordinary number of 500 crans. Their agree- 
ment with thecurers is generally from 9s. to lis. per cran, with a 
certain allowance of whisky. It is not, however, all gain that is made 
by the fishing, as it is attended with a very considerable expense. 
The boats, when thoroughly fitted for going to sea at first, cost 
about L. 100, and require a considerable sum to keep them in re- 
pair ; while the nets, when ready for use, cost about L.5 each, and 
the number taken by each boat varies from fourteen to twenty. 
The herring fishing is prosecuted for a short lime in winter during the 
months of January and February, and in autumn during the months 
of August and September. The other months are occupied by the 
fishermen in prosecuting the white fishing, when 28 or 30 boats 
go regularly to sea every morning if the weather permits, and pro- 
ceed oftentimes to the distance of 40 or 50 miles in search of fish. 
The boats in these cases are manned with eight men each, and while 
each manfur'nishes a certain portion of line, with the necessary hooks

attached, the produce is equally divided among the fishermen, the 
owner of the boat being entitled to a double share. In this mode of 
fishing a considerable expense is also incurred, bpth in the purchase 
of mussels for bait, which are generally brought from the Eden, 
beyond St Andrews, and also by the frequent loss of their fishing 
tackle. In summer, the fish are generally taken to Fisherrow and 
Newhaven, or to Dundee and Perth ; and in winter they are gene- 
rally brought into the harbour and sold to the fish-curers, or to 
the cadgers, who cart them to a great distance, and dispose of 
them in the different towns through which they pass. The fish- 
curers smoke the haddocks and pickle the cod which they pur- 
chase, and send them to the Glasgow, Liverpool, and London 
markets. Besides the fishermen who are engaged in the fishing, 
the means of subsistence are afforded to a number of other individu- 
als, such as coopers, carters, and women who are employed in 
cleaning and curing the fish. It would be difficult to ascertairt 
the amount of money which is brought in from the deep in the 
course of the year; but estimating each fishing boat at 120 crans 
on an average in ordinary years, the sum realized, at 10s. per 
cran, would amount to L.6G00, besides the profits arising from the 
take of cod and haddocks, &amp;c. during the summer season, which 
is very considerable ; but when the expense of keeping up their 
lines and the payment of their bait are taken into consideration, 
these apparent gains are much diminished. A cart load of mus- 
sels brought from the Eden costs from 20s. to 22s., and the lines 
which are employed in fishing by each fisherman extend to ItfOO 
feet in winter, and double that length in summer, so that when 
the whole or even a portion of the line is last, a considerable sum 
is necessary to repair the deficiency. 

Many of the fishermen are in respectable circumstances, and 
careful in the management of their substance, but it is matter of 
deep regret that the same cannot be said of all of them. 

Mrs D. Bethune, as the superior, is entitled to every fourteenth 
fish of the different kinds, with the exception of herring, of which 
she has a right to every eighteenth ; but instead of exacting the rent 
in fish, an agreement has been entered into with the fishermen, 
by which they consent, in lieu of the fish, to pay L.40 annually. 

As the harbour is intended merely for fishing boats, no ships or 
foreign vessels are allowed to enter it. 

V. — Pauochial Economy. 
Cellardyke is the only town in the parish, and Kilrenny the

ouly village, but there is no market held in either of them. 
East Anstruther adjoining Cellardyke, and about a mile west 
from Kilrenny, is the place where the nearest market is held, 
and where the post-office is situated. The road along the coast 
from Anstruther to Crail passes through the parish, extending up- 
wards of three miles ; and the road from Anstruther to St An- 
drews intersects the parish in a different direction, to the extent of 
two and a-half miles. Besides these turnpike roads there may be 
two or three miles of statute labour roads. 

Ecclesiastical State and Education. — The old church was of 
much larger dimensions than the present, being 100 feet by 50 
over the walls, and having the roof supported by two rows of 
Gothic arches and round pillars. The time of its erection is not 
known. It has been stated by some of the older inhabitants of 
the parish, that on one of its arches was cut a Lochaber axe, 
and on a stone on the west gable outside, was the figure of a sheep, 
as forming part of a coat of arms. Having, upon inspection in 
1806, been found in a dangerous state, it was taken down, and 
a plain commodious building erected on the same site, capable of 
accommodating about 800 sitters, but, in consequence of the rapid 
increase of the population, it should have been enlarged. Adjoin- 
ing the church is an excellent school- room, to which a considerable 
addition has lately been made, and a comfortable dwelling-house 
at the same time built for the accommodation of the schoolmaster. 
Both kirk and school are so placed, as to be convenient for the 
country part of the population ; but, as the great bulk of the in- 
habitants is in Cellardyke, it would have been desirable to have 
had them put down nearer to that locality. 

It appears that William Comyn, Earl of Buchan, with consent 
of his countess, confirmed the grant of the church of Kilrenny in- 
Fife to the monks of Dryburgh, which had been made by the 
Countess Ada, the mother of Malcolm the Fourth and William 
the Lion. The parish church is situated in the village of Kil- 
renny, its distance from the extremities of the parish being about 
two miles. It was built, as has already been mentioned, in 1806, 
and is at present in a good state of repair. The patronage is in 
the possession of Sir Windham C. Anstruther, Bart. The 
manse was built in 1819, and is also in a good state of repair. 
The extent of the glebe is about eleven acres, and is valued about 
L.'27. The stipend is 136 bolls of uieal and the same of barley, 
with L.IO of communion element money.

FIFESIIIRE. 



The great bulk of the population attend the Established Church 
with the exception of some Dissenters, not amounting to a hun- 
dred. The average number of communicants for several years 
past has been upwards of 620. 

Education. — There is one parochial school. There are also a 
female and an infant school, mostly supported by the school fees 
and partly by subscription. There are other two schools upon the 
teachers' own adventure. The female teacher assembles a class 
every Sunday morning for religious instruction, and a Sabbath 
school is taught in the evening, which is numerously attended 
by both boys and girls. The branches of instruction generally 
taught in the parish school, are, English, English grammar, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, geography, French, Latin, mathematics, and na- 
vigation. The salary of the schoolmaster is the maximum, and 
the school fees are 2s. 6d. for English, 3s. 6d. lor arithmetic, and 
5s. for Latin, &amp;c. per quarter. 

The house occupied by the teacher has more than the legal 
accommodation, but the garden ground being deficient, an allow- 
ance is granted by the heritors. The people in general being 
alive to the benefits of education, it is believed that there are 
comparatively few who cannot read or write. 

The only circulating library in the parish is one connected with 
the Sabbath school, which consists of religious publications. 

Several Societies atone time existed in the parish, but they are 
mostly broken up, with the exception of one which the fishermen 
maintain for the support of the aged, and widows and children ; 
and another which a few benevolent individuals some years ago 
organised, for administering a little relief to aged females.

Inns, Sfc. — The number of houses licensed for retailing spirits 
are, in Cellardyke, fourteen, and in Kilrenny, one. There are, 
besides, several other houses licensed only to retail porter, ale, 
and beer. 

Fuel. — Coal is the only fuel which is used in the parish. It is 
procured fvom coal-works in the parishes of Carnbee and Elie, a 
distance of from five to seven miles. The coal which is found in 
the parish is of inferior qujjlity, and used only for burning lime- 
stone. A considerable portion is also brought by sea from the 
coal-works along the Frith, and also from Newcastle, but at a 
greater expense.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF ST ANDREWS, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JOHN 'COOPER, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries. — The name of the parish was most pro- 
bably derived from a large cave anciently called weeni, which is 
situated near where the town is now built, as also from coal-pita 
having been early wrought in the same locality. 

Whether Pittenweem originally was a parish or not is uncertain. 
The parish extends from east to west about a mile and a half, and 
is half a mile in breadth. It is bounded by the parish of An- 
struther Wester on the east, by the same and Carnbee on the north, 
and by St Monance on the west. The Frith of Forth bounds it 
on the south. The grounds in the parish are flat. The soil is 
in general a black loam, and very fertile ; producing heavy crops 
of wheat and barley. 

Geoloffi/.— This parish forms part of the coal-field of Fife. 
The mountain limestone, constituting the lowest bed of the for- 
mation, is here seen to crop out on the surface to the west of the 
town, and above this are workable seams of coal. The intrusion 
of trap rocks has formed an anticlinal axis, so that the seams of

coal dip in two directions. The precise period when coal began 
to be worked in the pits here cannot be ascertained. The tradi- 
tion is, that a pit was opened by order of Oliver Cromwell, who 
took possession of the Earl of Kelly's estate, of which it then 
formed a part, and this old working still goes under the name of 
Cromwell's Pit. After the working had been long discontinued, 
it was recommenced by the proprietor, Sir John Anstruther, about 
the year 1770 on a large scale, and still continues. An exten- 
sive salt manufactory was also established by the same active 
proprietor ; but this has been long ago given up. 

II. — Civil History. 

Burgh. — The burgh of Pittenweem consists of a street extend- 
ing from east to west, with the parish church at the east end, — a 
street which fronts the harbour, and another of more recent erec- 
tion running parallel to those on the line of the county road. Se- 
veral lanes connect these streets from north to south. The 
houses, both of the old and new parts of the town, are substantial 
and neatly built. There are several excellent shops well filled 
with merchandise, and the whole place exhibits an air of cleanli- 
ness, comfort, and respectability. 

The burgh was at first a burgh of barony, holding of the priors 
of the Priory of Pittenweem, but. in 1542, by a charter of James V. 
granted in favour of John, then prior, it was erected into a 
royal burgh, and, in 1547, the prior and convent granted to the 
" provost, bailies, council, community, burgesses, and inhabi- 
tants, the burgh as the same was builded, or to have been builded, 
and the harbour thereof, and all moors, mosses, and waste ground, 
common ways, and other commonties, liberties, customs, anchor- 
ages, &amp;c. belonging thereto." In 1593, a charter was also granted 
by James VI. to the town " of that great house or lodging of the 
Monastery of Pittenweem." These charters were all ratified and 
confirmed by act of Parliament in June 1633. 

In 1651, King James VI. passed through the burgh, and slept 
a night at Anstruther House'. On this occasion his Majesty was 
received by the bailies, and council, and minister ' in their best 
apparel," and with them twenty-four of the ablest men in their 
" best apparel, with partizans, and other twenty-four with musquets." 
A table was spread at " Robert Smith's yeet," and the King and 
his followers regaled with " sundrie great bunns of fine flour and 
other wheat bread of the best order, baken with sugar, cannell, 
and other spices fitting, as also ten gallons of ale, with Canary,

sack, Rhenish wine, Tent, white, and claret wines. A discharge 
of " thirty-six cannon, all shot at once," announced the departure 
of the royal guest. 

One of the vessels belonging to the Spanish Armada was 
driven to this coast in great distress, and put into the harbour of 
Anstruther Easter, where the people were hospitably treated. 

In 1779, the inhabitants of the burgh were alarmed by the pa- 
pearance of the celebrated Paul Jones, whose small squadron lay 
off the harbour, for several hours, about half a mile from the shore. 
A pilot who went off, on the supposition that the ships were Bri- 
tish, was detained, and treated very uncivilly, nor was he set at 
liberty till after the engagement which Paul Jones had with the 
British fleet. 

The Priory of Pittenweem was founded for canons-regular, who 
were first introduced into Scotland about the year 1114. It be- 
longed to the Priory of St Andrews, and had considerable landed 
property, the Isle of May belonging to it, besides the churches 
of Anstruther Wester, Rhynd, and others. John Rowle, 
prior of Pittenweem, was one of the Lords of Session. His 
name first appears in the Sederunt Book, 5th November 
1544. In March 1542, he had bee one of the Lords for 
discussing of domes, and in March 1544 he appears as one of 
the Lords of the Articles. In 1550 he accompanied the Regent 
Murray to France and died in 1553. In 1583, William Stewart, 
a captain in the King's Guard, descended from Alan Stewart 
of Darnley, obtained a charter of the priory and lands of Pitten- 
weem, and was afterwards styled Commendator of the same. 
In 1806, the lands and baronies belonging to the priorv were 
erected into a temporal lordship in favour of Frederick Stewart, 
his son, who had farther charters in 1609 and 1618. He died, as 
is supposed, without issue, and the title has never since been claim- 
ed. Previous to his death he disponed the lordship to Thomas 
Earl of Kellie, who, with consent of his son, Alexander Lord 
Fenton, surrendered the superiority of the same into the hands of 
the King. A considerable portion of the buildings of the priory 
is still standing and inhabited. The prior's house is now the pro- 
perty and the residence of the Right Rev. David Low, LL. D., 
Bishop of the Scottish Episcopal United Diocese of Ross and 
Argyle. The walls of the precinct are still entire, and with the 
other buildings serve to indicate the original extent of the priory 
and its domains.

A little below the priory, in the direction of the sea beach, is a 
large cave with two apartments, in the inner of which is a well of 
excellent water. Where the two apartments join, there is a stone 
stair, which led up to a subterranean passage that communicated 
with the priory by another stair. The two stairs still are to be 
seen, but the passage, which must have been about fifty yards in 
length, has been obliterated by the falling down of the superin- 
cumbent earth. 

The burgh is now governed by a chief magistrate, three bailiesy 
nineteen councillors, a treasurer, and clerk ; the latter acting 
as assessor to the magistrates. They have the usual legal juris- 
diction of other burghs, but few cases come before them. There 
is no guildry or incorporated trades. The property of the burgh 
consists of lands, mills, slaughter-houses, and byres ; ship-build- 
ing yard, cellar, and shed ; shares in a granary, washing-house, 
and bleaching-green ; seats in parish church ; harbour, petty cus- 
toms, shore, boom, and crane dues ; ironstone on the sea shore, 
sea- ware; stances for curing herrings, feu duties, and ground an- 
nuals. The income is variable : for the year ending October 
1839, it was L.466, 4s. 2d. Sterling, besides considerable arrears 
owing to the town and money in bank. The debt owing by the 
town was at the same period L.1200 Sterling, but the expenditure 
is considerably within the income. The harbour is much expos- 
ed to south-east winds, but much attention is paid to its improve- 
ment by the magistrates. 

Dp Douglas, Bishop of Salisbury, was born and received the 
rudiments of his education in this burgh, where his father was a 
resident merchant. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1755 was 939 

1801, - 1072 

1831, - 1317 

1841, - 1349 

IV. — Industry. 

In former times a considerable trade was carried on here. In 
1639 the ships belonging to the port consisted of thirteen sail of 
large vessels, besides fishing boats. Many of these were, however, 
lost or taken by the enemy, and the trade afterwards declined. 
Kelp was at one time manufactured on the shores, but that busi- 
ness has been also given up. 

At present a considerable trade is carried on in Iverrmg fishmg 
and curing, and white fishing. A few sloops and schooners be- 



PITTENWEEM.

long to the town, and a considerable number of fishing boats; but 
as Anstruther Easter has a better harbour, the shipping is chiefly 
connected with that port. 

There are grain mills belonging to the town, but which are let 
out to a tenant. At one period there were no less than thirty 
breweries in the burgh, but at present there is only one. 

Rental. — The valued rent of the parish is L.2452 Scots. The 
annual value of real property in 1815 was L.1712 Sterling, of 
which L,1127 was assessed on the burgh, and L.585 Sterling on 
the landward part of the parish. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The patron is Sir W. C. Anstruther, Bart 
The stipend is L.166, Is. lOd. The yearly value of the glebe 
is L.12, 12s. The church is apparently of a very old date, and is 
supposed to have formed part of a priory which formerly existed 
here. 

Education, — The parochial schoolmaster has a school-house, 
dwelling-house, and garden ; the salary is the maximum. The 
average number of scholars is ninety. 

There is, besides, an unendowed school, at which there may be 
about the same number of pupils; and a female school, sup- 
ported merely by subscription, with an attendance of from sixty 
to eighty pupils.

nilESBYTERY OF DUNFEllMLI NE, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. GEORGE BUCHANAN, D. D. MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name was formerly written Kynross or Kynrosse. 
The word is of Gaelic origin, signifying the head of the promontory, 
and referring to the position of the parish at the extremity of a point 
of land running into the lake. This seems to be a better explanation 
of the name of the town and parish than that assigned in the former 
Statistical Account, viz. that it stands at the head of that tract lying 
betwixt the Friths f Forth and Tay, which had the appellation 
of Ross or the Peninsula. The etymology now given has the 
sanction of Christopher Irvine, whose work, entitled Historice 
Scotica Nomenclatura, contains these words : " Kinrossium. The 
town of Kinross, lying at the beginning or head of a point of land 
that runneth into the west side of Lochleven, and this is the rea- 
son of its name in the old language." See his work, p. 117, Edin- 
burgh, 1683. 

Extent, §-c. — The parish of Kinross hardly extends 4 miles in 
length from east to west, and from south to north, and con- 
tains about 14 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the 
lake, which leaves only a small portion of land betwixt it and 
the town, and part of the parish of Orwell ; on the south, by an 
angle of the parish of Portmoak and by the parish of Cleish ; on 
the west, by the united parish of Tullibole and Fossaway ; and on 
the north, by that of Orwell. It forms a sort of trapezium. 

There are no eminences within the parish to which the appel- 
lation of mountains, or even of hills, can in strict propriety be ap- 
plied, and hence its area is often called the laigh or level of Kin- 
ross, presenting, m this respect, a striking contrast'to the heights 
of the four adjoming parishes. The surface of Lochleven is 360 
feet and odds above the level of the sea; but the most elevated 
portion of the parish is not 100 feet above the surface of the lake. 

Meteorology.— The altitude of the parish, the range of the 
Cleish and Ochil hills skirting it both on the south and north, and 

KINROSS. A

the evaporation of the.waters of the lake, all concur in rendering the 
climate of Kinross parish, moist, cold, and variable. So far as 
this climate depends on evaporation, a great improvement has been 
accomplished, and will go on, by means of the recent operations 
upon Lochleven, and the increasing exertions of cultivators of the 
soil to convert wet land into dry ; of which, more particular men- 
tion will be made in a subsequent part of this account. 

About sixty years ago, agues were very prevalent, in consequence 
of the marshes and stagnant water which then abounded. Now, 
a case of ague is seldom to be met with. Rheumatism, often pro- 
ceeding from the same causes as ague, or at least very much ag- 
gravated by them, is both of rare occurrence and less severe than 
before. 

It is also not unworthy of remark, that our harvest frosts, which 
some years ago left the potato stems in the lower grounds alto- 
gether black, while in the upper they remained fresh and green, — 
are now far less frequently attended with these effects. And to what 
is this so much to be attributed as to a less copious exhalation  

Hydrography. — Throughout this parish, there lie scattered 
many perennial springs, " as clear as crystal, and as cold as ice," 
arising from a sandy or gravelly bottom. They yield water of ex- 
cellent quality. But there is none to which recourse is had for 
any medicinal or chemical purposes. 

Among the different objects connected with the parish of Kin- 
ross, there is none which imparts to it so much celebrity, interest, 
attraction, and value, as the magnificent sheet of water which forms 
its eastern boundary. The pen and the pencil have been so often 
employed in the description of this lake, and have been employed so 
well, that nothing of the kind is required or will be looked for in 
this Account. 

Yet it may not be unnecessary to observe, that while the ope- 
rations which the lake has given rise to within these few years, 
have certainly taken from its general impressiveness, as well as 
from its extent, it still presents an appearance on which the ad- 
mirer of nature delights to dwell. The appearance referred to, 
in calm weather, and under an unclouded sky, is that of mild 
beauty, rather than of picturesque grandeur. Under moonlight, 
and when " all the air a solemn stillness holds," the views from 
the road leading to the old church-yard are in no ordinary degree 
sweet and soothing. 

Now that Lochleven has been subjected to a considerable drain- 

4 



KINROSS. 



age, its extent or circuit is 12 miles, being 3 less than in its ori- 
ginal state, its depth 14 feet at its medium height, being 41 feet 
less than formerly. 

" The surface of the loch," says Dr Fleming of Aberdeen, in 
his Interim Report on its Fishings, " previous to the late partial 
dramage, extended to 4638 imperial acres. It is now diminished 
from the high-water flood to the top of the spill-water 1095 acres, 
thus leaving its maximum state at 3543 acres, according to the 
testimony of the Commissioners. By this mode of estimating the 
change, the loch would appear to have been diminished about one- 
fourth of its extent. But the water is seldom if ever allowed to 
rise to the height of the spill-water. Hence it appears expedient 
to increase by one-third, 365 acres, the recognized diminution of 
1095 acres, thus making in all the diminution of the area of the 
loch, and its consequent value, as it may be viewed as a fish-pond, 
of 1460 acres, as equal to one-third of its former dimensions." 

Within the circuit of Loehleven there are several islands, but all 
inconsiderable and insignificant, with the exception of two, one of 
vyhich is the island of St Serf or Servanus, or the Inch, which the pa- 
rish of Portmoak claims as its own, and which, as such, has been de- 
scribed in the old Statistical Account of that parish. The other, al- 
though considerably smaller, being only five acres in extent, is com- 
monly called the Castle Island or Castle, in consequenceofanancient 
fort and buildings being connected with it, which cover a great part of 
its surface. The oldest and largest building, and for the particulars 
of which the last Statistical Account may be consulted, is ascribed to 
a king of the Picts. In the absence of any thing like historical 
certainty on this point, it seems more reasonable to believe that 
many additions and alterations have taken place in the course of 
centuries, than to suppose, as Dr Walker in his Essays on Natu- 
ral History and Rural Economy, under the head Loehleven, has 
done, that, from its form, it appears to have been built in the time 
ot James II. of Scotland, who began to reign in 1436. Indeed, the 
facts to be afterwards mentioned render such an opinion altogether 



When, in the progress of arts, and manufacturing industry, a very 
considerable number of mills and bleachfields, requiring a large and 
permanent supply of water, had been erected on the Leven, which 
runs out of the lake, and when in a dry season that supply was often 
quite inadequate for the purpose,— it became an object of no small 
moment to the owners of these works, to render the basin of Loehleven 



4 



KINROSS-SHIRE. 



a reservoir on which they could depend throughout the year. But 
the means to be employed for this object, were the very same which 
made it for the interest of the landed proprietors around the lake, 
and of none so much as the proprietor of Kinross estate, to unite with 
the owners of the mills and bleachfields in taking steps to diminish 
the extent of the lake, — a work which, by lessening its evapora- 
tion, gave a more equable and steady supply to its outlet, while it 
added to the arable acres of the district. Accordingly, George 
Graham, Esq. of Kinross, first moved in the scheme, and after him 
Thomas Graham, Esq. with still more activity. It was not, however, 
until after the decease of this gentleman, and during the minority of 
his grandson, Graham Montgomery, Esq. son of Sir James Mont- 
gomery, Bart, that all opposition and difficulty were surmounted. 

Geology. — The rocks are sandstone, hmestone, and trap or whin- 
stone. The sandstone consists of two varieties, one of which belongs 
to the old red sandstone formation, and the other to the under car- 
boniferous group. No good section of either occurs within the 
parish, and our knowledge of the existence of the former is chief- 
ly obtained from an examination of the geognosy and structure of 
the surrounding district. The old red prevails throughout the en- 
tire extent of Stratheden, flanking the southern slope of the 
Ochils from Strathmiglo westwards, and cropping out at various 
places in the neighbouring parish of Orwell, whence it ranges in a 
south-westerly direction through the basin of which Kinross occu- 
pies the centre. It consists of two beds, the lower of which is an 
extremely coarse conglomerate, containing fragments of quartz, 
granite, slate, hornblende, felspar, and several members of the 
trap family, varying from the size of a garden pea to three or four 
inches in diameter : the upper bed is fine-grained, hard and com- 
pact, and forms an excellent building stone. The dip varies from 
an angle of 8 to 12°. No organic remains have been detected 
in this deposit in any of the quarries in the vicinity. Binnarty 
hill rests upon a yellow sandstone, which differs in its mineralogi- 
cal character from the sandstone of the coal-field, and which is 
supposed to be more nearly allied to the old red. But the inter- 
vention of the loch and other obstructions prevent any satisfactory 
researches being made into the nature of this interesting deposit, 
so far as its range is connected with the parish of Kinross. 

The carboniferous sandstone occurs in the western division of 
the parish on the farm of the property of Mr Spovvart. It is said ' 
to contain beds of coal, lut to what extent this valuable combusti- 



KINROSS.

ble exists in the locality is still matter of conjecture only. The 
position of this rock is sufficiently indicated by its relation to a 
similar deposit in the adjacent parish of Cleish, where it underlies 
the mountain limestone : and to the westward a few miles, near 
the Crook of Devon, the old red again emerges. If such be its 
true position, as we have every reason to believe that it is, any beds 
of coal that may be found in it will be such as are characteristic 
of the group with which it is connected, amounting, as in other 
•places, to two or three in number, and of inconsiderable thickness. 
Limestone accompanies this sandstone, but of what quality and 
extent, whether it belongs to the carboniferous limestone, or to the 
cornstone of the old red sandstone series, we have not the means 
of determining. No section of these rocks is exposed to view ; a 
thick covering of aluminous earth overlies the surface ; but the 
intelligent proprietor, from his excavations and drainings, as well 
as great practical knowledge of the minerals of the district, has 
been enabled to ascertain the existence of a calcareous deposit be- 
neath. 

Whinstone, or rather porphyry, is no less sparingly distributed in 
this parish. Two varieties only occur, namely, compact felspar, and 
claystone porphyry. The former is quarried towards the south side 
of the parish at Calcarnie, and occupies the ridge to the westwards. 
This rock is extremely close and compact in texture, and is much 
used as a road metal. It has a reddish ash-grey colour, and contains 
minute crystals of hornblende and carbonate of lime. The clay- 
stone porphyry, which is of a mixed iron-red and ochreous colour, 
may be observed behind the farm-steading of Calcarnie, and seems 
to run in the form of a vein in a north-easterly and south-westerly 
direction. It is traversed by veins of carbonate of lime, and also 
contains large masses of the same, along with crvstals of glassy 
fel spar and augite. It is stained in various places with dark-green 
spots, which would seem to indicate the presence in small quanti- 
ties, of copper, and which arise in all probability from the oxida- 
tion of that metal. Boulders of the primitive rocks are abundant- 
ly distributed, consisting of granite, quartz, mica slate, horn- 
blende and greenstone. None of these are of very large dimen- 
sions, but all are much water-worn, and bear sufficient marks of 
attrition to which they have been subjected in the course of their 
transportation. Masses of diluvium, of considerable depth, may 
be observed in several localities, and which consists chiefly of the 
debris of the old red sandstone.

If Mr Spowart, who is well acquainted, and is still connected, 
with working of coal at Dunfermline, on an extensive scale, shall fail 
in discovering, as he once hoped to do, that mineral in his lands in 
this parish, none need make a subsequent attempt. 

Zooy.— Passing from a subject of inquiry, in which, so far as 
this parish is concerned, little is to be added to the general stock of 
mineralogical information, the next branch of natural history, viz. 
zoology, is one in which there is much more variety, and the mate- 
rials are much more interesting. 

It is much to be feared that one of the effects of the late partial 
drainage of the lake, has been the destruction of some of the spe- 
cies of the fish, together with the diminution of the number and de- 
terioration of the quality of others. Certain of the sorts of which Dr 
Walker has written, seem now to be extinct, and the char, Sabno al- 
pinus, one of the finest fishes of the loch, has almost disappeared; in 
so much that Dr Fleming, so well known as a zoologist, and who has 
been appointed a valuator of the damage done to the fishing of 
Lochleven by the above-mentioned partial drainage, estimates it 
at L. 73, 6s. 8d. per annum. The three circumstances to which the 
learned Doctor ascribes this permanent injury are, Jirst, the cur- 
tailment of the area of the loch, secondly, the continued abstrac- 
tion of the fish by the currents at the new sluices, and lastly, the 
barrenness of the new margin of the lake. The weight of some 
of the trout has been 6 lbs. of 22 oz. to the pound; nay, one was 
caught nearly 18 lb. Pike has been caught in 1822, wanting only 
half-a-pound of two stones, or 42 lb. Dutch weight. 

The trouts of Lochleven feed on insects of every description, 
and very much on red earthworms, and insects from the side of 
the loch. According to Mr James M'Gill, who has spent the 
greater part of his life at Kinross, and who is uncommonly well ac- 
quainted with the natural history of the district, many of the fishes 
in Lochleven devour others. There are some that prey on min- 
nows, and some on shell -fish of every description ; but these last are 
trouts of inferior quality. That which seems to give the high 
colour to the fish of the lake, is the animalculse they feed on, im- 
perceptible to the naked eye. These minute insects are very 
abundant, and trouts in full season are always gorged with them. 
They resemble jelly after they have remained a little while in the 
stomach of the fish. When the contents of their stomach are not 
dried, the colour is of a light pink; when dried, red. 

The fishing of Lochleven, which begins on the first of January 



KINROSS. 



and ends on the first of September, is at present let for seven 
years, at L, 204 per annum. The price of trout, which thirty years 
ago was 4d. is now Is. a-pound at Kinross, although often lower at 
Edinburgh, Glasgow, and even at Manchester, where there has 
been of late a regular market for it. Pikes are sold at 2d. a-pound, 
and perches, which are most plentiful during the heat of summer, 
at 2d. a-dozen. There is now no stated fishing of eels, as for- 
merly, from August till December. Two boats and four boatmen 
are employed during one part of the fishing season. The two men 
employed throughout the whole of it have lis. a-week ; the other 
two, whose labours are confined to the summer months only, 10s. 
With regard to the fishes, it is further to be noticed, that they 
ascend the tributary streams of the lake, ready to spawn by the 
middle of August, and continue to do so nearly the whole month 
of February. 

We here add an extract from an article in the Transactions of 
the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1839, entitled " Account of a 
new species of British Bream, and of an undescribed species of 
Skate : to which is added a List of the Fishes of the Frith of 
Forth, and its tributary streams, with observations, by Richard 
Parnell, M.D., F. R. S., E., &amp;c. 

" Salmo coecifer, Parnell, bearing coeca, — the coeca being more 
numerous than in any of its congeners; Salmo Levenensis, Wal- 
ker, Lochleven trout, common in Lochleven. This species of trout, 
which is well known to many'persons as a delicious article of food, 
is considered by most naturalists as a variety of the Salmo fario or 
common fresh water trout, the redness of its flesh depending on 
the nature of its food. I consider it, however, not only as distinct 
from the Salmo fario, but as one of the best defined and most con- 
stant in its characters of all the species hitherto described. It is 
at once distinguished from the common fresh water trout by the 
number of its coecal appendages, which vary from seventy to eighty, 
whereas in the Salmo fario they are never more than forty-five or 
forty-six in number. Its tail is crescent-shaped at all ages, and its 
body has never a vestige of a red spot. The tail of the common trout 
is sinuous, and at length even at the end, and its body is almost 
always marked with red spots, besides its flesh being always of a 
white appearance. 

" I have no doubt that more than two species of trout are to be 
met with in our fresh water streams, which at present receive the 
name Salmo fario' — P. 1.54.

Referring to the birds that repair to Lochleven, it is deserving 
of notice, that a new one made its appearance about thirty years 
ago. It became very lame, and was called the Swedish crossbill. 
It comes in autumn, and its coming was thought to prognosticate 
bad weather. It feeds on buds and cones of fir. It frequents the 
plantings at the churchyard. Its colour is red, resembling that of 
a parrot. The bill crosses, and hence the name of cross-bill. 

Botany. — There are three plants found in the parish of Kinross, 
which that eminent botanist, Dr Arnott of Arlary, has not yet 
observed elsewhere in the county. The one is Clieiranthus cheiriy 
\a.r. Jruticulosus, or wallflower, growing on Lochleven Castle; the 
other is Cerastium arvense, found at Lathro, nearly opposite to the 
gate at Lethangie, east approach ; the third is Bromus sterilis, on 
the roadside to the church-yard. 

There were some trees of a stunted appearance betwixt the 
lands of Lethangie and Kinross, or Lochleven, by report and ap- 
pearance, several centuries old, which were lately cut down. There 
are trees in the avenue that attract, by their size and form, the at- 
tention of the stranger. There is a beautiful walnut in front of 
the mansion house ; and a remarkable ash in the Castle island, 
which was split by lightning, and part of which rests on the western 
wall of the castle. 

II. — Civil History. 

Of this parish, as such, there are no accounts, so far as the wi'i- 
terof these pages has either seen or heard, nor any maps, plans, or 
surveys. Of the county of Kinross, there has been a very correct 
map by Rennie. Of the counties of Kinross and Fife, a very hand- 
some as well as accurate one was published by an English com- 
pany a few years ago. 

In Gough's British Topography, Vol. ii. 1780, it is stated that 
Andrew Rutherford drew a view of the beautiful thorn tree, near 
Kinross, and of Lochleven Castle. In Font's Maps of Scotland 
in the Advocates' Library, folio xvii., there is one of Kinross-shire, 
described 28th October 1642, by James Gordon of " Keanross," 
■with the loch and adjacent countries, sixteen inches and a half by 
thirteen and a half. This is the oldest map of the county, and a 
great curiosity. 

Eminent Characters. — One of the first of these is Sir William 
Bruce, who built the mansion-house of Kinross. He was archi- 
tect to Charles II. The Falace of Holyrood was his design, as 
were also Hopetoun and Moncreiff Houses. Kinross House was

originally intended for the residence of James, Duke of York, 
afterwards James VII. of Scotland, in the event of his being pre- 
vented by the Exclusion Bill from succeeding to his brother. 

It must be added, that Dr John Thomson, the present distin- 
guished Professor of General Pathology in the University of Edin- 
burgh, is a native of this parish. 

Ministers of /he Parish. — Clergymen within and without the Es- 
tablishment, who were born or carried on their ministerial labours in 
this parish, were respected and esteemed in their day, and have left 
behind them memorials, shewing that, for their contemporaries and 
posterity, they did notlive in vain. The Rev. Robert Stark, although 
his settlement in 1732, was nearly coeval with the rise of the Seces- 
sion Church, and was the occasion of much division and strife, was a 
superior preacher, and, in particular, the author of an essay on the 
Ethiopian of the Acts of the Apostles, which has been much admired 
both by Churchmen and Dissenters. The Rev. John Swanston, or- 
dained minister of the Associate congregation of Kinross, 23d 
January 1748, was appointed to the office of Professor of Divinity in 
May 1764. This office, along with that of Minister of the Gospel, he 
held at Kinross, until his death at Perth on the 12th of June 1767. 
His biographer, Mr Eraser, minister at Kennoway, speaks of him 
as equally distinguished by the eminence of his piety and the depth 
of his theological attainments. A volume of his discourses, rich in 
the grace and truth of the gospel, has been long in the hands of 
the Christian public. The incumbent of Kinross parish imme- 
diately preceding the present, preached before the Synod of Glas- 
gow and Ayr a sermon, afterwards published, on the subject and 
manner of apostolical preaching. 

The ministers of Kinross parish since the Reformation, as far as 
the writer can ascertain, are as follows : — James Dolby, or Dobie, 
or Dowie, first-mentioned, a. d, 1567 ; — had under his superintend- 
ence the kirks of Orwell and Ballingry, while Mr Walter Balfour 
and Mr Alexander Wardlaw were readers and exhorters ; Robert 
Rait, 1590 ; John Colden, 1607, — conformed to presbytery in 
1638, and died in 1640 ; Mr George Colden, probably a son of 
the former, admitted 1641, and died in 1665. " Of George Gol- 
den it is reported that he died at St Andrews, whither he had gone 
to have an interview with Archbishop Sharp on some of the rights 
and interests of his benefice, but where he met with no redress or 
satisfaction. Such was the attachment borne to this minister, that 
a number of his people went to St Andrews, and bore his mortal 
remains to Kinross as his place of interment. Mr James Forsyth

was translated from Moonzie to Kinross, 23d November 1665; Mr 
Henry Christie was settled in 1682, and ejected for not praying 
for William and Mary in 1689 ; he was, afterwards, in 1709, con- 
secrated as a nonjuring bishop, and died in Kinross, in 1718, with 
the respect and affection of all who knew him. In Kinross church- 
yard, there is still to be seen the tombstone of Mr Christie, hav- 
ing a brass plate and a Latin epitaph in verse. Mr William Spence, 
next in order, was admitted 1689 ; Mr Robert Macgill, 1699; Mr 
Robert Stark, 1732; Mr Archibald Smith, 1784; the present 
incumbent, 1804. 

Speaking of religious persons connected with Lochleven, it may 
not be improper to mention that, at the dissolution of the monas- 
teries, Robert Pitcairn, commendator of the Abbey of Dunferm- 
line, and Secretary of State to James VI. in the regency of Len- 
nox, died in the castle of Lochleven, 1584, aged sixty-four. He 
was one of those engaged in the Raid of Ruthven, and as such, 
was carried prisoner to Lochleven. He was Royal Legate as well 
as Secretary to James VI. His tomb is in Dunfermline church- 
yard ; and on the lintel of a house occupied by him in the May- 
gate there is this couplet ;

Chief Land-owners. — The chief land owners are, Graham Mont- 
gomery, Esq., eldest son of Sir James Montgomery, of Stanhope, 
Bart, by the younger daughter of the late Thomas Graham of 
Kinross and Burleigh, Esq ; and the Earl of Kinnoul, who lately 
purchased the lands of Colden, &amp;c. once the property of Charles 
Stein, Esq. of Hattonburn. 

Parochial Registers. — The Session records extantcontain theacts 
of that court from 8th October 1665 until 13th May 1683. There is 
alsoatthe end of these records, a register of baptisms, from April 1676 
to March 1684. There is a second series from the 20th of May 1683 
to the 29th September 1689, with a register of baptisms from the 24th 
July 1684 to the 23d of August 1689, when the minister, Mr Chris- 
tie, was removed. The third begins the 29th May 1699, and ends 
9th November 1718. The fourth begins 29th January 1719, and 
ends 24th July 1741. The fifth is from 28th September 1741, 
to 26th March 1753. The sixth, from 17th April 1753 to 24th 
July 1754. There is a register of baptisms in a quarto volume from 
30th April 1699, and ending 2d April 1727, together with a re- 
gister of proclamations from the 23d of May 1699, to the 6th of 
January 1727. Another similar, from 9th April 1727 till 16th April

1770. A register of burying-grounds ; and a register of deaths 
from 1733 to 1735. Loose minutes beginning the 4th of July 1754, 
and ending 6th March 1771. From 1772 the session records are 
complete ; and now every minute is subscribed by the moderator. 

From the Session records, it appears to have been the practice 
more than a century ago, of a part of the kirk-session visiting the 
town during the time of pubUc worship, and making a report to 
their brethren. 

Antiquities, §-c.— In the month of June 1820, a number of sil- 
ver coins were discovered on the lands of Coldon, to the south 
of Kinross, having been turned up by workmen in one of the 
fields. When found, they were quite covered with a black coat- 
ing darker than the earth from which they were dug. The num- 
ber might amount from 300 to 400, and were found to consist 
chiefly of the coinage of Edward the First and Edward the Second 
of England. They were of the denomination commonly called 
silver pennies, and seem to have come from various mints, e. g. 
London, Canterbury, York, Durham, Lincoln, and Dublin. Some 
of them, instead of having the place of coinage, had on the reverse 
the name Robert de Hadeleir surrounding the X . Along with these 
English coins, a few Scotch were found of Alexander III. and John 
Baliol. They very much resembled the English in size and ap- 
pearance. If they differed in any thing, it was that they were 
rather more handsome : — the King's head was a profile with a 
crown and sceptre surrounded by Alexander Dei Gra. and Joannes 
Dei Gra. The reverse had a X with four stars, surrounded 
by Rex Scotorum. When and how these coins came to be depo- 
sited in the place where they were discovered, is a matter of con- 
jecture. Most probably, they had been lost by some person at- 
tached to one of the English armies, who, in the period of the so- 
vereigns referred to, and thereafter, so frequently occupied the 
country in the vicinity of Kinross, for the purpose of getting pos- 
session of the Castle of Lochleven, or of overawing that fortress, 
then a place of considerable strength and importance. 

In the month of April 1829, some labourers employed by John 
W. Williamson, Esq. Banker, Kinross, in examining his grounds at 
West Green, found, about two feet below the surface, imbedded in 
what appeared to be travelled earth, an ancient seal of pure gold, of 
a circular shape, eight-tenths of an inch in diameter, and two-tenths 
of an inch in thickness. It has two small wings also of gold joined in 
the centre by a neat hinge, which folds flat on the upper side of the 
seal, and when raised serves for a handle. This very curious piece of 



12 



KINIIOSS-SI-IIRE. 



workmanship, weighing four sovereigns, appears from its flat shape 
to have been intended for the pocket ; and as it has engraved on it 
the royal arms of Scotland impaled on the dexter side, with those 
of England on the sinister, it was at once considered, according 
to the laws of heraldry, as the private seal or signet of a Scottish 
King, who had married an English princess. The seal was shewn 
to several Edinburgh antiquaries ; and among others, to the late 
Sir Walter Scott, the late Sir Patrick Walker, Mr Auriol Hay, 
and Mr William Clerk, all of whom were decidedly of opinion, 
that it was the personal seal of the unfortunate James IV., who 
fell on the fatal field of Flodden. James, it is well known, mar- 
ried Margaret, daughter of Henry VH. of England. 

The seal is in perfect preservation, and affords a favourable 
view of the art of engraving in Scotland more than three centu- 
ries ago. How this relic of the olden time found its way to Kin- 
ross, must be mere conjecture ; yet is it no great stretch of ima- 
gination, that the ill-fated Mary had possession of this memorial 
of her grandfather, and may have dropt it in making her escape 
from the Castle of Lochleven  A more probable opinion may be 
hazarded, which is, that James himself may have lost this seal 
while hunting or travelling from his palace of Falkland to Stirling, 
Kinross being in the direct line betwixt these two royal residences. 
This view is strengthened by the fact, that there was found at the 
same time with the seal, and within a few yards of it, the corrod- 
ed fragment of a horse's shoe, — a circumstance which would lead 
us to suppose, that the royal charger, in losing a shoe, had stum- 
bled, and thrown his rider, when the seal dropt from his person. 

In 1822, the proprietor of Lathro, on trenching some of his 
grounds which had been planted sixty or seventy years before, 
came upon thirteen graves, which did not appear to contain any 
coffins ; but in one of them were two bodies, and a skull filled with 
undecayed teeth. This burying-ground "was on an eminence be- 
side the ground trenched, and called the Gallows Know, and hence 
it is naturally supposed to have been the place of publid execu- 
tion. This burying-ground must have been used before the abo- 
lition of heritable jurisdictions, and when the proprietors of the 
estate of Kinross had the power of pit and gallows. With regard 
to the bodies discovered, they were again committed to the earth, 
and the spot where they were found has been planted anew. 

The Castle of Lochleven, so far back as 1257, was a royal re- 
sidence. We read that, in that year, Alexander HI. and his youth- 



KINROSS. 



13 



ful queen were forcibly laid hold upon in this place, and carried off 
to Stirling. In Balfour's Annals, we have mention made of Sir John 
Corny n in 1301 raising the siege of Lochleven, then besieged by the 
English. In 1 3.35, as has been related by Buchanan, Abercromby, 
Sir David Dalrymple, and for a particular account of which 
transaction see Fordiini Scotichromcon, Vol. ii. p. 313, Edinburgh, 
1759, folio, Sir John Strevelyn invested Lochleven, at that time 
held by Alan Vypont, in the interest of David II. and was compel- 
led to raise the siege with great loss. ' In 1429, Archibald Earl 
of Douglas, on account of some inconsiderate speeches against 
his sovereign James I., was committed a prisoner to the same 
castle ; and in 1477, Patrick Graham, an eminent dignitary of the 
Scottish Church, and Archbishop of St Andrews, was, by a sen- 
tence of deprivation and imprisonment pronounced by Pope Sextus 
VI. 1484, and a college of cardinals, committed first to a cell in 
Inchcolm, removed thence to the monastery of Dunfermline, and 
lastly, for greater security, to Lochleven, where he died, and whence 
his mortal remains were carried to the island of St Serf. The 
Earl of Northumberland, who had taken refuge in Scotland to 
avoid the effects of Queen Elizabeth's displeasure, was also con- 
signed to Lochleven Castle in 1 569. The then ruling party placed 
and kept him there for three years, when he was removed to Eng- 
land, and there put to death by his sovereign. 

But all these are unimportant events in comparison of those that 
befel a Queen of Scotland, the most illustrious and most interest- 
ing, perhaps, that ever swayed a sceptre, by her beauty and per- 
sonal qualities, as well as the lengthened train of calamities to 
which she was subjected, and the termination of a captivity of 
twenty years, on a scaffold, by the hands of the pubhc executioner. 
It appears from a deed printed in Laing's " Dissertation on the 
Murder of Darnley," and entitled " Act for sequestrating the 
Quenis Majesties person, and detening the same in the hous and 
place of Lochlevin, 16 June 1567;"' that the unfortunate Mary 
was in Lochleven on the 16th June 1567. None acquainted 
with her eventful and tragical story can be ignorant of the man- 
ner of her escape, on Sunday the 2d of May 1568. We are 
informed, in the history of Mary's escape from Lochleven, that 
when her deliverer had opened the gates of the castle and shut 
them again, he threw the keys into the lake. Now, it is 
not undeserving of record, that, at the close of the very dry 
autumn of 1805, when the lake was uncommonly low, a boy, who 



14 



KINROSS-SHIRK. 



had been sauntering along its brink, picked up a bunch of keys, 
which he carried immediately to the parish schoolmaster, the late 
Mr John Taylor, — in whose possession the writer of this account 
has frequently had occasion to see them. They were very rusty, 
and fastened by an iron ring, which mouldered away on being rub- 
bed by the hand. Mr Taylor sent them to the late Earl of Mor- 
ton, heritable keeper of Lochleven, from whom he received a suit- 
able gratuity to the finder, L. 5 to the poor, and a handsome silver 
inkholder to himself. 

Modern Buildings. — The latest of these, and the most conspi- 
cuous from whatever quarter it is viewed, is the parish church, first 
employed for public worship on the 1 1th of March 1832. Before 
1 742 the parish church stood within the old burying-ground, im- 
mediately beside the lake. It was then removed from this situa- 
tion to another at the west of the town, which, gradually extend- 
ing its dimensions, came at length to place the church in its centre, 
as well as in the very front of the most frequented inn. 

The situation of this second church being very inconvenient, at 
the same time that it was also inadequate in size for the growing 
population, a handsome edifice of the Gothic kind has been erect- 
ed on a rising ground adjoining the manse, and altogether removed 
from the noise and bustle of the town thoroughfare. It cost 
L. 1537, lis. 6d. 

The County Hall, which is also the public gaol, is a still finer 
building. It was finished in 1826, and costL.2000, ofwhich L. 750 
formed a grant from Government, and the remainder was raised by 
a voluntary assessment from the heritors of the county, according 
to the old valued rent. It consists of a course of apartments, ofwhich 
there are 2 for the sheriff-clerk, 1 record room and safe, 1 court 
room, 1 witnesses room, 3 debtors rooms, 2 cells, and a guard-room. 

There are three mills within the parish, the first and most im- 
portant of which goes by the name of Kinross mill, and is for 
all manner of grain ; the second, within a quarter of a mile of 
the town, is Balleave, once for grain, but now employed in the new 
tartan manufactory ; the third, at West Tillyochie, about three 
miles from Kinross, once also occupied in grinding corn, but 
within these few months, taken in lease by one of the three tartan 
manufacturing companies here for the purposes of carding and spin- 
ning of wool on an extended scale ; the first attempt of the kind 
in this quarter, but only, it is to be hoped, the commencement of a 
new era of our manufacturing industry. 



KINROSS. 15 

III. — Population. 
The population of the parish has been on the increase ever 
since it was examined into. 

In 1735, it was 1310 

1792, . 1839 

1801, . 21'24 

1811, . 2214 

and in 1831, . 2927 

Among the more usual causes of the increase of population 
may be noticed a mortification, as it is termed, of land to the value 
of from L. 80 to L. 100 of yearly rent, which, on the death of a 
female of eighty years of age, who receives an annuity of L. 50, 
will come to be divided among the domiciled poor. Such bequest, 
it is greatly to be feared, may prove a premium to idleness, and a 
strong inducement to vagrants to terminate their wanderings here. 
The neighbourhood of coal, and the cheapness of living, may al- 
so contribute to the growing population of the parish. 

The number of the inhabitants of Kinross, is about 2200, and 
of the rest of the parish 727. 

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards, including two properties, one of which belongs to 
the British Linen Company, and the other is disponed in trust 
to the heritors of this parish, is 25. 

From a census made for this work, the number of inhabited 
houses in Kinross appears to be 566 ; of these unlet, 26 ; in ruins, 5. 

There are 3 persons in the parish more or less insane or fatu- 
ous, but not requiring confinement ; 4 blind, 4 deaf and dumb, 
and 1 in the Deaf and Dumb Institution, Edinburgh. 

Character of the People. — The general character of the people 
as to intellect, morals, and religion, is not inferior to that of the 
people of many parishes in like circumstances. There is not in 
their number one professed infidel ; and there exists among them 
a general external reverence for the Sabbath and its public ordi- 
nances ; not a few of them being of exemplary Christian character, 
and of eminent Christian qualifications. Affability, hospitality, and 
a readiness to serve and oblige to the utmost of their power, — nay, 
sometimes beyond what a regard to their own private and family 
interests would dictate, — are peculiarities in the habits of many of 
this place and vicinity, which, to strangers who have come to fix 
their residence here, have been the subject of pleasing observation 
and of grateful experience. 

Poaching, it must be confessed, is still too much practised 
both in the fields and in the tributary streams of Loch Leven. In 



IG 



KINIIOSS-SHIRE. 



the first case, it receives no check from any public association, 
and next to none from any individual whatsoever. In the last case, 
it is not unfrequent, at certain seasons, even on Sabbath, nay, par- 
ticularly on that day, especially among the young. It is gratify- 
ing to think that smuggling has almost disappeared. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — In consequence of a very large proportion of the 
lands of this parish being in the occupation of proprietors, it is not 
easy to arrive at a correct state of the number and value of its acres. 
But, from repeated surveys and examinations of the parish minis- 
ter, followed up by those of five of his parishioners peculiarly 
well qualified to obtain and to communicate the wished-for infor- 
mation, the following results, although not mathematically exact, 
may be considered as no distant approximation to the truth : — 

The whole of the arable acres may be - - 5240 

Those still in their natural state, but susceptible of improvement, 121 

Those under planting, - - - 213 

Those under buildings, fences, &amp;c. - - 24 

5600 

The kinds of trees generally planted are, larch, Scotch fir, and 
spruce. Those of the oldest standing are round the mansion-house, 
while those recently planted on the trust-estate of Kinross, and on 
the lands of Lethangie, Lathro, Easter Balado, &amp;c. are both hard 
wood and fir. The whole seem well attended to and thriving. 

Rent. — The old valued rent of the parish is L. 4006, 6s. 8d. 
Scotch. The real rent is L. 9175 Sterling: the minimum rent 
per acre is 17s. the maximum L. 5, the average rent L. I, 12s. 
lOfd. The average rent of grazing an ox or cow is from L. 3, 
lOs. to L. 4, and one-third of that for a ewe or full-grown sheep.

Soils. — Extent of surface about 6600 acres : 

Whereof 2000 acres are a deep black alluvial soil incumbent on sand or gravel, the 
substrata of part of which is whin.rock ; 
1000 acres light sandy soil thin incumbent on sand or dry till; 
1400 acres black thin loam, on a cold retentive clay or till ; 
200 acres cold thin clay, subsoil, barren clay mixed with weeping sand ; 
100 acres moss, on a cold weeping sand and clay mixed ; 
700 acres light black moorish soil, on a moorband sterile -subsoil ; 
200 acres uncultivated and under wood, the soil and subsoil of such a tex- 
ture as that of the preceding 700 acres. 

The various cattle-shows which are frequently held here and 
in the adjoining districts, have contributed not a little to the im- 
provement of farm stock. It is humbly suggested, that the great- 
est advantages would follow if prizes, whether as medals or sums of 
money, were distributed, not only to such as rear the best horses, 
bulls, and cows, &amp;c. but to such as, in the judgment of competent 
arbiters, had most distinguished themselves by draining, irrigating, 
embanking, destroying weeds and vermin,— by the condition of their 
enclosures, — by the nature of their management and crops, — by the 
neatness and cleanliness with which they surrounded their dwel- 
lings, and the prder as well as comfort which prevailed within 
them. 

KINROSS. ' B

KINROSS-SIIIRE. 



The general duration of leases is nineteen years. The state 
of farm-buildings, enclosures, &amp;c. has of late undergone a very 
striking change to the better: and the same improvement is observ- 
able in the roads, fences, husbandry, &amp;c. throughout the parish. 
Rents of several properties have, within the last thirty years, been 
more than doubled. An estate in the parish which was sold forty 
years ago for L. 10,000, was purchased last year for L. 35,500. 

Fisheries. — There is but one fishery, that of Loch Leven, which 
commences, if frost permit, on the first of January, and closes on 
the first of September. It was lately let at the yearly rent of L. 204. 
The former rent was L. 230, and this diminution has arisen 
from the partial drainage of Loch Leven being regarded as un- 
favourable to the lake, viewed as a fishing-pond. 

Manufactures. — Kinross was, of old, famous for its cutlery ; but 
now, there is not one individual in the parish employed in that oc- 
cupation. The manufacture, also, of Silesia linens, of which we 
read in the last Statistical Account, has ceased. Instead of these, 
there are ginghams, pullicates, checks, &amp;c. the materials of which 
are sent from Glasgow. But, of late, tartan shawls, plaids, and 
other articles of dress have begun to be wrought by three com- 
panies residing in Kinross, on theii- own account, with every pros- 
pect of a good return, besides a rise of the wages of the operative, 
and an increase of employment to our female population. 

There is, in addition to the two kinds of work mentioned, a ma- 
nufacture of damasks from Dunfermline.

The average wages of an industrious cotton weaver are, per week, 
5s. 6d. ; of a tartan ditto, 14s. The condition of the former is very 
fluctuating. Sometimes their wages are very low ; nor is it at all an 
uncommon occurrence for a greater or less number of them, for days 
and weeks together, to have no webs from Glasgow at all. For the 
removal, or at least the alleviation, of this distressing situation, 
heritors and others, whose circumstances permitted, have occa- 
sionally come forward to purchase materials of industry, or to pro- 
vide out-of-door occupation. 

It is the practice with our weavers, and others of the labouring 
classes, to apply to proprietors and farmers for as much land as 
will be sufficient for planting a certain quantity of potatoes, which 



KINROSS. 



19 



they obtain on condition merely of their giving manure, and hoe- 
ing the drills of the young plants, when necessary. This practice 
deserves to be encouraged, for- to those accustomed to sit for hours 
at the loom, it affords health and relaxation in the open air, be - 
sides supplying, at an expense which none of them feels, an article 
of food most nutritious and valuable. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Town. — The town of Kinross, though not a Royal burgh, has long 
enjoyed a species o{ municipal institution, which has been particu- 
larly useful for certain public purposes ; the principal of which 
are, lighting of the streets, supporting a bell and clock, a fire 
engine, steelyard, &amp;c. Having no public funds, the inhabi- 
tants have long had recourse to an annual voluntary contribution, 
which is placed under the management and control of a preses, 
treasurer, and clerk, who, with eight or sometimes ten members of 
committee, constitute a sort of town-council, so far as the above 
matters go : they are annually chosen at a public meeting, having, 
in the first instance, the trouble of collecting the contributions, of 
which, for the ensuing year, they have the sole charge ; but for 
the management of which they are at all times subject to be called 
to account at a public meeting of the inhabitants. 

This useful institution, designed " The Steeple Committee," 
commenced in 1742, when at a pubhc meeting of the inhabitants, 
the Rev. Robert Stark, minister of the parish, chairman, it was 
agreed, " That, considering it was in contemplation to build anew 
church, a steeple might with great propriety be added thereto." 
This after much care and assiduity was completed in 1751, when 
Sir John Bruce presented the town with a clock. At a meeting 
during the same year, the following appears on the record : " that 
the bell shall be rung at five in the morning ; eight and ten at 
night ; and on Sundays, at eight, nine, and ten in the forenoon, 
and that the last bell for divine service shall continue ringing a 
quarter of an hour." — 17th July 1758. " The principal Lord of 
the CAa/Jwera" compeared, and gave half a crown for carrying on 
the finishing of the steeple," which seems to have been the addi- 
tion of a vane or weathercock. In 1793 the streets were first 
lighted by lamps. At present 1839 the number of lamps is 
about 42 ; all lighted with gas. 

The annual collections vary from L. 20 to L. 25, which, with 
an annual donation of L. 5 from the road trustees, constitute the 
only funds for the purposes above referred to.

KINHOSS-SHIllK. 



In connection with the town, it may be noticed that tlie Curhng 
Club of Kini'oss is of very ancient date. In 1818, a committee of 
this club reported, that they had ascertained beyond a doubt that 
" curling" had been practised, and the adjuncts, of a " court," 
regular mysteries and ceremonies, preserved entire, for at least 150 
years previous to that period. 

Kinross, which is the only town in the parish, had once a weekly 
market on Tuesday ; but now it seems to be transferred to Milna- 
thort, in the parish of Orwell, which is not two miles distant, and 
holds every Wednesday. It is a post-town, where letters from the 
south arrive every evening about 9, and every morning at the same 
hour : and from the north at 2 a. m. and 4 p. m. 

For the gratuitous delivery of letters, for a branch of the British 
Linen Bank, and for other conveniences and advantages, Kinross 
stands indebted to the active and kind interference of Sir James 
Montgomery. 

Turnpike Roads.- — These, and particularly the great north road, 
are in excellent order. They extend to sixteen miles. 

Public carriages running in the parish are three in number; one 
of them is the Royal Mail from Edinburgh to Aberdeen ; another 
is the Defiance stage-coach, which has been employed for some 
months past as a conveyer of letters from Edinburgh to the north ; 
the third coach is the Saxe Cobourg from Edinburgh for Perth. 
Ere a second mail or a substitute for one was started, which was 
only some months ago, the old one passing in the Sabbath morn- 
ing betwixt two and three, and in the evening betwixt seven and 
eight, gave little annoyance to the serious part of our community. 
But the neAv mail, in its journeyings north and south, is viewed and 
felt in a very different light. The Presbytery of Dunfermline, to 
which Kinross parish belongs, has attempted, along with that of 
Edinburgh and others, but hitherto without success, to remove this 
Sabbath desecration. The consequence of no stop being put to 
the running on the Lord's day has been melancholy. At first, the 
new mail coach was, on Sabbath, generally empty. Now, there 
is little, if any, difference in the number of its passengers on Sab- 
bath, and the number on any other day. 

The bridges which connect Kinross parish with the parishes of 
Orwell, Cleish, and Fossaway, together with those within itself, 
of any considerable size, are 13 in number, all of stone, chiefly 
white freestone, and in good condition. The fences are chiefly 
of dry stone, something like the old Galloway dikes. There are 



KINROSS. 



21 



also, throughout the parish, quickset thorn hedges, sometimes in- 
terspersed with beeches. These, when Dlanted in a good soil, and 
duly attended to, become a complete protection to the fields they 
enclose, and an ornament to the country. But, from the poverty 
and shallowness of the land in which young plants are often set, 
and still more from leaving them almost entirely to themselves 
and driving stakes through the heart of them, and neither preserv- 
ing them from the inroads of cattle, nor being at any pains to fill 
up gaps, — they become worse than useless, and an eye-sore. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Of the parish church, as one of the new- 
buildings of Kinross, some mention has already been made. It 
may be added, that it is not four miles distant from the extremity 
of the parish. It is in the Gothic style. Its architect, Mr George 
Angus, built subsequently, and much after the same design, the 
churches of TuUiallan and Kettle. 

Connected with this new church, the only benefaction was from 
an individual, who mentions it entirely from the wish and hope 
that it may contribute to a great public good, and lead others, as 
it has already done in one instance, to follow his example. The 
example which is now referred to, is a donation of L. 100 to make 
sure that this new church should be built. There was also sub- 
scribed by the same person, as much more for pews to himself, and 
to others who might require them, and from whom he has never 
once applied for seat rents or any thing in the shape of such ; al- 
though, it must be added, that some who are most accustomed 
to earn their daily bread with the sweat of their brow, are the most 
unwilling to permit themselves to lie under what they regard a pe- 
cuniary obligation. 

On the 11th of March 1832, the new church was opened for 
public worship; and it is worthy of notice, that, within a year there- 
after, nearly 200 names were added to the minister's visitation 
roll ; and that since the above day, there has not been a single Sab- 

 The bell was got from London after the building of the new church, and vvas 
substituted for the bell which belonged to the old church, and which was permitted to 
remain in the old steeple once connected with the old church, but now standing by it- 
self in the centre of the town. A still older bell of the same church, and which was 
rendered useless on some days of public rejoicing had this legend : 
" VocoaA verbum, verbum ad Chrislum. 

How much in sense and in sound does the legend of our tower bell suffer in com- 
parison, 

Invito ad verbum, verbum ad Christum " 
And to whom, acquainted with the writings of Po]e, does it not suggest the well- 
known lines : 

" To ease thccusliion and soft Dean invite, 
Who never mentions Hell to cars polite "

bath without public worship in the new building. It is still in 
good repair. 

The old manse, inhabited by the Rev. Robert Stark, who was 
ordained minister here more than one hundred years ago, still exists 
near the inlet of the loch, at the south of the town, into which it 
is said the boat was rowed which carried Mary, from the island. 
The new manse was built in 1784, after the admission to the 
charge of this parish, of the last incumbent, the Rev. Archibald 
Smith. In 1812, and subsequently, additions and improvements 
have been rnade to it, both by heritors and the present minister. 
L. 600 have not sufficed for the outlay of the latter on the house, 
the offices, and the grounds around them. 

The glebe, at the admission of the present incumbent, consisted 
of about six acres, including the stance of manse and garden. 
After a process at law commenced by him in 1811, and not 6nal- 
ly concluded until 1825, he ultimately succeeded in establishing 
his claim to grass for a horse and two cows. About five acres, in 
the near vicinity of the manse, have been added to his former 
glebe, all of good quality, and worth more than L. 40 per annum. 

Stipend. — The stipend of the parish consists of the following 
items, viz. : barley, 31 bolls, 6 pecks ; oatmeal, 94 bolls, | peck ; 
money, L. 94, 6s. 7j'gd. ; amounting, communibus annis, accord- 
ing to the Third Report of the Commissioners for Religious Instruc- 
tion, to L. 184, 16s. 4d. 

The first and last augmentation obtained during the present in- 
cumbency, was on the 8th of December 1806; and the present 
incumbent has not made another effort to add to the comparatively 
inferior stipend he possesses, although, according to the above- 
mentioned Report of the Commissioners for Religous Instruction, 
there are in this parish unappropriated teinds to the amount of 
L. 116, 16s. 9d. 

Dissenting and Seceding Chapels. — There are two places of wor- 
ship in this parish pertaining to the United Secession Churchy for- 
merly the Bu7'gher and Aniiburgker communions. Their minis- 
ters are paid by seat rents. The amount of the stipend of the one 
minister is L. 120, and of the other L. 80, besides a house and gar- 
den. 

The number of persons of all ages belonging to the Establish- 
ed Church is 1240. Seceding and Dissenting ministers having 
no parochial territory, the range of their spiritual labours is uncir- 
cumscribed, and accordingly their Sabbath and week day-ministra- 



KINROSS. 



23 



tions extend to individuals within every parish of this county and 
even beyond it. 

The average amount of the ordinary collections in the parish 
church is about L.36 a-year. 

During 183S, collections were made for the four schemes of the 
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in addition to one 
for the Auchterarder case, when more than L, 18 was collected 
or subscribed. There are also different other collections for local 
purposes, on which occasions there is, on the part of the congre- 
gation in general, no want of liberahty. The amount of the sums 
thus received, and which are independent of the weekly collections 
for the poor, was L. 61, 16s. 8d. for 1838. 

Societies for Religious Purposes. — In 1812, a Religious Society 
was instituted under the designation of the Fife and Kinross-shire 
Bible Society. Soon after its institution, the union of counties was 
found to be attended with inconveniences. Accordingly, a Kinross- 
shire Bible Society was formed, which had its yearly and penny 
a-week subscribers, its quarterly committee and its annual general 
meetings, the last alternately at Kinross and Milnathort. The Apo- 
cryphal controversy led to the sending of that part of its funds which 
remained, after certain distributions agreed upon by its members, to 
the Edinburgh Bible Society. Peace and charity, and active co-ope- 
ration were the distinguishing features of this association. But of late, 
different communions of Christians, with those who take the deep- 
est interest in their public proceedings, have such different, and 
alas  often such conflicting views and measures which they consi- 
der of paramount importance, that it is not to be wondered there 
should be a striking diminution of the members and funds of the 
Society. 

There are in Kinross parish three Religious Tract Societies con- 
nected with the three congregations, and in which pious and be- 
nevolent ladies take a most efficient part, employing their stated 
visitings for the distribution of these tracts, as occasions for ac- 
quainting themselves with the bodily as well as the spiritual wants 
and distresses of the individuals whom they call on. 

Ladies' Society. — There is a Society of considerable standing 
here, and which is not undeserving of being classed in the number 
of Religious Societies. This is the Ladies' or Female Society. 
The members of it meet together monthly, when they distribute 
a certain quantity of oatmeal to each of those destitute women, 
whom they shall determine upon as the most suitable objects of re- 



24 



KINHOSS-SHIRE. 



lief. Their funds arise from a small subscription from each member 
of 5s. on her entrance ; and of a penny a-week or 4s. 4d. a year ; 
from occasional public collections ; from the donations of indivi- 
duals, &amp;c. No small addition was made, two years ago, by the 
proceeds of a musical festival in Kinross mansion-house. 

The two congregations of the United Secession Church con- 
tribute to the sending out a missionary to Jamaica, and maintain- 
ing him while there. 

There are three prayer-meetings here, one connected with the 
parish church congregation, and the other two with those of the 
United Secession. 

Temperance and Abstinence Societies. — One Society, the laws of 
which bound its members to refrain from all ardent spirits, ex- 
cepting when medicinally required, was formed some years ago, 
and for a little while was highly popular; but dissension springing 
up, a split took place, and it became extinct. Within the present 
year, 1839, another Society has been constituted, called a Tee- 
total, the object of which is to put an end to the use as well as 
abuse, not only of ardent spirits, but of malt liquor, and whatever 
contains in it any portion of alcohol. It is, at present, in high re- 
pute, already numbering among the subscribers to its obligations, 
of men, women, boys, and girls, more than 430 names. 

Education. — Of public schools, exclusive of the labours of in- 
structors in one or two families belonging to the country part of 
the parish, there are, parochial and endowed, 1 ; not parochial, 
and unendowed, 7 ; taught by females, 4. The branches of in- 
struction in these schools are such as we expect and are accus- 
tomed to meet with in similar situations. Latin, the first elements 
of Greek, geography, the use of the terrestrial globe, are con- 
fined to the parish school. The salary of the master of this school 
is L. 34, 4s. 4d. The amount of his fees annually is about L. 55. 
The payment of the greater proportion of pupils is weekly. 

There are not above 12 from six to fifteen years of age who can 
neither write nor read. To the benefits of education the people 
at large are not insensible. If there be any exception, it is with 
the very ignorant, and still more with the dissipated and depraved. 
No part of the parish is so distant as to prevent school attendance 
at Kinross, on the part of such, at least, as are above seven or eight 
years of age. At the examination of schools this spring, by the 
presbytery, more than one-seventh of the whole population were 
found to be in attendance. 



KINROSS.

The facilities of education are such, that there is not a single 
individual in the parish whom destitute circumstances prevent from 
obtaining access to the parish school, and all the common branches 
of instruction. The late Mr James Beveridge of Middle Balado 
left a small legacy for this purpose. The kirk-session and heri- 
tors are very attentive to the case of poor children who require to 
be sent to school ; and the schoolmaster himself is very liberal of 
his gratuitous services. 

Libraries. — There are two public subscription libraries here. 
The first is more general, and under the management of a com- 
mittee, of which the three clergymen are members, along with 
others. The second is the Tradesmen's Library, chiefly for artisans 
and operatives. 

There are, besides, three juvenile libraries, or rather small se- 
lections of books, chiefly of such as are suited to the years and 
capacities of the scholars of the Sabbath classes, and almost all 
of a strictly religious character. These are purchased by public 
collections at the church doors, or by individual bounty. 

A public reading-room is in contemplation. It is proposed to 
place it in a vacant space in the centrie of the town, and to set 
about building it immediately. 

Friendly Societies. — These, four in number, are, according to 
the dates of their institution, as follows : — 1. The Weavers', insti- 
tuted 25th November 1756; 2. The Hammermen, 15th June 
J 783; 3. The Friendly, 2d September 1799; 4. The Brotherly, 
4th January 1819. 

Savings Bank. — In May 1815, such a provident institution was 
established at Kinross, under the designation of Kinross-shire Bank 
for Savings, and although at its commencement it had to encounter 
suspicion and misapprehension on the part of many, for whose bene- 
fit it was intended, all such prejudices were so completely surmount- 
ed, that nearly L. 3000 of deposits, not exceeding L. 4 each, were 
realized. To its extensive and increasing usefulness, the writer of 
this article can bear his clear and decided testimony, having been 
actuary from its beginning till its dissolution on the 1st of January 
1833, a period of nearly eighteen years. Into the particulars that 
led to an event equally unfortunate and unexpected, it would be 
altogether improper to enter. Sufiice it to say, that its directors 
and other office-bearers, who gave their time and trouble gratui- 
tously, and the members who along with them contributed to an 
auxiliary fund of upwards of L. 100, were the only individuals 



20 



KINROSS-SHIUE. 



connected with it, subjected to any pecuniary loss. Tlie deposi- 
tors received every farthing they had lodged in the bank, and that, 
too, with bank interest. 

Notwithstanding the fate of the Savings Bank, and the trouble 
which it occasioned to its managers, a new one has of late been set 
afoot, and promises to do well. A new provident institution has 
been in operation since May 1837. It transacts with the branch 
of the British Linen at Kinross, receiving three instead of two per 
cent-, the common bank interest, and handing over deposits to the 
British Linen, or to their owners, as soon as they amount to L. 5. 
There is in this, as in the former savings establishment, an auxiliary 
fund. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
who at present receive parochial aid under the joint management of 
the heritors and kirk-session is 36 ; add for occasional paupers 4 ; 
total 40. The average sum allotted to each per week is from Is. 
to Is. 6d. The church collections in the support of the poor are 
from L. 30 to L. 36. 

These collections, together with mortcloth dues, which dues of 
late have been much diminished, are not sufficient to prevent an 
assessment, which it is no wonder that heritors should dislike, see- 
ing it falls entirely on them. But such a mode of provision ought 
to be an object of aversion to every friend of the best interests of 
the poor and the parish at large. It is most earnestly to be wish- 
ed, that what is terned the Voluntary principle, and which many, 
besides Churchmen, think has nolhing to recommend it in religion, 
should have the fullest scope, and be more than ever acted on, in 
the maintenance and management of the poor. 

A very common and commendable mode of occasional relief, in 
cases of want and distress, unforeseen and urgent, is for two or more 
respectable individuals to go about with a subscription paper, in 
which they insert the names of subscribers, and the sums which ■ 
have been subscribed and paid. 

There are here neither alms nor poor-houses, and long may it 
be so ; but there is a sum of L. 100 Scots L. 8, 6s. 8d. Sterling, 
distributed annually by the kirk-session among 17 females selected 
by them, and whose chief recommendations are age, destitution, 
and bodily infirmity. Each receives 10s. with the exception of 
the last chosen, who gets only 6s. 8d. These females are said 
to be on the hospital list, because the distribution made to them 
is in lieu of an- hospital, which Sir William Bruce intended to 



KINliOSS. 



27 



build on the side of the road to the old church-yard. Of this in- 
tended building, which was never executed, a particular account 
will be found in the Acts of the Scottish Parliament in the reign 
of James VII. under the title Sir William Bruce. 

It may be noticed farther, that a sum of L. 100 was mortified 
to the poor of the parish by the deceased George Graham, Esq. 
of Kinross. This sum has been lent to the heritors of the parish, 
and the interest of it, L. 5, is distributed by the minister of the 
parish, at the sight of the proprietor of the estate of Kinross. 

Prison. — There is one jail in Kinross parish, in which, during 
the last year, there were 3 civil and 36 criminal prisoners. This 
jail, although newly built, is not so secure as to prevent, from 
time to time, the escape of the worst of its inmates. Those con- 
fined are allowed two hours of open air abroad every day. No pro- 
vision is made for ministerial visitation or religious instruction to 
prisoners ; but free access is always to be had for both purposes. 

Police. — There is also a police at Kinross. The officer, whose 
salary is 14s. per week, is maintained by a voluntary assessment on 
the part of the landed proprietors. His duty is to check and pre- 
vent all disturbances of the public peace, and all attacks on the per- 
sons or properties of the lieges ; also to seize upon and to send off 
from the parish the host of vagrants and sturdy beggars from all 
quarters, who were once a far greater nuisance than now. 

Fairs. — There are four yearly fairs or markets ; the first on the 
third Wednesday of March, old style ; the second on the first day 
of June, old style ; the third on the third Wednesday of July, old 
style ; and the fourth on-St Luke's day, or the 18th of October, old 
style. These fairs are chiefly for cattle ; but they serve likewise for 
various other purposes of human intercourse and transacting toge- 
ther. 

There can be no doubt that these public occasions are, in a pe- 
cuniary view, very advantageous to Kinross. 

Inns, Alehouses, c. — There are two principal inns here, which, 
in respect of the accommodation and comfort afforded by them to 
the traveller, will yield to none from Edinburgh to Inverness. The 
inn to the south Kirkland's keeps o post-chaises, 1 landau, 1 
hearse, 34 post-horses, 4 post-boys, 6 strappers, 1 hostler, 1 head 
waiter, 1 under waiter, 4 female servants, one of whom is a cook. 
That to the north Kinross Green Inn, or Macgregor's, has 3 
post chaises, a drosky and gig, 5 horses, and a donkey ; 7 sta- 
bles; 4 post-boys, 7 strappers, I hostler, 1 head waiter, 1 under 



28 



■KINU0SS-SII11U5. 



ditto, 3 female servants. An inferior, but respectable inn, called 
the Salutation, near the middle of the town, has 3 horses and 2 
gigs. There are 12 other public-houses, without any carriage or 
horse, and of which 2 only have stables. Besides the beer and spi- 
rits sold in these places of public entertainment, a great deal is sold 
and drunk in back rooms of spirit shops and elsewhere. 

Fuel. — This article, of prime necessity, is here cheap and good. 
Coal is brought from Kelty, at the distance of five miles from Kin- 
ross, and from Lumphinnan, Lochgelly, where it is thought supe- 
rior, at the distance of eight miles. The coal called great is, at 
Kelty, at the rate of Sd. the cwt.. Is. 2d. 4 cwt., 4s. 8d. 16 cwt. 
or 4 loads, which is the usual draught of a single cart, although at 
some coal hills Lumphinnan not less than 18 cwt. are given for 4 
loads. The toll exigible for a single cart is 9d. ; the carriage from 
Kelty paid to a carter is 2s. 6d. ; ditto from Lochgelly, 3s. Small 
coal or chews, as they are called, are Is. 2d. per cart-load cheaper 
than great coal. Peat is got in the parishes of Portmoak and 
Cleish, but is not used except for some special purposes. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The division which, at one time, so much prevailed of land into 
what was termed infield and outfield, the former only being in a 
state of regular cultivation, and called mucked or dunged land, the 
latter being in a state of nature or just breaking up, under no rota- 
tion, has disappeared ; and where there is no insuperable obstacle, 
every spot is brought under the plough, or will be so immediately. 

The value of manure is now completely appreciated. With the 
exception of ashes, it finds a ready market at 5s. a ton. 

At the period of the former Statistical Account, there was no 
banking establishment in Kinross; now, it has aU this accommodation 
from a branch of the British Linen, where business is conducted 
with an attention, correctness, courtesy, and liberality, worthy of 
that highly respectable house. 

Gas Establishment. — On the 23d of March 1835, a company 
was formed here, called the Gas Light Company of Kinross and 
Milnathort. The number of its shares is 500, and they are held by 
134 individuals. Each share is L. 5, and the capital of the Com- 
pany amounts to L. 2500. The gas works have been set down 

 " Little or no wheat," says the writer of the former Statistical Account, in its 
very last sentence, " was raised till of late, but it is now sown in different parts of the 
parish." It may now April 1839 le as correctly said, that wheat is not sown here 
to the same extent as it was twenty years ago. The farmer finds it more advantageous 
to sow barley ; the thinness of the soil in general and our severe springs render wheat 
both a very precarious, and an exhausting crop.

about a mile to the north of the centre of Kinross, at an equal dis- 
tance from it and Mihiathort, serving as a reservoir to each, both 
for houses and shops. The streets of Kinross and its immediate 
vicinity are hghted with gas by pubhc voluntary subscription. 

The profits of the Gas Company must very much depend on the 
price of coals, and still more on the prosperous state of trade at 
Kinross and Milnathort. The dividend to shareholders has not yet 
exceeded 2 per cent., but is expected soon to be much higher. The 
charge for 1000 cubic feet of gas is about lis. The coal for the 
work is got at Capeldrae, about seven miles south-east from Kinross, 
and is of the kind called parrot or cannel, and is sold at about 14s. per 
•ton at the pit, and costs about L.l when laid down at the gas-works. 

The parish of Kinross, as stated in the title of this Account, is with- 
in the bounds of the presbytery of Dunfermline ; and from the town 
of Dunfermline, by the best carriage road, it is nearly fifteen miles 
distant. Much convenience and many advantages, both of a tempo- 
ral and spiritual kind, would arise to the minister and parish of Kin- 
ross, as well as to several ministers and parishes around, were Kin- 
ross made the seat of a new presbytery, comprehending within its ju- 
risdiction the parishes of Arngask, Orwell, Muckhart, Fossaway, 
and Tullibole, Cleish, Beath, Ballingry, Portmoak, and Strathmi- 
glo. Such a new arrangement has not only been seriously thought 
of, but has been submitted to the consideration of all the ministers 
of the parishes above-mentioned, and to two of their respective pres- 
byteries. Objections not anticipated, and some of them of a pri- 
vate and personal, and therefore not of a permanent nature, have 
hitherto opposed themselves to an object for many reasons most de- 
sirable. The presbytery of Dunferrpline, in order to lessen the in- 
conveniences and other evils of their Kinross-shire members being 
so far removed from their presbytery seat, came to a resolution, 
inserted in their minutes, of having two meetings at Kinross every 
year. This is so far well, but it is not a sufficient remedy for what 
the northern brethren complain of. This remedy the present in- 
cumbent of the parish of Kinross may never experience, but another 
will, when the views and feelings of individuals shall no longer be 
unfriendly, or allowed by the General Assembly to be so, to a hew 
arrangement of public and general advantage.

PRESBYTERY OF KIEKALDY, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. HUGH LAIRD, D. D. MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish has been usually derived from 
a St Moak, to whom a priory erected at the side of Lochleven is 
said to have been dedicated, — the prefix Port referring to the 
landing-place from the priory on the island of Servanus, part of the 
ruins of which still remain. This derivation, however, is liable to 
objection. When the Presbytery met in 1659 to condemn the old 
church which stood on the site of the priory at the side of the lake, 
the name of the parish in the record of that court is Servanus. If 
that was its usual name, then it is not easv to see how recourse 
would be had for another to the Roman calendar, so long after 
Popery was abolished. In the oldest manuscripts which the writer 
has seen, it is called Portmag, Portmog, or Portmoag, and old 
people and many strangers spell it so to this day. 

Extent, c. — From the south-west to the north-east, and from the 
north-west to the south-east, are about 9 miles, and from south to 
north and from east to west, about 5. The figure of the parish is 
very irregular. One corner runs about a mile to the south-east into 
the parish of Auchterderran, and one farm of about 140 acres is se- 
parated from the rest of the parish, and embosomed in that of King- 
lassie, — which arose from the annexation of the intermediate lands 
to the parish of Kinglassie, by presbyterial commissioners in 1650. 
It runs more than half round the lake, and rises gradually from 
it on one side to the Bishop's hill, distant rather more than a mile, 
and on the other to Benartie, at scarcely half the distance. The 
highest top of the former is about 1030 feet above the level of 
the sea, and the latter seems nearly as high. Both rise gradual- 
ly from the east very like a wave in a narrow channel, till they 
reach almost to the west end of the parish, where they terminate pre- 
cipitously. About the' middle of the parish, both hills begin to 
flatten to the eastward, and the arable land to extend in width. 



PORTMOAK. 31 

The west division is a sharp sandy soil ; the eastern, rather strong 
clay or heavy loam. 

Hydrography.— 0\o\ie to where the Bishop's hill winds to- 
wards the north, there are several exuberant springs. Within about 
400 yards, are three, of excellent water, which by the aid of a mo- 
derate fall would drive a mill. The eastmost one surprises strang- 
ers. It is said that Oliver Cromwell called them fontes Scotiai, and 
the adjoining village is called Scotland-well. Lochleven is about 
thirteen miles in circumference. The part of it which is in this 
parish is said to cover 1730 acres of land, and contains the island 
of St Servanus, which extends, since the draining of the lake, to 
about 70 acres. Till within these twenty-five years, there were 
no plantations in the vicinity of the loch, except on the south and 
west. Since that time, above 300 acres have been planted. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— In the low grounds, there is not 
much rock of any kind. The north side of Benartie is whin-rock ; 
and as the land rises to the Bishop's hill on the opposite side, free- 
stone is found, very soft, and, in general, unfit for use. But, on 
the top of the hill there is a great variety of stone, some very hard 
and some fit for hewing and building. The difficulty of bringing 
stones down renders them expensive. The fissures in all these 
rocks are from south to north, and west to east, at a great variety 
of distances. There is also some workable whin-rock, and an in- 
exhaustible lime rock. The seam at present worked is from 
eight to twenty feet thick, and backed at the distance of from four 
to ten feet. Its dip is to the north-east. Above it, is one foot of 
moss, and in some places fourteen feet of culm and red earth ; and 
below, a bed of whin so hard that irons have not been found suffi- 
cient to bore it. In the fissures, which vary in size, are found a 
great variety of petrifactions, and a substance resembling ice, which 
the quarriers were accustomed to throw away, but latterly have 
burnt, finding it to be the purest lime. When wet, it assumes the 
consistence of butter, and whitens nearly as well as English whit- 
ing. About 4000 tons of limestone are annually sold at Is. 8d. per 
ton. And were it not for the high price, the demand would be 
much greater. But the expense of preparing it is so great, that 
there is little hope of the price being reduced.

This is not taking into account either risk of bad payments, or 
loss of time for men and horses in winter. The only way of being 
able to sell at a lower rate would be to use machinery for bringing 
down the stones from the top to the kiln at the foot of the hill ; 
but this would require both capital and enterprise. The thing is 
possible, but is a speculation that cannot be expected to be under- 
taken soon. Every thing is conducted with the greatest economy. 
The tirring is let by the yard, and the quarrying by the ton. The 
lime is burnt by persons who live by it, or by small farmers who 
take a little land to enable them to keep horses more easily than 
otherwise they could do. There is hardly an instance of a person 
who lives by farming burning lime for sale ; and yet it seldom bap- 
pens that in this trade much money is earned. It seems to be 
only strong working people who gain by it, through an application 
of more time and strength than can be long continued. 

The soils are various in different parts of the parish. To the 
westward, it is in general sharp sand, and to the east strong clay or 
heavy loam. About the middle of the parish, and near the north 
bank of the lake, is a moss of about 80 acres, of great depth, and 
covered with heath. Besides this, there is about 150 acres, out 
of which peats have been taken ; but which are not cultivated. 

Zoology. — There are no very rare species of animal at present 
in this parish. A few years ago, the horns of a stag were found 
imbedded in water-run sand, of a very extraordinary size. The 
author saw lately the fragments of them. They had fallen to 
pieces from exposure to the air, so that the length could not be 
ascertained ; but at the root, they are thicker than those of the 
largest Aberdeenshire ox. The cattle reared are chiefly of the 
Fife breed, or that crossed by the Ayrshire, and short-horned spe- 
cies. The sheep breed are chiefly Leicester; but some of the far- 
mers purchase black-faced ones or Cheviots from the Highlands or 
the south to feed on turnips. A great variety of hogs are reared 
and kept. There are not many families among the labouring po- 
pulation that have not one. Farm horses are generally good at all 
prices from L. 20 to L. 35. Small feuars and carters have some-

times animals of less value. There are no forests in the parish, 
and till lately there were very few plantations. Within the last 
twenty years, about 300 acres have been planted, chiefly Scotch 
and larch fir. In some cases, there is a mixture of hard-wood. The 
soil would bear any trees except those which are partial to cold clay. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Marquis of 
Northampton, and Thomas Bruce, Esq. late of the Customs. The 
rest are chiefly feuars of from a-half acre to land worth L. 400 per 
annum. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial register commences in 
1703. The records previous to that time are said to have been 
accidentally burnt. In so far as the aff'airs of the poor, and the 
record of proclamations are concerned, they have been regularly 
kept ; but the register of baptisms is very incorrect, as Dissenters 
have in general been very remiss in getting the names of their 
children entered, and till very lately there was no register of 
funerals. 

Antiquities, Sj'C. — There are no antiquities in the parish known 
to the writer, except the ruins of a priory on the island of Servanus, 
and of a chapel at Scotland-well. A short time ago, the metal 
heads of some spears and a shield were found in the cut for drain- 
ing the lake. They were sent as curiosities to London. 

III. — Population. 

The number of people in the parish, according to Dr Webster's return, was 996 
In 1783, it was 1040 
1791, - 1105 
At present 1839 it is 1608

During the last three years there were 6 illegitimate births in 
the parish. 

No person of independent fortune resides in the parish. There 
are '29 land-owners whose properties exceed the value of L. 50 per 
annum. There is nothing remarkable in the strength, size, or 
complexion of the people ; 3 persons are deranged ; 2 fatuous ; 2 
blind ; and 2 dumb. , 

The people have improved greatly in cleanliness within the last 
thirty years. In some cases, there is still room for improvement, 
but there is none of that filth so often to be met with in large

towns. When they appear at church or market, they are gene- 
rally well dressed. Their ordinary food is the produce of the 
country, with the addition of tea and coffee, which are in general 
use. There are very few, if any, who have not butcher-meat occa- 
sionally, and there are few places where the labouring classes live 
so comfortably. Any person may have, for a trifle, as much land 
for potatoes as he can manure, and every thing done to it, except 
hoeing and digging the crop. In this way, an industrious family 
may, for JOs. or I2s., have as many potatoes as they can use, and 
perhaps feed a pig. If their turbulent neighbours would not in- 
terfere with them, and lead them to believe that this and the other 
change will improve their condition, they would give very little 
trouble. Among them arc a considerable number of very intelli- 
gent men, to whom it would not be easy to find equals in their 
station. They are a reading population, and, with a few excep- 
tions, temperate, and, circumspect. There is perhaps no smug- 
gling ; but owing to the want of resident gentlemen to protect 
game, poaching is carried to a shameful and demoralizing height. 
And if means be not adopted soon to put a stop to it, very injurious 
effects will follow, both to the rising generation and to property. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish contains about 6566 acres of land 
that have been cultivated, and 3313 that have never been culti- 
vated, including 1700 covered by that part of the lake which is 
in this parish. Of this very little could be ploughed with any ad- 
vantage, except what may be made dry by the partial draining of 
the lake. There is no general common, and even most of 
that which belongs exclusively to separate townships is in the 
progress of being divided. About 350 acres are under wood, all 
planted. 

Rent— The rent of arable land is extremely various, being, ac- 
cording to the quality of the soil, from 15s. to L.3 per acre. The 
probable average may be about L. 1, 10s. The rate of grazing, 
equally diversified, from L. 1 to L.4for a milk cow. The average 
may be about L.2, 10s. 

The common breed of sheep is Leicester and Cheviot, and 
much attention is paid to their improvement 

The land, in general, is well cultivated and drained. A great 
part of the parish is in the possession of the proprietors. That 
which is let is generally under Jeases of from seven to nineteen 
years. The farm-buildings are generally good, and the greater

part of the lands inclosed chiefly with dry stone-dikes, which are 
preferred to hedges, as the latter are long in coming to maturity, 
and decay before they are very old. 

Husbandry. — The principal improvement in farming, of late 
years, has been in pasturing to a greater extent, and bringing into 
cultivation above 500 acres of meadow and moss that were formerly 
of little value. The chief obstacle in the way of farming has been 
the practice of small proprietors working along with their servants. 
As they do not feel themselves called upon to work hard, their ser- 
vants imitate their example. Of course, farming is carried on at 
much greater expense than is requisite. This, however, is gradu- 
ally wearing out. There are 89 ploughs in the parish, and all on 
the model brought from East Lothian. The author never saw 
the long Scotch plough in this parish nor one drawn by oxen, ex- 
cept in one solitary instance, when it was employed to tear up 
some very coarse land. There are 189 farm-horses, which, with 
very few exceptions, will bear comparison with those of the Lo- 
thians; 13 riding-horses, 6 poneys, 12 chiefly for carting, 95 young 
horses, 230 milch cows kept by farmers, 40 by servants and trades- 
people, 347 calves reared, 1 160 young cattle, and many thousands 
of sheep. 

Quarries. — Though there be very good freestone in the parish 
there is at present no regular quarry. Lime is the only quarry that 
is regularly worked, and there is nothing remarkable in the way in 
which it is conducted. 



Amount of Produce. —

Manufactures. — There are no manufactures in the parish ex- 
cept one of parchment, which has for a very long period maintained 
its ground. There was a tannery of considerable extent, and also a 
thread manufactory; but they have been discontinued for some 
years. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Fairs, Sc. — Each of the two largest villages has nominally a fair, 
but one of them hardly deserves the name, as scarcely any cattle

or purchasers attend it. The nearest post-town is Kinross, which 
has no regular market. One of the villages contains 501 inhabi- 
tants, and the other, now 315. Besides these, there are three 
smaller villages. 

Means of Communication. — Turnpike-roads intersect the parish 
in two different directions, and the public roads arte in general good; 
but no public carriages travel on them. Bridges and fences are, 
for the most part, in good order. Two excellent bridges have been 
lately thrown over the Leven. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is as near the centre 
of the parish as the locality will permit. It is distant about seven 
miles from one corner, which is very thinly inhabited, and about half 
that distance from the other extremities. The old church was built 
in 1661, and has been rebuilt several years ago. It had become 
too small for th« population, and was supposed dangerous. The 
heritors, with a liberality that does them credit, have now built a 
plain substantial church, to accommodate about a third more than 
the former. It is seated for 730. The only benefaction on record 
is one of L. 100 to the poor born in the parish. The manse is a 
handsome and commodious dwelling, and by much the best house 
in the parish. The glebe contains above 18 imperial acres, but only 
about three of good land. The rest is either moss or unproductive 
land. The stipend is 16 chalders, half oatmeal and half barley. 
Till lately, there were two Dissenting meetings in the parish ; the 
one of Dissenters from the Cameronians, the other of the Secession 
church ; but the Cameronian minister having died, the congrega- 
tion was too small to call another, and most of the people have 
come to the Established Church. The stipend of the Seceding 
minister is L. 100, which is raised from the seat rents and the col- 
lections at the door. To this is added a dwelling-house. The 
number of families in the parish attending the Established Church 
is 219 : of Tamilies Dissenting or Seceding, 127. The collections 
in the parish church amount from L. 10 to L. 15 per annum. 

Education. — There are four schools in the parish, but none of 
them endowed except the one established by law. In these are 
taught, English, writing, arithmetic, and sometimes Latin, not, 
however, on the most desirable principles. The salary of the pa- 
rochial schoolmaster is the maximum. His fees amounted last 
year to L. 6. None above six years are known to be unable to read, 
and, in so far as the branches mentioned above are concerned, 



PORTMOAK. 



37 



there is an universal desire to have the young educated. The 
great desideratum is the want of a judicious and active teacher. 

There are two libraries in the parish, one of which is connected 
with the Secession Church. 

Poor. — No person is enrolled as a regular pensioner, so long as 
there is any hope of his ever being able to provide for himself. In- 
cidental distress is provided for by small loans with or without in- 
terest, on the understanding that they are to be repaid again, if it 
can be done ; and frequently they are paid years after, principal and 
interest. Nor is there any stated pension. The object in every 
case is to meet the real exigency, and leave no apology for begging. 
The kirk-session have given sums from 6d. to 5s. 6d. per week, 
according to the necessity of the cases. Besides this, they pay 
house rents, provide coals and articles of clothing, and shoes when 
required. The number of pensioners varies from about 8 to 20. 
To meet this expense, there is a fund of L. 540 in the management 
of the kirk-session, and L. 100 in that of the minister and two prin- 
cipal heritors. There have been no assessments for the poor, but 
the heritors and wealthier inhabitants have sometimes subscribed 
to meet extraordinary cases. Nor does there appear any growing 
indelicacy in the poor. The writer had occasion to examine very 
narrowly into the state of the poor, on account of the approach of 
cholera, and did not meet with a single instance of complaint, the 
justness of which he had reason to suspect. In a population of 157 1, 
the whole claims did not exceed L. 8. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used is coal, and a colliery has been 
lately commenced in the parish, but its practical effect is not yet 
known. There is an inexhaustible peat moss, which in a dry year, 
and with a cheaper mode of digging, might afford cheap fuel, 
though greatly remedied by th draining of the lake.

PRKSBYTERY OF DUNFERMLINE, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. W. W. DUNCAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, &amp;c. — This parish is about 6 miles in length from east 
to west, and about 1 mile in breadth, except at the east end, where 
it is \\ mile from north to south ; it contains about 7 square miles. 
It is bounded by Dunfermline parish on the south ; Beath on the 
south-east; Saline on the south-west; Portmoak and Ballingry on 
the east ; on the north by Kinross and Fossaway. The north-east 
end of the parish is about half a mile from the south side of Loch- 
Leven. 

Topographical Appearances. — The Cleish hills form the highest 
part of that elevated tract of ground which lies between Kinross- 
shire and Dunfermline. Dumglow, the highest of them, is 1215 feet 
above the level of the sea ; it is flat on the top, and conspicuous from 
all the country round. The next highest are three hills called In- 
gans, 1030, 1060, and 1048 feet in height. The arable land is from 
380 to 500 feet above the level of the sea. No account has been 
kept of the temperature or pressure of the atmosphere. In general, 
it is considered a good summer day when the thermometer is from 
55° to 58°, between eight and nine in the morning ; from 65° to 
68° between one and two, and about 60° between nine and ten at 
night. It is not often above 70°. The reporter only saw it twice 
as high as 80°, except in the year 1826. That year it was often 
higher; once at 88°. A moderate frost is from 2° to 8° of Fah- 
renheit below freezing ; it is seldom below 20°, very seldom be- 
low 10°. The prevailing winds are between south and west ; after 
these, the most frequent are from north-east ; these last feel colder 
than the others, even where the thermometer continues at the same 
height. The west winds are strongest, often consisting of violent 
blasts, with intermissions ; the east winds are more uniform and

steady. Rheumatisms and coughs are common here, as in other 
parts of Scotland, owing probably more to the dampness than the 
cold. A good deal more rain falls here than on the shores of 
the Forth, which are about twelve miles distant. 

Hydrography. — This parish is well supplied with excellent 
springs, almost every house having a rivulet running near it. The 
water is of good quality. The heat of most of the springs is 45°, 
of some 42° ; they proceed from the whinstone and freestone rocks. 
There are four lochs in this parish ; they are situated on the 
highest parts of the parish ; the largest. Loch Glow, is about a 
iriile and a half in circumference, the others much smaller. The 
fish in them are perches, pikes, and eels, with a few trouts. 
The river Gairney divides Cleish from Kinross for about two miles 
and a quarter; the water from the lochs falls into it. The fish 
in Gairney are produced by the Loch-Leven trouts, which come up 
the river during the floods in harvest, and return in the beginning 
of winter. About this time, some eels are caught going down from 
the lochs. 

Mirmalogy. — The hills are principally composed of sandstone, 
greywacke, and whinstone. The highest hills consist of the lat- 
ter ; lower down on the north, there is excellent freestone, extend- 
ing from east to west about four miles. There is also some of the 
same kind on the south side of the hills, and in that part of Benar- 
ty hill which is in Cleish parish. The best houses and bridges in 
the county and neighbourhood are built of it. It is porous, bears 
a fine polish, and does not yield to the weather. The whinstones 
in the hills are in columns. On the side of the high road from 
Kinross to Dunfermline, at Craigencat, in Dunfermline parish, 
but annexed, quoad sacra, to Cleish, there are very regular ba- 
salts in perpendicular pillars, with many horizontal divisions. They 
are easily quarried, and make excellent dikes and road metal. Of 
two stones of this kind fallen from the hill called the South Ingan, 
a pair of mill-stones has been made for Cleish mill. They have 
a great resemblance, internally, to the rocks of the Abbey Craig 
of Stirling, from which many flour-mill-stones have been made. 
There is coal on the estate of Blair-Adam, which was formerly 
wrought to a considerable extent ; it is a branch of the Kelty coal. 
As it is near the proprietor's house, it has not been wrought for 
many years. There is also coal in the hill, but the seams are thin, 
and nearly perpendicular, so as not to be worlh working. There 
is very good lime at Scarhill, on the estate of Cleish.

The animals and vegetables here are the same with those in 
other parts of the low country of Scotland. A few roes and foxes 
are now found in the young plantations.

II. — Civil History. 
Land'Oimers. — The chief land-owners are, Rear Admiral Sir 
Charles Adam of Blair- Adam and Barns ; and John Young, 
Esq. of Cleish. There are at present 1 1 heritors in Cleish, all of 
whom except one have land above the yearly value of L. 50. The 
number in 1744 was 24; many of their properties were small, and 
were bought up from time to time by the contiguous heritors. One 
of the principal heritors resides always in the parish, the other oc- 
casionally. 

 Mr Henry Burt bequeathed the estate of Barns to Admiral Adam, who has 
continued enclosing, cultivating, and planting, has rendered the mansion-house 
a most convenient dwelling, and has executed the large and important drainage by 
the straightening and lowering the Gairncy in the manner mentioned : — and to 
which may be added, that, besides making some private roads for the benefit of the es- 
tate, ho has contributed most liberally and usefully to an important public road 
which goes through his property from a place called Red- Moss, upon the great north 
roiid, to Cleish, to Tullybole, and the Crook of Devon.

Antiquiiies. Traces of an ancient fort or camp are to be found 

on the top of Dumglow, the highest hill in the parish. Some 
urns have been found under large stones and cairns, containing 
bones, ashes, and bits of charcoal. 

The oldest buildings in the parish are those of Cleish and Dow- 
hill. The house, usually called the Place of Cleish, is about 85 
feet high, the walls still almost entire. There are several old trees 
round it. The finest of these are two silver firs in the middle of a 
walk of yews, one of them being scarcely equalled in Scotland by 
any tree of that kind. It is 15 feet in circumference at one yard 
from the ground, which girth it maintains in a perfectly upright 
trunk of 22 feet in height, when it shoots out several enormous 
boughs, each of which might form a large tree. One of these is 
about 10 feet in circumference ; it continues in a horizontal position 
for 12 feet, when it changes its direction, and runs directly parallel 
with the main trunk to nearly the same height, that being about 
120 feet. Exactly opposite to this branch three others strike off, 
one above another, in the same manner, and on one of the other 
sides, a single bough, of gigantic dimensions, throws itself in a 
downward direction for 18 feet, when it, like the others, assumes 
the upright position. The effect of the whole is most imposing. 
The House o/ Dowhill has been used as a quarry, and a good part 
of it carried away. These buildings had very thick walls ; the lower 
stories were vaulted, and each of them had a small apartment with- 
in the wall, called by the people the pit, and used, according to 
tradition, not as a prison but as a place of concealment. 

It was in this parish that Michael Bruce, the poet, taught a 
school. The school-house stood in the centre of what is now the 
farm-steading of Gairney Bridge, and it was in a public-house 
which occupied the site of the stables, that the fathers of the Se- 
cession held their first meeting. About a quarter of a mile east 
from the church, in a stone dike opposite Nivingstone House, 
stands a large rock, which deserves notice. It is called The Lec- 
ture Stane, and was used, it seems, before the Reformation at fu- 
nerals, as a support br the coffin at the time that the burial ser- 
vice was read. There is a large hole in it, which was made many 
years ago with the view of bursting it with powder. Thrice this 
was tried, and as many times it failed, — which led to the belief 
that it was charmed, and no similar attempt has since been made. 
At the east end of the parish, the late Lord Chief- Commissioner 
has inserted in a bridge a stone, with an inscription, to mark the

road by which Queen Mary fled from Lochleven Castle. In the 
grounds of Blair- Adam are to be seen " the Keiry Crags," a most 
romantic spot, mentioned in " The Abbot" as the houffoi John 
Auchtermuchty, the carrier. 

III. — Population. 

In 1831 the number of inhabitants was 681, of whom 221 re- 
sided in villages, and 460 in the country. In agricultural parishes 
the numbers do not vary much. An act of Parliament is neces- 
sary to regulate the parish registers, particularly with regard to the 
births- Since the ground was enclosed there are fewer cottars, 
and their houses, instead of being placed irregularly in the fields, 
are built by the sides of the principal roads. There are five per- 
sons in the parish who have been insane ; one of them, a farm- 
servant, was eleven years in that situation, and was supported by 
the parish funds ; he recovered without the use of any remedies, 
and for more than thirteen years has maintained himself. 

Character of the People. — In general the people are of good 
morals, quiet, decent, intelligent, and seem contented with their si- 
tuation. Illegal distillation was attempted some years ago, but 
was soon put down. 

Within the last two years, only 3 illegitimate children have 
been born in the parish, — the parents of one of which married be- 
fore its birth. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — In the west end of the parish, the arable land 
consists of clay ; farther east, very good soil upon whin rock not 
basaltic ; then a considerable tract of gravel and sand, and some 
ground full of large whinstones, very productive when improved. 
The south-east quarter of the parish consists mostly of stiff ground, 
which requires draining. Going south toward the hill, the soil is 
inferior, mixed with clay; above that, lies the freestone, generally 
covered with poor soil, damp, and producing heather ; on the 
highest hills, the grass is of fine quality, and forms excellent sheep 
pasture. There is some moss in the north and east part of the 
parish ; it is of good quality, and forms excellent soil when culti- 
vated. 

The system of farming appears to be as good as the soil and 
climate admit of. The common rotation of crops in the arable land 
is that of four : 1. oats; 2. drilled crops, potatoes, and turnips; 
3. barley, or sometimes oats, or wheat after potatoes ; 4. rye- 
grass, with the different kinds of clover. The first year's crop is 



I 



CLEISH. 43 

generally cut for hay, and the land kept in pasture for a few years. 
Summer fallow is little practised except in clay, or when land is 
first cultivated ; when turnips and potatoes form part of the rota- 
tion, it is unnecessary. A considerable quantity of lime is used. 
Draining, which is the greatest improvement that this country ad- 
mits of, was never carried on with so much spirit as at present. 
The drains are now much better planned and executed than for- 
merly, and, in most places, plenty of stones can be got to fill them. 
A great number of acres has been added to the arable land by the 
main drain, which of late years has been carried along the north 
side of the parish. This will be afterwards more particularly de- 
scribed. There were originally three commons in the parish ; 
the greatest part of them has been improved long ago, and the 
cultivation of the remaining part is still going on. The thirlage 
of the two mills has been settled by arbitration. Some land has 
been trenched, or, in place of the ordinary trenching, the surface 
only has been turned over with the spade or plough, nine or ten 
inches deep, and the under soil opened with the pick to the depth of 
nine or ten inches more, and the stones taken out. The produce of 
some fields that have been drainedand treated in this way, is now dou- 
ble of what it formerly was. Some gentlemen have used ploughs 
of a particular construction for opening the under soil. As these 
ploughs are made to follow the common ploughs in the same fur- 
row, no fewer than six horses are requisite ; therefore, in many 
cases, it would be more convenient to lay the drills and either pick 
the furrows or open them with the under Soil plough ; thus one- 
half of the ground would be improved, and the other half when 
the drills were reversed. Wedge draining has been tried here, 
and has succeeded completely in clay and moss, when properly per- 
formed. Iron ploughs are generally used, and the carts and other 
implements of husbandry are much improved. There are five or 
six thrashing-mills in the parish. Two saw-mills were erected a few 
years ago, and are found to be of great advantage. The saws are 
circular ; one in each of the mills being two feet and a half in dia- 
meter ; they are calculated for sawing wood for roofing and floor- 
ing, as well as for lath, rails, and stakes. Scotch fir, which, when 
young, was considered of little value, answers well for lath. The 
two meal-mills in the parish have been rebuilt, and the machinery 
much improved. The kilns also have been rebuilt, and fitted up 
so as to dry the corn sooner and better, as well as with less fuel.

KINROSS-SHIIIE. 



The price of oatmeal from 1782 to 1791 was at an average, 
14s. 7id. ; from 1823 to 1832, 18s, 41. per boll 140 pounds. 

Wages. — The wages of labourers are about Is. lOd. in summer, 
and Is. 8d. in winter; of wrights, 2s. ; masons, 2s. 6d. to 3s. ; 
slaters, 3s. 6d ; women working in the fields from the planting to 
the taking up of the potatoes, 8d. and 9d. ; in harvest, from Is. 3d. 
to Is. 6d., except when they work by the thrieve, which they find 
most profitable. 

The labour of the women is employed to greatest advantage in the 
management of cows. There are about 150 cows kept in the parish, 
inclusivie of those belonging to the heritors and farmers. A cow's 
grass in summer costs L. 4 or L. 4, 4s. This is generally paid by 
the sale of the butter and the calf. At night the cow gets what 
can be spared from the garden, with grass from the sides offences 
and plantations. For winter, they generally provide some hay, 
and buy before harvest oats or barley, the meal of which goes to 
the support of the family, and the cow gets the straw, together 
with potatoes and turnips, which the farmers give them ground to 
plant in proportion to their dung. Where a cow is kept, there is 
also a pig, and some keep a pig who have not a cow. Every house- 
holder has a garden, a part of which is planted with potatoes. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle are generally of the Fife breed. A great 
deal of pains has been taken to improve them, especially since the 
establishment of the Kinross Farming Society. The sheep kept on 
the hill are black-faced, those on the low grounds of some of the 
English breeds. A considerable part of the arable ground of the 
parish is in pasture, and let for one year : it is partly stocked with 
young beasts, but principally with full-grown cattle, which are col- 
lected in the country by the graziers, and sold at the Falkirk 
September and October markets, or the Edinburgh Hallow fair. 

The leases are for fifteen or nineteen years. The farm build- 
ings and enclosures are good, and much improved of late years. 
The principal improvement which the agriculture of this parish ad- 
mits of, is to complete the system of draining, which is already far 
advanced, and to cultivate those parts of the waste land which still 
admit of it. 

The freestone has been quarried occasionally in many places ; at 
present, only two quarries are regularly wrought, one at Niving- 
stone, the other at Bin or Benarty hill. In the year 1834, there were 
taken from the Nivingstone quarry 14000 feet of stone for hewing, 
the price of which at 3d. per foot is L. 175 : and 3300 cart loads 



CLRISn.

of ruble or ordinary building stone, costing at 4d. per cart L. 65. 
and weighing about 18 cwt. per cart. 

Jmjjrovements.—The greatest improvement that has been made m 
the agriculture of this parish is the main drain that has been carried 
alongnhe north side of ihe parish, dividing it from Kinross and Fos- 
saway. The channel of the water of Gairney forms the east part of 
it, that of the Pow of Aldie the west part. The valley, along the 
south side of which the parish of Cleish hes, extends from Loch- 
Leven on the east, to the Pow mill bridge on the west. Here two 
roads unite ; one from Kinross to Alloa by Blairngone ; the other 
from Dunfermline to Crieff by the Rumbling Bridge. The Pow 
here takes the name of Gairney, runs in a deep ravine, and falls 
into Devon below the Caldron Linn. The ground on the sides 
of the valley is good ; on the banks of the rivers it is also good, 
but was ofteninjured by the floods. The channels of the two streams 
had been formerly straightened and deepened to about three feet, 
but this was found insufficient to prevent the low ground from be- 
ing overflowed, or to render it capable of being drained. It was 
evident that a much deeper cut was necessary, and this has at 
length been accomplished. John Young, Esq. of Cleish has the 
merit of beginning this work, and of carrying it through, as far as 
his estate extends. Ip the year 181 1, he with other two smaller 
heritors on the Cleish side, and Lord Keith, acting for his daughter 
Miss Mercer of Aldie, on the Fossaway side, agreed to widen and 
deepen the Pow of Aldie. This part of the cut is 2875 yards 
in length, it was made 22 feet wide at top, 6 feet at bot- 
tom, and 6 feet deep, and cost 14s. per 6 yards. It has since 
been frequently cleared and considerably deepened, and now forms 
a complete main drain for the ground on both sides. The soil 
here consists partly of clay : a great part of it is moss, but of good 
quality, and has yielded well when cultivated. 

In 1820, Mr Young and Mr Colville of Maw deepened the 
water of Gairney which divides their estates. The soil here is very 
good, lying upon gravel, the upper part of which is brown and con- 
tains iron. At the depth of five feet, it is very clean and open ; when 
this was cut into, a great quantity of water came from it, the pools 
in the old links of the river, and the springs in the low ground 
dried up. Several of the wells in the neighbourhood also dried ; 
on digging deeper, plenty of water was got, but without the iron 
flavour. At one part of this cut, a vein of black gravel was found, 
the water from which produced inflammation, and swelling in the

KFNROSS-SHIRE. 



hands and feet of tlie labourers, so that some of them were obho-- 
ed to give up work for two or three days- The gravel was after- 
wards examined, and was found to contain iron, but nothing that 
could explain the eflfect which it produced upon the workmen. 
This part of the cut is 1841 yards in length, 18 feet broad at the 
top, 6 feet at the bottom, and 6 feet deep ; rt cost 12s. per 6 
yards. 

The ground between Gairney and the Pow of Aldie still remained 
to be drained. This tract is the highest part of the valley. The water 
here runs partly to the east and partly to the west. The ground was 
very wet, a ditch that was formerly the march between the estates 
of Cleish and Aldie having been allowed to grow up, though some 
parts of it still remained deep enough to drown several cattle. 
When the ground was enclosed, a new march was made, consist- 
ing of a stone dike, carried in a straight line without regard to the 
bend of the valley, so that the land upon the one side of the march 
could not be drained except through the land on the other side. 
Mr Young and Mr James Loch, who acted for Miss Mercer, now 
Lady Keith, agreed to make the drain in the old line of march, 
which was in the lowest part of the ground : and also to make a 
belt of planting, 21 yards in breadth, on each side of the cut. 
This, when the 'trees grow up, will make a great addition to the 
shelter and beauty of this part of the valley. The length of this part 
of the main drain is 1387 yards; the breadth at top, 18 feet; at 
bottom, 3 feet ; the depth, 6 feet ; the expense, 10s. per 6 yards. 
It was executed in 1821. The effect produced here was fully 
equal to what was expected; the ground, which was before very 
soft, being soon able to bear loaded carts. This completed the 
drain from the west end of Cleish parish as far castas the church. 

Soon after, the proprietors of the ground on the sides of the wa- 
ter -of Gairney to the east agreed to deepen that part of the river 
which had formerly been straightened and frequently cleaned ; but 
was not deep enough to lay the whole of the contiguous ground 
dry, although some of it had been cultivated. The length of this 
part of the drain is 4022 yards ; the breadth, 24 feet to the west 
of the Barns estate, 26 feet to the east ; and 6 feet deep. The 
east part is rather too narrow, as a good deal of water from the hills 
falls into Gairney here. 

That part of the Pow of Aldie which extends from the west 
end of the parish of Cleish to near the Powmill Bridge, about 
3157 yards in length, was straightened and deepened in 1829 and 



CLEISH. 



47 



1830, which completes this important drain. It is in length 7 
miles, 4 furlongs, 153 yards,' and has drained or rendered capable 
of being drained, in Cleish, 453 acres.; in Fossaway, 484 ; in 
Kinross, 122; in Dunfermline, 48; in Saline, 13; in all, 1120 
statute acres of excellent land, almost all of which has been already 
cultivated. Mr Robert Drysdale, land-surveyor in Dunfermline, 
who is well acquainted with the ground, considers the value of each 
acre drained to be L. 1, 10s. yearly more than before, which would 
add to the annual value of that part of Cleish L. 679. Some oats 
raised upon this ground have been sold before harvest at L. 14, 8s. 
and L. 15, Is. 9d. per statute acre, the buyers being at the ex- 
pense of cutting down and carrying off the crop. 

The evaporation along this valley must have been formerly very 
great, and as evaporation produces cold, the air and soil in the low 
ground must now be warmer, as well as drier than before. It is 
probably owing to the diminution of the evaporation that we have 
not for some time seen those frost mists, which during the night in 
harvest frequently covered the low grounds and injured the crops. 
Though all the land on the sides of this drain is good, some of it 
had rather an unpromising appearance ; in particular, the peat-bog 
on the south side of Aldie. The improvement of this bog, which was 
begun by Count Flahault, has now been completed, and the moss 
has yielded excellent crops of oats, potatoes, turnips, and grass. 
The valley of Gairney and the Pow is now completely changed, and, 
when viewed from the higher grounds, forms a beautiful prospect, 
especially to those who were acquainted with it in its former state, 
The east part of the water of Gairney, from the parish of Cleish to 
Lochleven, in length 1 mile 310 yards, has not yet been straight- 
ened ; but this will probably be done soon. There is now plenty 
of level, the surface of the loch having been lowered from four to 
five feet. The improvement of this valley has been carried through 
by the proprietors themselves, without any dispute, and with little 
difference of opinion. When any one of them obtained more ad- 
vantage than his neighbour on the opposite side of the river, he 
paid a greater proportion of the expense of the cost. This was 
settled privately by the parties themselves. 

The estate of Blair- Adam presents a most instructive exam- 
ple of what may be effected by skilful and judicious manage- 
ment, in at once improving the appearance of the country, and in- 
creasing the productiveness of the soil in high and exposed situations. 
It originally consisted of no more than 640 Scotch acres; but, in con- 



48 



IClNUOSS-SIllItK. 



sequence of successive purcliases, it now extends from east to west 
upwards of three miles, from north to south upwards of two miles 
and six furlongs, and contains 3110 Scotch, or 3922 statute acres- 
The improvements were commenced in the year 1733, by the 
great-grandfather of the present proprietor. At that time the 
estate was little better than a wild unsheltered moor, the bleakness 
of which was increased rather than relieved by one sohtary tree, 
which, to use the language of the celebrated Robert Hall, looked 
" like nature hanging out a signal of distress." This fact the spec- 
tator at the present day finds it almost impossible to realize. A 
greater change than that which has taken place can hardly be con- 
ceived. The whole property is now adorned with noble woods, 
which are tastefully disposed so as to crown the hills, shade the 
slopes, and hang over the natural ravines which vary the landscape, 
producing altogether a striking and beautiful effect. 

But appearances have not been the only object of the proprietors. 
Great pains have been tak6n to drain the soil, which, when relieved 
from water, is in its nature rather fertile. Hedge-rows have been 
planted, sunk fences constructed, and every means resorted to for 
bringing the improvements to the greatest possible perfection. 

" The small property of East Mill, of which Mr Hutcheson is 
the tenant, is in the eastern district of the parish of Cleish, ad_ 
joining the west march of Barns. By the judicious management 
of Mr Hutcheson, this property has been greatly improved with- 
in the last five or six years ; and he now raises good wheat, where 
no corn formerly grew. The estate of Fruix, bounded by Barns 
on the west, and the lands of Gairney on the east, is proceeding in 
improvement under the management of the proprietor, and is 
greatly benefited by the lowering of the Gairney. The lands of 
Gairney, bounded by Brackly in the parish of Portmoak on the 
east, by the water of Gairney on the north ; and by the lands of 
Blair- Adam on the south, has been possessed for several years by 
Mr W. Stedman under a lease from Mr Bogie, the proprietor, 
who has built for his tenant most excellent and extensive offices. 
Mr Stedman, the tenant, has cultivated the land in a most judi- 
cious manner, and has converted what was unproductive and sterile 
dry land, into productiveness. He has likewise taken in a great 
part of the red moss, and by his judicious management in draining 
and liming, has converted what was a peat-bog, where peats had 
been dug for ages, into a state of fertility, and this being the work 
of a tenant proves that the culture must have been beneficial. This

peat-moss, which had been for ages used for fuel, was a few years 
ago, brought into cuUure by the servitude of digging peats having 
been given up. The three proprietors, the Lord Chief Commis- 
sioner, Mr Bogie, and Mr Stedman of Fruix, all encouraged the 
culture of this moss, through M'hich the great north road passes. 
It was in extent between forty and fifty acres, of which there is 
now hardly any thing to be seen, being all either converted into 
corn land, or covered with trees, which are in a very promising state 
with respect to growth, 

" The last-mentioned properties, viz. East Mill, Fruix, and Gair- 
ney, may extend to between three and four hundred acres, and 
with the estates of Blair Adam and Barns, constitute what is con- 
sidered as the eastern district of the parish of Cleish. 

" The estate of Barns, which adjoins that of Blair Adam on the 
north, was the propeity of a respectable family of Kinross-shire. 
Mr Robert Burt, who succeeded to it in 1750, upon the death of 
his father, became factor on the estate of Blair Adam at that 
period, and continued to discharge that duty until 1768, when 
Mr Henry Burt, his eldest son, was appointed to the situation. 

" Mr John Adam, the father of the late Lord Chief Commis- 
sioner, carried on his improvements on a very extensive scale, 
while he and Mr Burt were factors on his estate, — and they had 
his leave and indeed his injunctions to take from his large nurseries 
whatever trees they wished to plant on the estate of Barns ; so that 
the last mentioned property was cultivated and planted with trees 
in a manner similar to that of Blair Adam, so much so, that they 
almost appear to be the work of the same persons." 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town, Sfc. — The nearest market-town is Kinross, about 
three miles north from the centre of the parish, A great part of 
the grain, butter, and cheese produced is sold at Dunfermline, 
which is eight or nine miles distant. The turnpike roads from 
Queensferry and from Dunfermline to Kinross cross the parish 
from south to north. The roads here are good and still improving : 
the bridges were built not many years ago, and are in good order. 
There is a post-office at Blair- Adam, in the east end of the parish : 
the principal office for the district is that of Kinross. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated about four miles 

 The above remarks arc from the pen of the late Lord Chief Commissioner of the 
Jury Court, whose warm interest alike in the comfort of his people and the improve- 
ment of his property, has caused his death to bs felt in this parish as an irreparablo 
loss.

from the west end of the parish, and three miles from the east 
end. Formerly the greatest part of the people lived in the west 
part of the parish': but as the most of the land there is in pas- 
ture, and many houses have been built on the great north road, 
the east quarter is now the most populous. The former church, 
which was built in 1775, was unfortunately burnt on 11th of March 
1832, owing to the pipe of the stove being too near the top of the 
wall, and setting fire to the wall-plates. It was rebuilt immediately, 
and is now one of the handsomest, though unfortunately not one 
of the most substantial, churches in the country. The expense 
was about L. 850. It can accommodate upwards of 400 persons. 
All of the seats are free. 

The manse was built in 1744, and thoroughly repaired, and 
the offices rebuilt in 1793.  The glebe consists of 5 acres of 
arable, and nearly 2 of foggage or pasture-ground. I'he latter 
was formed into a watered meadow, and yields 5 tons of hay 
annually. The foggage being under the legal quantity, 16s. 
8d, was added to the stipend to make up the deficiency. The 
value of the glebe is about L. 14 per annum. The stipend, 
including L. 4, 3s. 4d. for element-money, and 16s. 8d. for the 
above-mentioned deficiency of foggage, consists of L. 49, 8s. 
lOAd. in money ; 24 bolls of oatmeal, and 8 bolls of bear, amount- 
ing, at an average of seven years, to L. 32, 3s. lid.: the Go- 
vernment allowance being L. 82, 6s. lj§d. ; the glebe being va- 
lued at L. 14 ; and the manse before the additions mentioned in 
the foot-note were made at L. 8 : altogether L. 185, 18s. ll/d. 

The number of persons, with their families, who belong to the 
Established Church is about 620; of Seceders, 60. Divine ser- 
vice is generally well attended at the Established Church. The 
number of communicants is about 200. The patron of the parish 
is John Young, Esq. of Cleish. 

Education. — There are three schools in the parish : the paro- 
chial school, situated near the church; aprivateschoolat Maryburgh, 
in the most populous part of the parish ; and occasionally another 
private school at Gairney Bridge, which is convenient for the 
children in the neighbourhood, and also for some in the adjacent 
parishes. The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommoda- 
tion ; his salary is the maximum. The school fees, in 1834, 

• Since thh was written, a large and handsome addition has been made to the 
manse, and an entirely new set of oflBces, besides a garden wall, have been built. 
The whole cost nearly L. 1000.

amounted to L. 30. English reading and grammar, writing, arith- 
metic, Latin, Greek, French, mathematics, algebra, navigation, 
and geography are taught here. The school at Maryburgh is 
supported by Sir Charles Adam, who gives the teacher a house, 
school, and garden, and L. 1 5 a-year. Reading, writing, arith- 
metic, and book-keeping are taught here : the fees are the same 
as in the other school, and amounted in 1834 to L. 26. The 
schoolmaster's wife has hitherto received L. 5 from Miss Adam 
for, teaching sewing. She has at an average eight scholars, at 3s. 
per quarter. The school at Gairney Bridge depends entirely on 
the school fees. 

At the examination of these schools in April 1839, the number 
of scholars in the parish school was 65 ; in Maryburgh, 81 ; and 
in 1838, in Gairney Bridge, about 30. The people are very sen- 
sible of the advantage of education ; and no part of the parish is so 
distant from the schools as to prevent children from attending.  

There are no friendly societies here ; but some of the people 
join with those in the neighbouring parishes. Several of them 
also take advantage of the Savings Bank which has been recently 
established at Kinross. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons at present 
receiving parochial aid is 6, at Is. per week, one at 2s., and two or- 
phan children at Is. each per week. There is also a woman re- 
ceiving 2s. 6d. as a temporary assistance, in consequence of her 
not being able to prove the father of her illegitimate child. The 
funds for their support are, the church collections, L. 21, 6s. lOd. ; 
interest of L. 265, L. 10, 12s.; and mortcloth dues, which, since 
the parish procured a hearse by subscription, are merely nominal : 
these, at an average of seven years, amount to L. .31, 18s. lOd. 
Out of the fund are paid L. 2 to the session clerk, L. 3 to the pre- 
centor, L. 1 to the church-officer, 10s. to . the presbytery clerk, 
5s. to the synod clerk, and 2s. to the presbytery officer, in all, 
L. 6, 17s., reducing the above L. 31, 18s. lOd. to L. 25, Is. 
lOd. The average of disbursements for seven years is L. 43, Is. 
5d. Till the year 1812, our funds were sufficient for the support 
of the poor, and there was even a small surplus. Since that time 
the heritors of the parish have, in addition to the ordinary income, 
subscribed what was necessary, in proportion to their valued rents, 

 There are three Sahbath schools, besides a class of young men and another of 
young women, one at Cleish, anotlier at Maryburgh, and the third at Gairney 
Bridge, consisting in all of about 130 children. There is also a parish library.

thinking that method preferable to an assessment. There was 
one subscription of L. 10 in 1814, and seven since that time of 
L. 20 each, amounting to L. 150. The sum received was L. 153, 
15s. 8d. Another subscription of L. 20 was agreed to in January 
1834, but has not yet been required. In 1799 and 1800, when 
provisions were scarce and dear, the heritors -subscribed for the 
rehef of the poorest people : the sum collected was L. 31, 13s. 6d.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNFERMLINE, SYNOD OF FIFE. 

THE REV. JAMES WEMYSS, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — This parish was originally called Ur- 
well, and takes its appellation from a property of the same name on 
the banks of Loch Leven, and at the south-east extremity of the pa- 
rish. Whence the word itself is derived is not very apparent ; as, 
however, almost all the names of the farms in the parish are obvi- 
ously Gaelic, so it may not be too much to suppose that this also 
may be of similar origin. In this point of view we must have re- 
course to the Gaelic word tir, meaning new or green, and baile, a 
residence or retreat ; the whole probably designates a green or fer- 
tile retired situation, — an interpretation peculiarly applicable to the 
property of Orwell, and the old situation of the church, especially 
previous to the introduction of drainage, and a superior mode of 
farming, which of late years has converted many wild into fertile 
districts. 

The parish is of a narrow oblong figure, the greatest length be - 
ing from east to west. From the mouth of the Pow-burn to the 
summit of Coal-craigie, or from Burnside to Warroch, is about 7 
miles, while its greatest breadth, from north to south, does not ex- 
ceed 3; and its surface may be stated in round numbers at 21 
square miles. It is bounded on the north by the parishes of 
Arngask, Forteviot, Forgandenny, and Dunning ; by Fossaway on 
the west ; by Kinross parish and Loch Leven on the south ; and by 



ORWELL. 



53 



Portinoak and Strathmiglo on the east. A small part of the pa- 
rish is annexed quoad sacra to that of Arngask. 

The southern portion of the parish is generally level, diversified 
with gently sweUing heights. North of Milnathort, it rises gra- 
dually to the top of the high grounds called the Braes of Orwell, 
and thence more suddenly to different eminences on the Ochil 
hills. The highest of these hills, at nearly the north-western ex- 
tremity of the parish, scarcely exceeds 1000 or 1100 feet above the 
level of the sea ; and the lowest part of the parish on the margin of 
Lochleven is about 335 feet above the same level. The average 
height of the cultivated portion may be about 450 feet. 

Climate, 8fc. — The climate, on the whole, is healthy. Former- 
ly ague was very prevalent on some farms, but now, owing to drain- 
age, is scarcely known. The most fcommon diseases are fevers and 
consumptions. During the early part of winter and spring, the 
low Dfrounds suffer considerablv from hoar-frost. The height of 
the barometer is at the same station very variable, but may be 
stated on an average at 29.5. The thermometer has never been 
observed lower than 7°, and seldom attains 70° in the shade, — the 
mean temperature being about 46.6°. From the proximity of the 
Ochil Hills on the north, of the Lomond and Bishop Hills on 
the east, and Benarty on the south, the quantity of rain that falls 
in the parish, and throughout the county, is above the average 
for Scotland. Even when not actually raining, the atmosphere 
generally may be called moist, as Leslie's hygrometer rarely ex- 
ceeds 25° in the finest weather, and on an average is not more 
than 15°. These observations were made at an altitude of 400 
feet above the level of the sea, and only apply to it. 

Polar lights are frequent during the end of autumn and begin- 
ning of winter. The east wind prevails for three or four months 
during spring and beginning of summer ; and its influence is con- 
siderably felt, notwithstanding the high barrier interposed by the 
Lomond and Bishop hills. In the evenings the mist, or, as it is 
called in the district, the eastern haar, is observed slowly crown- 
ing their summits, or descending their sides in vast masses, and 
extending itself far to the west, beyond the boundaries of the 
county. But the prevailing wind is the south-west, which blows 
the greater part of the year with considerable violence. This cir- 
cumstance may be attributed to the funnel-shaped nature of the 
district ; the western portion of which being the low strath which 
stretches by Dollar to Alloa ; the eastern, that by Strathmiglo 
into Fife.

KINROSS-SIIIRr;. 



Hydrography, — The North Queich is the only stream of any 
size that flows through the parish. There are several others, 
which, however, are of a trifling nature, except during speats oc- 
casioned by heavy rains. Almost all of these streams terminate 
in Loch Leven. The Queich, from its source to its mouth, is from 
five to six miles long, and its greatest breadth about twenty feet. 
It forms no cascades of any consequence ; although, among the 
hills in the earlier part of its course, there are several very pretty 
waterfalls. 

The Queich is a clear stream, and only remarkable as being 
one of the principal sources from which Loch Leven is replenish- 
ed with trout, — this being the chief breeding stream, although 
much less so now than formerly, few trouts comparatively ascending 
from the lake as they did forty years ago. This may be accounted 
for, either from the straightening and sloping of the banks, which 
modern improvements have suggested, — thus destroying the shel- 
ter of the fish, and giving them a dislike to their former haunts, 
— or from the over-fishing of the lake, which lessens the number 
of emigrants ; moreover, poaching is still carried on during close- 
time ; and in a late examination into the cause of the deteriora- 
tion of the fishings, consequent upon the drainage of the lake, it 
appeared, from the evidence of some noted poachers, that, after 
a September or October flood, many hundreds were killed during 
the night by spearing parties. These parties consist of three or 
four individuals ; and their operations are carried on much in the 
same manner as those by salmon-poachers. One or two with 
spears take the middle of the stream ; one on the bank carries a 
dark lanthorn, and the third and fourth the fish : the light is thrown 
upon theorf or shalloiv, and the fish, being in the act of spawning, 
are easily killed. Many fish are also caught at the dam-dikes be- 
longing to the small mills high up the stream ; indeed, whole sacks- 
full are taken out at some of these places in a single night. 

There are abundance of springs in the parish, and water may 
be obtained by sinking wells at very small depths. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — This parish is situated on the south- 
ern side of the Ochil-hills, and near the middle of the chain. The 
stratified rock is the same as the old red sandstone on the north 
border of the Fife coal-field, having its general dip south-east 
upon Loch Leven ; though of course contorted in various places 
by the intrusion of igneous rocks, of which there is abundance. 
Near the lake, deposits of lacustrine silt are said to have been ob-

served, including the usual organic remains; and, in the lower 
grounds, beds of gravel may be seen in many places, all seeming 
to indicate that Loch Leven was once a much more extensive sheet 
of water than now. The central part of the parish contains two 
large masses of trap rock, one of greenstone on the east, varymg 
in its character, and becoming tufaceous on the higher grounds in 
some places; and on the west, a much larger one of claystone por- 
phyry, of a purple colour, extending for several miles, very hard 
and compact, where the country is level, but where it rises, becom- 
ing softer, amygdaloidal, and in some parts even tufaceous. Be- 
tween these large masses of trap, there occur, here and there, com- 
pact felspar, clinkstone, and such like modifications of it. There 
is no limestone, nor any rock of the coal formation towards the west 
of the parish ; but near the boundaries on the east, the limestone 
and grey sandstone are upraised on the western Lomond and Bi- 
shop-hill. No transition rocks appear towards the rise of the stra- 
tification on the north-west. Large veins of calc-spar and of sul- 
phate of baryta occur in the greenstone. Heulandite, in small 
nodules, is found in the porphyry, and pretty large specimens of 
mesotype," where it becomes amygdaloidal. Laumonite and anal- 
cine abound in the neighbourhood, and therefore probably exist 
in the parish, although hitherto not observed. Scales of fish have 
been detected in the red sandstone. Iserine is occasionally found 
along the margin of the lake. 

Soil. The soil in the southern or more level part of the parish 

is a sandy clay, occasionally mixed with till or gravel, and a few 
fields may be termed loamy or alluviaL Upon the more elevated 
grounds, called the Braes of Orwell, the soil generally consists of 
a sharp gravel of good quality, excellently adapted to the culture 
of potatoes and turnips. Of the former, from 100 to 120 Linlith- 
gow bolls have been raised upon a Scottish acre. Wheat, ex- 
cept upon a few fields of the first quality, has not generally been 
raised with success ; and the more intelligent farmers prefer a crop 
of oats or barley, as affording a safer, and, upon the whole, a more 
profitable return. The average produce of oats, per Scotch acre, 
may be stated at from 6 to 10 Linlithgow bolls, that of barley 
from 5 to 8; although at times much higher returns are made. 
The better varieties of oats are generally in use, and the average 
weight in ordinary years may be stated at from 13 to 14 stones 
per Linlithgow boll. The quality of the barley has of late years 
much improved. Formerly it succeeded the oat crop, but it now 



56 



KlNROSS-SI-llRE. 



generally succeeds potatoes or turnips, and the average weight 
may be about 18 stones per Linlithgow boll, although often above 
19 stones. In a competition in the year 1833, between a gentle- 
roan possessing extensive properties in the county of Clackmannan, 
and an heritor in this parish, as to which of the counties, Clack- 
mannan or Kinross, that year would produce the best barley, it being 
agreed that each should stand by the produce of his own farm, 
the bet was decided in favour of Kinross -shire, the weight being 
58 lbs. per imperial bushel. In the same year, some barley was 
raised in Portmoak, close to this parish, and when sold at Kirk- 
aldy market was found to weigh 60 lbs. But this last was ex- 
tremely well cleaned. 

There are five or six quarries of red sandstone, one of which 
only, close to Milnathort, is wrought for sale. There are also se- 
veral of green or whinstone : but these are principally used for 
furnishing stones for dikes, and metal for the roads. 

Zoology. — Game was at one time abundant, but is now almost 
extirpated, owing to the remissness of the tax-office in not prose- 
cuting and punishing the lower class of poachers. A few roe-deer 
are occasionally seen, but do not seem to breed in the parish. 
The other kinds of game are the grouse, blackcock, partridge, 
woodcock, snipe, wild-duck, hare, and rabbit. The only birds of 
considerable rarity which have been observed are the kingfisher 
{Alcedo Ispida and the cross-bill {Loxia curvirostra. 

The principal kinds of fish are the common burn trout, Loch 
Leven trout, a variety of the former, eels, pike, and perch. But 
almost all these belong more properly to Loch Leven, which falls 
to be noticed under the account of the parish of Kinross. 

Botany. — Orwell contains few or none of the truly rare plants. 
The following may be mentioned, either because they are rare in 
the district, or common in the parish, although not generally dif- 
fused throughout Scotland.

The ferns are very few, and, with the exception of Polypodium 
pkp.gopteris, are of the most common kind. Of the rarer mosses 
may be mentioned, Orthotrichum Lyellii and pulchellum ; Hypnum 
dendroides, as well as Bartramia recurvata, occasionally are found 
in fructification. " Jungermannia exsecta occurs abundantly in the 
neighbouring parish of Portmoak, a few yards from the boundary. 
There are no rare Algae or Lichens : Cetraria islandica is abun- 
dant in some moors, but never with apothecia. Of the larger 
fungi, Amanita musearia may be mentioned as abundant, while the 
common mushroom {Agaricus campestris is rare ; and of the smal- 
ler, Puccinia buxi has been detected in profusion, but only in one 
locality. 

To complete this account, it is necessary to indicate some of 
those genera common in many places, but not found in this parish : 
thus there are ho species of Erythrcea ; Hyoscyamus ; Solanum; Sa- 
molus; Jusione; Cuscuta ; Pyrola ; Saxifraga, {except S. gr arm-

except S.fusca, aurita, and aquatica ; Myrica, or Jtriplex, ex- 
cept A. patula : Chrysanthemum Leucanthemum, although now in 
the greatest profusion throughout the parish, was unknown in the 
district until it was introduced along with the seed-corn, from a 
distance, forty or fifty years ago.

exposure of the Ochils. These consist principally of larch, Scots 
fir, spruce, oak, and ash. 

II. — Civil History. 

The only account of the parish is that contained in Sir John 
Sinclair's Statistical Account. There is no map of the parish by 
itself, but there are two very excellent ones of the county. One 
of these is by John Bell, in 1796 ; the other, by Sharp, Green- 
wood, and Fowler, in 1828. The latter, in particular, is remark- 
able for its minute accuracy. 

Burleigh Castle has been the subject of several paintings, espe- 
cially by Mr Robert Stein. ' 

Eminent Characters. — Dr Coventry, the late Professor of Agri- 
culture in the University of Edinburgh, possessed the property of 
Shanwell in this parish ; and Dr Young of Rosetta, in whose arms 
Sir Ralph Abercromby breathed his last in Egypt, was a native 
of it. Balfour, Lord Burleigh, was also from this parish ; — see 
Douglas's Peerage. 

Land-owners. — There are about 27 heritors possessed of the 
valuation of L. 100 Scots or upwards, besides 35 others having a 
smaller valuation, — the smallest being L. 2, 1 Os. There are nine pro- 
prietors at present whose valued rent each is L. 200 or upwards, 
viz. Dr Walker Arnott of Arlary, L. 619 Scots; John Horn, Esq. 
of Thomanean, L. 552; Rev. G. Coventry of Shanwell, L. 403; 
Robert Neilson, Esq. of Hilton, L. 272 ; Misses Macturk of 
Craigow, L. 241 ; Heirs of the late Rev. Dr Belfrage of Colliston, 
L. 233 ; Rev. Mr Brown of Finderly, L. 233 ; Charles Stein, Esq. 
of Hattonburn, L. 212 ; and Mr Purves of Warroch, L. 200. The 
total valued rental is L. 6786, 16s. 8d. Scots. By far the greater 
proportion of the proprietors farm their own lands, at least in part. 

Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest entry in the pa- 
rish register is 30th September 1688. It is not voluminous, owing 
to a great disinclination on the part of the people to come forward 
and register either births or deaths. This, however, is a little 
more attended to now than formerly. 

Antiquities. — On the farm of Orwell there are two flat standing 
stones, firmly imbedded in the ground. They are situated east 
and west of each other, at fifteen yards distance ; the one is 6|, 
the other 8 feet high, and each 3 feet broad. Considerable 
mechanical jjower must have been required to bring them to their 
present position, no similar rock being nearer than the West Lo- 
mond, which is distant two miles, and the ground intervening is 

4

rugged and uneven. No tradition exists in the district regarding 
thefr origin, though various conjectures have been formed ;— some 
supposing that they indicate a Danish battle ; others, that they form 
the remains of a Druidical circle. It may, however, be observed, 
that, in the same field, stone coffins have been occasionally turned up 
by the plough ; and a few years ago, the ground was in many places 
dug up by a neighbouring proprietor, when quantities of bones, much 
decomposed and mixed with charcoal, were discovered. The bones 
were about fifteen inches below the surface of the soil, and gene- 
rally a layer of small stones above them. A request was once 
made to the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh to send a deputa- 
tion to examine the ground carefully ; but this was never accom- 
plished. 

The old church of Orwell, situated on the shore of Loch Leven, 
and near the south-east boundary of the parish, was only a chapel 
of ease in the reign of Robert 1. ; who, says Sibbald, in his History 
of Fife and Kinross, gave to the monastery of Dunfermline hi 
puram et perpetuam eleeniosynam, Ecdesiam de Kinross cum Ca' 
pella de UrivelL At what period it became the parish church is 
unknown. 

Burleigh Castle, situated about a quarter of a mile to the south- 
east of the village of Milnathort, seems to be of considerable an- 
tiquity. It was at one period a place of great strength, consistmg 
of a square, surrounded by a wall of ten feet in height, a deep 
ditch filled with water, and a redoubt. The castle itself is entirely 
in ruins, though part of the square still remains. About twenty 
years ago, two towers were standing; one was of considerable 
height, and must have been very capacious. The south or small 
tower appears to have been the most modern structure of the 
whole. The date, 1582, with arms and the initials I. B., and be- 
low these M. B., doubtless of some of the possessors, were on the 
north corner of the west gable. The great tower must have been 
built at a much more remote period ; but no date or trace can be 
discovered from which a conjecture as to the time of its erection 
can be formed. The buildings on the north were probably erect- 
ed about the same period as the southern tower. The plantations 
about Burleigh were at one time very extensive and regular ; but 
almost all the trees have either been cut down, overturned by the 
wind, or have died of old age. About thirty-five years ago, there 
was a considerable number quite hollowed out ; and one in par- 
ticular, an ash, was known to have been so for upwards of a cea-

tury. This tree was noted for sheltering the Master of Burleigh 
when concealing himself from justice. In 1707, Robert, only son 
of the fourth Lord Burleigh, learning that Mr Henry Stenhouse, 
the schoolmaster of Inverkeithing, had married a girl, for whom 
he, young Burleigh, had an attachment, and on account of which 
he had been sent abroad to travel, and taken her from her father's 
house in his absence, on his return, went directly to the school- 
master's house, and shot him through the left shoulder at his own 
door, in consequence of which Stenhouse died twelve days after. 
Mr Balfour was apprehended some time afterward, tried 4th Au- 
gust 1709, and sentenced 29th November to be beheaded. He, 
however, escaped from prison the 1st or 2d of January 1710, by 
exchanging clothes with his sister, and concealing himself suc- 
cessfully for some years. The hollow of the old ash was often 
the place of his retreat, and hence received the appellation of 
Burleiyli's Hole. He afterwards engaged in the Rebellion of 1715, 
and was attainted. This tree was dismantled of its top bv the 
high winds, during the winter 1808-9 ; and was completely blown 
down to within a few feet of the root on Old Handsel- Monday 1822. 
It stood about twenty feet distant from the west wall of the great 
tower. 

Upon the top of the branch of the Ochils which bounds the 
parish on the north, stands Cairn-a-vain, once an immense col- 
lection of stones, though now much reduced in size, — the pro- 
prietor, thirty years since, having carried away many hundred 
cart-loads for the purpose of building dikes. An old rhyme, still 
remembered, alluded to a treasure supposed to be contained in it, — 

In the Dryburn well, beneath a stane, 

You'll find the key oF C;tirn-a-vaiii, 

That will mak' a Scotland rich ane by ane. 

However, no treasure was found, although eagerly expected by 
the workmen. There was a rude stone coffin in the centre of the 
cairn, containing an urn full of bones and charcoal, and amongst 
these was found a small ornament of bone about four inches long, 
very much resembling the figure of a cricket-bat, and notched in 
the edges ; this was in much better preservation than the other 
bones. Clay urns full of burnt bones have also been found on 
the farm of Holeton, and in other places along the skirts of the 
Ochil hills. 

III. — Population. 
In 1755, the population amounted to 1891 persons; and in 

 Maclaurin's Criminal Trials; and Douglas' Peerage of Scotland.

1793, the numbers were, males, 811; females, 933; total, 1744. 

The population at each census was as follows : — 
In 1801, males, '920 females, 1116 total, 2036

1821, do. 1170 do. 1359 do. 2529 
1831, do. 1512 do. 1493 do. 3008 

The population returns, in 1831, included about 190 males, 
then employed in making a new line of road from Milnathort to 
Damhead, nearly all of whom did not previously reside in the pa- 
rish, and left it when the work was completed. The causes of 
increase otherwise are supposed to be the improved state of agri- 
culture giving more employment to labourers, and the greater salu- 
brity of the atmosphere consequent on draining, the introduction of 
vaccination, &amp;c.

registered elsewhere.

L. 50, and upwards. At last census 1831 there were 662 fami- 
lies. The number of each family is about 4. 

In 1831, there were 455 inhabited houses; since then, at least, 
15 or 20 additional ones have been built. In 1831, there were 
7 uninhabited or building. 

By the census of 1831, there were 207 males employed in agri- 
culture ; 357 males, retailers ; 27 wholesale merchants, &amp;c. ; 236 
labourers; 52 males not included in the above description; 91 
female-servants, but there were no house male-servants. 

There is 1 fatuous person, 1 deaf and dumb, and 1 blind. 

Character of the People, c. — The people, generally speaking, 
are intellectual, moral, and religious. Poaching has prevailed 
of late years to such an extent that scarcely any gentleman takes 
out a game certificate. Smuggling is now unknown in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

The number of imperial acres may, in round numbers, be stated 
at 13,500 ;  of these about 8000 are either cultivated or occa- 
sionally in tillage ; and from 600 to 700 in plantations, gardens, 
&amp;c. The remaining 500 acres are almost in a state of nature, 
and, from lying principally along the heights and declivities of the 
Ochils, cannot be cultivated, at least with profit. 

Larch, Scotch fir, spruce, ash, and oak, are the principal trees. 
Little attention is paid to the regular yearly thinning, felling, prun- 
ing, &amp;c. 

The arable land may average about L. 1, 10s. or L. 1, 12s. 
per imperial acre. The average rate of grazing is from L. 3, 10s. 
to L. 4 per annum for a cow, and L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 for an ox. 

Wages. — Farm-servants in bothy receive about L. 12 in money, 
6 bolls of oatmeal, and 6 firlots of potatoes per annum, with a 
pint of milk daily. The married servants generally have cows, but 
their wages are lessened in proportion. The rate of labour is very 
various ; in summer a stout and good workman will earn 2s. per day 
providing his own victuals ; or, during the hay harvest, 2s. 6d. 
In winter Is. 6d. is a common rate. Women obtain from 9d. 
to Is. 3d. 

Live-Stock. — The Fife breed of black cattle is generally pre- 
ferred, though in its pure state can hardly be obtained. 

• The number of Scots acres, as given by the writer of the former Statistical Ac- 
count, was incorrect; for, if we take his own statement as to the number of miles, 
viz. 5 or G long, and 5 broad, this would give at the utmost 30 square miles, or 
15,200 Scots acres. By careful measurement on a map, the number of imperial 
acres given above will be found tolerably accurate.

Leases. — The larger farms, especially those requiring improve- 
nf:ent, are let for fifteen or nineteen years : smaller farms for seven 
years. Occasionally, single fields are let for three years, and ac- 
cording to a specified rotation of cropping. The farm-steadings 
formerly were in very bad order, but of late years much improve- 
ment has been effected in this particular, and nearly all are now 
in excellent condition. Thrashing-mills driven by horses are ge- 
nerally used; two or three are driven by water, but none by steam. 
Most farms are now enclosed either by dry stone dikes, or beech 
or thorn hedges. 

The principal manufacture was formerly cotton goods by the 
handloom ; but, owing to the low prices got, a new manufacture, 
that of tartan shawls and plaiding, has been introduced within the 
last twelvemonths, which lias created a great stimulus. One or other 
of these gives employment to a great many of the inhabitants. As 
the new manufacture requires larger, looms, and the dwelling- 
houses being generally unfit for such, one or two individuals have, 
as a speculation, erected large airy buildings in the village of Milna- 
thort, in which any of the work people can have a stance. This 
is much more healthy than the old system. The hours for work 
depend on their own pleasure. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-town. — Milnathort is the only market-town, and indeed 
there is no other village but itself in the parish. There has been 
a weekly corn-market by sample held here for nearly half a cen- 
tury, to which distillers at considerable distances send agents to 
purchase grain. It is likewise the only one in the county. About 
ten or twelve years ago, there was an attempt made to have a but- 
ter, cheese, and poultry-market; but it did not succeed. Milna- 
thort has no regular system of police ; but within these two years, 
a small constabulary paid force has been appointed for the county, 
and one of the officers has his residence in Milnathort, and in the 
day time perambulates the district assigned to him. Owing to 
the inhabitants of the towns and villages in the county not having 
hitherto contributed one farthing towards this establishment, but 
leaving all to be paid by the land-owners, it is not expected to be 
kept up much longer, unless they come forward and pay a reason- 
able proportion. 

The mail-coaches pass through Milnathort twice a-day, but it 
is only a penny-post to Kinross. There are about fourteen miles 
of turnpike roads ; a similar number are kept up by statute labour 



C4 



KINROSS-SHIRE. 



They are all in excellent condition. The bridge over the Queich, 
at the south end of Milnathort, is old, ill constructed, and by no 
means in good repair. The great north road trustees have not 
displayed their usual zealous attention by endeavouring to obviate 
this deformity, while other improvements of minor importance on 
this line of road have been carried into execution. The fences in 
the parish are in pretty good order. 

The Aberdeen and Inverness mail-coaches, Saxe-Cobourg to 
Perth, and Defiance to Aberdeen, travel along the great north road 
from Edinburgh every day, but the Cobourg and Defiance do not 
run on Sundays. Occasionally, there are other stage-coaches on 
the road ; and some time ago, one passed through Milnathort from 
Cupar to Stirling, but for some years it has ceased to run. 

Ecclesiastical State — The church, which was built in 1729, is 
situated half a mile from the nearest, and five miles from the far- 
thest boundary of the parish ; yet, as considered with reference to 
the dwellings of the parishioners, the village of Milnathort con- 
taining half of the whole population, it could not be more conve- 
niently situated. There is a mortification by Captain Crawfurd of 
Pow-mylne for the benefit of the poor, which amounted, in 1722, 
to L. 100.  

The church affords convenient accommodation for only 646 per- 
sons, although there are about 1600 connected with it; of these 599 
are communicants. There are no seats unlet, and nearly the whole 
belong to the heritors, and are filled by themselves, their tenants, or 
servants. The Dissenting heritors let their seats, when not required 
by their tenants or servants, for 2s. or 2s. 6d. each. One gallery in 
the aisle belongs to the patron, who has permitted it to be let, and 

" The following extract is from the parish records: — " 1722. The said 3d of 
May the Session met again, and after prayer, Major Henry Balfour of Dunbog de- 
positate in the minister his hands, in name and behalf of Captain William Crawfurd 
of Pow-mylne, for the use of the poor in the parish of Orwell, born and living in the 
parish, virtuously and honestly, the sum of L. 100 Sterling money; the" which 
sum to be lent out upon good security, and the a.-rent to be bestowed as it 
cometh into the managers of the said mortification. The managers appointed by 
the said Captain Crawfurd, being Sir Thomas Bruce of Kinross and his heiis, the 
minister of the parish of Orwell and his successors, ministers, and Captain Cra\rfurd 
and his heirs, Robert Coventry, fewar in Arlary, Robert Balfour in Orwell, William 
Shaw, fewar in Seggie, and George Arnott of Holeton, and failing any of these 
four by death, the survivois to choose others in their room, a power being reserved 
by the Captain for himself, or his heirs and successors, to add to the number of ma- 
nagers, as he or they shall find meet. The managers being likewise convened, and 
considering this pious, generous, and honourable deed of Captain Crawfurd, recom- 
mended it to the minister to write a letter of thanks, in name of the managers, to the 
Captain for his singular liberality, and to assure him that all due care shall be taken 
that the samen be managed and disposed so as it may annwer his good and laudable 
design."

tlie proceeds given to the poor. It contains about 90 sittings ; 
the front seats are let at Ss., the others at 6d. each. The poor 
have seats in this loft gratis. The church is by far too small for 
the contyreaation, and the demand for more accommodation is ra- 
pidly encreasing : 150 additional sittings at least are required, and 
nearly all of these for the working classes. The want of accom- 
modation in the parish church deprives many of the parishioners 
of the means of public worship, or compels them to attend Dis- 
senting churches. The attendance at church is nearly the same 
throughout the year; none of the parishioners belonging to the 
Establishment attend worship out of the parish. 

The manse was built in 1788, and, though repaired in 1825, is 
still very incommodious. The sum of L. 200, judiciously laid out, 
would render it very comfortable. The amount of stipend is L. 68, 
7s. lOj'gd. in money; 69 bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, 2§ lippies meal; 
46 bolls, 2 firlots, 3 pecks, and 2fo lippes barley; and 7 bolls, 2 
firlots oats. There is also a glebe worth about L. 30 per annum. 

There are two Dissenting places of worship ; the one belong- 
ing to the Original Burgher Associate Synod : the other to the 
United Associate Synod. Both these places of worship are in 
the village of Milnathort ; and the number of individuals attend- 
ing them, as given up to the Church Commission in December 
1837, was as follows, viz. — at the former, average attendance, 
300; persons in the habit of attending, 450; communicants, little 
more than 300 : the average attendance at the United Secession 
was about 400; those in the habit of attending, 580; communi- 
cants, 485. The actual numbers belonging to these establish- 
ments are supposed to be, to the one, 472 ; to the other, 714 ; 
but some of these may reside in other parishes. 

Education. — There are 6 schools in the parish, 1 parochial or 
endowed school, and 5 not endowed. Of these two are female 
schools : some of them are at the western extremity of the parish ; 
and, vvithin a few yards of the eastern boundary, there is one si- 
tuated in the parish of Strathmiglo, so that there are ample means 
of education. 

The parochial school is in Milnathort, and the branches here 

• " The primary cause of there being Seceders in this parish, was a Mr Mair, a mi- 
nister of the Establishment, who, changing his opinions, preached up the erroneous 
doctrine of universal redemption, and was, in consequence of this, dismissed from his 
charge ; notwithstanding of this, he still continued in the village, preaching this doc- 
trine till the day of his death, to his adherents, who were very numerous, and who 
built that large cliapel presently occupied by the Burghers." — Sir John Sinclair's 
Statistical Account, Vol. xx. p. 134.

generally taught are, English, writing, arithmetic, practical ma- 
thematics, geography and Latin, and sometimes Greek and French. 
In the unendowed schools attention is chiefly paid to the four first 
branches. The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 34, 4s. 
4d., and the school fees average about L. 50. « The lowest rate 
is, for English, 2s. 6d. per quarter ; writing and English, 3s. 6d. ; 
arithmetic with the two former, 4s. 6d. ; Latin with any of the 
preceding, 6s. ; mathematics, book-keeping, with the addition of 
any or all of those enumerated, 7s. 6d. The schoolmaster's house 
was built within the last thirty years. It consists of two stories, 
and is sufficient to enable him to keep boarders. He has besides 
all the legal accommodations. 

Thepeople ingeneral arealive to thebenefits of education. There 
are almost none between six and fifteen years of age who cannot 
read or write ; and none above fifteen in that situation, so far as is 
known. There is no part of the parish so distant as to prevent 
the children attending either the parish school or one of the un- 
endowed seminaries. 

The morals of the lowest classes have not improved of late years, 
but this is not to be attributed to the greater facilities for educa- 
tion. In consequence of the low price of spirits within these last 
six or eight years, there have been more petty crime and drunken- 
ness than WAS formerly known. 

There is a library in the village, instituted in 1797, called the 
Milnathort Library. This belongs at present to about forty diffe- 
rent individuals, in, or connected with the parish, who contribute 
6s. 6d. annually towards it. Any one, however, may read the 
books by paying Is. a-month, or 8s. a-year. The annual funds 
for the purchase of books, after defraying the ordinary expenses, 
amount, for the average of the last ten years, to L. 13. It is 
managed by a small committee of seven persons appointed annual- 
ly, and at present consists of 1270 volumes. Being the oldest li- 
brary in the county, it received, about four years ago, a donation 
from the Record Commission Court of London, of all the pub- 
lished acts, retours, and other records of England and Scotland, 
composing 52 folio volumes. Besides this, there is also a session 
library, instituted 1st January 1832, attached to the Established 
Church, and consisting of between 300 and 500 volumes. It is 
kept up by a collection at the church door on the first Sabbath of 
each year; and every individual belonging to the congregation is 
allowed to make use of it, on contributing Is. annually. The 



ORWELL. 6T 

books are given out to be read every Sabbath, before pubUc wor- 
ship, by one of the elders ; and the poor are allowed to read the 
books free of expense. It is not confined to religious works, but 
comprehends others of general information, such as narratives of 
voyages, travels, &amp;c. There are also two other libraries ; the one 
a subscription library, belonging to the United Secession, instituted 
in 1S38, to which each family using it contributes 2s. annually ; 
the other, conducted on similar principles, is a congregational li- 
brary, belonging to the Original Burghers. 

There are no institutions or societies in the parish ; but one gen • 
tleman, it may be observed, has an extensive private collection of 
dried plants, containing upwards of 20,000 species. 

Saving Bank.—Theve was formerly a Saving Bank in the coun- 
ty, but, owing to the stopping of the Stirling Bank, in which much 
of the money was deposited, the institution was broken up. Dur- 
ing last year, another, nearly on the Government plan, was set 
agoing. The head office is in Kinross, and there are also branches 
in Milnathort and Cleish. As, however, it has been a few months 
only in existence, nothing can be stated as to its prospects of suc- 
cess. 

Poor. — In the former Statistical Account it is said, " There 
are few poor on the roll, as the other three places of worship sup- 
port their own poor,"— a statement totally inapplicable to the pre- 
sent day. Formerly, the poor had a feeling of independence, de- 
clining all assistance so long as they could earn a pittance by their 
own exertions, and their relatives were desirous of aiding them ra- 
ther than see their names on the poor's roll. Not so now. The 
applications for assistance every year are becoming more and more 
numerous, and nothing is heard but grumbling that they are not 
getting so much as some of their acquaintances on the roll. In- 
deed, very near relatives, who, by law, might perhaps be compel- 
led to assist, contribute nothing. Formerly, the money collected 
at the church-door was sufficient not only to support all the poor, 
but, by good management, a sum was amassed, which, about forty 
years ago, was laid out in purchasing a piece of land. Now, ow- 
ing to the poor belonging to the Secession churches coming to the 
Orwell kirk-session for relief, from the collections at the church- 
door not proportionally increasing, many passing by without be- 
stowing one farthing, alleging that the heritors, and not they, ought 
to give, and others contributing far below their means, there is 
not a sufficiency of funds to support the poor, even with the rent 



68 



KINROSS-SHIHE. 



derived from the purchased land, which at present amounts to 
L. 56 Sterh'ng. As it is doubtful whether a legal assessment can 
be laid on, so long as there is property belonging to the poor, an 
attempt was made about a year ago to lay on a voluntary assess- 
ment, in the expectation that those heritors who- were either non- 
resident or did not attend the parish church, and who had hitherto 
contributed Httle or nothing, would come forward in a handsome 
manner. This measure failed ; few of those individuals havino- 
given more than what by law they could have been compelled to pay, 
and others gave nothing whatever. A similar attempt is not there- 
fore likely again to be made, and ere long the property must be 
sold ; and when this happens, the few hundred pounds obtained 
will speedily vanish, demands to be put on the poor's roll will ra- 
pidly increase, and a legal assessment be the result. 

The average number of paupers on the permanent roll, exclusive 
of lunatics in confinement, and of persons receiving occasional relief, 
were in 1835, 23 who received L. 78, 9s. 9d. ; in 1836, 19 who re- 
ceived L.83, Is. Id.; in 1837, 26 who received L.81,8s.6d. Those 
who received occasional relief in 1835 were 27, who got L. 9, 3s. 
5d.; in 1836, 32 received L. 10, 13s. 6d. ; in 1837, 40 received 
L. 20, 16s. 8d. In 1837, there was one lunatic in confinement, 
the cost of which was L. 25, 18s. 2d. 

The annual amount of collections at the church-door were as 
follows :— 1835, L. 29, 6s. 8d. ; 1836, L. 29, 9s. 9d. ; 1837, L. 29, 
19s. 3d. During these years, there were also voluntary contribu- 
.lions to the amount of— 1835, L. 3, 5s. Id. ; 1836, L. 3, 8s. 8id. ; 
and 1837, L. 54, 7s. 5d. The mortcloth and other sessional dues 
and rent of poor's land amounted, in 1835, to L. 62, 15s.; 1836, 
to L.62, 6s. 6d.; and in 1837, to L. 63, 14s. 6d. The collec- 
tions are applied to the relief of the poor of all denominations in 
the parish ; under deduction of a salary of L. 3, 3s. to the session- 
clerk ; L. 3 to the precentor; and to the beadle L. 1, Is. The 
books, containing a statement of these funds, are inspected twice 
a year by a joint committee of the kirk-session and heritors. 

The parish is much annoyed by vagrants, such as shipwrecked 
sailors, and persons disbanded from manufacturing establishments, 
&amp;c. solicitinof relief. 

Fairs. — There are six markets or fairs held during the jear 
in the village of Milnathort. Two of these, one on the Thursday 
before Christmas, the other on the second Thursday of February, 
are held for the sale of fat cattle only. The other four are gene- 

;3 



ORWELL. 



69 



ral markets for cuttle, sheep, and horses, and take place in the be- 
ginning of May, July, and November, and end of August. 

Inns and Alehouses.- — There are no less than 14 spirit licenses 
granted for this parish. Of these, 5 are issued to inns or public- 
houses in the village of Milnathort ; seven grocers in the village also 
allow spirits to be consumed on their premises ; and. there are two 
public-houses in the landward part of the parish. This facility of 
obtaining spirituous liquors, not to mention the cheapness of the 
article, while it has given an effectual check to smuggling, has in- 
creased their consumption, and greatly deteriorated the morals of 
the lower orders ; and instances of late have occurred of some 
abandoned wretches stealing and selling mere trifles to obtain the 
few pence requisite to purchase a dram. 

Fuel. — Almost the onlv kind of fuel now used is coal, which is 
obtained in several places in the county of Fife, at no great distance 
from the borders of Kinross-shire. The distance of the pits from 
Milnathort is from seven to nine miles. The price is variable, but 
at present the cost may be stated at 7s. or 7s. 6d. per ton at the 
pit mouth. A cart load weighs 84 stone Dutch, or 13 cwt. and 
14 lbs. ; and when contracted for on behalf of the poor, it varies 
from 7s. to 8s. 6d., including carriage and tolls. ' 

There is no distillery now in the parish. The one belonging to 
Mr Stein of Hattonburn, noticed in the former Statistical Account, 
having been converted into a potato-flour or farina manufactory. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the former Statistical Account was written, and, indeed, 
within the last thirty years, great alterations have taken place ow- 
ing to an extensive system of draining, and a more skilful method of 
husbandry. Many fields, which at that period were totally useless, 
may now be seen to produce excellent crops. The greater part of 
the parish is dry ; yet, from the close-bottomed nature of many 
fields, improvement still may be expected from wedge-draining, as 
yet partially introduced ; and it is probable that this will be more 
attended to, as the returns to those farmers who have thoroughly 
practised it have been satisfactory. The roads are all in excellent 
order, and lime is to be had at a convenient distance, and at no 
great expense. Taking these circumstances into view, together 
with the moderate rate of wages, the agriculturist has every facility 
to carry on his improvements.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q784746">KINROSS</name>.</head>
<p>

Sir Robert Sibbald, in his History of Fife and Kinross, tells 
us, that, in the ancient language of the Picts, the county of Fife 
was called Ross, " which signifieth a peninsula," and adds, " that 
the upper part of this territory, formed by the Friths of Forth and 
Tay, got the name of Kenn-Hoss, which means the head of the 
peninsula." He does not, however, adduce a shadow of evidence 
to satisfy us that the county of Fife was at any period called Ross; 
and we are rather inclined to suppose, that the origin of the word 
Kinross arose entirely from some local circumstance. 

This county lies between 3° 14' and 3° 35' west longitude, and 
between 56° 9' and 50° 18' north latitude. From the eastmost 
point at Auchmoor Bridge over the River Leven to the westmost 
part, where it is bounded by the Devon, it does not exceed twelve 
miles in extent ; and from Kelty- Bridge, on the south to Damhead 
on the north, is scarcely ten. The area of the whole county 
does not exceed seventy square miles, or 44,800 imperial acres ; 
and thus it is one of the smallest shires in Scotland. It is bound- 
ed on the north, by the Ochil-hills, which separate the district 
from Strathearn ; on the east, by the Lomond-hills ; and the south- 
east and south-west boundaries run partly along the summit of Be- 
narty, and partly along the flat ground to a point on Kelty-burn, 
w hence the Cleish-hills, extending to the west, divide it from Fife. 
Thus, though the boundaries are generally hilly, there is a level 
opening at Blair- Adam, between Benarty and the Cleish-hills, 
through which the great north road passes ; there is another open- 
ing to the north-east, between the Ochil and Lomond-hills, lead- 
ing towards Cupar- Fife ; and a third level, more extensive than 
any of the former, opens to the west towards Stirling, at the Crook 
of Devon. In addition to these, there is a narrow pass through 
which the River Leven flows from the loch. 

Previous to the year 1426, the greater ]art of this county was

incorporated with Fifeshire, and at the period when the disjunc- 
tion took place, it comprised only the parishes of Kinross, Orwell, 
and Portmoak; but in the year 1685, the King and estates in 
Parliament, in consideration of the smallness of the county, added 
Cleish, TuUiebole, and some lands lying in Perthshire. These 
constituted the county or sheriffdom of Kinross. But although 
separated from Fife, the same Sheriff-depute was placed over both, 
in the same way as one was placed over Stirling and Clackman- 
nan. This state of matters continued till the year 1807, when the 
counties of Clackmannan and Kinross were united into one She- 
riffdom. — Kinross-shire at present comprehends only four entire 
parishes, with portions of three others, which will be noticed un- 
der the county of Perth, to which they chiefly belong. 

The greater part of this small territory is dry, resting on a sharp 
gravel, intermingled with small portions of clayey loam, and a good 
deal of it is of a moorish quality. The climate, though cold and wet, 
owing to the general elevation of the district, has been much improv- 
ed by an extensive system of drainage, and is upon the whole consi- 
dered healthy, — the people being vigorous and subject to few ma- 
ladies. Indeed, the whole county till a very recent period was 
wild and barren, which circumstance has been attributed to the 
local peculiarity of the district being divided into small farms — al- 
most every single farm being a separate property, and generally 
possessed by its owner. Thus the number of small proprietors are 
greater here in proportion to the size of the district than elsewhere. 
These farms were feued out . chiefly about the end of the seven- 
teenth or beginning of the last century for a feu-duty. " The 
marches of the various farms," it is stated in Chambers' Gazetteer, 
" not having been well defined, and being distracted by the practice 
of run-rig, it was long before the county manifested very active 
signs of improvement. Within the recollection of persons of mid- 
dle life, few districts were worse cultivated or less profitable than 
Kinross-shire ; but various circumstances, among which is includ- 
ed the good example shown by neighbours, ultimately induced a 
spirited change, and now, from less to more, the agriculture, the 
mode of draining, enclosing, and planting can vie with those of 
Fife, or most other places." The whole productive land is about 
four-fifths of the whole county, and when let is on leases generally 
from fourteen to twenty-one years, the rent for the most part being 
a fixed annual sum. The size of the farms vary from 50 to 300 
acres — the corn crops being oats and barley, though occasionally

GENERAL OllSEUVATlONS ON THE 



on the better soils wheat is cultivated. Potatoes, turnips, clovers, 
and rye-grass are raised all over the county. A fair proportion of 
these farms is in grass, for which the soil and clinnate are both 
favourable. The pastures of the cultivated land are occupied by 
cattle, but sheep are kept in numbers only on the Cleish and 
Ochil- hills. It is supposed that about 3000 acres are under wood, 
the most extensive plantations being on Blair- Adam. These were 
begun in 1733, and at the present time cover about 1300 acres, 
consisting of oak, ash, larch, elm, beech, spruce, silver and Scotch 
fir ; the last, however, it is understood, does not grow well in ex- 
posed situations. The mineralogy of the shire is of little import- 
ance. Coal has been found on the south, where the county joins 
Fifeshire, but is not wrought in this county. Freestone quarries of 
excellent quality are likewise wrought in the parish of Cleish, and 
whinstone is almost every where to be met with. To the north of 
Kinross, red freestone is the geological formation of the district, 
and limestone, in great profusion, is obtained from the Lomond- 
hills. The roads throughout the county are all good, and none in 
Scotland can surpass in excellence the great north road, which runs 
through Kinross, the county town. This town is the only one in 
the shire, but there is a large and populous village, about a mile to 
the north, called Milnathort. At both these places, several an- 
nual fairs are held, and at the latter a weekly corn-market for the 
sale of grain. The manufacture of cutlery was formerly carried 
on in Kinross, but has for a long period been entirely abandoned. 
A great many people are employed in weaving cotton, chiefly by 
the manufacturers of Glasgow ; and within the last twelve months, 
two or three companies belonging to Kinross and Milnathort, have 
set agoing the manufacture of tartan shawls and plaids, which 
hitherto appears to have met with success. 

The annual value of real property in 1815, was L. 25,805, and 
now it cannot be estimated at less than L. 35,000 or L. 40,000. 

Legal assessments for the poor are seldom resorted to, the 
heritors preferring to contribute according to their rentals what 
sums may be necessary. 

Li this county there are a few small rivulets, which, with the ex- 
ception of the Leven, act as feeders to the loch. This sheet of 
water lies in the south-east part of the county, at an elevation of 
about 360 feet above the level of the sea, and is emptied by 
the stream just alluded to, which flows in an easterly direction 
through Fifeshire, till it disembogues itself into Largo Bay. Loch 



COUNTY OF KINROSS. 



Leven is from eiglit to nine miles in circumference, and covers 
about 4000 acres ; though inferior in magnitude and picturesque 
beauty to some of the Highland lochs, it is still a noble expanse of 
water. Trout, pike, perch, and eel, are found here in abundance. It 
is of an irregular oval figure, possessing several islets, of which only 
two are worth noticing, — the one, extending to about five acres, is 
situated within a short distance of the shore at Kinross, and here 
are the remains of the castle, once the prison of the unfortunate 
Mary Queen of Scots ; the other, called St Serf's Isle, having a 
flat, bare appearance, is neaf the south-east extremity of the loch. 
On the latter island there was a priory dedicated to St Serf or Ser- 
vanus, which must have been placed here upwards of 1000 years 
ago, but no vestige of it is now to be seen. A considerable 
number of cattle and sheep are pastured upon this island, which, 
since the draining of the loch, immediately about to be noticed, ex- 
tends to upwards of 100 acres. On the other island, containing 
the castle, the main tower of which, it may be observed, appears 
to be about the same size as the border towers, a fortlet was first 
built by Congal, a valiant Pictish King, who reigned towards the 
end of the fifth century. At what period the castle itself was erect- 
ed We are not informed, but it makes an early appearance in our 
history. In the year 1335 it was defended by Alan de Vipont, a 
Scottish royalist, against a John de Strivilin, apparently a Scottish- 
man, but who acted in behalf of Baliol. A fort was erected in the 
churchyard of Kinross, on a neighbouring promontory, and at the 
lower end of the lake, where the water issues from it, an embankment 
was thrown across with the view of laying the island and castle under 
water, and thereby compelling the besieged to surrender. Vipont 
took the opportunity of the English General being absent on some 
pious duty at Dunfermline, and broke through this barrier to the 
utter confusion and discomfiture of the English. Such is the story 
told by Buchanan, but it does not appear probable ; for an embank- 
ment such as would inconvenience the besieged, must, from the 
nature of the ground, have also annoyed the blockading party on the 
shore at Kinross. And when we consider the magnitude of the 
operations required — the strength of the works necessary — and the 
time requisite for accumulating the water, we are inclined to 
place little reliance in the tale, considering that it happened in the 
time of war and slender resources. It appears to us, however, that 
the termination of the lake formerly must have been at the east end 
of the level carse through which the stream of the Leven flows. 

KINROSS. 



74 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 

Here even now the rising grounds on each side almost meet to- 
gether, and in all likelihood the natural barrier having, from some 
cause or other, given way, the waters of the loch receded to their 
lowest level, and thus the carse was formed. 

The drainage of the loch, which has lately been effected, had 
engaged the attention of many of the proprietors in the neigh- 
bourhood for half a century ; but it was only within the last twelve 
years that any attempt was seriously made to get this object ac- 
complished. An act of Parliament was at length obtained ; and 
though the operations have now been completed at an expense of 
some L. 40,000, it is very questionable whether the advantages, 
supposed to arise from the measure, have not been greatly exag- 
gerated. A few proprietors may probably feel its good effects ; 
but, in general, the ground recovered, which may be about 1000 
acres in all, is poor.— that on the eastern side, which comprises 
the greater proportion, being composed of a covering of whitish 
sand, having generally a subsoil of bluish tilly sand, of a most 
unproductive quality. ' If any material advantage arise from the 
operations, it must be to the land-owners along the river, who 
have obtained a greater facility for draining ; or to the mill-pro- 
prietors, who, indeed, will chiefly reap the advantage ; and appa- 
rently endless disputes have already arisen as to the proportions of 
the expense which each party interested has to pay. 

The features of the county, in general, are not very imposing, 
yet still they have a few charms ; nor do we know any thing more 
beautiful than the view to be obtained from the rising ground on 
the eastern side of Loch Leven in an autumnal morning, when the 
mist which has enveloped the whole county may be seen gradually 
ascending from the lake, under the influence of the rising sun, and 
unfolding to the eye of the traveller, the calm unruffled surface of 
the waters, with the'gray and lonely castle— connected with many 
a strange tale in our history— reposing in its bosom ; as the mist 
clears away, the hills are seen girding on the whole, which pre- 
sents at such a moment a picture highly interesting and sublime.

Until the passing of the Reform Act in 1832, Kinross-shire 
retnrned a member to serve in Parliament only alternately with 
Clackmannan, and the number of freeholders then on the roll was 
21. The constituency at present is 498, and that of Clackman- 
nan 797 ; both counties uniting in sending a representative to Par- 
liament.
